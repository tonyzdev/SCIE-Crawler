    "abstract": "During the extended clinically latent period associated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection the virus itself is far from latent. This phase of infection generally comes to an end with the development of symptomatic illness. Understanding the factors affecting disease progression can aid treatment commencement and therapeutic monitoring decisions. An example of this is the clear utility of CD4+ T-cell count and HIV-RNA for disease stage and progression assessment. Elements of the immune response such as the diversity of HIV-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte responses and cell-surface CD38 expression correlate significantly with the control of viral replication. However, the relationship between soluble markers of immune activation and disease progression remains inconclusive. In patients on treatment, sustained virological rebound to >10 000 copies/mL is associated with poor clinical outcome. However, the same is not true of transient elevations of HIV RNA (blips). Another virological factor, drug resistance, is becoming a growing problem around the globe and monitoring must play a part in the surveillance and control of the epidemic worldwide. The links between chemokine receptor tropism and rate of disease progression remain uncertain and the clinical utility of monitoring viral strain is yet to be determined. The large number of confounding factors has made investigation of the roles of race and viral subtype difficult, and further research is needed to elucidate their significance. Host factors such as age, HLA and CYP polymorphisms and psychosocial factors remain important, though often unalterable, predictors of disease progression. Although gender and mode of transmission have a lesser role in disease progression, they may impact other markers such as viral load. Finally, readily measurable markers of disease such as total lymphocyte count, haemoglobin, body mass index and delayed type hypersensitivity may come into favour as ART becomes increasingly available in resource-limited parts of the world. The influence of these, and other factors, on the clinical progression of HIV infection are reviewed in detail, both preceding and following treatment initiation.",

Southern Africa remains the region most severely affected by the epidemic. Women continue to bear the brunt of the epidemic with young women infected almost ten years earlier compared to their male counterparts. Epidemiological evidence suggests unacceptably high HIV prevalence and incidence rates among women. A multitude of factors increase women's vulnerability to HIV acquisition, including, biological, behavioral, socioeconomic, cultural and structural risks. There is no magic bullet and behavior alone is unlikely to change the course of the epidemic. Considerable progress has been made in biomedical, behavioral and structural strategies for HIV prevention with attendant challenges of developing appropriate HIV prevention packages which take into consideration the socioeconomic and cultural context of women in society at large.",

    "abstract": "The HIV care continuum is a framework that models the dynamic stages of HIV care. The continuum consists of five main steps, which, at the population level, are depicted cross-sectionally as the HIV treatment cascade. These steps include diagnosis, linkage to care (LTC), retention in care (RiC), adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral suppression. Although the HIV treatment cascade is represented as a linear, unidirectional framework, persons living with HIV (PLWH) often experience the care continuum in a less streamlined fashion, skip steps altogether, or even exit the continuum for a period of time and regress to an earlier stage. The proportion of PLWH decreases at each successive step of the cascade, beginning with an estimated 86% who are diagnosed and dropping dramatically to approximately 30% of PLWH who are virally suppressed in the United States (US). In this current issues review, we describe each step in the cascade, discuss targeted interventions that address weak points in the continuum, review domestic and international policies that help shape and direct HIV care strategies, and conclude with recommendations and future directions for HIV providers and policymakers. While we primarily examine issues related to domestic HIV care in the US, we also discuss international applications of the continuum in order to provide broader context.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the available information on the risk of hospitalization, severe disease, and death attributable to HIV in patients with COVID-19. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and SCOPUS were searched through October 25, 2021, to identify relevant studies, without language restriction. A random-effects model was used to pool estimates. Results We included 44 studies reporting information from 38,971,065 patients with COVID-19. The pooled prevalence of HIV among COVID-19 patients was 26.9 ‰ (95% CI 22.7–31.3) and was significantly higher in studies conducted in Africa compared to those conducted elsewhere (118.5‰ [95% CI 84.8–156.9, 11 studies] vs 10.9‰ [95% CI 8.8–13.2, 27 studies]). In pooled analyses of unadjusted odds ratio, HIV-positive individuals were more likely to be admitted to hospital (OR: 1.49; 95% CI 1.01–2.21, 6 studies) compared to HIV-negative individuals. In the adjusted (for age and sex) analyses, HIV was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio: 1.76, 95% CI 1.31–2.35, 2 studies). However, HIV was not associated with the severity of the disease (OR: 1.28; 95% CI 0.77–2.13, 13 studies), or death (OR: 0.81; 95% CI 0.47; 1.41, 23 studies) in patients with COVID-19 in the meta-analysis of unadjusted odds ratio. Conclusion Our findings suggest that patients with HIV have an increased risk of hospital admission for COVID-19. HIV seems to be independently associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patient in adjusted analysis. However, this evidence was derived from only two studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 epidemic and various control and mitigation measures to combat the widespread outbreak of the disease may affect other parts of health care systems. There is a concern that the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt HIV services. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on service delivery and treatment outcomes in people with HIV. Methods In this study, a systematic search was conducted using the keywords in the online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. The retrieved articles underwent a two-step title/abstract and full-text review process, and the eligible papers were selected and included in the qualitative synthesis. Result We selected 16 studies out of 529 retrieved records that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Study populations of the selected studies were either HIV-positive patients or HIV clinics and healthcare providers. Most studies were focused on adhering to and obtaining medication and attending clinical appointments and their decrement during the pandemic. Other aspects of HIV care (alternative healthcare settings, viral suppression, psychological care, etc.) were discussed to a lesser extent by the included studies. Conclusion Interruption in in-person visits and medical follow-up services, loss of adherence to treatment, and subsequent increase in mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic complications in PLHIV have led to growing concerns. Other challenges were psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression, an increase in substance abuse, and a rise in experienced stigma and discrimination. However, the use of telemedicine in some countries helps to alleviate the situation to some extent and is recommended in similar settings in the future.",

A paradoxical clinical worsening of a known condition or the appearance of a new condition after initiating therapy characterizes the syndrome. Potential mechanisms for the syndrome include a partial recovery of the immune system or exuberant host immunological responses to antigenic stimuli. The overall incidence of IRIS is unknown, but is dependent on the population studied and its underlying opportunistic infectious burden. The infectious pathogens most frequently implicated in the syndrome are mycobacteria, varicella zoster, herpesviruses, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). No single treatment option exists and depends on the underlying infectious agent and its clinical presentation. Prospective cohort studies addressing the optimal screening and treatment of opportunistic infections in patients eligible for ART are currently being conducted. These studies will provide evidence for the development of treatment guidelines in order to reduce the burden of IRIS. We review the available literature on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of IRIS, and present treatment options for the more common infectious manifestations of this diverse syndrome and for manifestations associated with a high morbidity.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 invades the central nervous system (CNS) in the context of acute infection, persists thereafter in the absence of treatment, and leads to chronic intrathecal immunoactivation that can be measured by the macrophage activation marker, neopterin, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In this review we describe our experience with CSF neopterin measurements in 382 untreated HIV-infected patients across the spectrum of immunosuppression and HIV-related neurological diseases, in 73 untreated AIDS patients with opportunistic CNS infections, and in 233 treated patients. In untreated patients, CSF neopterin concentrations are almost always elevated and increase progressively as immunosuppression worsens and blood CD4 cell counts fall. However, patients with HIV dementia exhibit particularly high CSF neopterin concentrations, above those of patients without neurological disease, though patients with CNS opportunistic infections, including CMV encephalitis and cryptococcal meningitis, also exhibit high levels of CSF neopterin. Combination antiretroviral therapy, with its potent effect on CNS HIV infection and CSF HIV RNA, mitigates both intrathecal immunoactivation and lowers CSF neopterin. However, despite suppression of plasma and CSF HIV RNA to below the detection limits of clinical assays (<50 copies HIV RNA/mL), CSF neopterin often remains mildly elevated, indicating persistent low-level intrathecal immune activation and raising the important questions of whether this elevation is driven by continued CNS infection and whether it causes continued indolent CNS injury. Although nonspecific, CSF neopterin can serve as a useful biomarker in the diagnosis of HIV dementia in the setting of confounding conditions, in monitoring the CNS inflammatory effects of antiretroviral treatment, and give valuable information to the cause of ongoing brain injury.",

    "abstract": "HIV remains responsible for an estimated 40% of mortality in South African pregnant women and their children. To address these avoidable deaths, eligibility criteria for antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnant women were revised in 2010 to enhance ART coverage. With greater availability of HIV services in public health settings and increasing government attention to poor maternal-child health outcomes, this study used the patient's journey through the continuum of maternal and child care as a framework to track and document women's experiences of accessing ART and prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programmes in the Eastern Cape (three peri-urban facilities) and Gauteng provinces (one academic hospital).In-depth interviews identified considerable weaknesses within operational HIV service delivery. These manifested as missed opportunities for HIV testing in antenatal care due to shortages of test kits; insufficient staff assigned to HIV services; late payment of lay counsellors, with consequent absenteeism; and delayed transcription of CD4 cell count results into patient files (required for ART initiation). By contrast, individual factors undermining access encompassed psychosocial concerns, such as fear of a positive test result or a partner's reaction; and stigma. Data and information systems for monitoring in the three peri-urban facilities were markedly inadequate.A single system- or individual-level delay reduced the likelihood of women accessing ART or PMTCT interventions. These delays, when concurrent, often signalled wholesale denial of prevention and treatment. There is great scope for health systems' reforms to address constraints and weaknesses within PMTCT and ART services in South Africa. Recommendations from this study include: ensuring autonomy over resources at lower levels; linking performance management to facility-wide human resources interventions; developing accountability systems; improving HIV services in labour wards; ensuring quality HIV and infant feeding counselling; and improved monitoring for performance management using robust systems for data collection and utilisation.",

    "abstract": "As the HIV-1 epidemic enters its fourth decade, HIV-1 associated neurological disorders (HAND) continue to be a major concern in the infected population, despite the widespread use of anti-retroviral therapy. Advancing age and increased life expectancy of the HIV-1 infected population have been shown to increase the risk of cognitive dysfunction. Over the past 10 years, there has been a significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms and the risk factors involved in the development of HAND. Key events that lead up to neuronal damage in HIV-1 infected individuals can be categorized based on the interaction of HIV-1 with the various cell types, including but not limited to macrophages, brain endothelial cells, microglia, astrocytes and the neurons. This review attempts to decipher these interactions, beginning with HIV-1 infection of macrophages and ultimately resulting in the release of neurotoxic viral and host products. These include: interaction with endothelial cells, resulting in the impairment of the blood brain barrier; interaction with the astrocytes, leading to metabolic and neurotransmitter imbalance; interactions with resident immune cells in the brain, leading to release of toxic cytokines and chemokines. We also review the mechanisms underlying neuronal damage caused by the factors mentioned above. We have attempted to bring together recent findings in these areas to help appreciate the viral and host factors that bring about neurological dysfunction. In addition, we review host factors and viral genotypic differences that affect phenotypic pathological outcomes, as well as recent advances in treatment options to specifically address the neurotoxic mechanisms in play.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 10 years, extensive work has been carried out in the field of microbial translocation in HIV infection, ranging from studies on its clinical significance to investigations on its pathogenic features. In the present work, we review the most recent findings on this phenomenon, focusing on the predictive role of microbial translocation in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, the mechanisms by which it arises and potential therapeutic approaches. From a clinical perspective, current work has shown that markers of microbial translocation may be useful in predicting clinical events in untreated HIV infection, while conflicting data exist on their role in cART-experienced subjects, possibly due to the inclusion of extremely varied patient populations in cohort studies. Results from studies addressing the pathogenesis of microbial translocation have improved our knowledge of the damage of the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier occurring in HIV infection. However, the extent to which mucosal impairment translates directly to increased gastrointestinal permeability remains an open issue. In this respect, novel work has established a role for IL-17 and IL-22-secreting T cell populations in limiting microbial translocation and systemic T-cell activation/inflammation, thus representing a possible target of immune-therapeutic interventions shown to be promising in the animal model. Further, recent reports have not only confirmed the presence of a dysbiotic intestinal community in the course of HIV infection but have also shown that it may be linked to mucosal damage, microbial translocation and peripheral immune activation. Importantly, technical advances have also shed light on the metabolic activity of gut microbes, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches to correct the function, as well as the composition, of the gastrointestinal microbiota.",

    "abstract": "The success of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has determined a dramatic decline in AIDS- and immunodeficiency-related causes of death in the HIV-infected population. As life-expectancy increases, such individuals have become gradually exposed not only to the effects of aging itself, but also to the influence of environmental risk factors, which are known to act in the general population. These features can lead to obesity, diabetes mellitus and ultimately cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Metabolic complications and abnormal fat distribution were frequently observed after a few years of antiretroviral therapy and, as the array of antiretroviral drugs became broader, long term metabolic alterations are becoming far more common worldwide. Nevertheless, the risk of not being on HAART is overwhelmingly greater than the metabolic adverse events in terms of morbidity and mortality events. HIV/HAART-induced metabolic unbalances overlap in some extent the components of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) and its high rates in the HIV population place infected individuals in an elevated CVD risk category. MetS can explain at least in part the emergence of CVD as the major morbidity and mortality conditions in the HIV population. In this review we convey information on the underlying aspects of MetS during HIV infection, highlighting some physiopathological and epidemiological features of this comorbidity along with the role played by HIV itself and the synergy action of some antiretroviral drugs. Considerations on MetS management in the HIV population are also depicted.",

Methods A case-control study was conducted in Dessie referral and Borumeda district hospitals from March 1 to 31, 2010, northern Ethiopia. A total of 320 study participants (160 cases and 160 controls) were included in the study. Cases were people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) who had a WHO clinical stage of III or IV or a CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 200/uL at the time of the first presentation to antiretroviral treatment (ART) clinics. Controls were PLHA who had WHO stage I or II or a CD4 lymphocyte count of 200/uL or more irrespective of clinical staging at the time of first presentation to the ART clinics of the hospitals cases and controls were interviewed by trained nurses using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire. In-depth interviews were conducted with ten health workers and eight PLHA.

Good ART adherence is required to achieve these benefits. We investigated how the environmental, social, economic and behavioural experiences of people living with HIV with poor viral suppression could explain their non-adherence to long term ART.This qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted in Uganda between September 2015 and April 2016. Thirty individuals on ART for 5 years or more (10 on first line and 20 on second line), with poor viral suppression, were randomly selected from a cohort of people living with HIV on ART. In-depth interviews about ART; awareness, adherence counselling, obstacles to daily adherence and regimen switches were conducted. Emerging themes from the interviews transcripts and field notes were identified and thematic content analysis done. Participants' consent, compensation, confidentiality and study ethical approvals were ensured.We found that poor adherence to long term ART was due to: travel for work or social activities, stigma, receiving little or no continuous ART adherence education, alcohol consumption and use of alternative 'HIV cure' medicines. Other reasons included; ART side effects, treatment fatigue, belief that long-term ART or God can 'cure HIV', and food security.Achieving optimal ART benefits requires continuous provision of ART adherence education to individuals on long term ART. This helps them overcome the challenges related to living with HIV: worries of food insecurity, alcohol misuse, economic hardship, and beliefs in HIV cures and use of unproven alternative HIV treatments. People living with HIV who travel require adherence support and larger quantities of ART refills to cover their time away.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has led to declines in HIV related morbidity and mortality. However, virologic failure (VF) and acquired drug resistance (ADR) may negatively affect these gains. This study describes the prevalence and correlates of HIV-1 VF and ADR among first-line ART experienced adults at a rural HIV clinic in Coastal Kenya. HIV-infected adults on first-line ART for ≥6 months were cross-sectionally recruited between November 2008 and March 2011. The primary outcome was VF, defined as a one-off plasma viral load of ≥400 copies/ml. The secondary outcome was ADR, defined as the presence of resistance associated mutations. Logistic regression and Fishers exact test were used to describe correlates of VF and ADR respectively. Of the 232 eligible participants on ART over a median duration of 13.9 months, 57 (24.6% [95% CI: 19.2 – 30.6]) had VF. Fifty-five viraemic samples were successfully amplified and sequenced. Of these, 29 (52.7% [95% CI: 38.8 – 66.3]) had at least one ADR, with 25 samples having dual-class resistance mutations. The most prevalent ADR mutations were the M184V (n = 24), K103N/S (n = 14) and Y181C/Y/I/V (n = 8). Twenty-six of the 55 successfully amplified viraemic samples (47.3%) did not have any detectable resistance mutation. Younger age (15–34 vs. ≥35 years: adjusted odd ratios [95% CI], p-value: 0.3 [0.1–0.6], p = 0.002) and unsatisfactory adherence (<95% vs. ≥95%: 3.0 [1.5–6.5], p = 0.003) were strong correlates of VF. Younger age, unsatisfactory adherence and high viral load were also strong correlates of ADR. High levels of VF and ADR were observed in younger patients and those with unsatisfactory adherence. Youth-friendly ART initiatives and strengthened adherence support should be prioritized in this Coastal Kenyan setting. To prevent unnecessary/premature switches, targeted HIV drug resistance testing for patients with confirmed VF should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Adolescents living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) have worse treatment adherence, viral suppression, and mortality rates compared to adults. This study investigated factors associated with viral non-suppression among adolescents living with HIV in Cambodia. A cross-sectional study was conducted in August 2016 among 328 adolescents living with HIV aged 15–17 years who were randomly selected from 11 ART clinics in the capital city of Phnom Penh and 10 other provinces. Clinical and immunological data, including CD4 count and viral load, were obtained from medical records at ART clinics. Adolescents were categorized as having achieved viral suppression if their latest viral load count was < 1000 ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies/mL. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors independently associated with viral non-suppression. The mean age of the participants was 15.9 years (SD = 0.8), and 48.5% were female. Median duration on ART was 8.6 (interquartile range = 6.0–10.6) years. Of total, 76.8% of the participants had achieved viral suppression. After adjustment for other covariates, the likelihood of having viral non-suppression remained significantly lower among adolescents who were: older/aged 17 (AOR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.21–0.98), had been on ART for more than 9 years (AOR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.19–0.64), had most recent CD4 count of > 672 (AOR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.26–0.86), had a relative as the main daily caregiver (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.17–0.80), and did not believe that there is a cure for AIDS (AOR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.21–0.75) compared to their reference group. The likelihood of having viral non-suppression also remained significantly higher among adolescents who had first viral load > 628 RNA copies/mL (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.05–4.08) and among those who were receiving HIV care and treatment from an adult clinic (AOR = 2.95, 95% CI 1.56–5.59). The proportion of adolescents living with HIV with viral suppression in this study was relatively high at 76.8%, but falls short of the global target of 90%. Programs targeting younger adolescents and adolescents in transition from pediatric to adult care with a range of interventions including psychosocial support and treatment literacy could further improve viral suppression outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been effective in suppressing HIV replication. However, severe drug toxicities due to the therapy and its failure in targeting the integrated proviral genome have led to the introduction of a new paradigm of gene-based therapies. With its effective inhibition and high precision, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) or CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as an effective genome editing tool in the last decade. Mediated by guide RNAs (gRNAs), Cas9 endonuclease acts like genetic scissors that can modify specific target sites. With this concept, CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to target the integrated proviral HIV-1 genome both in in vitro as well as in vivo studies including non-human primates. The CRISPR has also been tested for targeting latent HIV-1 by modulating the proviral transcription with the help of a specialized Cas9 mutant. Overcoming the limitations of the current therapy, CRISPR has the potential to become the primary genome editing tool for eradicating HIV-1 infection. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements of CRISPR to target the proviral HIV-1 genome, the challenges and future prospects.",

Tackling this global public health issue is the key to reducing the rate of virological failure and increasing the success of treatment for those living with HIV. Methods This umbrella review delves into various aspects of current anti-retroviral therapy (ART) which is the primary treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Comprehensive searches were conducted in online databases including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, up to May 26, 2023. Following the screening and selection of relevant articles, eligible articles were included in the data extraction. This study adhered to the PRISMA guideline to report the results and employed the NIH quality and bias risk assessment tool to ensure the quality of included studies. Results In total, 40 review studies published from 2015 to 2023 were included. The bulk of these studies concurred on several major factors contributing to HIV drug resistance and virological failure. Key among these were medication adherence, baseline and therapeutic CD4 levels, the presence of co-infections, and the advanced clinical stage of the infection. Conclusion The resistance to HIV drugs and instances of determinants for virologic failure have a profound impact on the life quality of those infected with HIV. Primary contributors to this scenario include insufficient adherence to treatment, decreased CD4 T-cell count, elevated viral levels, and certain treatment regimens. Implementing appropriate interventions could address these issues. Sub-Saharan Africa exhibits elevated rates of determinants for virologic failure, attributed to the delay in HIV testing and diagnosis, and late initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). It is essential to undertake further research aimed at enhancing the detection of resistance in HIV patients and mitigating viral failure by addressing these underlying causes.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 remains a major global health challenge, impacting approximately 39 million people worldwide. Although antiretroviral therapy has substantially reduced HIV incidence and enhanced the quality of life for those living with HIV, adherence difficulties, limited access, and persistent stigma continue to exacerbate the disease burden. A curative or long-term immunological control strategy without continuous medication would significantly advance pandemic management. In the 2010s, technological progress led to the development of a new generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) with improved potency and breadth, targeting conserved regions of the HIV-1 envelope and facilitating viral neutralization and clearance. This review evaluates the clinical outcomes and potential of bNAbs in people living with HIV, summarizing findings from a review of 154 registered trials, of which 62 met the inclusion criteria focusing on adult PLWH. Early trials confirmed bNAbs' safety but revealed transient and limited viral suppression, often due to viral escape. Second-generation bNAbs like VRC01 and 3BNC117, as well as combination therapies such as 3BNC117 with 10-1074, extended viral suppression but continued to face resistance challenges. More recent trials that paired bNAbs with latency-reversing agents or combined multiple bNAbs demonstrated promising results, including delayed viral rebound and enhanced CD8 + T-cell responses. While bNAbs show potential as an adjunct or alternative to ART, obstacles such as viral resistance, high production costs, and scalability must be addressed. Continued research is crucial to developing more potent, durable, and affordable bNAbs for sustainable HIV treatment and potential remission.",

    "abstract": "Over the years, Nigeria has recorded significant progress in controlling the HIV epidemic in the country. HIV prevalence has reduced from 4.1% in 2010 to 1.4 in 2019. The number of people acquiring new HIV infections decreased from 120,000 in 2010 to 74,000 in 2021, and HIV-related deaths decreased from 82,000 in 2010 to 51,000 in 2021. However, the country still faces challenges such as high HIV transmission among key populations (KP) who account for 11% of new HIV infections. Over the years, the government and development partners involved in HIV response efforts in Nigeria have been establishing and scaling up access to services to help address the needs of KPs. Initially, services for KPs as with the general population in Nigeria were largely preventive. Treatment of PLHIV in Nigeria commenced in 2002 and has increased from about 15,000 to more than 1.78 million PLHIVs in 2023. Despite this progress in treatment coverage, however, KPs are not equitably covered. To address this gap, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) launched an ambitious initiative-the Key Population Investment Fund (KPIF)-to target the unaddressed HIV-related needs of key populations (KPs) who are disproportionately affected by HIV. The KPIF initiative was implemented through partner organizations such as the Society for Family Health (SFH), a KP-friendly and indigenous non-governmental organization. Earlier, the program implemented by SFH was largely an HIV prevention program. SFH's transformation, transition, and growth to a comprehensive HIV prevention, care, and treatment service provider was necessary to bridge the gap in the needed expansion of HIV services to adequately meet the care needs of KPs and scale up programs. Therefore, this paper's aim is to share experiences in the transformation of SFH into a comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, and care service provider in the hope that it may serve as a lesson for organizations with similar objectives.",

    "abstract": "Implementation of programs for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV faces a variety of barriers and challenges. The assessment of these challenges has generally been conducted in large urban health facilities. As programs expand into rural areas, the potential barriers that may be encountered there also need to be assessed. This study examines potential barriers that might affect the acceptability of interventions for PMTCT in rural and urban settings.Four hundred and four women at a large urban hospital and three rural clinics that had recently started implementing PMTCT were interviewed. Level of knowledge of MTCT and preference for rapid HIV testing were equally high in both areas, but rural women had a higher tendency to think that they should consult their husbands before testing, with borderline statistical significance (72% vs. 64% p = 0.09). Health facility-based deliveries were significantly lower among mothers in rural areas compared to those in the urban setting. Overall, significant predictors of willingness to test for HIV were post-primary education (OR = 3.1 95% CI 1.2, 7.7) and knowledge about rapid HIV tests (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.01, 3.4). The strongest predictor of willingness to accept an HIV test was the woman's perception that her husband would approve of her testing for HIV. Women who thought their husbands would approve were almost six times more likely to report a willingness to be tested compared to those who thought their husbands would not approve (OR = 5.6, 95% CI 2.8, 11.2).Lessons learned in large urban hospitals can be generalized to rural facilities, but the lower proportion of facility-based deliveries in rural areas needs to be addressed. Same-day results are likely to ensure high uptake of HIV testing services but male spousal involvement should be considered, particularly for rural areas. Universal Primary Education will support the success of PMTCT programs.",

Genetic polymorphisms in exon 4 of the CYP2B6 gene were identified using PCR amplification of this region followed by sequencing of the amplification products. EFV concentrations were analysed by UPLC-MS/MS. Assessment of the presence of CNS related side effects following EFV initiation were elicited with the use of a questionnaire together with physical examination.Plasma EFV concentrations displayed high inter-individual variability amongst subjects with concentrations ranging from 94 mug/l to 23227 mug/l at 2 weeks post initiation of treatment. For the 516G > T polymorphism the following frequencies were observed 23% of patients were TT homozygous, 36% GG and 41% GT. The TT homozygous patients had significantly higher EFV concentrations vs. those with the wild (GG) genotype (p < 0.05). Patients who experienced no side effects had significantly lower EFV plasma concentrations vs. the group of patients which experienced the most severe side effects (p < 0.05).The significant association between the 516G > T polymorphism and plasma EFV concentrations has been demonstrated in this study.

Anti-retroviral drugs (ARV) are the treatments of choice and non-adherence is an important factor in treatment failure and development of resistance, as well as being a powerful predictor of survival. This study assesses adherence to ARV in HIV positive patients in Bangalore, India, a country where only 10% of those who need therapy are receiving it. A cross-sectional anonymous questionnaire survey of 60 HIV antibody positive patients was carried out with patients attending HIV outpatient services at two centres: The Chest and Maternity Centre, Rajajinagar, and Wockhardt Hospital and Heart Institute, Bangalore. Consent was obtained. Translation was done by a translator and doctors where required. Data was analysed using SPSS statistical analysis. A response rate of 88% (53/60) was achieved. The mean patient age was 39.98 years, with 50% aged 30–40, and 73.6% of participants being male. Mean family size was 4.8 (1–13). 21% lived less than 50 kms and 21% greater than 400 kms from clinic. 60% reported they were fully adherent. Adherence was statistically significantly linked to regular follow-up attendance (70.5%, p = 0.002). No other results were statistically significant but trends were found. \"100% adherence\" trends were seen in older patients, male gender, those from larger families, those who had a previous AIDS defining illness, those taking fewer tablets, and without food restrictions. Commonest side-effects causing non-adherence were metabolic reasons (66%) and GI symptoms (50%). No trends were seen for education level, family income, distance travelled to clinic, time since diagnosis, or time on ART. Regular attendance for follow up was statistically significant for 100% lifetime adherence. Positive trends were seen in those in larger families, older, those who had AIDS defining illness, simple regimes, and without side-effects. Education, income, distance travelled and length of time diagnosed or treated had no effect on adherence.",

Multivariable analysis demonstrated that at 6 months, food security significantly improved in those who received food assistance versus who did not (-3.55 vs -0.16; P < 0.0001); BMI decreased significantly less in the food assistance group than in the non-food group (-0.20 vs -0.66; P = 0.020). At 12 months, food assistance was associated with improved food security (-3.49 vs -1.89, P = 0.011) and BMI (0.22 vs -0.67, P = 0.036). Food assistance was associated with improved adherence to monthly clinic visits at both 6 (P < 0.001) and 12 months (P = 0.033).Food assistance was associated with improved food security, increased BMI, and improved adherence to clinic visits at 6 and 12 months among people living with HIV in Haiti and should be part of routine care where HIV and food insecurity overlap.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the clinical characteristics and outcome of HIV-associated Penicilliummarneffei infection in northern Vietnam. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients with laboratory confirmed Penicilliummarneffei infection admitted to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi, Vietnam, between July 2006 and September 2009. 127 patients with P. marneffei infection were identified. All were HIV-infected; median CD4+ T-cell count was 24 cells/μl (IQR:12-48); 76% were men. Common clinical features were fever (92.9%), skin lesions (82.6%), hepatomegaly (61.4%), lymphadenopathy (40.2%), weight loss (59.1%) and cough (49.6%). Concurrent opportunistic infections were present in 22.0%; half of those had tuberculosis. Initial treatment regimens were: itraconazole or ketoconazole capsule (77.2%), amphotericin B (20.5%), and fluconazole (1.6%). In-hospital mortality was 12.6% and showed no significant difference in patients treated with itraconazole (or ketoconazole) and amphotericin B (p = 0.43). Dyspnea, ascites, and increased LDH level were independent predictors of mortality. No seasonality was observed. The clinical features, treatments and outcomes of HIV-associated P. marneffei infection in northern Vietnam are similar to those reported in other endemic regions. Dyspnea was an important predictor of mortality. More patients were treated with itraconazole than amphotericin B and no significant difference in treatment outcome was observed. It would be of clinical value to compare the efficacy of oral itraconazole and amphotericin B in a clinical trial.",

This study evaluated individual patient characteristics determining antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and the predictive values of different measures of adherence on virological treatment failure in a cohort of patients in a routine-care setting in Cameroon. Longitudinal study over 6-months following ART introduction, using patients questionnaires and hospital and pharmacy records. At the end of the 6 months study period, 219 of 312 patients (70%) returned to the pharmacy to refill their medication, 17% (51) were lost to follow-up, 9% (28) were dead and 4% (14) were transferred to other care centres. Virological treatment failure at 6 months was experienced by 26 patients, representing 13% of patients with available viral load value. Pharmacy refill irregularity was the most powerful predictor (odds ratio 12.4; P < 0.001) of virological treatment failure, compared with CD4 cell count increase at 6 months (odds ratio 7.8; P = 0.002) or self-reported adherence at one month (odds ratio 1.1; P = 0.85). Low intensity of ART side-effects after one month was strongly associated with survival (odds ratio 0.11; P = 0.001). Patients starting ART with CD4 cell count <100 cells/mm3 had a greater risk of dying during the follow-up period (odds ratio 2.69; P = 0.02). Compared with asymptomatic CDC stage A patients, CDC stage B (odds ratio 5.72) and CDC stage C patients (odds ratio 16.9) had higher risk of becoming lost to follow-up (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analyses, pharmacy non-adherence was less frequent in women (adjusted odds ratio 0.56; P = 0.05) but more frequent in patients with high monthly income (odds ratio 3.24; P = 0.04). Pharmacy-refill adherence might be considered as an alternative to CD4 count monitoring for identification of patients at risk of virological failure, especially in resources-scarce countries. The study confirmed the difficulty in demonstrating clear associations of individual patient factors and treatment outcomes. The substantial loss to follow-up and deaths occurring within 6 months after initiating ART emphasise the need to understand the best timing of ART initiation and further elucidate and educate on the underlying reasons for delaying initiation of ART in resource-limited countries",

The 2014 guidelines were developed by the collaborations of the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and the Thai AIDS Society (TAS). One of the major changes in the guidelines included recommending to initiating ART irrespective of CD4 cell count. However, it is with an emphasis that commencing HAART at CD4 cell count above 500 cell/mm(3) is for public health, in term of preventing HIV transmission and personal benefit. In tuberculosis co-infected patients with CD4 cell counts ≤50 cells/mm(3) or with CD4 cell counts >50 cells/mm(3) who have severe clinical disease, ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of starting tuberculosis treatment. The preferred initial ART regimen in treatment naïve patients is efavirenz combined with tenofovir and emtricitabine or lamivudine. Plasma HIV viral load assessment should be done twice a year until achieving undetectable results; and will then be monitored once a year. CD4 cell count should be monitored every 6 months until CD4 cell count ≥350 cells/mm(3) and with plasma HIV viral load <50 copies/mL; then it should be monitored once a year afterward. HIV drug resistance genotypic test is indicated when plasma HIV viral load >1,000 copies/mL while on ART. Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir or atazanavir in combination with optimized two nucleoside-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors is recommended after initial ART regimen failure. Long-term ART-related safety monitoring has also been included in the guidelines.",

However, there is paucity of evidence on long term survival of patients on anti-retroviral treatment in the region. The objective of this study is to examine mortality and its predictors among a cohort of HIV infected patients on anti-retroviral treatment retrospectively followed for five years.A retrospective cohort study was conducted among HIV infected patients on ART in eastern Ethiopia. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to investigate factors that influence time to death and survival over time.A total of 1540 study participants were included in the study.

In multivariate analysis, the independent predictors for mortality were loss of more 10% weight loss, bedridden functional status at baseline, ≤ 200 CD4 cell count/ml, and advanced WHO stage patients.A lower level of mortality was detected among the cohort of patients on antiretroviral treatment in eastern Ethiopia. Previous history of weight loss, bedridden functional status at baseline, low CD4 cell count and advanced WHO status patients had a higher risk of death. Early initiation of ART, provision of nutritional support and strengthening of the food by prescription initiative, and counseling of patients for early presentation to treatment is recommended.",

Little is known about the rate and predictors of adherence in Ethiopia. Therefore this study determines the magnitude and predictors of adherence to antiretroviral therapy among people living with HIV/AIDS in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross sectional study was carried out from January 1, 2009 to March 3, 2009 among 319 adult PLWHA (≥ 18 years) attending ART clinic at Jimma university Specialized Hospital (JUSH). Multiple Logistic regression models were constructed with adherence and independent variables to identify the predictors. Results About 303(95%) of the study subjects were adherent based on self report of missed doses (dose adherence) in a one-week recall before the actual interview. The rate of self reported adherence in the study based on the combined indicator of the dose, time and food adherence measurement was 72.4%. Patients who got family support were 2 times [2.12(1.25-3.59)] more likely to adhere than those who didn't get family support as an independent predictor of overall adherence (dose, time and food). The reasons given for missing drugs were 9(27.3%) running out of medication/drug, 7(21.2%) being away from home and 7(21.2%) being busy with other things. Conclusion The adherence rate found in this study is similar to other resource limited setting and higher than the developed country. This study highlights emphasis should be given for income generating activities and social supports that helps to remember the patients for medication taking and management of opportunistic infections during the course of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal parasites are a major concern in most developing countries where HIV/AIDS case are concentrate and almost 80% of AIDS patients die of AIDS-related infections. In the absence of ART, HIV/AIDS patients in developing countries unfortunately continue to suffer from the consequences of opportunistic parasites. But this prevalence has dramatically decreased in countries where antiretroviral agents are widely available. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of intestinal parasite and risk factor among pre- ART and on ART adult HIV/ AIDS patients attending ART clinic in Dessie hospital.A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among pre-ART and on ART adult HIV/AIDS patients of Dessie Hospital. A total of 272 (136 from each group) study subjects were selected by using systematic random sampling. Stool sample was collected and processed using direct wet mount, formol-ether concentration technique and modified Ziehl-Neelson staining techniques. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on Sociodemographic & associated risk factors. Data was entered and analyzed by using SPSS 16 software and logistic regressions were applied to assess any association between explanatory factors and outcome variables.The overall prevalence of IP in pre-ART and on-ART was 39% and 17.6%, respectively with significant decrease of intestinal parasite in the ART era (p < 0.001). All Cryptosporidium spps infections were found in the pre-ART patients and significantly associated for lower CD4 <200cells/mm3. Absence of toilet (AOR = 7.57; 95% CI = 1.3,44.22), source of water (AOR = 6.03; 95% CI = 1.14,31.98), living condition (AOR = 13.29, 95% CI = 5.14, 34.35); WHO stage (AOR = 6.06; 95% CI = 2.49,14.74) and ART status (AOR = 7.55; 95% CI = 3.24,17.59) have significant association with prevalence of intestinal parasite.The overall prevalence of IP was differ by ART status and opportunistic parasite like cryptosporidium spps were found in low CD4 counts in ART naive patients. This study identified some environmental and some clinical finding as determinant factor for IP infections. Therefore, public health measures and adherence to ART should be strengthened to improve the quality of life of these patients.",

The process may have positive and negative effects to the HIV infected people who disclose their status. The present study was undertaken to describe HIV serostatus disclosure among HIV infected people attending care and treatment clinic at Sekou-Toure hospital in Mwanza, Tanzania. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out on 270 HIV infected adults attending Care and Treatment Clinic (CTC) at Sekou-Toure hospital between September and October, 2010. A Swahili questionnaire was used to obtain demographic and HIV disclosure information. Results Hundred and ninety five (72.5%) of all recruited participants were females, 88.1% (238/270) were aged above 30 years and 44.1% (119/270) were married. The prevalence of serostatus disclosure was 93.3% (252/270) with participants aged above 30 years having significantly higher proportion of serostatus disclosure compared to those aged below 30 years (94.5% vs. 84.4%, p &lt; 0.05). Among the participants who disclosed their status, 69.3% reported closeness to the disclosed person as the reason for disclosure while 25.8% (65/252) disclosed because they needed help. Two hundred (79.4%) reported to have received emotional support following disclosure while 25.8% and 29.7% received financial support and freedom to use their anti-retroviral drugs around the person they disclosed their status respectively. Thirty four participants reported to have been discriminated following disclosure and 12 participants reported to have been divorced. Conclusions Rate of disclosure of HIV serostatus was noted to be high in this study. Delayed disclosure was also noted in small proportion of participants. Negative outcomes following disclosure of serostatus were reported by participants. Efforts need to be increased to promote disclosure of HIV serostatus in Tanzania through health education and awareness for both HIV infected individuals and the community.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) has been the most common opportunistic infection and cause of mortality among HIV-infected patients, especially in resource-limited countries. Clinical manifestations of TB vary and depend on the degree of immunodeficiency. Sputum microscopy and culture with drug-susceptibility testing are recommended as a standard method for diagnosing active TB. TB-related mortality in HIV-infected patients is high especially during the first few months of treatment. Integrated therapy of both HIV and TB is feasible and efficient to control the diseases and yield better survival. Randomized clinical trials have shown that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves survival of HIV-infected patients with TB. A delay in initiating ART is common among patients referred from TB to HIV separate clinics and this delay may be associated with increased mortality risk. Integration of care for both HIV and TB using a single facility and a single healthcare provider to deliver care for both diseases is a successful model. For TB treatment, HIV-infected patients should receive at least the same regimens and duration of TB treatment as HIV-uninfected patients. Currently, a 2-month initial intensive phase of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of continuation phase of isoniazid and rifampin is considered as the standard treatment of drug-susceptible TB. ART should be initiated in all HIV-infected patients with TB, irrespective of CD4 cell count. The optimal timing to initiate ART is within the first 8 weeks of starting antituberculous treatment and within the first 2 weeks for patients who have CD4 cell counts <50 cells/mm3. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART remains a first-line regimen for HIV-infected patients with TB in resource-limited settings. Although a standard dose of both efavirenz and nevirapine can be used, efavirenz is preferred because of more favorable treatment outcomes. In the settings where raltegravir is accessible, doubling the dose to 800 mg twice daily is recommended. Adverse reactions to either antituberculous or antiretroviral drugs, as well as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, are common in patients receiving integrated therapy. Early recognition and appropriate management of these consequences can reinforce the successful integrated therapy in HIV-infected patients with TB.",

We examined program retention among ART program participants in rural Uganda, which has used a community-based distribution model of ART delivery since 2004.We analyzed data of all patients >18 years who initiated ART in Jinja, Ugandan site of The AIDS Support Organization between January 1, 2004 and July 31, 2009. Participants attended clinic or outreach visits every 2-3 months and had CD4 cell counts measured every 6 months. Retention to care was defined as any patient with at least one visit in the 6 months before June 1, 2013. We then identified participants with at least one visit in the 6 months before June 1, 2013 and examined associations with mortality and lost-to-follow-up (LTFU). Participants with >4 years of follow up during August, 2012 to May, 2013 had viral load conducted, since no routine viral load testing was available.A total of 3345 participants began ART during 2004-2009. The median time on ART in June 2013 was 5.69 years. A total of 1335 (40 %) were residents of Jinja district and 2005 (60 %) resided in outlying districts. Of these, 2322 (69 %) were retained in care, 577 (17 %) died, 161 (5 %) transferred out and 285 (9 %) were LTFU. Factors associated with mortality or LTFU included male gender, [Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) = 1.56; 95 % CI 1.28-1.9], CD4 cell count <50 cells/μL (AHR = 4.09; 95 % CI 3.13-5.36) or 50-199 cells/μL (AHR = 1.86; 95 % CI 1.46-2.37); ART initiation and WHO stages 3 (AHR = 1.35; 95 % CI 1.1-1.66) or 4 (AHR = 1.74; 95 % CI 1.23-2.45). Residence outside of Jinja district was not associated with mortality/LTFU (p value = 0.562). Of 870 participants who had VL tests, 756 (87 %) had VLs <50 copies/mL.Community-based ART distribution systems can effectively mitigate the barriers to program retention and result in good rates of virologic suppression.",

A higher prevalence of late presentation and advanced HIV disease was found in male heterosexuals and female people who use drugs (PWID). Heterosexuals (OR 2.11 [95% CI 1.90-2.34]) and PWID (OR 1.55 [95% CI 1.30-1.84]) had a higher risk of late presentation than men who have sex with men (MSM). Blood testing of the blood receivers (OR 1.75 [95% CI 1.36-2.26]) and diagnosed in hospital (OR 1.74 [95% CI 1.65-1.84]) had an increased risk of late presentation compared to those who diagnosis in voluntary counseling and testing (VCT). Heterosexuals (OR 2.86 [95% CI 2.51-3.27]), PWID (OR 2.23 [95% CI 1.83-2.71]), blood testing of the blood receivers (OR 1.58 [95% CI 1.29-1.94]) and diagnosed in hospital (OR 1.85 [95% CI 1.76-1.94]) were also independent risk factors associated with advanced HIV disease. Older age, lower level of education and being divorced or widowed were also associated with late presentation and advanced HIV disease.Late presentation and advanced HIV disease were very common among patients with newly diagnosed HIV in Guangxi, China during 2012-2016.

Spearman's rank correlation test was used to assess the association between nutritional status and QoL.One in five PLHIVs was found to be under nourished (BMI <18.5 kg/m(2)). Illiteracy, residence in care homes, CD4 cells count <350 cells/mm(3), OIs, and illness at WHO clinical stages III and IV were found to be significant predictors of under nutrition. BMI was significantly correlated with three domains of QoL (psychological, social and environmental).Nutrition interventions should form an integral part of HIV care programs. Understanding the presence of OI, decline in CD4 count, and advancing WHO clinical stages as risk factors can be helpful in preventing under nutrition from developing. Longitudinal research is necessary to further explicate associations between nutritional status and QoL.",

    "abstract": "After a period where it was recommended to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) early, the CD4 threshold for treating asymptomatic adults dropped to 200/mm3 at the beginning of the 2000s. This was mostly due to a great prudence with regards to drug toxicity. The ART-start CD4 threshold in most international guidelines was then raised to 350/mm3 in 2006–2009 and to 500/mm3 in 2009–2013. Between 2012 and 2015, international guidelines went the last step further and recommended treating all HIV-infected adults regardless of their CD4 count. This ultimate step was justified by the results of three randomized controlled trials, HPTN 052, Temprano ANRS 12136 and START. These three trials assessed the benefits and risks of starting ART immediately upon inclusion (\"early ART\") versus deferring ART until the current starting criteria were met (\"deferred ART\"). Taken together, they recruited 8427 HIV-infected adults in 37 countries. The primary outcome was severe morbidity, a composite outcome that included all-cause deaths, AIDS diseases, and non-AIDS cancers in the three trials. The trial results were mutually consistent and reinforcing. The overall risk of severe morbidity was significantly 44–57 % lower in patients randomized to early ART as compared to deferred ART. Early ART also decreased the risk of AIDS, tuberculosis, invasive bacterial diseases and Kaposi's sarcoma considered separately. The incidence of severe morbidity was 3.2 and 3.5 times as high in HPTN052 and Temprano as in START, respectively. This difference is mostly due to the geographical context of morbidity. The evidence is now strong that initiating ART at high CD4 counts entails individual benefits worldwide, and that this is all the more true in low resource contexts where tuberculosis and other bacterial diseases are highly prevalent. These benefits in addition to population benefits consisting of preventing HIV transmission demonstrated in HPTN052, justify the recommendation that HIV-infected persons should initiate ART regardless of CD4 count. This recommendation faces many challenges, including the fact that switching from \"treat at 500 CD4/mm3\" to \"treat everyone\" not only requires more tests and more drugs, but also more people to support patients and help them remain in care.",

Young women are particularly vulnerable to STIs. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to examine the risk factors associated with prevalent and incident STIs among women who had participated in three clinical trials.A total of 5,748 women were screened and 2293 sexually active, HIV negative, non-pregnant women were enrolled in three clinical trials in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. The prevalence of individual STIs Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhea (NG), syphilis, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) was assessed at screening; and incident infections were evaluated over a 24 month period.Overall, the combined study population of all three trials had a median age of 28 years (inter-quartile range (IQR):22-37), and a median duration of follow-up of 12 months. Prevalence of STIs (CT, NG, TV, or syphilis) was 13% at screening. The STI incidence was estimated to be 20/100 women years. Younger women (<25 years, p < 0.001), women who were unmarried (p < 0.001) and non-cohabiting women (p < 0.001) were shown to be at highest risk for incident STIs.These results confirm the extremely high prevalence and incidence of STIs among women living in rural and urban communities of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the HIV epidemic is also particularly severe. These findings strongly suggest an urgent need to allocate resources for STI and HIV prevention that mainly target younger women.Clinical Trials.gov, NCT00121459.",

    "abstract": "HIV is usually associated with weight loss. World health Organization (WHO) recommends early antiretroviral (ART) initiation, but data on the progression of body mass index (BMI) in participants initiating early ART in Africa are scarce. The Temprano randomized trial was conducted in Abidjan to assess the effectiveness of early ART and Isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis for tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons with high CD4 counts below 800 cells/mm3 without any indication for starting ART. Patients initiating early ART before December 2010 were included in this sub-study. BMI was categorized as: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2) and obese (≥30 kg/m2). At baseline and after 24 months of ART, prevalence of being overweight or obese and factors associated with being overweight or obese were estimated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. At baseline, 755 participants (78 % women; median CD4 count 442/mm3, median baseline BMI 22 kg/m2) initiated ART. Among them, 19.7 % were overweight, and 7.2 % were obese at baseline. Factors associated with being overweight or obese were: female sex aOR 2.3 (95 % CI 1.4–3.7), age, aOR for 5 years 1.01 (95 % CI 1.0–1.2), high living conditions aOR 2.6 (95 % CI 1.5–4.4), High blood pressure aOR 4.3 (95 % CI 2.0–9.2), WHO stage 2vs1 aOR 0.7 (95 % CI 0.4–1.0) and Hemoglobin ≥95 g/dl aOR 3.0 (95 % CI 1.6–5.8). Among the 597 patients who attended the M24 visit, being overweight or obese increased from 20.4 to 24.8 % (p = 0.01) and 7.2 to 9.2 % (p = 0.03) respectively and factor associated with being overweight or obese was immunological response measured as an increase of CD4 cell count between M0–M24 (for +50 cells/mm3: aOR 1.01; 95 % CI 1.05–1.13, p = 0.01). The weight categories overweight and obese are highly prevalent in HIV-infected persons with high CD4 cell counts at baseline, and increased over 24 months on ART in this Sub-Saharan African population.",

Changing nutritional, as well as social behaviour, play integral roles in the prevalence and incidence of decreased BMD. Furthermore, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) specifically, has a negative impact on BMD and although highly active antiretroviral therapy increases the prognosis for HIV-infected individuals, BMD still seem to decrease further. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is considered the gold standard for BMD assessment; however, recent developments have provided more cost-effective screening methods, among which heel quantitative ultrasound appears to be the most widely used in resource limited countries such as South Africa.",

Myricetin is a flavonoid found in several plants that has been described as an inhibitor of Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) through its action against the HIV reverse transcriptase, but myricetin derivatives have not been fully studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-HIV-1 activity of glycosylated metabolites obtained from Marcetia taxifolia and derived from myricetin: myricetin rhamnoside and myricetin 3-(6-rhamnosylgalactoside). Compounds were obtained from organic extracts by maceration of aerial parts of M. taxifolia. All biological assays were performed in the MT4 cell line. Antiviral activity was measured as inhibition of p24 and reverse transcriptase with a fluorescent assay. Both flavonoids have antiviral activity in vitro, with an EC50 of 120 µM for myricetin 3-rhamnoside (MR) and 45 µM for myricetin 3-(6-rhamnosylgalactoside) (MRG), both significantly lower than the EC50 of myricetin (230 µM). Although both compounds inhibited the reverse transcriptase activity, with an IC50 of 10.6 µM for MR and 13.8 µM for MRG, myricetin was the most potent, with an IC50 of 7.6 µM, and an inhibition greater than 80%. Molecular docking approach showed correlation between the free energy of binding with the assays of enzyme inhibition. The results suggest that glycosylated moiety might enhance the anti-HIV-1 activity of myricetin, probably by favoring the internalization of the flavonoid into the cell. The inhibition of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is likely responsible for the antiviral activity.",

It remains unclear which adherence measure best predicts these outcomes. We compared six patient-reported and objective adherence measures in one ART-naïve cohort in South Africa. Methods We recruited 230 participants from a community ART clinic and prospectively collected demographic data, CD4 count and HIV-RNA at weeks 0, 16 and 48. We quantified adherence using 3-day self-report (SR), clinic-based pill count (CPC), average adherence by pharmacy refill (PR-average), calculation of medication-free days (PR-gaps), efavirenz therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and an electronic adherence monitoring device (EAMD). Associations between adherence measures and virologic and genotypic outcomes were modelled using logistic regression, with the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses derived to assess performance of adherence measures in predicting outcomes. Results At week 48 median (IQR) adherence was: SR 100% (100–100), CPC 100% (95–107), PR-average 103% (95–105), PR-gaps 100% (95–100) and EAMD 86% (59–94), and efavirenz concentrations were therapeutic (&gt;1 mg/L) in 92%. EAMD, PR-average, PR-gaps and CPC best predicted virological outcome at week 48 with AUC ROC of 0.73 (95% CI 0.61–0.83), 0.73 (95% CI 0.61–0.85), 0.72 (95% CI 0.59–0.84) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.52–0.76) respectively. EAMD, PR-gaps and PR-average were highly predictive of detection of resistance mutations at week 48, with AUC ROC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.87–0.97), 0.86 (0.67–1.0) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.65–1.0) respectively. SR and TDM were poorly predictive of outcomes at week 48. Conclusion EAMD and both PR measures predicted resistance and virological failure similarly. Pharmacy refill data is a pragmatic adherence measure in resource-limited settings where electronic monitoring is unavailable.

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a comorbidity of major clinical significance amongst people living with HIV (PLWHIV) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of CKD is rising, despite the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is increasingly related to prevalent non-infectious comorbidities (NICMs) and antiretroviral toxicity. There are great disparities evident, with the highest prevalence of CKD among PLWHIV seen in the African continent. The aetiology of kidney disease amongst PLWHIV includes HIV-related diseases, such as classic HIV-associated nephropathy or immune complex disease, CKD related to NICMs and CKD from antiretroviral toxicity. CKD, once established, is often relentlessly progressive and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Identifying patients with risk factors for CKD, and appropriate screening for the early detection of CKD are vital to improve patient outcomes. Adherence to screening guidelines is variable, and often poor. The progression of CKD may be slowed with certain clinical interventions; however, data derived from studies involving PLWHIV with CKD are sparse and this represent an important area for future research. The control of blood pressure using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, in particular, in the setting of proteinuria, likely slows the progression of CKD among PLWHIV. The cohort of PLWHIV is facing new challenges in regards to polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions and adverse drug reactions. The potential nephrotoxicity of ART is important, particularly as cumulative ART exposure increases as the cohort of PLWHIV ages. The number of PLWHIV with ESRD is increasing. PLWHIV should not be denied access to renal replacement therapy, either dialysis or kidney transplantation, based on their HIV status. Kidney transplantation amongst PLWHIV is successful and associated with an improved prognosis compared to remaining on dialysis. As the cohort of PLWHIV ages, comorbidity increases and CKD becomes more prevalent; models of care need to evolve to meet the new and changing chronic healthcare needs of these patients.",

Methods This is a retrospective, observational study. We compared the numbers of medical visits performed, antiretroviral drugs dispensed and the number of new HIV diagnosis and of hospitalizations in a cohort of people living with HIV (PLWH) followed by the Spedali Civili of Brescia between the bimester of the COVID-19 pandemic peak and the bimester of October–November 2019. Data were retrieved from administrative files and from paper and electronic clinical charts. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables were described using mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. Means for continuous variables were compared using Student’s t-tests and the Mann–Whitney test. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 test. Results As of December 31st, 2019, a total of 3875 PLWH were followed in our clinic. Mean age was 51.4 ± 13 years old, where 28% were females and 18.8% non-Italian. Overall, 98.9% were on ART (n = 3834), 93% were viro-suppressed. A total of 1217 and 1162 patients had their visit scheduled at our out-patient HIV clinic during the two bimesters of 2019 and 2020, respectively. Comparing the two periods, we observed a raise of missed visits from 5 to 8% ( p &lt; 0.01), a reduction in the number of new HIV diagnosis from 6.4 in 2019 to 2.5 per month in 2020 ( p = 0.01), a drop in ART dispensation and an increase of hospitalized HIV patients due to COVID-19 . ART regimens including protease inhibitors (PIs) had a smaller average drop than ART not including PIs (16.6 vs 21.6%, p &lt; 0.05). Whether this may be due to the perception of a possible efficacy of PIs on COVID19 is not known. Conclusions Our experience highlights the importance of a resilient healthcare system and the need to implement new strategies in order to guarantee the continuum of HIV care even in the context of emergency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Through universal “test and treat approach” (UTT) it is believed that HIV new infection and AIDS related death will be reduced at community level and through time HIV can be eliminated. With this assumption the UTT program was implemented since 2016. However, the effect of this program in terms of individual patient survival and treatment outcome was not assessed in relation to the pre-existing defer treatment approach. Objective To assess the effects of UTT program on HIV treatment outcomes and patient survival among a cohort of adult HIV infected patients taking antiretroviral treatment in Gurage zone health facilities. Methods Institution based retrospective cohort study was conducted in facilities providing HIV care and treatment. Eight years (2012–2019) HIV/AIDS treatment records were included in the study. Five hundred HIV/AIDS treatment records were randomly selected and reviewed. Data were abstracted using standardized checklist by trained health professionals; then it was cleaned, edited and entered by Epi info version 7 and analyzed by STATA. Cox model was built to estimate survival differences across different study variables. Results A total of 500 patients were followed for 1632.6 person-year (PY) of observation. The overall incidence density rate (IDR) of death in the cohort was 3 per-100-PY. It was significantly higher for differed treatment program, which is 3.8 per-100-PY compared to 2.4 per-100-PY in UTT program with a p value of 0.001. The relative risk of death among differed cases was 1.58 times higher than the UTT cases. The cumulative probability of survival at the end of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years was 98%, 90.2%, 89.2% and 88% respectively with difference between groups. The log rank test and Kaplan–Meier survival curve indicated patients enrolled in the UTT program survived longer than patients enrolled in the differed treatment program (log rank X 2 test = 4.1, p value = 0.04). Age, residence, base line CD4 count, program of enrolment, development of new OIS and treatment failure were predicted mortality from HIV infection. Conclusion Mortality was significantly reduced after UTT. Therefore, intervention to further reduce deaths has to focus on early initiation of treatment and strengthening UTT programs.",

This study evaluated real world adherence and persistence of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), comparing STRs and MTRs.Adult Medicaid beneficiaries (aged ≥ 18 years) initiating ART with ≥ 2 ART claims during the identification period (January 1, 2015-December 31, 2016) and continuous health plan enrollment for a 12-month baseline period were included. For STRs, the first ART claim date was defined as the index date; for MTRs, the prescription fill claim date for the last drug in the regimen was defined as the index date, and prescription fills were required to occur within a 5-day window. Adherence was assessed in 30-day intervals over a 6-month period, with adherence defined as having less than a 5-day gap between fills. Persistence was evaluated as median number of days on therapy and percent persistence at 12 months. Cox Proportional Hazard models were used to evaluate risk of discontinuation, controlling for baseline and clinical characteristics.A total of 1,744 (STR = 1290; MTR = 454) and 2409 (STR = 1782; MTR = 627) patients newly prescribed ART had available data concerning adherence and persistence, respectively. Average age ranged 40-42 years. The patient population was predominantly male. Adherence assessments showed 22.7% of STR initiators were adherent to their index regimens over a 6-month period compared to 11.7% of MTR initiators.

Controlling for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, MTR initiators had a higher risk of treatment discontinuation (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.6, p < 0.0001). Among STRs, compared to the referent elvitegravir(EVG)/cobicistat(COBI)/emtricitabine(FTC)/tenofovir alafenamide(TAF), risk of discontinuation was higher for efavirenz(EFV)/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate(TDF) (HR = 3.6, p < 0.0001), EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF (HR = 2.8, p < 0.0001), and abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC)/dolutegravir (DTG) (HR = 1.8, p = 0.004). Among backbones, FTC/TAF was associated with lower risk of discontinuation than FTC/TDF (HR = 4.4, p < 0.0001) and ABC/3TC (HR = 2.2, p < 0.0001).Among patients newly prescribed ART, STR initiators were significantly less likely to discontinue therapy and had greater adherence and persistence compared to MTR initiators. Regimens containing FTC/TAF as a backbone had higher persistence than those consisting of other backbones.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Achieving undetectable viral load is crucial for the reduction of HIV transmissions, AIDS-related illnesses and death. Adolescents (10 to19 years) living with HIV (ALHIV) on antiretroviral treatment (ART) have worse treatment adherence and lower viral suppression rates compared to adults. We report on the clinical factors associated with viral suppression among ALHIV in the Ehlanzeni district, Mpumalanga in South Africa. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with 9386 ALHIV, aged 10 to 19 years, who were enrolled in 136 ART clinics in the Ehlanzeni district. Clinical and immunological data were obtained from electronic medical records (Tier.net). ALHIV were categorised as having achieved viral suppression if their latest viral load count was &lt; 1000 ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies/mL. Using a backward stepwise approach, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors independently associated with viral suppression. Results The mean age of the participants was 14.75 years (SD = 2.9), and 55.43% were female. Mean duration on ART was 72.26 (SD = 42.3) months. Of the 9386 adolescents with viral load results recorded, 74% had achieved viral suppression. After adjusting for other covariates, the likelihood of achieving viral suppression remained significantly higher among ALHIV who were: female (AOR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.05–1.39), and had most recent CD4 count &gt; 200 (AOR = 2.53, 95% CI 2.06–3.11). Furthermore, the likelihood of having viral suppression was lower among adolescents with CD4 count &gt; 200 at baseline (AOR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.61–0.87), and who were switched to second line regimen (AOR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.34–0.49). Conclusions Viral suppression amongst ALHIV at 74% is considerably lower than the WHO target of 95%. Of particular concern for intervention is the lower rates of viral suppression amongst male ALHIV. Greater emphasis should be placed to early enrolment of ALHIV on ART and keeping them engaged in care (beyond 6 months). Furthermore, improved and regular viral load monitoring will help to adequately identify and manage ALHIV with unsuppressed viral load and subsequently switching to second line treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Depression is particularly common among adolescents with HIV/AIDS and has been associated with disruption of the important developmental process, subsequently leading to a wide range of negative mental, physical and psychosocial consequences, as well as poor quality of life in those population groups. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there are no prior systematic reviews and meta-analytic studies that determined the prevalence of depression among adolescents with HIV/AIDS. Method We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science for relevant literature until May 2020. A random-effect meta-analysis was used to pool prevalence rates from individual studies. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneities and to compare the prevalence estimates across the groups. The Joanna Briggs Institute’s quality assessment checklist was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. Cochran’s Q and the I 2 tests were used to assess heterogeneity between the studies. Results A total of ten studies were included for the final analysis, with 2642 adolescents living with HIV/AIDS. Our final meta-analysis showed that more than a quarter of adolescents with HIV had depression [26.07% (95% CI 18.92–34.78)]. The prevalence was highest amongst female adolescents (32.15%) than males (25.07%) as well as amongst the older adolescents aged 15–19 years (37.09%) than younger adolescents aged 10–14 years (29.82%). Conclusion Our study shows that a significant proportion of adolescents with HIV had depression, indicating the imperativeness of intervention strategies to alleviate the suffering and possibly reduce the probable negative ramifications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background To accelerate progress toward the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Nigeria country office (CDC Nigeria) initiated an Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) Surge in 2019 to identify and link 340,000 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) to ART. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatened to interrupt ART Surge progress following the detection of the first case in Nigeria in February 2020. To overcome this disruption, CDC Nigeria designed and implemented adapted ART Surge strategies during February–September 2020. Methods Adapted ART Surge strategies focused on continuing expansion of HIV services while mitigating COVID-19 transmission. Key strategies included an intensified focus on community-based, rather than facility-based, HIV case-finding; immediate initiation of newly-diagnosed PLHIV on 3-month ART starter packs (first ART dispense of 3 months of ART); expansion of ART distribution through community refill sites; and broadened access to multi-month dispensing (MMD) (3–6 months ART) among PLHIV established in care. State-level weekly data reporting through an Excel-based dashboard and individual PLHIV-level data from the Nigeria National Data Repository facilitated program monitoring. Results During February–September 2020, the reported number of PLHIV initiating ART per month increased from 11,407 to 25,560, with the proportion found in the community increasing from 59 to 75%. The percentage of newly-identified PLHIV initiating ART with a 3-month ART starter pack increased from 60 to 98%. The percentage of on-time ART refill pick-ups increased from 89 to 100%. The percentage of PLHIV established in care receiving at least 3-month MMD increased from 77 to 93%. Among PLHIV initiating ART, 6-month retention increased from 74 to 92%. Conclusions A rapid and flexible HIV program response, focused on reducing facility-based interactions while ensuring delivery of lifesaving ART, was critical in overcoming COVID-19-related service disruptions to expand access to HIV services in Nigeria during the first eight months of the pandemic. High retention on ART among PLHIV initiating treatment indicates immediate MMD in this population may be a sustainable practice. HIV program infrastructure can be leveraged and adapted to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Viral suppression remains the most desired outcome in the management of patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and this can be achieved by an effective Antiretroviral Therapy (ART). However, some patients who achieve viral suppression may experience viral rebound with dire consequence. We evaluated viral suppression and rebound and their associated factors among adult patients on ART in Kumasi, Ghana.This hospital-based retrospective study was conducted at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Ghana. We reviewed the medical records of 720 HIV patients on ART. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 26.0 and GraphPad prism version 8.0. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Proportions of patients with viral suppression and viral rebound were 76.1% and 21.0% respectively. Being diagnosed at WHO stage I [aOR = 11.40, 95% CI (3.54-36.74), p < 0.0001], having good adherence to ART [aOR = 5.09, 95% CI (2.67-9.73), p < 0.0001], taking Nevirapine-based regimen [aOR = 4.66, 95% CI (1.20-18.04), p = 0.0260] and increasing duration of treatment (p < 0.0001) were independently associated with higher odds of viral suppression. However, being diagnosed at WHO stage II (aOR = 7.39, 95% CI 2.67-20.51; p < 0.0001) and stage III (aOR = 8.62, 95% CI 3.16-23.50; p < 0.0001), having poor adherence (aOR = 175.48, 95% CI 44.30-695.07; p < 0.0001), recording baseline suppression value of 20-49 copies/mL (aOR = 6.43, 95% CI 2.72-15.17; p < 0.0001) and being treated with Zidovudine/Lamivudine/Efavirenz (aOR = 6.49, 95% CI 1.85-22.79; p = 0.004) and Zidovudine/Lamivudine/Nevirapine (aOR = 18.68, 95% CI 1.58-220.90; p = 0.02) were independently associated with higher odds of viral rebound.Approximately 76% viral suppression rate among HIV patients on ART in Kumasi falls below the WHO 95% target by the year 2030. Choice of ART combination, drug adherence, WHO clinical staging and baseline viral load are factors associated with suppression or rebound. These clinical characteristics of HIV patients must be monitored concurrently with the viral load.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Surging HIV prevalence across countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is largely a result of poor HIV care engagement and a lack of comprehensive support for key populations. This is fostered by widespread stigma across healthcare, community, and legislative settings. Discussion Throughout CEE, HIV stigma and intersectional stigma are serious obstacles to providing adequate medical care to people living with HIV. Anticipated and enacted (experienced) stigma from healthcare professionals, and fears of breaches in confidentiality, deter individuals from having an HIV test and engaging in HIV care. Furthermore, negative connotations surrounding HIV infection can lead to discrimination from family, friends, colleagues, and the public, leading to internalized stigma and depression. Key populations that have higher HIV prevalence, such as men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, transgender individuals, and sex workers, experience additional stigma and discrimination based on their behaviour and identities. This contributes to the concentrated HIV epidemics seen in these populations in many CEE countries. The stigma is exacerbated by punitive legislation that criminalizes HIV transmission and penalizes sexual orientation, drug use, gender identities, and sex work. Despite high levels of HIV stigma and intersectional stigma, there are many evidence-based interventions that have reduced stigma in other parts of the world. Here, we discuss the interventions that are currently being enacted in various countries of CEE, and we suggest additional effective, evidence-based interventions that will tackle stigma and lead to increased HIV care engagement and higher rates of viral suppression. We cover the promotion of the undetectable = untransmittable (U = U) message, stigma-reduction education and training for healthcare professionals, patient-centric approaches for testing and treatment, and advocacy for non-discriminatory legislation, policies, and practices. We also consider targeted stigma-reduction interventions that acknowledge the wider challenges faced by marginalized populations. Conclusions HIV stigma and intersectional stigma in CEE drive poor engagement with HIV testing services and care. Widespread adoption of evidence-based interventions to tackle stigma highlighted in this review will improve the quality of life of people living with HIV, improve HIV care engagement, and ultimately slow the surging HIV prevalence and concentrated epidemics occurring throughout CEE.",

We conducted a bio-behavioral survey to estimate HIV prevalence and associated risk factors among tertiary student MSM (TSMSM) in Nairobi, Kenya.Between February and March 2021, 248 TSMSM aged ≥ 18 years who reported sex with another man in the past year participated in a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) based cross-sectional survey. Participants completed an electronically self-administered behavioral survey and provided a blood sample for HIV antibody testing, alongside urine, anorectal and oropharyngeal swabs for pooled testing of sexually transmitted infections using a multiplex nucleic acid amplification test. RDS-Analyst v.0.72 and Stata v.15 software were used for data analysis. Differences in proportions were examined using chi-square (χ2) test, and unweighted multivariate logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with HIV infection.HIV prevalence among study participants was 8.3%, whereas the weighted prevalence was 3.6% (95% CI: 1.3-6.0%). Median ages of participants, and at self-reported first anal sex with a man were 21(interquartile range [IQR] 20-22) and 18 (IQR 17-19) years, respectively. A majority (89.3%) of TSMSM owned a smart phone, 46.5% had ever used a geosocial networking app for MSM such as Grindr ® to find a sex partner, and a third (33.6%) met their last sex partner online. Almost three-quarters (71.3%) had > 1 male sex partner in the year before the survey. A third (34.3%) did not use condoms with their last sex partner, 21.2% received money from their last sex partner and 40.9% had taken alcohol/another drug during their last sexual encounter. HIV infection was associated with studying in private institutions (adjusted odds ratio[AOR] = 6.0; 95% confidence intervals [CI] : 1.2-30.0, p = 0.027), preferring a sex partner of any age-younger, same or older (AOR = 5.2; 95 CI: 1.1-25.2, p = 0.041), last sex partner being > 25 years (AOR = 6.4; 95% CI: 1.2-34.6, p = 0.030), meeting the last sex partner online (AOR = 4.2; 95% CI; 1.1-17.0, p = 0.043) and testing positive for Neisseria gonorrhea (AOR = 7.8; 95% CI: 2.0-29.9, p = 0.003).HIV prevalence among TSMSM in Nairobi is alarmingly high, demonstrating a need for tailored prevention and control interventions for this young key population.",

The increased life expectancy in the post-Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) era has led to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death among Persons Living with HIV (PLHIV). Hypertension remains a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease among PLHIV. Some studies have suggested associations between hypertension among PLHIV and HIV-related health factors. Objective To determine the prevalence of hypertension among PLHIV on antiretroviral medications and examine its association with HIV-related health factors. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among attendants at an adult HIV clinic. 362 study participants were selected by systematic sampling. Data on hypertension diagnosis, HIV-related health factors, sociodemographic and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors were collected using a standardized questionnaire and patient chart review. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the association between hypertension and HIV-related factors, adjusting for other risk factors for hypertension. Results The mean age of participants was 47.9 years and majority of participants were female (77.1%). 42% of study participants had been on antiretroviral medications for &gt; 10 years. The prevalence of hypertension was 17.4%. Age &gt; 50 years was associated with higher odds of hypertension (aOR: 3.75, 95%CI 1.68, 8.55, p-value: 0.002). BMI in overweight and obese categories, and a history of comorbid medical conditions (diabetes, hyperlipidemia) were also associated with higher odds of hypertension (aOR: 3. 76, 95%CI 1.44, 9.81, p-value: 0.007), (aOR: 3.17, 95%CI 1.21, 8.32, p-value: 0.019) and (aOR: 14.25, 95%CI 7.41, 27.41, p-value: &lt; 0.001) respectively. No HIV-related health factors were associated with hypertension. Conclusion Hypertension was a common condition among PLHIV on antiretroviral medications. No HIV-related health factors were associated with hypertension. Traditional risk factors associated with hypertension were increased age &gt; 50 years, increased BMI, and a history of comorbid medical conditions.",

    "abstract": "Despite progress towards HIV epidemic control, people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Zambia continue to face high mortality during and especially after hospitalization, with suboptimal post-discharge care leading to poor outcomes. We conducted a qualitative study to better understand factors influencing post-discharge engagement in care for HIV and associated comorbidities. We conducted in-depth interviews with 16 recently discharged PLHIV, seven caregivers, and two doctors; and three focus group discussions with inpatient doctors (n = 8) and lay counsellors (n = 16) at two tertiary hospitals in Lusaka, guided by the social-ecological model. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, managed with Atlas.ti 9, and thematically analyzed. Individual and household-level barriers to post-discharge care for PLHIV included HIV status denial and stigma, limited disclosure, and limited social and emotional support. Health-related barriers included concomitant treatments for TB, HIV comorbidities, and behavioral health issues like depression and alcohol abuse. Health system barriers included limited confidentiality during admission and poor communication between healthcare providers and between facilities aftercare transitions following discharge. Social-economic factors included economic shocks of hospitalization and post-discharge recovery, which compounded pre-existing poverty and high transportation and food costs. Conversely, disclosure of HIV status, better social support, a financially stable household, and hospital follow-up appointment reminders facilitated better post-discharge care. After hospital discharge with HIV, system and individual challenges exacerbate pre-existing interpersonal, health, environmental, and system-related factors to cause poor outcomes. Holistic community-based interventions to facilitate these patients' re-engagement in care after discharge could help HIV programs reach the last mile in epidemic control.",

This study aims to identify predictors of survival among older persons living with HIV receiving ART in Uganda's AIDS Support Organization Centers of Excellence (1987–2023). Understanding these predictors can inform effective clinical interventions to improve outcomes for this population. This study conducted a retrospective analysis of medical records from 11 TASO centers of excellence in Uganda (1987–2023). Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we identified factors associated with survival among older adults living with HIV. TASO centers of excellence in Entebbe, Gulu, Jinja, Masaka, Masindi, Mbale, Mbarara, Mulago, Rukungiri, Soroti, and Tororo. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified factors influencing survival among older persons living with HIV (OPLHIV). Of the 30,758 OPLHIV medical records analyzed (1987–2023), 72.5% were active on ART, 5.9% had died, 15.2% were lost to follow-up, and 5.6% transferred to other facilities. Survival was significantly associated with: gender (female, HR = 1.19, p < 0.001), marital status (married, HR = 0.99, p < 0.001; separated/divorced, HR = 0.85, p < 0.001), WHO clinical stage (II, HR = 1.66, p < 0.001), viral load (> 200 copies/ml, HR = 1.49, p < 0.001), and ART adherence (fair, HR = 0.94, p = 0.157). Key predictors of survival among Older Adults Living with HIV (OPLHIV) include: female gender, age 50–59, weight 51–70 kg, married status, viral load > 200 copies/ml, WHO HIV clinical stage II, paid employment, and ART adherence. To improve survival outcomes, consistent clinical screenings of WHO clinical stages, viral load, and ART adherence are essential. These measures can guide healthcare providers in making informed treatment decisions to enhance survival and quality of life for OPLHIV in Uganda. Strengthen routine monitoring of viral load, ART adherence, and WHO clinical staging. Provide targeted support to married and separated/divorced adults to improve their survival chances. Address gender disparities in care to enhance outcomes for females. Focus on maintaining ART adherence and viral suppression to reduce mortality risks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The study assessed the effect of some highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART), used in the management of HIV/AIDS in Cameroon, on oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (as TBARs), albumin, protein carbonyl content and protein sulfhydryls groups. 85 HIV positive patients (34.8 ± 9.3 years) were on three different highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART patients). 65 HIV positive patients (32.2 ± 10.9 years) on no treatment (Pre-HAART patients), and 90 non-HIV infected patients (32.6 ± 9.3 years), were the control groups. Plasma TBARs as well as carbonyl levels were significantly higher in HIV patients on HAART compared to pre-HAART patients or non-HIV infected controls. On the other hand, the protein sulfhydryl group content was not different for patients on HAART compared to pre-HAART patients, but both were significantly lower than non-HIV infected controls (P &lt; 0.0001, 0.001). The combination treatment Therapy I [stavudin (80 mg) + Lamivudin (600 mg) + Nevirapin + (400 mg) zidovudin (600 mg)] brought about a significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in the plasma concentration of protein sulfhydrl groups as well as TBARs compared to Therapy II [stavudin (80 mg) + Lamivudin (300 mg) + nevirapin (400 mg)] or with combination Therapy III of [zidovudine (600 mg) + lamivudin(300 mg) with efavirenz (600 mg)] (P &lt; 0.05). The content of the antioxidant, Vitamin C was lower in the plasma of patients on Therapy I compared to those on Therapy II (P &lt; 0.01) and Therapy III (P &lt; 0.001). HIV infection therefore increases the oxidative stress process, while antiretroviral combination therapy increased protein oxidation as well as the level of oxidative stress already present in HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) has proved to be a highly effective gene silencing mechanism with great potential for HIV/AIDS gene therapy. Previous work with siRNAs against cellular coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5 had shown that down regulation of these surface molecules could prevent HIV-1 entry and confer viral resistance. Since monospecific siRNAs targeting individual coreceptors are inadequate in protecting against both T cell tropic (X4) and monocyte tropic (R5) viral strains simultaneously, bispecific constructs with dual specificity are required. For effective long range therapy, the bispecific constructs need to be stably transduced into HIV-1 target cells via integrating viral vectors. Results To achieve this goal, lentiviral vectors incorporating both CXCR4 and CCR5 siRNAs of short hairpin design were constructed. The CXCR4 siRNA was driven by a U6 promoter whereas the CCR5 siRNA was driven by an H1 promoter. A CMV promoter driven EGFP reporter gene is also incorporated in the bispecific construct. High efficiency transduction into coreceptor expressing Magi and Ghost cell lines with a concomitant down regulation of respective coreceptors was achieved with lentiviral vectors. When the siRNA expressing transduced cells were challenged with X4 and R5 tropic HIV-1, they demonstrated marked viral resistance. HIV-1 resistance was also observed in bispecific lentiviral vector transduced primary PBMCs. Conclusions Both CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptors could be simultaneously targeted for down regulation by a single combinatorial lentiviral vector incorporating respective anti-coreceptor siRNAs. Stable down regulation of both the coreceptors protects cells against infection by both X4 and R5 tropic HIV-1. Stable down regulation of cellular molecules that aid in HIV-1 infection will be an effective strategy for long range HIV gene therapy.",

But the proper awareness level is substantially low in Bangladesh. This paper aims to identify the factors associated with the awareness regarding HIV/AIDS through a bivariate and multivariate analysis using the data extracted from Bangladesh Demography and Health Survey (BDHS) 1999–2000. Results The findings of both techniques show that education, occupation, socioeconomic status, status of household food consumption, area of residence and media exposure have significant (p &lt; 0.001) contribution in determining HIV/AIDS awareness level. It also reveals that media, particularly TV, and education play the leading role regarding this issue while the others have an indirect relationship. The odds of awareness among higher educated women and men were 4.69 and 77.73 times of no educated women and men respectively. In addition, both women and men those who regularly watch TV were 8.6 times more likely to be aware about AIDS compared to those who never watch TV. This phenomenon holds true for both women and men. Conclusion At this instant it is urgent to give emphasis on education, alleviation of poverty, ensuring electronic media exposure, head to head communication program, institutional based sex education and necessary information to learn about HIV/AIDS for the young, adult and adolescents all over the country.",

Outcomes analyzed were virologic suppression (VS) and failure (VF), CD4 count changes, AIDS and death. VF was defined as never suppressing or having at least one rebound event. Multivariate (MV) analyses stratified by the HAART initiation year (before or after 2000) were performed to identify risk factors associated with these outcomes. Among patients who started HAART after 2000, 81% had VS at 1 year (N = 1,759), 85% at 5 years (N = 1,061), and 82% at 8 years (N = 735). Five years post-HAART, the median CD4 increase was 247 cells/ml and 34% experienced VF. AIDS and mortality rates at 5 years were 2% and 0.3%, respectively. In a MV model adjusted for known risk factors associated with treatment response, being on active duty (versus retired) at HAART initiation was associated with a decreased risk of AIDS (HR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0) and mortality (0.6, 0.3-0.9), an increased probability of CD4 increase ≥ 50% (1.2, 1.0-1.4), but was not significant for VF. In this observational cohort, VS rates approach those described in clinical trials. Initiating HAART on active duty was associated with even better outcomes. These findings support the notion that free access to healthcare likely improves the response to HAART thereby reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality.",

Many studies in high HIV prevalence settings have reported low coverage of PMTCT services, but there have been few reports from low HIV prevalence settings, such as Asian countries. We investigated the access of HIV-infected pregnant women to PMTCT services in the well-resourced setting of the capital city, Hanoi. Fifty-two HIV positive women enrolled in a self-help group in Hanoi were consulted, through in-depth interviews and bi-weekly meetings, about their experiences in accessing PMTCT services. Only 44% and 20% of the women had received minimal and comprehensive PMTCT services, respectively. Nine women did not receive any services. Twenty-two women received no counselling. The women reported being limited by lack of knowledge and information due to poor counselling, gaps in PMTCT services, and fear of stigma and discrimination. HIV testing was done too late for optimal interventions and poor quality of care by health staff was frequently mentioned. In a setting where PMTCT is available, HIV-infected women and children did not receive adequate care because of barriers to accessing those services. The results suggest key improvements would be improving quality of counselling and making PMTCT guidelines available to health services. Women should receive early HIV testing with adequate counselling, safe care and prophylaxis in a positive atmosphere towards HIV-infected women.",

    "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most heavily affected by HIV. In 2008, the region accounted for 67% of HIV infections worldwide, the region also accounted for 72% of the world's AIDS-related deaths in 2008. Young people aged 15-24 years accounted for an estimated 45% of the new HIV infections. In sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya is among countries affected by the HIV and AIDS pandemic which led to the declaration of AIDS as a national disaster in 1999. Given these scenario the study was undertaken to examine trends in HIV and AIDS comprehensive knowledge and identify the main correlates of comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge among Kenyan urban young women. Data used was drawn from the 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2008/09 Kenya Demographic & Health Surveys. Logistic regression was used for analysis. While comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge is low among urban young women in Kenya, the results show a significant increase in comprehensive knowledge from 9% in 1993 to 54% in 2008/09. The strongest predictors for having comprehensive knowledge were found to be 1) education; 2) having tested for HIV; 3) knowing someone with HIV, and/or 4) having a small or moderate to great risk perception. The response to HIV and AIDS can only be successful if individuals adopt behaviours that will protect against infection. Currently, efforts are underway in Kenya to ensure that young people have comprehensive knowledge. As evident from the results, comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge has increased over the 15 year period among urban young women from 9% in 1993 to 54% in 2008/09. Despite this improvement, a lot more needs to be done to attain the target of 90% threshold set by UNGASS. While both young women and men should be targeted with education on HIV prevention, concerted efforts should be directed at young women as many continue to get infected due to low levels of comprehensive HIV knowledge.",

In addition, several studies have suggested that polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes may play important roles in nevirapine-induced rash. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different HLA-C alleles on rash associated with nevirapine in patients who started highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) containing nevirapine in Thailand.A case-control study was carried out involving HIV-1 patients under treatment at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Nonthaburi, Thailand between March 2007 and March 2008. The study included all HIV/AIDS patients being treated with nevirapine-containing regimens. The study population comprised 287 HIV/AIDS patients of whom 248 were nevirapine-tolerant and 39 developed rash after nevirapine treatment. From the nevirapine-tolerant patients, 60 were selected as the control group on the basis of age, sex, and therapy history matched for nevirapine-induced rash cases. We observed significantly more HLA-Cw*04 alleles in nevirapine-induced rash cases than in nevirapine-tolerant group, with frequencies of 20.51% and 7.50%, respectively (P = 0.009). There were no significant differences between the rash and tolerant groups for other HLA-C alleles except for HLA-Cw*03 (P = 0.015).This study suggests that HLA-Cw*04 is associated with rash in nevirapine treated Thais. Future screening of patients' HLA may reduce the number of nevirapine-induced rash cases, and patients with alleles associated with nevirapine-induced rash should be started on anti-retroviral therapy without nevirapine.",

However, whether the extremely high smoking prevalence in HIV-positive subjects affects their lung function is unclear, particularly whether smoking decreases lung function more in HIV-positive subjects, compared to the general population. We conducted this study to determine the association between smoking and lung function, respiratory symptoms and diseases amongst HIV-positive subjects. Of 120 enrolled HIV-positive subjects, 119 had an acceptable spirogram. Ninety-four (79%) subjects were men, and 96 (81%) were white. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 43.4 (8.4) years. Mean (SD) of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) percent of age, gender, race and height predicted value (%FEV1) was 93.1% (15.7%). Seventy-five (63%) subjects had smoked 24.0 (18.0) pack-years. For every ten pack-years of smoking increment, %FEV1 decreased by 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.6%, -0.6%), after controlling for gender, race and restrictive lung function (R2 = 0.210). The loss of %FEV1 in our subjects was comparable to the general population. Compared to non-smokers, current smokers had higher odds of cough, sputum or breathlessness, after adjusting for highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) use, odds ratio OR = 4.9 (95% CI: 2.0, 11.8). However respiratory symptom presence was similar between non-smokers and former smokers, OR = 1.0 (95% CI: 0.3, 2.8). All four cases of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) had smoked. Four of ten cases of restrictive lung disease had smoked (p = 0.170), and three of five asthmatic subjects had smoked (p = 1.000). Cumulative cigarette consumption was associated with worse lung function; however the loss of %FEV1 did not accelerate in HIV-positive population compared to the general population. Current smokers had higher odds of respiratory symptoms than non-smokers, while former smokers had the same odds of respiratory symptoms as non-smokers. Cigarette consumption was likely associated with more COPD cases in HIV-positive population; however more participants and longer follow up would be needed to estimate the effect of smoking on COPD development. Effective smoking cessation strategies are required for HIV-positive subjects.",

Increasingly evident is that HIV-1 replication is dependent on select components of autophagy. Fittingly, HIV-1 proteins are able to modulate autophagy to maximize virus production. At the same time, HIV-1 proteins appear to disrupt autophagy in uninfected cells, thereby contributing to CD4+ cell death and HIV-1 pathogenesis. These observations allow for new approaches for the treatment and possibly the prevention of HIV-1 infection. This review focuses on the relationship between autophagy and HIV-1 infection. Discussed is how autophagy plays dual roles in HIV-1 replication and HIV-1 disease progression.",

However, published data on adherence to ART in Kenya is limited. This study assessed adherence to ART and identified factors responsible for non adherence in Nairobi. This is a multiple facility-based cross-sectional study, where 416 patients aged over 18 years were systematically selected and interviewed using a structured questionnaire about their experience taking ART. Additional data was extracted from hospital records. Patients were grouped into adherent and non-adherent based on a composite score derived from a three questions adherence tool developed by Center for Adherence Support Evaluation (CASE). Multivariate regression model was used to determine predictors of non-adherence. Overall, 403 patients responded; 35% males and 65% females, 18% were non-adherent, and main (38%) reason for missing therapy were being busy and forgetting. Accessing ART in a clinic within walking distance from home (OR = 2.387, CI.95 = 1.155-4.931; p = 0.019) and difficulty with dosing schedule (OR = 2.310, CI.95 = 1.211-4.408, p = 0.011) predicted non-adherence. The study found better adherence to HAART in Nairobi compared to previous studies in Kenya. However, this can be improved further by employing fitting strategies to improve patients' ability to fit therapy in own lifestyle and cue-dose training to impact forgetfulness. Further work to determine why patients accessing therapy from ARV clinics within walking distance from their residence did not adhere is recommended.",

Serious non-AIDS events (SNAEs), including non-AIDS malignancies, cardiovascular events, renal and hepatic disease, bone disorders and neurocognitive impairment, have become the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. SNAEs occur at the rate of 1 to 2 per 100 person-years of follow-up. The pathogenesis of SNAEs is multifactorial and includes the direct effect of HIV and associated immunodeficiency, underlying co-infections and co-morbidities, immune activation with associated inflammation and coagulopathy as well as ART toxicities. A number of novel strategies such as ART intensification, treatment of co-infection, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and agents that reduce microbial translocation are currently being examined for their potential effects in reducing immune activation and SNAEs. However, currently, initiation of ART before advanced immunodeficiency, smoking cessation, optimisation of cardiovascular risk factors and treatment of HCV infection are most strongly linked with reduced risk of SNAEs or mortality. Clinicians should therefore focus their attention on addressing these issues prior to the availability of further data.",

    "abstract": "Data on lipid profile abnormalities among patients receiving highly active antiretroviral treatment in Ethiopia are very limited. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of dyslipidemia and characteristics of lipid profiles among patients living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in Southern Ethiopia.This cross sectional comparative group study was conducted between March and May 2012, and included 113 HIV infected patients treated for a minimum of one year with first-line HAART regimens that included Efavirenz and Nevirapine (HAART group) and others 113 who had never received HAART (pre-HAART group). Serum lipid profiles were determined after overnight fasting and dyslipidemia was assessed according to the United State National Cholesterol Education program-III guideline. For statistical analysis Chi-square, student's t-test, and logistic regression were used using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 20.Ninety-three (82.3%) of HAART and 87 (76.9%) pre-HAART patients had at least one laboratory abnormality, which is compatible with a diagnosis of dyslipidemia. Total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dl occurred in 43.4% of HAART and 15.9% pre-HAART patients (p=<0.0001), whereas HDL-cholesterol below 40 mg/dl occurred in 43.4% and in 63.7% respectively, (p=0.002). The LDL-cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl occurred in 33.6% of HAART and 15% pre-HAART patients (p=0.001), while triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dl occurred in 55.8% and 31.0% respectively, (p=0.001). Receiving of HAART was significantly and positively associated with raised total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. The adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of HAART-treated vs. pre-HAART was 3.80 (1.34-6.55) for total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dl; 2.64 (1.31-5.32) for LDL- cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl and 2.50 (1.41-4.42) for triglycerides ≥150 mg/dl.Use of first-line antiretroviral therapy regimens that contain Efavirenz and Nevirapine were associated with raised total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, an established atherogenic lipid profiles. Lipid profiles should be performed at baseline before commencement of antiretroviral therapy and then periodically through treatment follow-up to monitor any rising trends.",

    "abstract": "Cobicistat is an alternative pharmacoenhancer to ritonavir. In healthy volunteers, darunavir exposure was comparable when darunavir 800 mg once daily was co-administered with cobicistat 150 mg once daily (as single agents or a fixed-dose combination) vs. with ritonavir 100 mg once daily. This 48-week, Phase IIIb, single-arm, US multicenter study (NCT01440569) evaluated safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily (as single agents) plus two investigator-selected nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) in HIV-1-infected adults. Patients had no darunavir resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), plasma viral load (VL) ≥1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, eGFR ≥80 ml/min and genotypic sensitivity to the two N[t]RTIs. The primary endpoint was any treatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) through Week 24. The majority of the 313 intent-to-treat patients were treatment-naïve (295/313; 94%), male (89%), White (60%) and received a tenofovir-based regimen (99%). Median baseline VL and CD4+ count overall were 4.8 log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml and 361 cells/mm3, respectively. Overall, 86% of patients (268/313) completed the study. The majority of discontinuations were for AEs (15/313; 5%). The incidence of treatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 AEs regardless of causality was 6% through Week 24 and 8% through Week 48. Most common AEs through Week 48 were diarrhea (27%) and nausea (23%), which were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Week 48 virologic response rates (% with VL <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml; Snapshot analysis) were 81% overall and 83% in treatment-naïve patients; median increases in CD4+ count at 48 weeks were 167 and 169 cells/mm3, respectively. Of 15/313 patients who met the criteria for resistance analysis, one developed a darunavir RAM as a mixture with wild-type (I84I/V), without phenotypic resistance to darunavir. The mean population pharmacokinetic-derived darunavir areas under the plasma concentration–time curve were 102,000 overall and 100,620 ng•h/ml in treatment-naïve patients. No clinically relevant relationships were seen between darunavir exposure and virologic response, AEs or laboratory parameters. Darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily was generally well tolerated through Week 48, with no new safety concerns. Pharmacokinetics, virologic and immunologic responses for darunavir/cobicistat were similar to previous data for darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily.",

    "abstract": "Immune restoration is often incomplete after ART in HIV patients, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We studied the incidence and probability of CD4/CD8 normalization in an adult Thai HIV cohort and explored the predictive value of the ratio for developing of non-AIDS defining events (NAEs).We analyzed data from HIV-infected Thai adults between 1996 and 2017 in the HIV-NAT 006 prospective long-term cohort in Bangkok, Thailand. Normalization was defined as CD4/CD8 ratio ≥ 1 on two consecutive visits, and normalization probability was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. NAEs were a composite endpoint including cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, non-AIDS defining malignancies and death. Multivariate Cox regression was used to evaluate demographic, disease and treatment characteristics associated with CD4/CD8 ratio normalization and NAEs.A total of 800 ART-naïve patients with baseline CD4/CD8 ratio of < 0.8 who started combination ART, and had sustained virological suppression were enrolled. Participants were on ART for a median of 8.9 years and virologically suppressed for 6.1 years. The probabilities of CD4/CD8 normalization at 2, 5 and 10 years after virological suppression were 5.1%, 18.6% and 39.1%, respectively. Factors associated with normalization in multivariate analysis were female sex (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.47, 95% CI 1.71-3.56, p < 0.001) and baseline CD4 counts ≥ 350 cells/mm3 (HR: 3.62, 95% CI 2.36-5.55), p < 0.001) vs. < 200 cells/mm3 as reference. The second analysis explored the predictive value of CD4/CD8 ratio for NAEs. Older age (HR: 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13, p < 0.01) and current CD4/CD8 ratio < 0.3 (HR: 3.02, 95% CI 1.27-7.21, p = 0.01) or between 0.3 and 0.45 (HR: 2.03, 95% CI 1.03-3.98, p = 0.04) vs. > 0.45 were independently associated with higher risk of progression to NAEs in the multivariate analysis.Our findings showed that complete immune recovery is uncommon in an Asian setting and earlier ART initiation at higher CD4 counts may have increased the ratio sooner. The findings demonstrate the use of CD4/CD8 ratio as a prognostic marker for clinical progression of NAEs. Trial registration HIV-NAT 006 cohort, clinical trial number: NCT00411983.",

The majority of new infections are transmitted heterosexually, and women have consistently been found to be more susceptible to HIV-1 infection during heterosexual intercourse compared to men. This emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of how the microenvironment in the female genital tract (FGT) could influence HIV-1 acquisition. This short review focuses on our current understanding of the interplay between estrogen, progesterone, and the cervicovaginal microbiome and their immunomodulatory effects on the FGT. The role of hormonal contraceptives and bacterial vaginosis on tissue inflammation, T cell immunity and HIV-1 susceptibility is discussed. Taken together, this review provides valuable information for the future development of multi-purpose interventions to prevent HIV-1 infection in women.",

    "abstract": "The risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) from some rural parts of Africa is not well known. We assessed CVD risk factors, the estimated 5-year Data collection on adverse effects of anti-HIV drugs (DA.) risk score and the 10-year Framingham risk score in persons with HIV infection on ART in a rural area in South Africa. A cross-sectional study in which the data on demographic, lifestyle, and chronic disease were collected using the World Health Organization Stepwise approach to surveillance questionnaire. Biochemical parameters were tested using standard biochemical methods. CD4 counts were performed using PIMA analyser and viral load was tested using the branched deoxyribonucleic acid technique. Student t test and Chi square test were used on continuous and categorical variables respectively. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze predictors of CVD risk factors. Estimates of 5 and 10-year CVD risk were calculated using online tools. The Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to assess the agreement between CVD risk equations. The mean age of participants was 44.8 ± 11.8 years; 79.9 % were females. Most of the participants (85 %) had an undetectable viral load and a mean CD4 count of 462 ± 235 cell/mm3. The most common CVD risk factors were low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (43.8 %), hypercholesterolaemia (33.2 %) and a high Apolipoprotein (Apo) B/ApoA ratio (45.4 %).Using the Framingham equation, 6.7 % of participants had a moderate to high 10-year CVD risk while the DAD risk equation showed that 31.1 % of participants had a moderate to high 5-year CVD risk. Most participants had a low CVD risk by both risk equations. The level of agreement between the two risk equations was 73.8 % (k = 0.23; 95 % CI 0.10–0.35; p value 0.001). CVD risk factors were common among this rural population on ART. The high proportion of participants with a moderate to high CVD risk, observed with the DAD risk equation, clearly represents a considerable health burden that can possibly be reduced by increasing educational programs on CVD prevention for people on ART. There is however a need to develop and evaluate a race/ethnicity-specific CVD risk estimation tool for HIV infected Africans.",

However, in Ghana, accurate estimates of the prevalence of HIV/HBV coinfection needed to inform policy decisions and the design of public health interventions are currently lacking. In this study, our aim was to determine the HIV/HBV coinfection prevalence rate in Ghana. Primary studies reporting prevalence of HIV/HBV coinfection in Ghana were retrieved through searches conducted in PubMed, science direct, Google scholar and Africa journals online (AJOL) databases. The websites of the Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Service were also searched for related reports or reviews. Additionally, the online repository of two leading Ghanaian universities were searched to identify unpublished thesis related to the subject. All online searches were conducted between 01/03/2016 and 12/03/2016. Further searches were conducted through reference screening of retrieved papers. Twelve (12) studies published between 1999 and 2016 and conducted across seven (7) regions of Ghana were included in this review. The three (3) regions with no studies' representation were Upper East, Upper West and Central regions. The 12 included studies involved a total of 8162 HIV patients. The reported HIV/HBV coinfection prevalence rates ranged from 2.4 to 41.7 %. The pooled HIV/HBV coinfection prevalence rate was determined as 13.6 % (95 % CI 10.2–16.8 %; P < 0.001). In Ghana, about one in seven HIV patients may be also be chronically infected with HBV. Preventive interventions and strategic policy directions including systematic screening of all newly diagnosed HIV cases for coinfection will be needed, so as to improve management strategies for HBV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) implementation.",

    "abstract": "The life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLHIV) has dramatically improved with effective and well-tolerated antiretroviral therapy. This presents a new challenge in caring for this patient population, with up to 28% of older PLHIV being identified as frail. Studies suggest that the prevalence of frailty is higher in PLHIV compared to the general population, and that the onset of frailty occurs at an earlier age. Frail individuals often present with multiple and non-specific health complaints, fluctuating disability, falls and delirium, and are at higher risk for multiple adverse outcomes, post-operative complications, poor responses to vaccination and functional decline. They tend to require longer hospital admissions, are more likely to require nursing home care, and are at greater risk of mortality. The degree of frailty can fluctuate over time. Limited evidence exists to support the reversal of frailty, but epidemiological evidence suggests that interventions to assess and manage co-morbidities, reducing risk factors such as smoking, increasing exercise and optimising BMI, and improving personal and community resources, are all likely to reduce the risk of frailty. Physicians who care for PLHIV need to recognise and manage frailty in this patient population. This includes an understanding of: when to intervene aggressively in the management of an older patient with a new HIV diagnosis to delay or prevent permanent debility and frailty; when to acknowledge that the patient has become frail; and the role of geriatric medicine in addressing the specific issues and needs of this patient, such as maximising functional ability, preventing falls, reducing social isolation and improving quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been effective in reducing HIV/AIDS related morbidity and mortality. However, the use and uptake of ART has resulted in adverse reactions, due mainly to the medicine's toxicity and interactions with other medicines. The timing of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among these patients is a critical public health issue for antiretroviral (ARV) treatment adherence and retention. Reliable monitoring of HIV patients on ART is through a structured pharmacovigilance surveillance system. However, recurrent nature of these data pose challenges in their analyses. This study aimed at modelling the timing of ADR events in HIV patients on ART using correlated time-to-event models.The data concern 590 HIV patients registered onto the Medunsa National ARV Pharmacovigilance Surveillance System within 6 months of ART initiation between February 2007 and July 2011. Recurrent times of ADRs and baseline characteristics: patient gender, and age, ART regimen, clinic and initiation period were extracted from the data. The recurrent ADR events data were modelled using both shared frailty and marginal models on the five patients' characteristics as covariates.Out of 590 patients, 67% were female, 68% started on regimen: Stavudine, Lamivudine and Efavirenz; 37% had experienced at least one ADR and 67% started ART in 2009-2011. Age (p-value = 0.0210), clinic (p-value < 0.0001) and period of ART initiation (p-value = 0.0002) were significantly associated with timing of first ADR. There was a significantly higher rates of ADR recurrences in patients aged 38-44 years [HR = 2.45; 95% CI = (1.47; 4.10)] vs. 30 years and less, patients taking regimen: Zidovudine, Lamivudine and Nevarapine) vs. regimen: Stavudine, Lamivudine and Efavirenz [HR = 2.09; 95% CI = (1.35; 3.22)], while the rate was lower among those who started ART in 2009-2011 vs. those who initiated in 2007-2008 [HR = 0.55; 95% CI = (0.40; 0.76)].More realistic time-to-event models for recurrent events data have been used to analyse timing of ADR events in HIV patients taking ARV treatment. Age, antiretroviral regimen type and period of initiation of ART were associated with the timing of HIV/AIDS drug related adverse reactions regardless of the analysis model used. This study has public health policy implications in addressing the added morbidity among HIV patients taking ARV treatment in the context of universal scaling up of ARV treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcosis has been one of the most common opportunistic infections and causes of mortality among HIV-infected patients, especially in resource-limited countries. Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common form of cryptococcosis. Laboratory diagnosis of cryptococcosis includes direct microscopic examination, isolation of Cryptococcus from a clinical specimen, and detection of cryptococcal antigen. Without appropriate treatment, cryptococcosis is fatal. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to treatment success. Treatment of cryptococcosis consists of three main aspects: antifungal therapy, intracranial pressure management for cryptococcal meningitis, and restoration of immune function with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Optimal integration of these three aspects is crucial to achieving successful treatment and reducing the mortality. Antifungal therapy consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. A combination of two drugs, i.e. amphotericin B plus flucytosine or fluconazole, is preferred in the induction phase. Fluconazole monotherapy is recommended during consolidation and maintenance phases. In cryptococcal meningitis, intracranial pressure rises along with CSF fungal burden and is associated with morbidity and mortality. Aggressive control of intracranial pressure should be done. Management options include therapeutic lumbar puncture, lumbar drain insertion, ventriculostomy, or ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Medical treatment such as corticosteroids, mannitol, and acetazolamide are ineffective and should not be used. ART has proven to have a great impact on survival rates among HIV-infected patients with cryptococcosis. The time to start ART in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcosis has to be deferred until 5 weeks after the start of antifungal therapy. In general, any effective ART regimen is acceptable. Potential drug interactions between antiretroviral agents and amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole are minimal. Of most potential clinical relevance is the concomitant use of fluconazole and nevirapine. Concomitant use of these two drugs should be cautious, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events, including hepatotoxicity. Overlapping toxicities of antifungal and antiretroviral drugs and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome are not uncommon. Early recognition and appropriate management of these consequences can reinforce the successful integrated therapy in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcosis.",

    "abstract": "People with HIV with access to treatment are growing older and living healthier lives than in the past, and while health improvements and increased survival rates are welcome, the psychological and social consequences and quality of life of ageing are complex for this group. Understanding how ageing, HIV and quality of life intersect is key to developing effective interventions to improve QoL.One hundred people with HIV over the age of 50 (range 50-87, mean 58), were recruited through HIV community organizations, and clinics, and included men who have sex with men (MSM), and Black African and White heterosexual men and women. The WHOQOL-HIV BREF was used, as well as the Every Day Memory Questionnaire, and additional questions on anxiety and depression to supplement the WHOQOL.While most rated their quality of life (QoL) positively, bivariate analysis showed that better QoL (total score and most domains) was strongly associated with being a man; in a relationship; in paid employment; having higher level of income; not on benefits, and to a lesser degree with being MSM, having higher level of education, and diagnosed after the age of 40. Multivariate analysis showed that not being on benefits was the variable most consistently associated with better quality of life, as was being partnered. Concerns about everyday memory difficulties, and anxiety and depression scores were strong predictors of poorer quality of life.While the cross-sectional nature of the investigation could not establish that the associations were causal, the findings indicate that concerns about memory difficulties, anxiety and depression, as well as gender, ethnicity, financial factors, and relationship status, are important contributors to QoL in this group. These findings point towards the need for further research to clarify the mechanisms through which the factors identified here affect QoL, and to identify possible interventions to improve the QoL of older people living with HIV.",

The uptake of HLA-B*57:01 screening and incidence of hypersensitivity reaction were assessed in a prospective clinical cohort in the United States to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. We included all patients initiating an abacavir-containing regimen for the first time in the pre-HLA-B*57:01 screening period (January 1, 1999 to June 14, 2008) or the post-HLA-B*57:01 screening period (June 15, 2008 to January 1, 2016). Yearly incidence of both HLA-B*57:01 screening and physician panel-adjudicated hypersensitivity reactions were calculated and compared. Of the 9619 patients eligible for the study, 33% initiated abacavir in the pre-screening period and 67% in the post-screening period. Incidence of HLA-B*57:01 screening prior to abacavir initiation increased from 43% in 2009 to 84% in 2015. The incidence of definite or probable hypersensitivity reactions decreased from 1.3% in the pre-screening period to 0.8% in 2009 and further to 0.2% in 2015 in the post-screening period. Frequency of HLA-B*57:01 screening increased steadily since its first inclusion in treatment guidelines in the United States. This increase in screening was accompanied by a decreasing incidence of definite or probable hypersensitivity reactions over the same period. However, a considerable proportion of patients initiating abacavir were not screened, representing a failed opportunity to prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Where HLA-B*57:01 screening is standard of care, patients should be confirmed negative for this allele before starting abacavir treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background After the launching of the « Test &amp; Treat » strategy and the wider accessibility to viral load (VL), evaluating virological success (VS) would help in meeting the UNAIDS targets by 2020 in Cameroon. Setting and methods Cross-sectional study conducted in the Chantal BIYA International Reference Centre for research on HIV/AIDS prevention and management (CIRCB), Yaoundé, Cameroon; data generated between October 2016 and August 2017 amongst adults, adolescents and children at 12, 24, 36 and ≥ 48 months on ART. VS was defined as &lt; 1000 copies/mL of blood plasma and controlled viremia as VL &lt; 50 copies/mL. Data were analysed by SPSS; p &lt; 0.05 considered as significant. Results 1946 patients (70% female) were enrolled (1800 adults, 105 adolescents, 41 children); 1841 were on NNRTI-based and 105 on PI-based therapy; with 346 patients at M12, 270 at M24, 205 at M36 and 1125 at ≥ M48. The median (IQR) duration on was 48 months (24–48). Overall, VS was 79.4% (95% CI 77.6–81.2) and 67.1% (95% CI 64.9–69.1) had controlled viral replication. On NNRTI-based, VS was 79.9% vs. 71.4% on PIs-based, p = 0.003. By ART duration, VS was 84.1% (M12), 85.9% (M24), 75.1% (M36) and 77.2% (≥ M48), p = 0.001. By age, VS was 75.6% (children), 53.3% (adolescents) and 81.1% (adults), p &lt; 0.001. Conclusions In this sub-population of patients receiving ART in Cameroon, about 80% might be experiencing VS, with declining performance at adolescence, with NNRTI-based regimens, and as from 36 months on ART. Thus, improving VS may require an adapted adherence support mechanism, especially for adolescents with long-term treatment in resource-limited settings.",

    "abstract": "Hypogonadism is common among HIV-infected men, even among men receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Our objective in this study was to determine the prevalence of biochemical hypogonadism among HIV-infected men compared with HIV-uninfected controls. We also examined the use of free testosterone (FT) and total testosterone (TT) measurements in the assessment of biochemical hypogonadism in HIV-infected and -uninfected men.This was a cross-sectional analysis from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). TT levels were measured from archived serum using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. FT was calculated from TT and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (measured by radioimmunoassay) using the Vermeulen equation. Biochemical hypogonadism was defined as having low TT, low FT, or both.Of 945 men in the MACS Cardiovascular Substudy, T assays were not performed in 89 because of insufficient/no stored serum (n = 18) or use of T replacement therapy (TRT) (n = 71). 530 men had morning (AM) T measurements; 364 (68.7%) were HIV-infected. The prevalence of biochemical hypogonadism was similar in HIV-infected (34/364 = 9.3%) and HIV-uninfected (12/166 = 7.2%) men. Prevalence of hypogonadism, when men on TRT (n = 71) were included in the group of hypogonadal men, was higher in HIV-infected (104/434 = 24.0%) compared with HIV-uninfected (13/167 = 7.8%) men (p < 0.0001). Of 34 HIV-infected men with biochemical hypogonadism not on TRT, 11 (32.4%) had normal TT, but low FT. Of 12 HIV-uninfected men with biochemical hypogonadism not on TRT, none were in this category (p = 0.04) - all had low TT.The prevalence of biochemical hypogonadism in our sample of HIV-infected men was approximately 10%, with a substantial proportion of these men having a normal TT, but low FT. The measurement of AM FT, rather than TT, in the assessment of hypogonadism in HIV-infected men will likely increase diagnostic sensitivity and should be recommended.",

    "abstract": "Regular monitoring of HIV patients who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) is required to ensure patient benefits and the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of ART programs. Prompted by WHO recommendations for expansion and decentralization of HIV treatment and care in low and middle income countries, we conducted a systematic review to assess the feasibility of treatment monitoring in these settings. A comprehensive search strategy was developed using a combination of MeSH and free text terms relevant to HIV treatment and care, health service delivery, health service accessibility, decentralization and other relevant terms. Five electronic databases and two conference websites were searched to identify relevant studies conducted in LMICs, published in English between Jan 2006 and Dec 2015. Outcomes of interest included the proportion of patients who received treatment monitoring and health system factors related to monitoring of patients on ART under decentralized HIV service delivery models. From 5363 records retrieved, twenty studies were included in the review; all but one was conducted in sub-Saharan African countries. The majority of studies (15/20) had relatively short follow-up duration (≤24 months), and only two studies were specifically designed to assess treatment monitoring practices. The most frequently studied follow-up period was 12 months and a wide range of treatment monitoring coverage was observed. The reported proportions of patients on ART who received CD4 monitoring ranged from very low (6%; N = 2145) to very high (95%; N = 488). The median uptake of viral load monitoring was 86% with studies in program settings reporting coverage as low as 14%. Overall, the longer the follow-up period, the lower the proportion of patients who received regular monitoring tests; and programs in rural areas reported low coverage of laboratory monitoring. Moreover, uptake in the context of research had significantly better where monitoring was done by dedicated research staff. In the absence of point of care (POC) testing, the limited capacity for blood sample transportation between clinic and laboratory and poor quality of nursing staff were identified as a major barrier for treatment monitoring practice. There is a paucity of data on the uptake of treatment monitoring, particularly with longer-term follow-up. Wide variation in access to both virological and immunological regular monitoring was observed, with some clinics in well-resourced settings supported by external donors achieving high coverage. The feasibility of treatment monitoring, particularly in decentralized settings of HIV treatment and care may thus be of concern and requires further study. Significant investment in POC diagnostic technologies and, improving the quality of and training for nursing staff is required to ensure effective scale up of ART programs towards the targets of 90-90-90 by the year 2020.",

Single or un-blinded studies reporting a direct comparison between STR and MTR were eligible for the meta-analysis. Double-blinded studies were excluded due to lack of difference in pill burden between cohorts. The key outcomes of interest included: adherence rates/proportion meeting target, efficacy, safety/tolerability, non-clinical and economic outcomes.After screening 63 full-text articles and posters, 14 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. The analysis showed that patients taking STR had improved outcomes over those taking MTR. Patients were significantly more adherent regardless of daily dosing frequency (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, p < 0.001) and were more likely to achieve virological suppression (relative risk [RR]: 1.05, p = 0.002). There was a trend toward a lower discontinuation risk in the STR cohort, together with reported higher therapy satisfaction, better symptom control, improved health status, reduced healthcare resource utilization and demonstrated cost-effectiveness compared to MTR. There were no differences in CD4 cell count increase (at 48 weeks) or safety outcomes.The findings of this study confirm previously reported preliminary findings of the advantages of STR over MTR for HIV treatment in adherence, therapy continuation, viral suppression, tolerability, quality of life improvement, cost-effectiveness and healthcare resource utilization.",

Dysregulation of gut microbiota composition, also known as dysbiosis, is involved in the clinical outcome of diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer, aging and HIV infection. Gut dysbiosis and inflammation persist in people living with HIV (PLWH) despite receiving antiretroviral therapy, further contributing to non-AIDS comorbidities. Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic agent, has been found to benefit microbiota composition, promote gut barrier integrity and reduce inflammation in human and animal models of diabetes. Inspired by the effect of metformin on diabetes-related gut dysbiosis, we herein critically review the relevance of metformin to control inflammation in PLWH. Metformin may improve gut microbiota composition, in turn reducing inflammation and risk of non-AIDS comorbidities. This review will pave the way towards innovative strategies to counteract dysregulated microbiota and improve the lives of PLWH.",

    "abstract": "There are approximately 72,000 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in Peru. Non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most important factor for therapeutic failure and the development of resistance. Peru has achieved moderate progress in meeting the 90-90-90 targets, but only 60% of PLHIV receiving ART are virally suppressed. The purpose of this study was to understand ART adherence in the Peruvian context, including developing sociodemographic and clinical profiles, evaluating the clinical management strategies, and analyzing the relationships between the variables and adherence of PLHIV managed at a regional HIV clinic in Lambayeque Province (Northern Peru). This was a cross-sectional study with 180 PLHIV adults, non-randomly but consecutively selected with self-reported ART compliance (78.2% of the eligible population). The PLHIV profile (PLHIV-Pro) and the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ) were used to collect sociodemographic information, clinical variables, and data specific to ART adherence. Descriptive analysis of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics was performed. Bivariate analysis was performed with the Mann–Whitney test, Chi square test, and Yates correction. The 180 PLHIV sample included 78.9% men, 49.4% heterosexual, 45% with a detectable HIV-1 viral load less than 40 copies/ml, 58.3% not consistently adherent, and only 26.1% receiving Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Efavirenz. Risk factors significant for non-adherence included concurrent tuberculosis, discomfort with the ART regime, and previous pauses in ART. Multivariate analysis of nested models indicated having children is a protector factor for adherence. Self-reported adherence appeared to be low and the use of first-line therapy is not being prescribed homogeneously. Factors associated with nonadherence are both medical and behavioral, such as having tuberculosis, pausing ART, or experiencing discomfort with ART. The Peruvian government needs to update national technical standards, monitor medication availability, and provide education to health care professionals in alignment with evidence-based guidelines and international recommendations. Instruments to measure adherence need to be developed and evaluated for use in Latin America.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The key cause of HIV transmission is failure to provide adequate information about HIV/AIDS which is a substantial public health issue in low and middle-income countries. While global health coverage continues, there is still little understanding of HIV/AIDS among women of reproductive age (15–49 years) in Ethiopia. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS among women of reproductive age in Ethiopia. Methods A secondary data analysis was employed using the 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey data. Data were extracted about comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS among women of reproductive age. We used multi-variable mixed-effect binary logistic regression to identify factors associated with comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS among women of reproductive age. The adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to declare statistical significance. Results We found that having primary (AOR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.56–1.97),secondary (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI 2.33–3.22), and higher (AOR = 4.07, 95% CI 3.32–4.99) educational statuses, being in highest wealth quintiles; richer (AOR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.01–1.43) and richest (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.22–1.87), knowing the place for HIV test (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.88–2.42), use of traditional contraceptive method (AOR = 1.93,95% CI 1.12–3.35), female household head (AOR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.07–1.31), watching television (AOR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.06–1.41) and own mobile phone (AOR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05–1.33) were positively associated with comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS among women of reproductive age in Ethiopia. Conclusion Women with higher education and higher wealth quintiles, knowing the place of HIV test, watching television, a traditional contraceptive method use, having a mobile phone and being in female headed household were positively associated with comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS among women of reproductive age in Ethiopia. Programs working on HIV/AIDS should target women based on the identified factors so as to scale up their comprehensive knowledge towards HIV/AIDS. In this context, the media should actively contribute to raising awareness of HIV/AIDS.",

In youth MSM (aged 15-24 years), the incidence of HIV infection has substantially increased. However, data on HIV risk, risk perception and HIV testing and counseling (HTC) uptake among youth MSM in hotspots are limited.A subanalysis of a prospective study among Thai MSM attending a gay sauna was conducted. HIV risk and risk perception were assessed by an anonymous survey. The MSM were categorized as having actual \"low-risk\", \"moderate-risk\" and \"high-risk\" for HIV acquisition based on the validated study risk categorization tool. HTC was provided on-site with result notification within 1 h. HIV care establishment appointment was arranged by the counselors for HIV-infected participants. Care engagement within 1 year of diagnosis was subsequently assessed.There were 358 MSM participants; 87 (24%) were youth MSM. Comparing to other MSM, youth MSM had significantly higher median number of lifetime sexual partners [2 (IQR 1-9) vs. 1 (IQR 0-1); P < 0.001), were more-likely to ever exchange sex for money (44% vs. 9%; P < 0.001) and have sexual partner who exchanged sex for money (8% vs. 1%; P < 0.001). Rates of consistent condom use in the past 3 months for anal, oral and vaginal sexes were low and not significantly different between youth and other MSM (51% vs. 61%, 26% vs. 35% and 72% vs. 61%, respectively). By using the study risk categorization tool, there were 68 youth MSM with moderate or high-risk for HIV acquisition, of which 43 (63%) had false perception of low HIV risk. Youth MSM were more likely than other MSM to accept HTC [68% vs. 33%, P < 0.001)] and to be first-time testers (42% vs. 28%, P = 0.07). By HTC, the rates of HIV infection tended to be higher among youth MSM comparing to other MSM [14/59 (24%) vs. 11/89 (12%); P = 0.07]. Among the 14 youth MSM newly-diagnosed with HIV infection, only 6 (43%) showed-up for continuity care after 1-year follow-up.Youth MSM had substantial high HIV risk, false perception of low HIV risk and low rate of care engagement but demonstrated considerable rate of HTC uptake. Strategies to improve access to HTC, risk perception and linkage to care are needed for HIV prevention and management among the youth MSM.",

Little is known about the barriers and facilitators of optimal ART adherence among heterosexual HIV-positive men. Methods Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to test a theory-derived model of ART adherence using data from a cross-sectional sample of 317 HIV-positive self-identified heterosexual men residing in New York City. We assessed a conceptual model in which mental health (depression, anxiety) and substance use dependence mediated the effects of socio-structural factors (HIV-related stigma, social support) on ART adherence, and subsequently, undetectable viral load. Results Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that men who reported higher levels of HIV-related stigma tended to experience higher levels of general anxiety, which in turn was associated with reduced probability of optimal ART adherence. Moreover, men who reported higher levels of social support tended to exhibit less dependence on illicit substance use, which in turn was associated with increased probability of optimal ART adherence. African-American men reported lower ART adherence compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions Our findings support the hypothesis that substance use dependence and mental health problems, particularly anxiety, may be primary drivers of suboptimal ART adherence among heterosexual men, and that socio-structural factors such as HIV-related stigma and social support are potential modifiable antecedents of these drivers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Antiretroviral treatment has played a pivotal role in the reduction of HIV/AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. However, treatment options can be impaired by the development of antiretroviral treatment failure. Regular monitoring of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus treatment outcome via viral load tests is the key approach. There is a scarcity of information about HIV treatment failure and risk factors in the study area. Therefore, the study was aimed to assess antiretroviral treatment failure and associated factors among patients on first-line antiretroviral treatment at Tefera Hailu Memorial Hospital, Sekota, northeast Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 295 patients on first-line antiretroviral treatment from Nov. 2018 to Apr. 2019. Socio-demographic and clinical variables were collected using a pretested questionnaire, and blood specimen was collected for PCR viral load and CD4 + cell count estimation. Data were entered into Epi-Info and exported to SPSS for analysis. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify associated factors, and P value &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results Of the 295 subjects on first-line ART, 49 (16.6%) and 18 (6.1%) experienced virological and immunological failures, respectively. The failure of the former was associated with poor adherence (AOR: 6.367, P &lt; 0.001), CD4 + count &lt; 500 cells/µL (AOR: 4.78, P = 0.031) and shorter (6–24 months) duration on ART (AOR: 0.48, P = 0.048), while poor treatment adherence (AOR: 11.51, P = 0.012) and drug interruption (AOR: 6.374, P = 0.039) were the independent risk factors for latter. Immunological tests to predict virological failures showed as sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 20.4%, 96.7%, 55.5%, and 86.0%, respectively. Conclusions The rate of ART failure was considerably high. Poor adherence, low CD4 + count, prolonged ART, and drug interruption were found to be the most predictor variables for virological and immunological failures. The discrimination power of the immunological parameter was low in comparison to virological measurements as standard methods. Therefore, the study highlighted the need for more attention and efforts to curb associated factors and maximize virological tests for monitoring treatment failures.",

Despite the effort to contain the HIV/AIDS epidemic, LP has remained an impediment to individual immune reconstitution and public health. Objective This review aimed to estimate the prevalence and determine the factors associated with late presentation to HIV/AIDS care. Methods We searched PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Wanfang, and Weipu database for articles published from 2010 to 2020. We utilized I 2 statistics and Q -test to estimate heterogeneity between studies. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to calculate the aggregate odds ratio of late presentation to HIV/AIDS care. Results Of 9563 titles and abstracts retrieved, 189 were identified as potentially eligible and 39 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of late presentation to HIV/AIDS care was 43.26%. The major risk factors were patients ≥ 50 years old ( OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.85–2.58; I 2 = 97.44%), married ( OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.35–1.68; I 2 = 96.58%), with heterosexual contact as risk factor for infection ( OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.73–2.11; I 2 = 90.74%) and diagnosed in medical institutions ( OR = 2.35,95% CI: 2.11–2.62; I 2 = 96.05%). In middle or low HIV prevalence areas, patients ≥ 50 years old ( P = 0.01), married ( P &lt; 0.01) and diagnosed in medical institutions ( P = 0.01) were more likely to be presented late than in high prevalence areas. From 2016–2020, the OR of patients who were married and diagnosed in medical facilities were significantly lower than before ( P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion Patients ≥ 50 years old, married, with heterosexual contact as risk factor for infection, and diagnosed in medical institutions were risk factors of LP. Gender had no significant relationship with LP. In middle or low prevalence areas, patients who were ≥ 50 years old, married, and diagnosed in medical institutions were more likely to be presented late than in other areas. Married patients and those diagnosed in medical institutions after 2015 have a lower risk of LP than before.",

    "abstract": "Older People Living with HIV (OPWH) combine both aging and HIV-infection features, resulting in ageism, stigma, social isolation, and low quality of life. This context brings up new challenges for healthcare professionals, who now must aid patients with a significant comorbidity burden and polypharmacy treatments. OPWH opinion on their health management is hardly ever considered as a variable to study, though it would help to understand their needs on dissimilar settings.We performed a cross-sectional, comparative study including patients living with HIV aged ≥50 years old from multiple centers worldwide and gave them a survey addressing their perception on overall health issues, psychological problems, social activities, geriatric conditions, and opinions on healthcare. Data was analyzed through Chisquared tests sorting by geographical regions, age groups, or both.We organized 680 participants data by location (Center and South America [CSA], Western Europe [WE], Africa, Eastern Europe and Israel [EEI]) and by age groups (50- 55, 56-65, 66-75, >75). In EEI, HIV serostatus socializing and reaching undetectable viral load were the main problems. CSA participants are the least satisfied regarding their healthcare, and a great part of them are not retired. Africans show the best health perception, have financial problems, and fancy their HIV doctors. WE is the most developed region studied and their participants report the best scores. Moreover, older age groups tend to live alone, have a lower perception of psychological problems, and reduced social life.Patients' opinions outline region- and age-specific unmet needs. In EEI, socializing HIV and reaching undetectable viral load were the main concerns. CSA low satisfaction outcomes might reflect high expectations or profound inequities in the region. African participants results mirror a system where general health is hard to achieve, but HIV clinics are much more appealing to them. WE is the most satisfied region about their healthcare. In this context, age-specific information, education and counseling programs (i.e. Patient Reported Outcomes, Patient Centered Care, multidisciplinary teams) are needed to promote physical and mental health among older adults living with HIV/AIDS. This is crucial for improving health-related quality of life and patient's satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Following reports of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) experienced Ugandan people living with HIV (PLHIV) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis weeks to months following a switch to dolutegravir (DTG), the Uganda Ministry of Health recommended withholding DTG in both ART naïve and experienced PLHIV with diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as well as 3-monthly blood glucose monitoring for patients with T2DM risk factors. We sought to determine if the risk of T2DM is indeed heightened in nondiabetic ART naïve Ugandan PLHIV over the first 48 weeks on DTG. Methods Between January and October 2021, 243 PLHIV without T2DM were initiated on DTG based ART for 48 weeks. Two-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (2-h OGTT) were performed at baseline, 12, and 36 weeks; fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured at 24 and 48 weeks. The primary outcome was the incidence of T2DM. Secondary outcomes included: incidence of pre-Diabetes Mellitus (pre-DM), median change in FBG from baseline to week 48 and 2-h blood glucose (2hBG) from baseline to week 36. Linear regression models were used to determine adjusted differences in FBG and 2hBG from baseline to weeks 48 and 36 respectively. Results The incidence of T2DM was 4 cases per 1000 PY (1/243) and pre-DM, 240 cases per 1000 person years (PY) (54/243). There was a significant increase in FBG from baseline to week 48 [median change from baseline (FBG): 3.6 mg/dl, interquartile range (IQR): − 3.6, 7.2, p -value ( p ) = 0.005] and significant reduction in 2hBG (2hBG: − 7.26 mg/dl, IQR: − 21.6, 14.4, p = 0.024) at week 36. A high CD4 count and increased waist circumference were associated with 2hBG increase at week 36. Conclusion We demonstrated a low incidence of T2DM in Ugandan ART-naïve patients receiving DTG. We also demonstrated that longitudinal changes in BG were independent of conventional risk factors of T2DM in the first 48 weeks of therapy. Restricting the use of dolutegravir in Ugandan ART naïve patients perceived to be high risk for diabetes mellitus may be unwarranted.",

This study determines the social demographic and sexual behaviour driving the use of HIV self-test kits. The study used secondary data obtained from Tanzania DHS-MIS 2022. The survey uses a stratified two-stage sample design. The first stage involved the selection of clusters consisting of enumeration areas, and in the second stage of sampling, 26 households were selected from each cluster. The mean age = 28.6 years. Usage of HIV self-test kits was found to be low (3.9%). The odds of using HIV self-test kits were 2.2 and 6.6 times more likely among those with primary (aOR = 2.2, 95%CI = 2.2–2.3) and secondary (aOR = 6.6, 95%CI 6.6–6.7) education compared to those without education respectively. As age increases, the odds of using HIV self-test kits increases. Men residing in rural areas were about 40% less likely to use HIV self-test kits compared to those dwelling in urban areas (aOR = 0.6, P < 0.0001). Significant demographic and sexual behaviour factors associated with the usage of HIV self-test kits include sex of household head, education level, marital status, wealth status, age, ever heard of sexually transmitted infection and condom use during sexual intercourse. HIV self-test kits were used more in urban areas than in rural areas. It is essential to raise awareness and improve access to HIV self-test kits for less informed populations, such as those living in rural areas.",

    "abstract": "Early detection and initiation of care is crucial to the survival and long-term well-being of children living with HIV (CLHIV). However, there remain challenges regarding early testing and linking of CLHIV for early treatment. This study examines the progress made towards achieving the 95-95-95 HIV indicators and associated factors among CLHIV < 15 years in South Africa. The data was collected as part of the 2017 cross-sectional, multistage cluster randomized population-based household National HIV survey. Age-appropriate structured questionnaires were utilized to gather sociodemographic data, HIV-related knowledge, risk behaviours, and health-related information. Blood samples were collected to test for HIV serology, viral load suppression, and antiretroviral usage. Backward stepwise multivariable generalized linear regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with the 95-95-95 HIV indicators. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are shown, and p < 0.05 indicates statistical significance. A total of 12,237 CLHIV < 15 years were included (median 8 years, interquartile range 4–11 years). HIV prevalence was 2.8% (95% CI: 2.4–3.3). Overall, 40.0% of the CLHIV were tested and knew their status (first 95%), and among these, 72.6% (95% CI: 61.7–81.3) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (second 95%), and 95.0% (95% CI: 88.4–97.9) of these were virally suppressed (third 95%). Among CLHIV, the odds of testing and knowing the HIV-positive status were significantly higher among children whose health was rated as fair/poor than excellent/good [AOR = 1.32 (95%CI: 1.05–1.67), p = 0.022], and were significantly lower among females than males [AOR = 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71–0.95), p = 0.009], and were significantly lower among those attending private healthcare facilities than public health facilities [AOR = 0.64 (95% CI:0.57–0.74), p < 0.001]. Among those who knew their HIV-positive status, the odds of being on ART were significantly higher among children residing in farm areas than urban areas [AOR = 1.40 (95% CI:1.05–1.86), p = 0.017], and were significantly lower among children attending private healthcare facilities [AOR = 0.44 (95% CI:0.36–0.54), p < 0.001]. Awareness of HIV status and initiation of treatment in children was low. The findings highlight the need to improve HIV status awareness and disclosure to children. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions and programs tailored for CLHIV in urban areas.",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and the factors associated with HIV testing-seeking behaviors among women of childbearing age in Tanzania. This study used the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey dataset. The study utilized individual recodes (IR) files where data was collected using the Women's Questionnaire to analyze factors influencing HIV testing behavior among women, Descriptive analysis, and bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed and all the data were processed and analyzed using STATA version 17 at 95% CI and significance level P < 0.05. This study included 2531 women with 90.0% having ever tested for HIV while 7.0% had never tested for HIV. Not employed [AOR:0.35, CI (0.20–0.61)] has lower odds of HIV testing than All-year employed status. Rural residents have reduced odds of HIV testing [AOR:0.43, CI (0.21–0.88)] compared to women living in urban areas. Those able to ask their partner to use a condom are more likely to have been tested with increased odds [AOR: 3.52, CI (2.31–5.37)]. Participants with a history of genital discharge [AOR:4.30, CI (1.28–14.46)] and those who don't know their genital discharge history have [AOR: 0.20, CI (0.07–0.55)] are significant for HIV testing. Women who have heard about PrEP but are not uncertain about its approval [AOR: 36.07, CI (3.33–390.25)], respondents who have tested before with HIV testing kits [AOR:35.99, CI (4.00–324.13)] and women who are aware of HIV testing kids but never tested with them before [AOR: 2.80, CI (1.19–6.58)] are predictors of HIV testing seeking behaviors. The government and other concerned agencies should introduce mobile or community-based testing units and subsidize testing costs to reach economically disadvantaged or rural populations. Promote Open Communication on Sexual Health: Public health campaigns should encourage open discussions about sexual health within relationships, emphasizing condom negotiation and mutual health checks as preventive measures. Raise Awareness and Accessibility of HIV Prevention Tools: Expand education on PrEP and HIV self-test kits to improve familiarity and acceptance, which may empower individuals to proactively seek testing. Integrate Sexual Health Screening into Routine Healthcare: Health facilities should incorporate HIV testing when individuals present with symptoms like genital discharge to improve early detection and intervention.",

We searched major databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to 30 August 2024 for observational studies involving PLWH that reported on mpox vaccine acceptance rates. A random-effects model was employed for the meta-analysis, utilizing R software version 4.4. Heterogeneity among the studies was quantified using the I² statistic, and the methodological quality of each study was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Out of 1,123 articles identified, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria and included 7,248 participants. The pooled estimate of the Mpox vaccine acceptance rate was 61.1% (95% CI: 44.2-75.7%), with high heterogeneity (I² = 99%). Additionally, a pooled vaccine hesitancy prevalence was 13.2%, (95% CI: 2.4-48.6%), reflecting substantial variability and had high heterogeneity (I² = 98%). This systematic review and meta-analysis reveal moderate Mpox vaccine acceptance and considerable hesitancy among PLWH. To further increase vaccine uptake and address any remaining hesitancy in this at-risk population, targeted public health strategies and ongoing research are necessary. Strengthening vaccine acceptance is critical to safeguarding PLWH against emerging infectious diseases such as Mpox. Not applicable.",

    "abstract": "Chryseobacterium indologenes is an opportunistic, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacillus increasingly recognized as a cause of hospital-acquired infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Although rare, its intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams and its ability to colonize medical devices pose significant therapeutic challenges. We describe a case of C. indologenes hospital-acquired pneumonia in a 43-year-old HIV-positive patient with multiple comorbidities, including Kaposi sarcoma, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis. The patient was initially admitted with fever and elevated inflammatory markers, and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated. Despite initial improvement, the patient developed respiratory failure, requiring oxygen therapy. A respiratory panel identified Rhinovirus, while sputum culture revealed C. indologenes, resistant to multiple antibiotics but susceptible to levofloxacin. Targeted therapy led to clinical improvement. However, the course was complicated by Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, followed by fatal sepsis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. Our review of the literature identified 71 reported cases, with bacteremia (51%) and pneumonia (29%) as the most common clinical presentations. Medical devices and prolonged antibiotic exposure were key risk factors. While C. indologenes is intrinsically resistant to beta-lactams and carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole demonstrated efficacy in most cases. Emerging therapies, such as cefiderocol, may provide additional options for multidrug-resistant strains. This case highlights the critical need for accurate microbial identification, targeted therapy, and vigilant antimicrobial stewardship to improve outcomes in vulnerable patient populations. C. indologenes infections remain rare but clinically significant in hospitalized patients with immune dysfunction. The pathogen's multidrug resistance profile complicates treatment, necessitating early identification and targeted antimicrobial therapy. Fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and cefiderocol may serve as effective treatment options, emphasizing the importance of susceptibility-guided management.",

    "abstract": "Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces mortality in the developed world, it remains undocumented in resource-poor settings. We assessed the effect of HAART on patient mortality and tuberculosis incidence rate under routine clinical care conditions in Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of HAART on patient mortality and tuberculosis incidence rate under routine clinical care conditions in a resource-limited setting in south Ethiopia. Starting in January 2003, we followed all consecutive adult HIV infected patients who visited the HIV clinic. Since August 2003, we treated patients with HAART. Only basic laboratory services were available.We followed 185 patients in the pre-HAART cohort and 180 patients in the HAART cohort. The mortality rate was 15.4 per 100 person-years of observation (PYO) in the HAART group and tuberculosis incidence rate was 3.7 per 100 PYO. In the pre-HAART group, the mortality rate was 58.1 per 100 PYO and the tuberculosis incidence rate was 11.1 per 100 PYO. HAART resulted in a 65% decline in mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [95%CI] = 0.35 [0.19-0.63]; P < 0.001). Tuberculosis incidence rate was lower in the HAART group (adjusted hazard ratio [95%CI] = 0.11 [0.03-0.48]; P < 0.01). Most of the deaths occurred during the first three months of treatment.HAART improved survival and decreased tuberculosis incidence to a level similar to that achieved in the developed countries during the early years of HAART. However, both the mortality and the tuberculosis incidence rate were much higher in terms of absolute figures in this resource-limited setting. Attention should be paid to the early weeks of treatment when mortality is high. The high tuberculosis incidence rate, when coupled with the improved survival, may lead to increased tuberculosis transmission. This highlights the need for strengthening tuberculosis prevention efforts with the scale-up of treatment programmes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not infrequent as both share same route of exposure. The risk of developing chronic hepatitis B virus is 6%, in general population but can reach 10–20% in HBV/HIV co-infected patients. When compared to general population, the response rate to HBV vaccine in HIV-infected patients is diminished, so previous studies have tried to improve this response using variety of schedules, doses and co-administration of immunomodulators. The purpose of this study was to evaluate two doses of recombinant HBV vaccine (10 or 40 μg), IM at 0, 1 and 6 months. Vaccination response was measured 30–50 days after last dose; titers of &gt;9.9 IU/L were considered positive. Results Seventy-nine patients were included, 48 patients (60.7%) serconverted. Thirty-nine patients (49.3%) received 10 μg vaccine dose, 24 patients (61.5%) seroconverted. Forty patients (50.7%) received 40 μg vaccine dose, 24 (60%) seroconverted. There were no differences between two doses. A statistically significant higher seroconversion rate was found for patients with CD4 cell counts at vaccination ≥ 200 cel/mm3 (33 of 38 patients, 86.8%), compared with those with CD4 &lt; 200 cel/mm3 (15 of 41, 36.6%), [OR 11.44, 95% IC 3.67–35.59, p = 0.003], there were no differences between two vaccine doses. Using the logistic regression model, CD 4 count &lt;200 cel/mm 3 were significantly associated with non serologic response (p = 0.003). None other variables such as gender, age, risk exposure for HIV, viral load, type or duration of HAART or AIDS-defining illness, were asociated with seroconversion. Conclusion In this study, an increase dose of HBV vaccine did not show to increase the rate of response in HIV infected subjects. The only significant findings associated to the response rate was that a CD4 count ≥ 200 cel/mm 3 , we suggest this threshold at which HIV patients should be vaccinated.",

The objective of this study was to determine social, behavioral and biological risk factors of HIV infection among pregnant women in Moshi urban, Tanzania. In 2002 – 2004, consenting women (N = 2654), attending primary health clinics for routine antenatal care were interviewed, examined and biological samples collected for diagnosis of HIV and other sexually transmitted/reproductive tract infections. The prevalence of HIV was 6.9%. The risk for HIV was greater among women whose male partner; had other sexual partners (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 15.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.39–27.20), traveled frequently (AOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.22–2.65) or consumed alcohol daily (AOR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.06–2.67). Other independent predictors of HIV were age, number of sex partners, recent migration, and presence of bacterial vaginosis, genital ulcer, active syphilis and herpes simplex virus type 2. Development of programs that actively involve men in HIV prevention is important in reducing transmission of HIV in this population. Further, interventions that focus on STI control, the mobile population, sexual risk behavior and responsible alcohol use are required.",

Although HIV-related proteins including gp120 and Tat can directly cause oxidant stress and cellular dysfunction, their effects in the lung are unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of HIV-1 transgene expression in rats on alveolar epithelial barrier function. Alveolar epithelial barrier function was assessed by determining lung liquid clearance in vivo and alveolar epithelial monolayer permeability in vitro. Oxidant stress in the alveolar space was determined by measuring the glutathione redox couple by high performance liquid chromatography, and the expression and membrane localization of key tight junction proteins were assessed. Finally, the direct effects of the HIV-related proteins gp120 and Tat on alveolar epithelial barrier formation and tight junction protein expression were determined.HIV-1 transgene expression caused oxidant stress within the alveolar space and impaired epithelial barrier function even though there was no evidence of overt inflammation within the airways. The expression and membrane localization of the tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 and occludin were decreased in alveolar epithelial cells from HIV-1 transgenic rats. Further, treating alveolar epithelial monolayers from wild type rats in vitro with recombinant gp120 or Tat for 24 hours reproduced many of the effects on zonula occludens-1 and occludin expression and membrane localization.Taken together, these data indicate that HIV-related proteins cause oxidant stress and alter the expression of critical tight junction proteins in the alveolar epithelium, resulting in barrier dysfunction.",

Doctors worked in urban and peri-urban HIV/AIDS clinics in Peru, where almost 70% of the nation's HIV patients in need are on treatment. A set of 3D learning scenarios simulating interactive clinical cases was developed and adapted to the Smartphones for a continuing medical education program lasting 3 months. A mobile educational platform supporting learning events tracked participant learning progress. A discussion forum accessible via mobile connected participants to a group of HIV specialists available for back-up of the medical information. Learning outcomes were verified through mobile quizzes using multiple choice questions at the end of each module.In December 2009, a mid-term evaluation was conducted, targeting both technical feasibility and user satisfaction. It also highlighted user perception of the program and the technical challenges encountered using mobile devices for lifelong learning.With a response rate of 90% (18/20 questionnaires returned), the overall satisfaction of using mobile tools was generally greater for the iPhone. Access to Skype and Facebook, screen/keyboard size, and image quality were cited as more troublesome for the Nokia N95 compared to the iPhone.Training, supervision and clinical mentoring of health workers are the cornerstone of the scaling up process of HIV/AIDS care in resource-limited settings (RLSs). Educational modules on mobile phones can give flexibility to HCWs for accessing learning content anywhere. However lack of softwares interoperability and the high investment cost for the Smartphones' purchase could represent a limitation to the wide spread use of such kind mLearning programs in RLSs.",

    "abstract": "Although Venezuela has a National Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Program offering free diagnosis and treatment, 41% of patients present for diagnosis at a later disease-stage, indicating that access to care may still be limited. Our study aimed to identify factors influencing delay in presenting for HIV-diagnosis using a case-case comparison. A cross-sectional survey was performed at the Regional HIV Reference Centre (CAI), Carabobo Region, Venezuela. Between May 2005 and October 2006 225 patients diagnosed with HIV at CAI were included and demographic, behavioural and medical characteristics collected from medical files. Socio-economic and behavioural factors were obtained from 129 eligible subjects through interviews. \"Late presentation\" at diagnosis was defined as patients classified with disease-stage B or C according to the 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) classification, and \"early presentation\" defined as diagnosis in disease-stage A.Of 225 subjects, 91 (40%) were defined as late presenters. A similar proportion (51/129) was obtained in the interviewed sub-sample. Older age (>30 years), male heterosexuality, lower socio-economic status, perceiving ones partner to be faithful and living >/= 25 km from the CAI were positively associated with late diagnosis in a multivariate model. Females were less likely to present late than heterosexual males (odds ratio = 0.23, P = 0.06). The main barriers to HIV testing were low knowledge of HIV/AIDS, lack of awareness of the free HIV program, lack of perceived risk of HIV-infection, fear for HIV-related stigma, fear for lack of confidentiality at testing site and logistic barriers.Despite the free Venezuelan HIV Program, poverty and barriers related to lack of knowledge and awareness of both HIV and the Program itself were important determinants in late presentation at HIV diagnosis. This study also indicates that women; heterosexual, bisexual and homosexual men might have different pathways to testing and different factors related to late presentation in each subgroup. Efforts must be directed to i) increase awareness of HIV/AIDS and the Program and ii) the identification of specific factors associated with delay in HIV diagnosis per subgroup, to help develop targeted public health interventions improving early diagnosis and prognosis of people living with HIV/AIDS in Venezuela and elsewhere.",

Rifampicin, a critical component of tuberculosis (TB) therapy is a potent inducer of CYP enzyme activity. Polymorphisms of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 are associated with altered activity of hepatic enzyme in the liver and pharmacokinetics resulting in treatment efficacy. This study aimed to investigate whether CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 polymorphisms had effects on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations when co-administered with rifampicin in HIV/TB co-infected Thai adults.We studied 124 rifampicin recipients with concurrent HIV-1/TB coinfection, receiving efavirenz (600 mg/day) (n = 65) or nevirapine (400 mg/day) (n = 59) based antiretroviral therapy (ART). The frequencies of GG, GT and TT genotypes of CYP2B6-G516T were 38.46%, 47.69% and 13.85% in efavirenz group and 44.07%, 52.54% and 3.39% in nevirapine group, respectively. The mean 12-hour post-dose plasma efavirenz concentration in patients with TT genotype at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation (10.97 +/- 2.32, 13.62 +/- 4.21 and 8.48 +/- 1.30 mg/L, respectively) were significantly higher than those with GT (3.43 +/- 0.29, 3.35 +/- 0.27 and 3.21 +/- 0.22 mg/L, respectively) (p < 0.0001) or GG genotypes (2.88 +/- 0.33, 2.45 +/- 0.26 and 2.08 +/- 0.16 mg/L, respectively) (p < 0.0001). Likewise, the mean 12-hour post-dose plasma nevirapine concentration in patients carrying TT genotype at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation (14.09 +/- 9.49, 7.94 +/- 2.76 and 9.44 +/- 0.17 mg/L, respectively) tended to be higher than those carrying GT (5.65 +/- 0.54, 5.58 +/- 0.48 and 7.03 +/- 0.64 mg/L, respectively) or GG genotypes (5.42 +/- 0.48, 5.34 +/- 0.50 and 6.43 +/- 0.64 mg/L, respectively) (p = 0.003, p = 0.409 and p = 0.448, respectively). Compared with the effects of CYP2B6-516TT genotype, we could observe only small effects of rifampicin on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine levels. After 12 weeks of both drug regimens, there was a trend towards higher percentage of patients with CYP2B6-TT genotype who achieved HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL compared to those with GT or GG genotypes. This is the first report to demonstrate the effects of CYP2B6 G516T polymorphisms on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations when co-administered with rifampicin in HIV/TB co-infected Thai adults.CYP2B6-TT genotype had impact on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations, while rifampicin co-administration had only small effects.",

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of lipid profile derangements associated with first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) among Cameroonians living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.This cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2009 and January 2010, and involved 138 HIV patients who had never received ART (ART-naive group) and 138 others treated for at least 12 months with first line triple ART regimens that included nevirapine or efavirenz (ART group). Lipid profile was determined after overnight fast and dyslipidemia diagnosed according to the US National Cholesterol Education Program III criteria. Data comparison used chi-square test, Student t-test and logistic regressions.The prevalence of total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dl was 37.6% and 24.6% respectively in ART group and ART-naive groups (p = 0.019).

Plasma 25-(OH)D concentrations decreased significantly in both nevirapine and efavirenz-containing regimens but not in PI-treated patients. Vitamin D deficiency is frequent in HIV-positive individuals and NNRTI therapy further decreases 25-(OH)D concentrations.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the pattern and predictors of mortality of HIV/AIDS patients with neurologic manifestations. Methods Medical records of 347 patients (age ≥13 years) admitted to Tikur Anbesa Hospital from September 2002 to August 2009 were reviewed and demographic and clinical data were collected. Results Data from 347 patients were analysed. The mean age was 34.6 years. The diagnosis of HIV was made before current admission in 33.7% and 15.6% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Causes of neurological manifestation were: cerebral toxoplasmosis (36.6%), tuberculous meningitis (22.5%), cryptococcal meningitis (22.2%) and bacterial meningitis (6.9%). HIV-encephalopathy, primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were rare in our patients. CD4 count was done in 64.6% and 89.7% had count below 200/mm3[mean = 95.8, median = 57] and 95.7% were stage IV. Neuroimaging was done in 38% and 56.8% had mass lesion. The overall mortality was 45% and the case-fatality rates were: tuberculous meningitis (53.8%), cryptococcal meningitis (48.1%), cerebral toxoplasmosiss (44.1%) and bacterial meningitis (33.3%). Change in sensorium and seizure were predictors of mortality. Conclusions CNS opportunistic infections were the major causes of neurological manifestations of HIV/AIDS and were associated with high mortality and morbidity. Almost all patients had advanced HIV disease at presentation. Early diagnosis of HIV, prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic infections, timely ART, and improving laboratory services are recommended. Mortality was related to change in sensorium and seizure.",

A total of 1,139 (55.6%) of the 2,507 studied cases over these nine years were late presenters varying from 48% among men who have sex with men to 70% among heterosexual men. The proportion of late presentation was 62.7% in 2001-2003, 51.9% in 2004-2005, 52.6% in 2006-2007 and 52.1% in 2008-2009. A decrease over time only was observed between 2001-2003 and 2004-2005 (p = 0.001) but remained constant thereafter (p = 0.9). Independent risk factors for late presentation were older age at diagnosis (p < 0.0001), use of injected drugs by men (p < 0.0001), being a heterosexual men (p < 0.0001), and being born in South America (p < 0.0001) or sub-Saharan Africa (p = 0.002).Late presentation of HIV is still too frequent in all transmission groups in spite of a strong commitment with HIV prevention in our city. It is necessary to develop interventions that increase HIV testing and facilitate earlier entry into HIV care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background There have been few reports of long-term survival of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Africa managed under near normal health service conditions. Methods Participants starting ART between February 2005 and December 2006 in The AIDS Support (TASO) clinic in Jinja, Uganda, were enrolled into a cluster-randomised trial of home versus facility-based care and followed up to January 2009. The trial was integrated into normal service delivery with patients managed by TASO staff according to national guidelines. Rates of survival, virological failure, hospital admissions and CD4 count over time were similar between the two arms. Data for the present analysis were analysed using Cox regression analyses. Results 1453 subjects were enrolled with baseline median count of 108 cells/μl. Over time, 119 (8%) withdrew and 34 (2%) were lost to follow-up. 197/1453 (14%) died. Mortality rates (95% CI) per 100 person-years were 11.8 (10.1, 13.8) deaths in the first year and 2.4 (1.8, 3.2) deaths thereafter. The one, two and three year survival probabilities (95% CI) were 0.89 (0.87 - 0.91), 0.86 (0.84 - 0.88) and 0.85 (0.83 - 0.87) respectively. Low baseline CD4 count, low body weight, advanced clinical condition (WHO stages III and IV), not being on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and male gender were associated independently with increased mortality. Tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis and diarrhoeal disease were estimated to be major causes of death. Conclusion Practical and affordable interventions are needed to enable earlier initiation of ART and to reduce mortality risk among those who present late for treatment with advanced disease.",

NGX-4010 is a capsaicin 8% dermal patch with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of HIV-DSP. Data from two phase III, double-blind studies were integrated to further analyze the efficacy and safety of NGX-4010 and explore the effect of demographic and baseline factors on NGX-4010 treatment in HIV-DSP. Data from two similarly designed studies in which patients with HIV-DSP received NGX-4010 or a low-concentration control patch (capsaicin 0.04% w/w) for 30 or 60 minutes were integrated. Efficacy assessments included the mean percent change from baseline in Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) scores to Weeks 2–12. Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events (AEs) and pain during and after treatment. Patients (n = 239) treated with NGX-4010 for 30 minutes demonstrated significantly (p = 0.0026) greater pain relief compared with controls (n = 100); the mean percent change in NPRS scores from baseline to Weeks 2–12 was −27.0% versus − 15.7%, respectively. Patients who received a 60-minute application of NGX-4010 (n = 243) showed comparable pain reductions (−27.5%) to patients treated for 30 minutes, but this was not statistically superior to controls (n = 115). NGX-4010 was effective regardless of gender, baseline pain score, duration of HIV-DSP, or use of concomitant neuropathic pain medication, although NGX-4010 efficacy was greater in patients not receiving concomitant neuropathic pain medications. NGX-4010 was well tolerated; the most common AEs were application-site pain and erythema, and most AEs were mild to moderate. The transient increase in pain associated with NGX-4010 treatment decreased the day after treatment and returned to baseline by Day 2. A single 30-minute application of NGX-4010 provides significant pain relief for at least 12 weeks in patients with HIV-DSP and is well tolerated. C107 = NCT00064623; C119 = NCT00321672",

This study aimed at describing the incidence, risk factors and the resistance associated mutations (RAMs) of first line treatment failure among HIV-1-infected children attending the Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC), Kampala, Uganda.A retrospective cohort of 701 children who had been initiated on ART between January 2004 and September 2009 at the JCRC was studied. Data of children aged 6 months up to 18 years who had been started on ART for at least 6 months was extracted from the clinic charts. The children who failed the first-line ART were taken as cases and those who did not fail as the controls. Data was analysed using STATA version10.Of 701 children, 240(34%) failed on first line ART (cases) and 461(66%) did not fail (controls). The overall median time (IQR) to first line ART failure was 26.4 (18.9 - 39.1) months. The factors associated with treatment failure were poor adherence [(OR = 10, 95 CI: 6.4 - 16.7) p < 0.001], exposure to single dose nevirapine (sdNVP) [(OR = 4.2, 95% CI:1.8-9.4), p = 0.005] and a NVP containing regimen [(OR = 2.2,95% CI:1.4-3.6), p < 0.001].

However, cost and resistance to cART are major obstacles for access to treatment especially in resource-limited settings. In this study, we aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors of treatment failure in a cohort of treatment-naïve Thai HIV-infected patients. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-infected patients initiating their first cART at Chiang Mai University Hospital, Thailand. Results From January 2002 to December 2008, 788 patients were enrolled; 365 were male (46.3%), and the mean age was 37.9 ± 8.6 years. The median baseline CD4 count was 57.7 cells/mm 3 (IQR 22, 127). GPO-VIR ® (a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine, stavudine, and nevirapine) was the most common prescribed cART (657 patients, 83.4%). Seventy-six patients developed virological failure given the cumulative incidence of 9.6%. The incidence of virological failure was 2.79 (95% CI 2.47, 3.14) cases per 100 person years. Poor adherence was the strongest predictor for virological failure. Of 535 immunologically evaluable patients, 179 (33.5%) patients developed immunological failure. A low CD4 cell count at baseline (&lt; 100 cells/mm 3 ) and the increment of CD4 cell count of &lt; 50 cell/mm 3 after 6 months of cART were the predictors for immunological failure (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrated that even in resource-limited settings, the high rate of success could be expected in the cohort with good and sustainable drug adherence. Poor adherence, older age, and low baseline CD4 cell count are the predictors for unfavorable outcome of cART.",

We test the hypothesis that the sub-preputial microenvironment created by the foreskin drives immune activation in adjacent foreskin tissues, facilitating HIV-1 infection through a combination of epithelial barrier disruption, enhanced dendritic cell maturation, and the recruitment/activation of neutrophils and susceptible CD4 T cell subsets such as Th17 cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the genital microbiome may be an important driver of this immune activation. This suggests that new modalities to reduce genital immune activation and/or alter the genital microbiome, used alone or in combination with topical microbicides, may be of significant benefit to HIV prevention.",

    "abstract": "The Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) can manifest neurologically in both adults and children. Early invasion of the central nervous system by the virus, affecting the developing brain, is believed to result in the most common primary HIV-related neurological complication, HIV Encephalopathy (HIVE). In countries such as South Africa where many children have not been initiated on antiretroviral treatment early, HIVE remains a significant clinical problem. Children were selected from a clinic for children with neurologic complications of HIV, located at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, South Africa 2008–2012. Eligible subjects fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: aged 6 months-13 years; positive diagnosis of HIV infection, vertically infected and HIVE as defined by CDC criteria. Each participant was prospectively assessed by a Pediatric Neurologist using a standardized proforma which collated relevant details of background, clinical and immunological status. The median age of the 87 children was 64 months (interquartile range 27–95 months). All except one child were on antiretroviral treatment, 45% had commenced treatment <12 months of age. Delayed early motor milestones were reported in 80% and delayed early speech in 75% of children in whom we had the information. Twenty percent had a history of one or more seizures and 41% had a history of behavior problems. Forty-eight percent had microcephaly and 63% a spastic diplegia. CD4 percentages followed a normal distribution with mean of 30.3% (SD 8.69). Viral loads were undetectable (<log 1.6) in 70% of the children. Brain imaging was performed on 56% with 71% of those imaged demonstrating at least one abnormality, most commonly white matter volume loss or signal abnormality. Amongst the cohort of children referred to this clinic, the diagnosis of HIVE was unrecognized in the general medical services, even in its most severe form. Developmental delay and school failure were major presenting problems. Co-morbidities are a frequent finding and should be sought actively in order to optimize management and promote best possible outcomes for this vulnerable group of children.",

The secondary objective was to provide estimates and determinants of direct cost of medical care in HIV patients.We performed a matched cohort study including HIV + LP and HIV + EP among people attending the Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic (MHMC) in 2014. HIV-positive participants were matched in a 1:3 ratio with HIV-negative participants from the CINECA ARNO database. Multimorbidity was defined as the concurrent presence of ≥2 NICM. Logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate associated predictors of NICM and multimorbidity.We analyzed 452 HIV + LP and 73 HIV + EP participants in comparison to 1575 HIV-negative controls. The mean age was 46 ± 9 years, 27.5% were women. Prevalence of NICM and multimorbidity were fourfold higher in the HIV + LP compared to the general population (p < 0.001), while HIV + EP present an intermediate risk. LP was associated with increased total costs in all age strata, but appear particularly relevant in patients above 50 years of age, after adjusting for age, multimorbidity, and antiretroviral costs.LP with HIV infection is still very frequent in Italy, is associated with higher prevalence of NICM and multimorbidity, and contributes to higher total care costs. Encouraging early testing and access to care is still urgently needed.",

Rates of current smoking among people living with HIV (PLHIV) are 2–3 times that of the general population, which contributes to the higher incidence of non-AIDS-related morbidity and mortality in PLHIV. Given the benefit of smoking cessation, strategies to assist individuals who smoke to quit should be a primary focus in modern HIV care. Tobacco harm reduction focuses on reducing health risk without necessarily requiring abstinence. However, there remains uncertainty about the safety, policy and familiarity of specific approaches, particularly the use of vaporised nicotine products. Evidence suggests that vaporised nicotine products may help smokers stop smoking and are not associated with any serious side-effects. However, there is the need for further safety and efficacy data surrounding interventions to assist quitting in the general population, as well as in PLHIV specifically. In addition, official support for vaping as a harm reduction strategy varies by jurisdiction and this determines whether medical practitioners can prescribe vaporised products and whether patients can access vaporised nicotine products. When caring for PLHIV who smoke, healthcare workers should follow general guidelines to assist with smoking cessation. These include: asking the patient about their smoking status; assessing the patient's readiness to quit and their nicotine dependence; advising the patient to stop smoking; assisting the patient in their attempt to stop smoking through referral, counselling, pharmacotherapy, self-help resources and/or health education; and arranging follow-up with the patient to evaluate their progress.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was launched to increase access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and to prevent new HIV infections globally. As new infections have decreased in many PEPFAR-supported countries, PEPFAR is increasingly focusing on understanding and decreasing mortality among PLHIV, specifically by addressing advanced HIV disease (AHD) and its attendant opportunistic infections (OIs). Several developments in identifying AHD, in preventing, diagnosing, and treating selected OIs, and in PEPFAR’s support for mortality surveillance make this an opportune moment for PEPFAR to address HIV-related mortality. Discussion AHD upon diagnosis or re-engagement in HIV care is not uncommon, and it substantially increases risk of death from OIs. The World Health Organization provides evidence-based guidelines for a package of interventions for preventing, diagnosing, and treating common OIs, including tuberculosis (TB), cryptococcal meningitis, and severe bacterial infections. PEPFAR facilitates implementation of these guidelines. To identify PLHIV with low CD4, PEPFAR plans to support expanded access to CD4 testing, including a point-of-care assay that differentiates CD4 cell count as a binary of greater than or less than 200 cells/µL. To prevent AHD-related mortality, PEPFAR supports rapid ART initiation with integrase inhibitor–based regimens and implementation and documentation of TB preventive treatment. To diagnose selected OIs, PEPFAR is implementing urine lateral flow lipoarabinomannan use to identify TB among PLHIV who have a CD4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/µL. To treat selected OIs, PEPFAR has focused on improving patient-centered care in TB/HIV co-infection services and scaling up implementation of new drug regimens for cryptococcal meningitis. To better understand mortality, PEPFAR has introduced an indicator, TX_ML, to routinely and systematically categorize outcomes, including deaths, among PLHIV on ART. Conclusions PEPFAR is increasing its efforts to identify AHD; to prevent, diagnose, and treat OIs; and to track mortality in its programs. These ongoing efforts, done in collaboration with other stakeholders, seek to decrease mortality among PLHIV.",

Despite the fact that it has been almost 40 years since the discovery of AIDS, there is still no cure or vaccine against HIV. Consequently, the concepts of functional vaccines and cures that aim to limit HIV disease progression and spread by persistent control of viral replication without life-long treatment have been suggested as more feasible options to control the HIV pandemic. To identify virus-host mechanisms that could be targeted for functional cure development, researchers have focused on a small fraction of HIV-1 infected individuals that control their infection spontaneously, so-called elite controllers. However, these efforts have not been able to unravel the key mechanisms of the infection control. This is partly due to lack in statistical power since only 0.15% of HIV-1 infected individuals are natural elite controllers. The proportion of long-term viral control is larger in HIV-2 infection compared with HIV-1 infection. We therefore present the idea of using HIV-2 as a model for finding a functional cure against HIV. Understanding the key differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections, and the cross-reactive effects in HIV-1/HIV-2 dual-infection could provide novel insights in developing functional HIV cures and vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Data on chronic kidney disease development in HIV infection is important towards building a comprehensive knowledge of HIV, ageing and polypharmacy in Africa. Several previous studies on tenofovir-associated kidney disease in Africa have shown conflicting results. This review summarises what is known about the development of kidney disease in HIV-positive African patients on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-containing ART. We set out to document the occurrence of kidney disease in HIV-positive Africans on TDF-containing ART in population-based studies and to evaluate the renal safety of TDF in Africans. Methods We conducted a systemic review using published studies which were identified through a computerized search of original research using the Medline/PubMed database, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, Proquest Google Scholar and Global Health reported from inception until 5 October 2017. Two reviewers independently abstracted the data and performed quality assessment of the included studies. We screened 595 articles and included 31 in the qualitative analysis performed. Results A total of 106 406 patients (of whom 66,681 were on Tenofovir) were involved in these 31 studies with sample sizes ranging from 30 to 62,230. Duration on tenofovir-containing ART ranged from those initiating ART at baseline to those who received TDF for up to 9 years. All but one of the studies involved only patients 16 years and older. The studies had differing definitions of kidney dysfunction and were of variable study design quality. The documented outcomes had substantial discrepancies across the studies, most likely due to methodological differences, study size and disparate outcome definitions. Conclusions Our review identified studies in Africans reporting statistically significant renal function decline associated with TDF use but the clinical significance of this effect was not enough to contraindicate its continued use in ART regimens. Consistent with studies in other populations, patients are at greater risk if they have pre-existing renal disease and are more advanced in age. More research is needed on paediatric populations under 16 years of age. Trial registration This review was registered on Prospero (registration number CRD42018078717).",

In exploring their various medical concerns and social vulnerabilities, we consider the role of multiple services in creating a pathway for resilience.Multiple methods and case studies allowed for triangulation of evidence and provided a holistic understanding of resilience among adolescents with complex needs. The research methods included: (1) a survey to identify examples of young people with complex needs, (2) qualitative interviews and field notes to further explore these needs, (3) patient files and health passports to identify clinical challenges, and (4) ecomapping exercises to personalize cases and identify resilience-enabling resources and supports. We present four case studies to highlight the complex experiences and access to services of ALHIV, and to illustrate their growing power and decision-making capacity over time.Adversity experienced by ALHIV varied by gender, family situation, years of schooling, and use of teen-clubs for support. The two female adolescents emphasised their need to be accepted and how this impacted sexuality and reproduction. The two males illustrated how ideas of masculinity influenced their sexual practice and involvement with health services and the correctional justice system. Multiple risks (alcohol use, sexual activities) and complex needs (belonging, having a purpose in life/productive activities, autonomy, desire for offspring) influence pathways to resilience. ALHIV were able to strengthen their own wellbeing by resisting negative behaviours and peer pressure and caregiver interactions through 'strategic silence'.ALHIV experienced self-transformation as a result of taking ART, with fewer severe episodes of illness and distressing skin conditions. Continuous engagement at the teen-club clinic transformed both productive activities and social relationships among ALHIV as they set life goals, gained a sense of empowerment, requested SRH services, and formed intimate relationships. These transformative opportunities allowed them to learn ways of minimizing risk of reinfection and violence, and of navigating health worker-caregiver-adolescent interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background When considering adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, many different cut-points are used. The primary goals of this study were to identify a level of self-reported medication adherence that best distinguished HIV viral suppression from non-suppression, and to compare the ability of a single-item and a 3-item adherence questionnaire to predict HIV viral suppression. Methods This cross-sectional analysis included 380 persons with HIV (PWH) from the Florida Cohort study who completed a self-reported ART adherence measure within 30-days of having an HIV viral load test. We used Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses and ROCContrast to compare the ability of a single-item and a 3-item self-reported adherence measure to predict HIV viral suppression (defined as ≤ 200 copies/mL). We used the Youden index and chi square statistics to assess specific cut-points, and repeated the analysis with a different definition of HIV viral suppression (≤ 1000 copies/mL). Results The mean percent adherence was 92.4% using the single-item score and 90.4% using the 3-item score; 81.6% had viral suppression. The areas under the curve for the single-item and 3-item adherence measures were generally poor overall and not significantly different from each other (0.589 and 0.580, p = 0.67). The Youden index identified cut-points of 93% and 89% as maximizing the sensitivity and specificity for the single-item and 3-item measures, respectively, whereas a cut-point of 80% on the single-item measure was best able to discriminate those with viral suppression (58% vs. 84%, p &lt; 0.001). Results were similar with viral suppression defined as ≤ 1000 copies/mL. Conclusions In this sample of PWH, a single question on medication adherence was as good as a 3-item questionnaire in predicting HIV viral suppression, although neither had good discriminatory ability. A cut-point close to 90% adherence maximized sensitivity and specificity, although viral suppression was very similar for nearly all measures above 80%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Door-to-door distribution of HIV self-testing kits (HIVST) has the potential to increase uptake of HIV testing services (HTS). However, very few studies have explored the social response to and implications of door-to-door including secondary distribution of HIVST on household relations and the ability of individuals to self-test with or without supervision within households. Methods A CRT of HIVST distribution was nested within the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial, in four Zambian communities randomised to receive the PopART intervention. The nested HIVST trial aimed to increase knowledge of HIV status at population level. Between February 1 and April 30, 2017, 66 zones (clusters) within these four communities were randomly allocated to either the PopART standard of care door-to-door HTS (33 clusters) or PopART standard of care door-to-door HTS plus oral HIVST (33 clusters). In clusters randomised to HIVST, trained Community HIV care provider (CHiPs) visited households and offered individuals aged ≥ 16 and eligible for an offer of HTS the choice of HIV testing using HIVST or routine door-to-door HTS (finger-prick RDT). To document participants’ experiences with HIVST, Interviews (n = 40), observations (n = 22) and group discussions (n = 91) with household members and CHiPs were conducted. Data were coded using Atlas.ti 7 and analysed thematically. Results The usage and storage of HIVST kits was facilitated by familiarity with and trust in CHiPs, the novelty of HIVST, and demonstrations and supervision provided by CHiPs. Door-to-door distribution of HIVST kits was appreciated for being novel, convenient, private, empowering, autonomous and easy-to-use. Literacy and age influenced accurate usage of HIVST kits. The novelty of using oral fluids to test for HIV raised questions, some anxiety and doubts about the accuracy of HIVST. Although HIVST protected participants from experiencing clinic-based stigma, it did not address self-stigma. Within households, HIVST usually strengthened relationships but, amongst couples, there were a few reports of social harms. Conclusion Door-to-door distribution of HIVST as a choice for how to HIV test is appreciated at community level and provides an important testing option in the sub-Saharan context. However, it should be accompanied by counselling to manage social harms and by supporting those testing HIV-positive to link to care.",

Despite the design and implementation of various PrEP-focus interventions in the US, aggregated evidence for enhancing PrEP uptake and adherence is lacking. The objective of this systematic review is to synthesize and evaluate interventions aimed to improve PrEP uptake and adherence among MSM in the US, and identify gaps with opportunities to inform the design and implementation of future PrEP interventions for these priority populations. Methods We followed the PRISMA guidelines and conducted a systematic review of articles (published by November 28, 2021) with a focus on PrEP-related interventions by searching multiple databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science and PsycINFO). Details of PrEP interventions were characterized based on their socioecological level(s), implementation modalities, and stage(s) of PrEP cascade continuum. Results Among the 1363 articles retrieved from multiple databases, 42 interventions identified from 47 publications met the inclusion criteria for this review. Most individual-level interventions were delivered via text messages and/or apps and incorporated personalized elements to tailor the intervention content on participants’ demographic characteristics or HIV risk behaviors. Interpersonal-level interventions often employed peer mentors or social network strategies to enhance PrEP adoption among MSM of minority race. However, few interventions were implemented at the community-, healthcare/institution- or multiple levels. Conclusions Interventions that incorporate multiple socioecological levels hold promise to facilitate PrEP adoption and adherence among MSM in the US given their acceptability, feasibility, efficacy and effectiveness. Future PrEP interventions that simultaneously address PrEP-related barriers/facilitators across multiple socioecological levels should be enhanced with a focus to tackle contextual and structural barriers (e.g., social determinants of health, stigma or medical mistrust) at the community- and healthcare/institution-level to effectively promote PrEP use for MSM of color.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) remains the cornerstone of optimal HIV outcomes, including viral suppression (VS), immune recovery, and decreased transmission risk. For many people with HIV (PWH), particularly those with early-acquired HIV, structural, behavioral, and cognitive barriers to adherence and competing priorities related to life events may be difficult to overcome, resulting in nonadherence. Long-acting injectable antiretroviral therapies (LAI-ART) may be a useful strategy to overcome some of these barriers. However, to date, the approved LAI-ART strategies (e.g., cabotegravir and rilpivirine (CAB/RPV)) have targeted those who have already attained viral suppression, precluding their use in the 40% of adolescents and young adults (AYA) that VS has eluded. Case presentation Ms. X is a 30-year-old woman with perinatally-acquired HIV and barriers to adherence. Despite many interventions, she remained persistently viremic, with resultant immune suppression and multiple comorbid opportunistic conditions, and viral load (VL) &gt; 10,000,000 copies/ml. Given her longstanding history of poor adherence to an oral regimen, a switch to monthly intramuscular (IM) injections and biweekly infusions of ibalizumab were initiated leading to decreased viral load to 8,110 copies/ml within two weeks. Ms. H is a 33-year-old woman with cognitive limitations due to childhood lead poisoning. Her viral load trajectory took a downward turn, precipitated by various life events, remaining elevated despite intensive case management. Initiation of LAI-ART (CAB/RPV) in this patient led to an undetectable VL (&lt; 20 copies/ml) within two months of treatment initiation. Miss Y. is a 37-year-old woman with perinatally-acquired HIV and chronic challenges with nonadherence and longstanding immunosuppression with CD4 &lt; 200 cells/mm 3 for &gt; 5 years. She received a 1-month oral lead-in (OLI) of cabotegravir/rilpivirine, followed by the injectable loading dose. She has since adhered to all her monthly dosing appointments, sustained VS, and transitioned to a bi-monthly injection schedule. Conclusion These three individuals with HIV (perinatally and non-perinatally acquired) with longstanding nonadherence and persistent viremia were successfully initiated on LAI-ART through the process of care coordination and the collective efforts of the care team, highlighting the barriers, challenges, and the multidisciplinary coordination needed to assure successful implementation of this strategy for the most vulnerable of patients.",

However, only a few studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) reported experiences of people living with HIV (PLWH) on self-management. Methods This meta-synthesis of qualitative studies investigated perspectives of PLWH in LMICs on self-management. Various databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, and CINHAL, were searched through June 2022. Relevant additional articles were also included using cross-referencing of the identified papers. We used a thematic synthesis guided by the \"Model of the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory\" (IFSMT). Result PLWH in LIMICs experience a variety of challenges that restrict their options for effective self-management and compromises their quality of life. The main ones include: misconceptions about the disease, poor self-efficacy and self-management skills, negative social perceptions, and a non-patient-centered model of care that reduces the role of patients. The experiences that influenced the ability to practice self-management are summarized in context (the condition itself, physical and environmental factors, individual and family factors) and process factors (knowledge and beliefs, relationship with the health care worker, self-regulation skills and abilities, and social facilitation). Context and process greatly impacted quality of life through the self-management practices of the patients. Conclusion and recommendation PLWH encounter multiple challenges, are not empowered enough to manage their own chronic condition, and their needs beyond medical care are not addressed by service providers. Self-management practice of these patients is poor, and service providers do not follow service delivery approaches that empower patients to be at the center of their own care and to achieve an effective and sustainable outcome from treatment. These findings call for a comprehensive well thought self-management interventions.",

Despite the increasing number of people living with HIV (PLWH) in low-income countries, very little research on self-management is conducted in this setting. The aim of this research is to understand the perspectives of service providers and experts on the importance of self-management for PLWH. Methods A systematizing expert interview type of qualitative methodology was used to gain the perspectives of experts and service providers. The study participants had experience in researching, managing, or providing HIV service in east and southern African (ESA) countries. All the interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated to English. The quality of the transcripts was ensured by randomly checking the texts against the audio record. A thematic analysis approach supported by Atlas TI version 9 software. Result PLWH face a variety of multi-dimensional problems thematized under contextual and process dimensions. The problems identified under the contextual dimension include disease-specific, facility-related, and social environment-related. Problems with individual origin, such as ignorance, outweighing beliefs over scientific issues, low self-esteem, and a lack of social support, were mostly highlighted under the process dimensions. Those problems have a deleterious impact on self-management, treatment outcomes, and the quality of life of PLWH. Low self-management is also a result of professional-centered service delivery in healthcare facilities and health service providers’ incapacity to comprehend a patient’s need beyond the medical concerns. Participants in the study asserted that patients have a significant stake in enhancing treatment results and quality of life through enhancing self-management. Conclusion and recommendation HIV patients face multifaceted problems beyond their medical issues. The success of medical treatment for HIV is strongly contingent upon patients’ self-management practices and the supportive roles of their family, society, and health service providers. The development and integration of self-management practices into clinical care will benefit patients, their families, and the health system.",

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the women in order to gain an understanding of their experiences of antenatal care and to identify missed opportunities for participation in PMTCT.15 women actually missed their nevirapine not because of stigma and ignorance but because of health systems failures. Six were not tested for HIV during antenatal care. Two were tested but did not receive their results. Seven were tested and received their results, but did not receive nevirapine. Health Systems failure for these programme leakages ranged from non-availability of counselors, supplies such as HIV test kits, consent forms, health staff giving the women incorrect instructions about when to take the tablet and health staff not supplying the women with the tablet to take.HIV testing enables access to PMTCT interventions and should therefore be strengthened. The single dose nevirapine regimen is simple to implement but the all or nothing nature of the regimen may result in many missed opportunities.

To assess the effect of HAART on QOL by comparing HIV-infected women using HAART with HIV-infected women remaining HAART naïve in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), a multicenter prospective cohort study begun in 1994 in the US. A 1:1 matching with equivalent (<or= 0.1%) propensity scores for predicting HAART initiation was implemented and 458 pairs were obtained. HAART effects were assessed using pattern mixture models. The changes of nine QOL domain scores and one summary score derived from a shortened version of the MOS-HIV from initial values were used as study outcomes. The background covariates of the treatment groups were well-balanced after propensity score matching. The 916 matched subjects had a mean age of 38.5 years and 42% had a history of AIDS diagnosis. The participants contributed a total of 4,292 person visits with a median follow-up time of 4 years. In the bivariate analyses with only HAART use and time as covariates, HAART was associated with short-term improvements of 4 QOL domains: role functioning, social functioning, pain and perceived health index. After adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, biological and clinical variables, HAART had small but significant short-term improvements on changes in summary QOL (mean change: 3.25; P = 0.02), role functioning (6.99; P < 0.01), social functioning (5.74; P < 0.01), cognitive functioning (3.59; P = 0.03), pain (6.73; P < 0.01), health perception (3.67; P = 0.03) and perceived health index (4.87; P < 0.01). These QOL scores typically remained stable or declined over additional follow-up and there was no indication that HAART modified these trends. Our study demonstrated significant short-term HAART effects on most QOL domains, but additional use of HAART did not modify long-term trends. These changes could be attributed to the direct effect of HAART and indirect HAART effect mediated through clinical changes.",

    "abstract": "International HIV guidelines have recently shifted from a medium-late to an early-start treatment strategy. As a consequence, more people will be eligible to Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). We estimate mean life years gained using different treatment indications in low income countries. We carried out a systematic search to identify relevant studies on the treatment effect of HAART. Outcome from identified observational studies were combined in a pooled-analyses and we apply these data in a Markov life cycle model based on a hypothetical Tanzanian HIV population. Survival for three different HIV populations with and without any treatment is estimated. The number of patients included in our pooled-analysis is 35 047. Providing HAART early when CD4 is 200-350 cells/μl is likely to be the best outcome strategy with an expected net benefit of 14.5 life years per patient. The model predicts diminishing treatment benefits for patients starting treatment when CD4 counts are lower. Patients starting treatment at CD4 50-199 and <50 cells/μl have expected net health benefits of 7.6 and 7.3 life years. Without treatment, HIV patients with CD4 counts 200-350; 50-199 and < 50 cells/μl can expect to live 4.8; 2.0 and 0.7 life years respectively. This study demonstrates that HIV patients live longer with early start strategies in low income countries. Since low income countries have many constraints to full coverage of HAART, this study provides input to a more transparent debate regarding where to draw explicit eligibility criteria during further scale up of HAART.",

    "abstract": "Fat abnormalities are common among HIV-infected persons, but few studies have compared regional body fat distribution, including visceral fat, in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons and their subsequent trajectories in body composition over time. Between 1999 and 2002, 33 men with clinical evidence of lipodystrophy (LIPO+), 23 HIV-infected men without clinical evidence of lipodytrophy (LIPO-), and 33 HIV-uninfected men were recruited from the four sites of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Participants underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, quantitative computerized tomography of the abdomen and thigh, and circumference measurements of the waist, hip and thigh. Circumference measurements at each semi-annual MACS visit between recruitment and 2008 were used to compare average annual anthropometric changes in the 3 groups. Body mass index (BMI) was lower in LIPO+ men than in the LIPO- men and the HIV- uninfected controls (BMI: 23.6 ± 0.4 vs 26.8 ± 1.5 vs 28.7 ± 0.9 kg/m2, respectively, p < 0.001). The average amount of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was similar in all three groups (p = 0.26), but after adjustment for BMI, VAT was higher in the LIPO+ group (169 ± 10 cm2) compared to the LIPO- men (129 ± 12 cm2, p = 0.03) and the HIV-uninfected group (133 ± 11 cm2, p = 0.07). Subcutaneous adipose tissue (thigh, abdomen) and total extremity fat were less in the HIV-infected men (LIPO+ and LIPO-) than in the HIV-uninfected men. Over an average of 6 years of follow-up, waist circumference increased at a faster rate in LIPO+ group, compared to the LIPO- men (0.51 cm/year vs 0.08 cm/year, p = 0.02) and HIV-uninfected control men (0.21 cm/year, p = 0.06). The annual changes in hip and thigh circumferences were similar in all three groups Subcutaneous lipoatrophy was observed in HIV-infected patients, even those without clinical evidence of lipodystrophy, compared to age-matched HIV-uninfected men. Despite markedly lower BMI, HIV-infected men with lipodystrophy had a similar amount of VAT as HIV-uninfected men and tended to have more rapid increases in waist circumference over 6 years of follow-up. These longitudinal increases in waist circumference may contribute to the development of cardiovascular risk in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy.",

We described the patterns of SO-CD4 both in terms of:- I) magnitude of CD4 cell increase (a CD4 count increase < 50 CD4 cells/μl at 6 months, <100 cells/μl at 12 months; and <200 cells/μl at 24 months of ART) and II) failure to achieve a CD4 cell count above 200 cells/μl at 6,12 and 24 months of ART. Using criteria I) we used logistic regression to determine the predictors of SO-CD4. We compared the cumulative risk of clinical events (death and/or recurrent or new AIDS-defining illnesses) among patients with and without SO-CD4. Of 559 patients initiating ART, 386 (69%) were female. Median (IQR) age and baseline CD4 counts were 38 yrs (33–44) and 98 cells/μl (21–163) respectively; 414 (74%) started a d4T-based regimen (D4T+3TC+NVP) and 145 (26%) a ZDV-based regimen (ZDV+3TC+EFV). After 6, 12 and 24 months of ART, 380 (68%), 339 (61%) and 309 (55%) had attained and sustained HIV-RNA viral suppression. Of these, 78 (21%), 151 (45%) and 166 (54%) respectively had SO-CD4 based on criteria I), and 165(43%), 143(42%) and 58(19%) respectively based on criteria II). With both criteria combined, 56 (15%) and 129 (38%) had SO-CD4 at 6 and 12 months respectively. A high proportion (82% and 58%) of those that had SO-CD4 at 6 months (using criteria I) maintained SO-CD4 at 12 and 24 months respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of clinical events among patients with [19/100PYO (12–29)] and without SO-CD4 [23/100PYO (19–28)]. Using criteria I), the frequency of SO-CD4 was 21% at 6 months. Majority of patients with SO-CD4 at 6 months maintained SO-CD4 up to 2 years. We recommend studies of CD4 T-cell functional recovery among patients with SO-CD4.",

In this study we assembled combinations of highly-conserved shRNAs to target as many HIV-1 strains as possible. We analyzed intersecting conservations of 10 shRNAs to find combinations with 4+ matching the maximum number of strains using 1220+ HIV-1 sequences from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). We built 26 combinations of 2 to 7 shRNAs with up to 87% coverage for all known strains and 100% coverage of clade B subtypes, and characterized their intrinsic suppressive activities in transient expression assays. We found that all combinations had high combined suppressive activities, though there were also large changes in the individual activities of the component shRNAs in our multiple expression cassette configurations. By considering the intersecting conservations of shRNA combinations we have shown that it is possible to assemble combinations of 6 and 7 highly active, highly conserved shRNAs such that there is always at least 4 shRNAs within each combination covering all currently known variants of entire HIV-1 subtypes. By extension, it may be possible to combine several combinations for complete global coverage of HIV-1 variants.",

    "abstract": "Current therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection relies primarily on the administration of anti-retroviral nucleoside analogues, either alone or in combination with HIV-protease inhibitors. Although these drugs have a clinical benefit, continuous therapy with the drugs leads to drug-resistant strains of the virus. Recently, significant progress has been made towards the development of natural and synthetic agents that can directly inhibit HIV-1 replication or its essential enzymes. We previously reported on the pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (PCI) r-roscovitine as a potential inhibitor of HIV-1 replication. PCIs are among the most promising novel antiviral agents to emerge over the past few years. Potent activity on viral replication combined with proliferation inhibition without the emergence of resistant viruses, which are normally observed in HAART patients; make PCIs ideal candidates for HIV-1 inhibition. To this end we evaluated twenty four cdk inhibitors for their effect on HIV-1 replication in vitro. Screening of these compounds identified alsterpaullone as the most potent inhibitor of HIV-1 with activity at 150 nM. We found that alsterpaullone effectively inhibits cdk2 activity in HIV-1 infected cells with a low IC50 compared to control uninfected cells. The effects of alsterpaullone were associated with suppression of cdk2 and cyclin expression. Combining both alsterpaullone and r-roscovitine (cyc202) in treatment exhibited even stronger inhibitory activities in HIV-1 infected PBMCs.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it has been shown that human ejaculate enhances human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infectivity. Enhancement of infectivity is conceived to be mediated by amyloid filaments from peptides that are proteolytically released from prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), termed Semen-derived Enhancer of Virus Infection (SEVI). The aim of this study was to test the range of HIV-1 infectivity enhancing properties of a large number of individual semen samples (n = 47) in a TZM-bl reporter cell HIV infection system. We find that semen overall increased infectivity to 156% of the control experiment without semen, albeit with great inter- and intraindividual variability (range -53%-363%). Using transmission electron microscopy, we provide evidence for SEVI fibrils in fresh human semen for the first time. Moreover, we confirm that the infectivity enhancing property can be inhibited by the major green tea ingredient epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) at non-toxic concentrations. The median inhibition of infection by treatment with 0.4 mM EGCG was 70.6% (p < 0.0001) in our cohort. Yet, there were substantial variations of inhibition and in a minority of samples, infectivity enhancement was not inhibited by EGCG treatment at all. Thus, topical application of EGCG may be a feasible additional measure to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. However, the reasons for the variability in the efficacy of the abrogation of semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity and EGCG efficacy have to be elucidated before therapeutic trials can be conducted.",

    "abstract": "South Africa, with its scientific capacity, good infrastructure and high HIV incidence rates, is ideally positioned to conduct large-scale HIV prevention trials. The HIV Prevention Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council conducted four phase III and one phase IIb trials of women-initiated HIV prevention options in KwaZulu-Natal between 2003 and 2009. A total of 7046 women participated, with HIV prevalence between 25% and 45% and HIV incidence ranging from 4.5-9.1% per year. Unfortunately none of the interventions tested had any impact on reducing the risk of HIV acquisition; however, extremely valuable experience was gained, lessons learned and capacity built, while the communities gained associated benefits.Our experience in conducting these trials ranged from setting up community partnerships to developing clinical research sites and dissemination of trial results. Community engagement included setting up community-based research sites with approval from both political and traditional leaders, and developing community advisory groups to assist with the research process. Community-wide education on HIV/sexually transmitted infection prevention, treatment and care was provided to over 90,000 individuals. Myths and misconceptions were addressed through methods such as anonymous suggestion boxes in clinic waiting areas and intensive education and counselling. Attempts were made to involve male partners to foster support and facilitate recruitment of women. Peer educator programmes were initiated to provide ongoing education and also to facilitate recruitment of women to the trials. Recruitment strategies such as door-to-door recruitment and community group meetings were initiated. Over 90% of women enrolled were retained. Community benefits from the trial included education on HIV prevention, treatment and care and provision of ancillary care (such as Pap smears, reproductive health care and referral for chronic illnesses). Social benefits included training of home-based caregivers and sustainable ongoing HIV prevention education through peer educator programmes.Several challenges were encountered, including manipulation by participants of their eligibility criteria in order to enroll in the trial. Women attempted to co-enroll in multiple trials to benefit from financial reimbursements and individualised care. The trials became ethically challenging when participants refused to take up referrals for care due to stigma, denial of their HIV status and inadequate health infrastructure. Lack of disclosure of HIV status to partners and family members was particularly challenging. Some of the ethical dilemmas put to the test our responsibility as researchers and our obligation to provide health care to research participants.Conducting these five trials in a period of six years provided us with invaluable insights into trial implementation, community participation, recruitment and retention, provision of care and dissemination of trial results. The critical mass of scientists trained as clinical trialists will continue to address the relentless HIV epidemic in our setting and ensure our commitment to finding a biomedical HIV prevention option for women in the future.",

    "abstract": "The nucleoside(tide) reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have traditionally been an important 'back-bone' of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. However all agents have been associated with both short- and long-term toxicity. There have also been concerns regarding the efficacy and safety of a treatment sequencing strategy in which those with past exposure and/or resistance to one or more NRTIs are re-exposed to 'recycled' NRTIs in subsequent ART regimens. Newer, potent and possible safer, agents from various ART classes continue to become available. There has therefore been growing interest in evaluating NRTI-sparing regimens. In this review, we examined studies of NRTI-sparing regimens in adult HIV-positive patients with varying degrees of ART experience. We found that in treatment experienced patients currently on a failing regimen with detectable viral load, there now exists a robust evidence for the use of NRTI-sparing regimens including raltegravir with a boosted-protease inhibitor with or without a third agent. In those on a virologically suppressive regimen switching to a NRTI-sparing regimen or in those ART-naïve patients initiating an NRTI-sparing regimen, evidence is sparse and largely comes from small exploratory trials or observational studies. Overall, these studies suggest that caution needs to be exercised in carefully selecting the right candidate and agents, especially in the context of a dual-therapy regimen, to minimise the risks of virological failure. There is residual toxicity conferred by the ritonavir boost in protease-inhibitor containing NRTI-sparing regimens. Fully-powered studies are needed to explore the place of N (t)RTI-sparing regimens in the sequencing of ART. Additionally research is required to explore how to minimise the adverse effects associated with ritonavir-based pharmacoenhancement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Moringa oleifera Lam., an herb commonly consumed by HIV-infected people on antiretroviral therapy, inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4, 1A2 and 2D6 activity in vitro; and may alter the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antiretroviral drugs metabolized via the same pathways. However, in vitro drug interaction activity may not translate to a clinically significant effect. Therefore, the effect of moringa leaf powder on the PK of nevirapine in HIV-infected people was investigated. Methods Adult patients at steady-state dosing with nevirapine were admitted for 12-h intensive PK sampling following a 21-day herbal medicine washout. Blood sampling was repeated after 14 days of nevirapine and moringa (1.85 g leaf powder/day) co-administration. Nevirapine plasma concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. To assess the effect of moringa on nevirapine PK, the change in nevirapine area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) was determined. The mean difference in pre- and post-moringa nevirapine, maximum concentration (C max ) and concentration at 12 h (C 12h ) were also calculated. The PK parameters were compared by assessing the post/pre geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and associated 90% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Pharmacokinetics analyses were performed on the results from 11 participants for whom complete data were obtained. The post/pre GMRs and associated 90% CIs for nevirapine were 1.07 (1.00–1.14) for the AUC; 1.06 (0.98–1.16) for C max and 1.03 (0.92–1.16) for C 12h . Conclusion Co-administration of Moringa oleifera Lam. leaf powder at the traditional dose did not significantly alter the steady-state PK of nevirapine.

    "abstract": "To investigate the predictive factors for the development of Kaposi sarcoma-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (KS-IRIS) and long-term prognosis in patients starting combined antiretroviral therapy (cART).We studied a retrospective-cohort of consecutive antiretroviral-naïve patients with KS initiating cART from January 2005 to December 2011 and followed through June 2013. KS-IRIS was defined as ≥2 of the following: abrupt increase in number of KS lesions, appearance or exacerbation of lung-opacities or lymphedema, concomitantly with an increase in CD4+ cell-count ≥50 cells/mm3 and a decrease of >1 log in viral-load once started cART. We compared individuals who met KS-IRIS criteria with those that did not and described the long-term follow-up.We included 89 patients, 88 males; 35 (39%) developed KS-IRIS at a median of 10 weeks (IQR 4-16). KS-IRIS patients had more pulmonary-involvement (60% vs. 16.6% of patients; p < 0.0001), eight died attributed to pulmonary-KS. Thrombocytopenia <100,000/mm3 at follow-up occurred in 36% of KS-IRIS vs. 4% in non-KS-IRIS patients (p = 0.0002), 45% KS-IRIS patients with thrombocytopenia died, non without KS-IRIS. Chemotherapy (bleomicyn-vincristine) was more frequently prescribed in KS-IRIS patients (88.6% vs. 29.6%) with no differences in outcome; 80% of all patients achieve KS complete remission, 52% of them never received chemotherapy. No difference between groups in the long-term follow-up (mean 52.4 ± 27.4 months) was found, only one patient developed a secondary malignancy (1.12%).Lung-involvement was predictive of IRIS development. Thrombocytopenia in KS-IRIS patients at week 12 follow-up after cART initiation was associated with high mortality. Over a third of patients with KS achieve remission without chemotherapy. Individuals that survive the initial period of KS-IRIS adhere to cART had a good long-term prognosis.",

    "abstract": "In resource limited settings non-availability of CD4 count facility at the site could adversely affect the ART roll out programme. Point of care CD4 enumerating equipments can make the CD4 count available at the site of care and improve the patients' management considerably. This study is aimed at determining the utility of a Point of Care PIMA CD4 analyzer (Alere, Germany) in the field settings in India. The blood samples were collected from 1790 participants at 21 ART centers from different parts of the country and tested using PIMA and the reference methods (FACSCalibur, FACSCount and CyFlow SL3). The paired finger prick and venous blood samples from 175 participants were tested by the PIMA CD4 Analyzer and then by FACSCalibur. The CD4 counts obtained by PIMA CD4 analyzer showed excellent correlation with the counts obtained by the reference methods; for venous blood the Pearson's r was 0.921, p < 0.001 and the relative bias was 0.2% (range: -42 to 42%) and for finger prick samples, the Pearson's r was 0.856 and the relative bias was −9.1% (range: -46% to 27%). For CD4 ranges; <250, 251–350, 351–500 and >500 cells/mm3, the differences in the median CD4 counts obtained by the reference method and the PIMA analyzer were not significant (P > 0.05) and the relative bias were low (−7 to 5.1%). The Intermachine comparison showed variation within the acceptable limit of%CV of 10%. In the field settings, the POC PIMA CD4 analyzer gave CD4 counts comparable to the reference methods for all CD4 ranges. The POC equipment could identify the patients eligible for ART in 91% cases. Adequate training is necessary for finger prick sample collection for optimum results. Decentralization of CD4 testing by making the CD4 counts available at primary health centers, especially in remote areas with minimum or no infrastructure would reduce the missed visits and improve adherence of the patients.",

    "abstract": "Despite progress in the development of combined antiretroviral therapies (cART), HIV infection remains a significant challenge for human health. Current problems of cART include multi-drug-resistant virus variants, long-term toxicity and enormous treatment costs. Therefore, the identification of novel effective drugs is urgently needed.We developed a straightforward screening approach for simultaneously evaluating the sensitivity of multiple HIV gag-pol mutants to antiviral drugs in one assay. Our technique is based on multi-colour lentiviral self-inactivating (SIN) LeGO vector technology.We demonstrated the successful use of this approach for screening compounds against up to four HIV gag-pol variants (wild-type and three mutants) simultaneously. Importantly, the technique was adapted to Biosafety Level 1 conditions by utilising ecotropic pseudotypes. This allowed upscaling to a large-scale screening protocol exploited by pharmaceutical companies in a successful proof-of-concept experiment.The technology developed here facilitates fast screening for anti-HIV activity of individual agents from large compound libraries. Although drugs targeting gag-pol variants were used here, our approach permits screening compounds that target several different, key cellular and viral functions of the HIV life-cycle. The modular principle of the method also allows the easy exchange of various mutations in HIV sequences. In conclusion, the methodology presented here provides a valuable new approach for the identification of novel anti-HIV drugs.",

    "abstract": "Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has significantly reduced HIV morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. However, the sustainability of cART may be compromised by the emergence of viral drug resistance mutations (DRM) and the cellular persistence of proviruses carrying these DRM. This is potentially a more serious problem in resource limited settings. DRM were evaluated in individuals with unsuppressed viral loads after first or multiple lines of cART at two sites in rural Limpopo, South Africa. Seventy-two patients with viral loads of >1000 copies/ml were recruited between March 2014 and December 2015. Complete protease (PR) and partial Reverse Transcriptase (RT) sequences were amplified from both plasma RNA and paired proviral DNA from 35 of these subjects. Amplicons were directly sequenced to determine subtype and DRM using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Interpretation algorithm. Among the 72 samples, 69 could be PCR amplified from RNA and 35 from both RNA and DNA. Sixty-five (94.2%) viruses were subtype C, while one was subtype B (1.4%), one recombinant K/C, one recombinant C/B and one unclassified. Fifty-eight (84%) sequences carried at least one DRM, while 11 (15.9%) displayed no DRM. DRM prevalence according to drug class was: NRTI 60.8% NNRTI 65.2%, and PI 5.8%. The most common DRMs were; M184V (51.7%), K103N (50%), V106M (20.6%), D67N (13.3%), K65R (12%). The frequency of the DRM tracked well with the frequency of use of medications to which the mutations were predicted to confer resistance. Interestingly, a significant number of subjects showed predicted resistance to the newer NNRTIs, etravirine (33%) and rilpivirine (42%), both of which are not yet available in this setting. The proportion of DRM in RNA and DNA were mostly similar with the exception of the thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) D67N, K70R, K219QE; and K103N which were slightly more prevalent in DNA than RNA. Subjects who had received cART for at least 5 years were more likely to harbour >2 DRM (p < 0.05) compared to those treated for a shorter period. DRM were more prevalent in this rural setting compared to a neighbouring urban setting. We found a very high prevalence of NRTI and NNRTI DRM in patients from rural Limpopo settings with different durations of treatment. The prevalence was significantly higher than those reported in urban settings in South Africa. The dominance of NNRTI based mutations late in treatment supports the use of PI based regimens for second line treatment in this setting. The slight dominance of TAMs in DNA from infected PBMCs compared to plasma virus requires further studies that should include cART subjects with suppressed virus. Such studies will improve our understanding of the pattern of drug resistance and dynamics of viral persistence in these rural settings.",

Simultaneously, abundant unintegrated DNAs (uDNAs), are formed in cells ubiquitously. The uDNAs either undergo recombination or degradation or persist inactively for long periods in the nucleus as future resources. Among them, 2-LTR circles are considered a dead-end for viral spread. Their contribution to the HIV-1 infection is still poorly understood. Nevertheless, the preintegration transcription of the aberrant DNAs and the consequent alterations of cellular factors have already been reported. Since the major fate of the viral genome is to persist as episomal DNA, precise characterization is required for studying the biology of HIV-1. This review compiles the biochemical and genetic updates on uDNA in the HIV-1 life cycle and could provide direction to further study of their roles in HIV-1 replication and application in HIV-1 pathogenesis.",

In HIV infected patients several factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular problems: life-style, metabolic parameters, genetic predisposition, viral factors, immune activation, chronic inflammation and side effects of antiretroviral therapy. The same factors may also contribute to complicate the clinical management of these patients.

We undertook a study to determine the prevalence of occult hepatitis B infection among HIV infected individuals visiting a health facility in South West Cameroon and characterized occult HBV strains based on sequence analyses.Plasma samples (n = 337), which previously tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), were screened for antibodies against hepatitis B core (anti-HBc) and surface (anti-HBs) antigens followed by DNA extraction. A 366 bp region covering the overlapping surface/polymerase gene of HBV was then amplified in a nested PCR and the amplicons sequenced using Sanger sequencing. The resulting sequences were then analyzed for genotypes and for escape and drug resistance mutations.Twenty samples were HBV DNA positive and were classified as OBI giving a prevalence of 5.9%. Out of these, 9 (45%) were anti-HBs positive, while 10 (52.6%) were anti-HBc positive. Additionally, 2 had dual anti-HBs and anti-HBc reactivity, while 6 had no detectable HBV antibodies. Out of the ten samples that were successfully sequenced, nine were classified as genotype E and one as genotype A. Three sequences possessed mutations associated with lamivudine resistance. We detected a number of mutations within the major hydrophilic region of the surface gene where most immune escape mutations occur.Findings from this study show the presence of hepatitis B in patients without any of the HBV serological markers. Further prospective studies are required to determine the risk factors and markers of OBI.",

    "abstract": "Thailand has the highest prevalence of HIV among countries in Asia but has also been a pioneer in HIV prevention and treatment efforts in the region, reducing the incidence of new infections significantly over the last two decades. Building upon this remarkable history, Thailand has set an ambitious goal to stop the AIDS epidemic in the country by 2030. A key component of the strategy to achieve this goal includes scale-up of HIV screening programs to facilitate early HIV diagnosis and investment in mechanisms to support immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Initiation of ART during early or acute HIV infection not only reduces viremia, thereby halting onward transmission of HIV, but also may facilitate HIV remission by reducing the size of the latent HIV reservoir and preserving immune function. In Thailand, many efforts have been made to reduce the time from HIV infection to diagnosis and from diagnosis to treatment, especially among men who have sex with men and transgender women. Successfully identifying and initiating ART in individuals with acute HIV infection has been leveraged to conduct groundbreaking studies of novel strategies to achieve HIV remission, including studies of broadly-neutralizing HIV-specific monoclonal antibodies and candidate therapeutic vaccines. These efforts have mostly been deployed in Bangkok and future efforts should include other urban and more rural areas. Continued progress in HIV prevention, screening, and treatment will position Thailand to substantially limit new infections and may pave the way for an HIV cure.",

    "abstract": "Adherence and CD4 cell count change measure the progression of the disease in HIV patients after the commencement of HAART. Lack of information about associated factors on adherence to HAART and CD4 cell count reduction is a challenge for the improvement of cells in HIV positive adults. The main objective of adopting joint modeling was to compare separate and joint models of longitudinal repeated measures in identifying long-term predictors of the two longitudinal outcomes: CD4 cell count and adherence to HAART.A longitudinal retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the joint predictors of CD4 cell count change and adherence to HAART among HIV adult patients enrolled in the first 10 months of the year 2008 and followed-up to June 2012. Joint model was employed to determine joint predictors of two longitudinal response variables over time. Furthermore, the generalized linear mixed effect model had been used for specification of the marginal distribution, conditional to correlated random effect.A total of 792 adult HIV patients were studied to analyze the longitudinal joint model study. The result from this investigation revealed that age, weight, baseline CD4 cell count, ownership of cell phone, visiting times, marital status, residence area and level of disclosure of the disease to family members had significantly affected both outcomes. From the two-way interactions, time * owner of cell phone, time * sex, age * sex, age * level of education as well as time * level of education were significant for CD4 cell count change in the longitudinal data analysis. The multivariate joint model with linear predictor indicates that CD4 cell count change was positively correlated (p ≤ 0.0001) with adherence to HAART. Hence, as adherence to HAART increased, CD4 cell count also increased; and those patients who had significant CD4 cell count change at each visiting time had been encouraged to be good adherents.Joint model analysis was more parsimonious as compared to separate analysis, as it reduces type I error and subject-specific analysis improved its model fit. The joint model operates multivariate analysis simultaneously; and it has great power in parameter estimation. Developing joint model helps validate the observed correlation between the outcomes that have emerged from the association of intercepts. There should be a special attention and intervention for HIV positive adults, especially for those who had poor adherence and with low CD4 cell count change. The intervention may be important for pre-treatment counseling and awareness creation. The study also identified a group of patients who were with maximum risk of CD4 cell count change. It is suggested that this group of patients needs high intervention for counseling.",

In all TB cases, advancing age, co-infection with HIV, a prior history of TB and the presence of both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB were independently associated with an increasing hazard of death. In HIV-infected TB cases, advancing age and female gender were independently associated with an increasing hazard of death. Increasing CD4 counts and antiretroviral treatment during TB treatment were protective against death. In HIV-uninfected TB cases, advancing age was independently associated with death, whereas smear-positive disease was protective.We identified several independent predictors of death during TB treatment in resource-constrained settings. Our findings inform resource-constrained settings about certain subgroups of TB patients that should be targeted to improve mortality during TB treatment.",

    "abstract": "The development of HIV related pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) reduces the probability of survival by half as compared with HIV-infected individuals without HIV related PAH. HIV infected patients have a greater incidence of PAH compared to general population and have a 2500-fold increased risk of developing PAH. It is therefore important to have a recent overview of the problem in Africa, the most HIV affected part of the world (70 % of all HIV infection in the world). First, we discussed the epidemiology of HIV-related PAH in Africa. Second, the current understanding of the HIV-related PAH pathogenesis has been covered. Third, role of highly active antiretroviral therapy on HIV-related PAH has been revisited. There are few data concerning epidemiology of HIV related pulmonary hypertension in Africa leading to necessity to conduct further prospective large studies. The prevalence of PAH among HIV infected people in Africa varies from 5 to 13 %. The prevalence of HIV-related PAH in Africa is notably high compared to those in developed countries and in general population. The pathogenesis of PAH is clearly complex, and probably results from the interaction of multiple modulating genes with environmental factors. The physiopathology includes cytokines secretion increase which induces dysregulation of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell growth and imbalance of endogenous vasodilators and constrictors; HIV viral proteins which induces vascular oxidative stress, smooth myocyte proliferation and migration, and endothelial injury and genetic predisposition due to some major histocompatibility complex alleles, particularly HDL-DR6 and HLA-DR5. Histologically, HIV related PAH has the same characteristics with other types PAH. Antiretroviral therapy have a beneficial effect on the outcome of HIV related pulmonary hypertension, but it lacks evidence from large prospective studies.",

Adults (≥18 years) who started salvage ART between July 2007 and December 2011 were included. Salvage ART was defined by inclusion of darunavir or tipranavir in an ART regimen after having failed another PI. For Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis, patients were followed up until event, or censored at death (only for virologic outcomes), leaving the programme, or April 2014.152 patients were included. Subtype was known for 113 patients: 111 (98 %) were infected with subtype C. All 152 had a genotype resistance test demonstrating major PI resistance mutations. Salvage drugs included were: darunavir/ritonavir (n = 149), tipranavir/ritonavir (n = 3), raltegravir (n = 58), and etravirine (n = 8). Median follow-up was 2.5 years (IQR = 1.5-3.3). 82.9 % achieved a viral load ≤400 copies/ml and 71.1 % ≤50 copies/ml. By the end of the study 17 (11.2 %) of the patients had died. The KM estimate of cumulative survival was 87.2 % at 2000 days.Virologic suppression was comparable to that demonstrated in clinical trials and observational studies of salvage ART drugs conducted in other regions. Few deaths occurred during short term follow-up. Third-line regimens for patients with multidrug resistant subtype C HIV in Africa are virologically and clinically effective.",

    "abstract": "Expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to improved HIV/AIDS treatment outcomes in Nigeria, however, increasing rates of loss to follow-up among those on ART is threatening optimal standard achievement. Therefore, this retrospective cross-sectional study is aimed at identifying correlates and predictors of loss to follow-up in patients commencing ART in a large HIV program in Nigeria.Records of all patients from 432 US CDC Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supported facilities across 10 States and FCT who started ART from 2004 to 2017 were used for this study. Bivariate and multivariate analysis of the demographic and clinical parameters of all patients was conducted using STATA version 14 to determine correlates and predictors of loss to follow-up.Within the review period, 245,257 patients were ever enrolled on anti-retroviral therapy. 150,191 (61.2%) remained on treatment, 10,960 (4.5%) were transferred out to other facilities, 6926 (2.8%) died, 2139 (0.9%) self-terminated treatment and 75,041 (30.6%) had a loss to follow-up event captured. Males (OR: 1.16), Non-pregnant female (OR: 4.55), Patients on ≥ 3-monthly ARV refills (OR: 1.32), Patients with un-suppressed viral loads on ART (OR: 4.52), patients on adult 2nd line regimen (OR: 1.23) or pediatric on 1st line regimen (OR: 1.70) were significantly more likely to be lost to follow-up.Despite increasing access to anti-retroviral therapy, loss to follow-up is still a challenge in the HIV program in Nigeria. Differentiated care approaches that will focus on males, non-pregnant females and paediatrics is encouraged. Reducing months of Anti-retroviral drug refill to less than 3 months is advocated for increased patient adherence.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic has undoubtedly increased the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) globally, posing a formidable global health challenge affecting 1.2 million cases. Pulmonary TB assumes utmost significance in the programmatic perspective as it is readily transmissible as well as easily diagnosable. HIV complicates every aspect of pulmonary tuberculosis from diagnosis to treatment, demanding a different approach to effectively tackle both the diseases. In order to control these converging epidemics, it is important to diagnose early, initiate appropriate therapy for both infections, prevent transmission and administer preventive therapy. Liquid culture methods and nucleic acid amplification tests for TB confirmation have replaced conventional solid media, enabling quicker and simultaneous detection of mycobacterium and its drug sensitivity profile Unique problems posed by the syndemic include Acquired rifampicin resistance, drug–drug interactions, malabsorption of drugs and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome or paradoxical reaction that complicate dual and concomitant therapy. While the antiretroviral therapy armamentarium is constantly reinforced by discovery of newer and safer drugs every year, only a few drugs for anti tuberculosis treatment have successfully emerged. These include bedaquiline, delamanid and pretomanid which have entered phase III B trials and are also available through conditional access national programmes. The current guidelines by WHO to start Antiretroviral therapy irrespective of CD4+ cell count based on benefits cited by recent trials could go a long way in preventing various complications caused by the deadly duo. This review provides a consolidated gist of the advancements, concepts and updates that have emerged in the management of HIV-associated pulmonary TB for maximizing efficacy, offering latest solutions for tackling drug–drug interactions and remedial measures for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.",

Neuropsychiatric adverse events (NP-AEs) have been reported with DTG but neuropsychiatric symptoms have not been systemically quantified using structured scales. This study examined mood and cognitive parameters before and after a planned transition from non-DTG to DTG-based ART within a longitudinal study of acute HIV infection (AHI).RV254 AHI cohort participants on ≥ 24 weeks of ART initiated at AHI underwent sequential assessments before and after the switch including: (1) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a 9-item survey (scores 0-27) that evaluates somatic and affective/cognitive symptoms of depression; (2) a 2-Questions screening that has been validated locally for depression; (3) Distress Thermometer (scores 0-10); and 4) administration of a 4-test neurocognitive battery sensitive to HIV.254 individuals (95% male, median age 30) switched to a DTG-based regimen after a median 144 weeks of ART. Serial assessments were completed at a median of 19 weeks before and 37 weeks after DTG. There was a modest but statistically significant increase in PHQ-9 scores after DTG (pre-switch: 5 [IQR 1-7] vs. Post-switch: 5 [IQR 2-8], p = 0.009). The percentage of participants with at least moderate depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) increased from 10 to 16% (p = 0.006), but the frequency of moderate-severe depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 15) remained unchanged (3%). No volunteer reported NP-AEs within the study period. Somatic symptoms of depression increased more than cognitive/affective symptoms. Plasma viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50; p = 0.005) and PHQ-9 ≥ 10 (p < 0.001) before switch were linked to lower PHQ-9 scores after DTG in multivariable analysis. Performance on all neuropsychological tests, except grooved pegboard test, improved modestly after DTG (all p < 0.05).After a median duration of 37 weeks of DTG use, there was a modest increase in the higher quartile of PHQ-9. This increase was associated with a rise in moderate depression symptoms but not the more severe forms of depression on PHQ-9. No clinically relevant NP-AEs were reported. Pre-existing depression was not associated with subsequent worsening of symptoms after DTG. Cognitive test performance improved post-DTG but could be due to practice effect.",

CD38 has broad and complex functions, including enzymatic activity, intercellular signal transduction, cell activation, cytokine production, receptor function and adhesion activity, and it plays an important role in the physiological and pathological processes of many diseases. Many studies have shown that CD38 is related to the occurrence and development of HIV infection, and CD38 may regulate its progression through different mechanisms. Therefore, investigating the role of CD38 in HIV infection and the potential signaling pathways that are involved may provide a new perspective on potential treatments for HIV infection. In the present review, the current understanding of the roles CD38 plays in HIV infection are summarized. In addition, the specific role of CD38 in the process of HIV infection of human CD4 + T lymphocytes is also discussed.",

Efforts have been made to reduce HIV/AIDS-related morbidity and mortality by delivering antiretroviral therapy. However, the incidence and predictors of mortality in border areas like Metema were not investigated. This study aimed to assess predictors of mortality rate among adult HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy at Metema Hospital. Methods Retrospective follow-up study was employed among ART patients from January 1, 2013, to December 30, 2018. Data were entered in Epi-data 3.1 and exported to STATA 14 for analysis. Kaplan–Meier and Log-Rank test was used to compare survival differences among categories of different variables. In bi-variable analysis p-values &lt; 0.20 were entered into a multivariable analysis. Multivariate Weibull model was used to measure the risk of death and identify the significant predictors of death. Variables that were statistically significant at p-value &lt; 0.05 were concluded as predictors of mortality. Result A total of 542 study participants were included. The overall incidence rate was 6.7 (95% CI: 5.4–8.4) deaths per 100 person-years of observation. Being male (HR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.24–4.62), STAGE IV (HR = 5.64; 95% CI: 2.53–12.56), stage III (HR = 3.31; 95% CI: 1.35–8.10), TB-coinfection (HR = 3.71; 95% CI: 1.59–8.64), low hemoglobin (HR = 4.14; 95% CI: 2.18–7.86), BMI ≤ 15.4 kg/m 2 (HR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.17–5.10) and viral load &gt; 1000 copy/ml (HR = 6.70; 95% CI: 3.4–13.22) were found to be a significant predictor for mortality among HIV patients on ART treatment. Conclusion The incidence of death was high. Being male, viral load, those with advanced STAGE (III &amp; IV), TB co-infected, low BMI, and low hemoglobin were at a higher risk of mortality. Special attention should be given to male patients and high public interventions needed among HIV patients on ART to reduce the mortality rate.",

Therefore, evaluation of survival is needed in the current setting. We retrospectively analyzed secondary data of the national AIDS program database from national health security region number 4 among PLWH who were ART-naive between January 2014 and December 2018. All PLWH were followed until December 2019 to evaluate their survival status and possible risk factors related to death. A total of 42,229 PLWH were identified, of which 14,053 were ART-naive and thus enrolled in the study. Sixty-seven percent were male, the mean ± SD age was 35 ± 12 years, and the median (IQR) baseline CD4 count was 162 (44-353) cells/mm3. Regarding medical care benefits, 46% had a universal health coverage scheme, 34% had a national social security scheme, and 2% had a civil servants medical benefit scheme. A total of 2142 (15%) mortalities occurred during the total follow-up period of 28,254 patient-years. The mortality rate was 7.5 (95% CI 7.2-7.9) per 100 person-years. Survival rates at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after HIV registration were 88.2% (95% CI 87.6-88.7%), 85.3% (95% CI 84.6-85.9%), 82.9% (95% CI 81.9-83.4%), 81.3% (95% CI 80.5-82.0%) and 75.1% (95% CI 73.5-76.8%), respectively. The Cox proportional hazards model showed that all-cause mortality was associated with a history of ART switching (HR = 7.06, 95% CI 4.53-11.00), major opportunistic infections during ART (HR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.35-2.77), baseline CD4 count ≤ 200 vs. > 500 cells/mm3 (HR = 4.00, 95% CI 1.45-11.11), age ≥ 50 vs. < 30 years (HR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.12-2.78), and receiving nevirapine-based regimens(HR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.04-1.97). This study demonstrated the substantial mortality rate over the consecutive 5 years of the follow-up period among PLWH who received ART in a resource-limited setting. Early case finding and prompt initiation of ART as well as continuous HIV care are a cornerstone to improve survival.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background South Africa, with one of the highest HIV prevalences in the world, introduced the universal test and treat (UTT) programme in September 2016. Barriers to sustained viral suppression may include drug resistance in the pre-treated population, non-adherence, acquired resistance; pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and concurrent use of alternative treatments. Objective The purpose of this review is to highlight potential challenges to achieving sustained viral load suppression in South Africa (SA), a major expectation of the UTT initiative. Methodology Through the PRISMA approach, published articles from South Africa on transmitted drug resistance; adherence to ARV; host genetic factors in drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and interactions between ARV and herbal medicine were searched and reviewed. Results The level of drug resistance in the pre-treated population in South Africa has increased over the years, although it is heterogeneous across and within Provinces. At least one study has documented a pre-treated population with moderate (&gt; 5%) or high (&gt; 15%) levels of drug resistance in eight of the nine Provinces. The concurrent use of ARV and medicinal herbal preparation is fairly common in SA, and may be impacting negatively on adherence to ARV. Only few studies have investigated the association between the genetically diverse South African population and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ARVs. Conclusion The increasing levels of drug resistant viruses in the pre-treated population poses a threat to viral load suppression and the sustainability of first line regimens. Drug resistance surveillance systems to track the emergence of resistant viruses, study the burden of prior exposure to ARV and the parallel use of alternative medicines, with the goal of minimizing resistance development and virologic failure are proposed for all the Provinces of South Africa. Optimal management of the different drivers of drug resistance in the pre-treated population, non-adherence, and acquired drug resistance will be beneficial in ensuring sustained viral suppression in at least 90% of those on treatment, a key component of the 90-90-90 strategy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background World Health Organization (WHO) reports that people who indulge in risky behaviours such as penile-anal sex, unprotected intercourse, multiple sex partners, and alcohol and illicit drugs are at risk of HIV/AIDS and classified as Key Populations (KPs). Since the introduction of PrEP and HIVST for the key population groups in Nigeria, government entities and implementing partners have used a range of channels in messaging these essential services across to the target groups—ranging from in-person, social media, television, and radio adverts. Yet, few successes have been documented, thereby necessitating the need to understand the enabling facilitators, barriers to, and communication needs of the KP groups in messaging PrEP and HIVST services in Nigeria. Communicating PrEP and HIVST services will empower the key populations to seek available HIV prevention services and help to increase access to HIV testing services in Nigeria. Methods This study was a mixed-method cross-sectional design; involving 1169 participants from the key populations in Nigeria. The study used a survey and qualitative exploratory methods (interviews and focus group discussion), to collect data from the participants—MSM, FSWs, and key influencers of the KP groups (health providers, peer educators, HIV program officers). In August 2020, data collection was conducted using an open data kit (ODK). Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 for descriptive statistics, while qualitative data were analyzed using deductive and thematic analysis based on the codebook. Results The KPs were mainly urban dwellers (77.7%), and the majority of the participants were between 18 to 28 years (89.3%). However, the MSM group was of a younger population compared to the FSWs. A majority completed secondary education (56.1% FSWs and 43.5% MSM). The MSM group showed more tendency to acquire higher education compared to the FSWs. For example, about 51.3% of the MSM group were undergraduates compared to 9.5% of the FSWs. The majority of the KPs were self-employed (56.4% FSWs and 40% MSM). Only about 51% of the KPs were aware of PrEP, with typological variations (39.9% FSWs and 62.3% MSM). MSM group in Lagos (82.5%) were more aware of PrEP services, than 53.1% and 54.5% in A/Ibom (53.1%) and C/River (54.5%). Among the enablers to acquiring PrEP information was the ability of the KPs to network within their communities and on personal relationships. Evidence shows that no single approach influenced the acquisition and use of PrEP information by KPs. Although this proportion varied across the geographic locations, only about 50% of the KPs were aware of HIVST services (40% FSWs and 60% MSM). The factors that enabled the acquisition and use of the prevention commodities were cross-cutting, including a previous or current role as a peer educator, integration of the messages, peer networking, multi-lingual and multi-channel presentation, job aids, and reminders. KPs expressed the need for information on how to take PrEP, eligibility, clarification on differences between PrEP and PEP, clarification on any side effects, for PrEP, price, efficacy, sales point, dosage, available brands. A scale-up of the research across all geopolitical zones and a survey to quantify the prevalence would help understand the dynamics and prioritization of interventions for scaling up PrEP and HIVST services in Nigeria. Conclusions The study documented barriers and facilitators to the uptake of PrEP and HIVST among key populations in Nigeria. It highlighted that KPs are willing to receive PrEP and HIVST messages. The policy actors should consider the preferences of the KPs and the key influencers in reducing barriers to communication and increasing the uptake of PrEP and HIVST services; ensure it reflects in a tailored communication strategy. Since multi-linguistics and multi-channels of presentation were enablers to acquiring PrEP and HIVST messages, the communications strategy for HIV prevention should incorporate these recommendations and adapt to context-specific approaches for effective messaging.",

    "abstract": "Reduction of the reservoir of latent HIV-infected cells might increase the possibility of long-term remission in individuals living with HIV. We investigated factors associated with HIV-1 proviral DNA levels in children receiving different antiretroviral therapy (ART) strategies in the children with HIV early antiretroviral therapy (CHER) trial.Infants with HIV < 12 weeks old with CD4% ≥ 25% were randomized in the CHER trial to early limited ART for 40 or 96 weeks (ART-40 W, ART-96 W), or deferred ART (ART-Def). For ART-Def infants or following ART interruption in ART-40 W/ART-96 W, ART was started/re-started for clinical progression or CD4% < 25%. In 229 participants, HIV-1 proviral DNA was quantified by PCR from stored peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children who had received ≥ 24 weeks ART and two consecutive undetectable HIV-1 RNA 12-24 weeks apart. HIV-1 proviral DNA was compared between ART-Def and ART-96 W at week 96, and in all arms at week 248. Factors associated with HIV-1 proviral DNA levels were evaluated using linear regression.Longer duration of ART was significantly associated with lower HIV-1 proviral DNA at both 96 (p = 0.0003) and 248 weeks (p = 0.0011). Higher total CD8 count at ART initiation was associated with lower HIV-1 proviral DNA at both 96 (p = 0.0225) and 248 weeks (p = 0.0398). Week 248 HIV-1 proviral DNA was significantly higher in those with positive HIV-1 serology at week 84 than those with negative serology (p = 0.0042).Longer ART duration is key to HIV-1 proviral DNA reduction. Further understanding is needed of the effects of \"immune-attenuation\" through early HIV-1 exposure.Wellcome Trust, National Institutes of Health, Medical Research Council.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Adolescents are lagging behind in the “third 95” objective of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS requiring 95% of individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) to have viral load (VL) suppression. This study aimed to describe factors associated with viral non-suppression among adolescents in Mbale district, Uganda. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of routinely collected HIV programme records. Data such as age, education, ART Regimen, ART duration, WHO Clinical stage, comorbidities, etc., were extracted from medical records for the period January 2018 to December 2018. Descriptive analysis was done for continuous variables using means and frequencies to describe study sample characteristics, and to determine the prevalence of outcome variables. We used logistic regression to assess factors associated with VL non-suppression among adolescents. Results The analysis included 567 HIV-infected adolescents, with 300 (52.9%) aged between 13 to 15 years, 335 (59.1%) female, and mean age of 15.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 13.5–17.8. VL non-suppression was 31.4% (178/567). Male sex (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.06, 2.99; p &lt; 0.01), age 16–19 years (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.06, 2.99; p &lt; 0.05), No formal education (AOR = 3.67, 95% CI 1.48–9.09; p &lt; 0.01), primary education (AOR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.05–2.32; p &lt; 0.01), ART duration of &gt; 12 months to 5 years (AOR = 3.20, 95% CI 1.31–7.82; p &lt; 0.05), ART duration &gt; 5 years (AOR = 3.47, 95% CI 1.39– 8.66; p &lt; 0.01), WHO Clinical Stage II (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82; p &lt; 0.01), second-line ART regimen (AOR = 2.38, 95% CI 1.53–3.72; p &lt; 0.001) and comorbidities (AOR = 3.28, 95% CI 1.20–9.00; p &lt; 0.05) were significantly associated with viral non-suppression . Conclusions VL non-suppression among adolescents was almost comparable to the national average. VL non-suppression was associated with being male, age 16–19 years, education level, duration on ART therapy, WHO Clinical Staging II, second-line ART regimen, and presence of comorbidities. Adolescent-friendly strategies to improve VL suppression e.g. peer involvement, VL focal persons to identify and actively follow-up non-suppressed adolescents, patient education on VL suppression and demand creation for ART are needed, especially for newly-initiated adolescents and adolescents on ART for protracted periods, to foster attainment of the UNAIDS 95–95–95 targets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a novel prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), has become the preferred drug for the treatment of HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis B infection in clinical practice. Results from clinical trials showed that it had better renal and bone mineral outcomes compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). However, as we have seen with TDF, side effects from the new medication can be more prevalent and recognized after extensive use in real world situations. Sporadic cases of acute kidney injury in patients using TAF have started to emerge. Case presentation We report a case of 49-year-old Thai, HIV treatment-experienced female with hypertension presented with worsening renal function after switching her antiretroviral regimen from TDF, emtricitabine (FTC), and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) to TAF, FTC and dolutegravir (DTG) for 3 months. Kidney biopsy showed distinctive picture of tenofovir nephrotoxicity with acute tubular injury and mitochondrial injury. The possible causes of acute kidney injury and nephrotoxicity from TAF for this patient were discussed. We have extensively reviewed all published case reports of TAF-associated nephrotoxicity and summarized the essential information in this article. Conclusion Although TAF has less nephrotoxicity compared with TDF; renal function should always be monitored after the initiation of both drugs. Future large cohort studies are required to identify the risk factors of TAF-associated nephrotoxicity and to design an effective preventive strategy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Retention in clinical care is important for people living with HIV (PLWH). Evidence suggests that missed clinic visits are associated with interruptions in antiretroviral therapy (ART), lower CD4 counts, virologic failure, and overlooked coinfections. We identified factors associated with missed routine clinic visits in the African Cohort Study (AFRICOS). Methods In 2013, AFRICOS began enrolling people with and without HIV in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria. At enrollment and every 6 months thereafter, sociodemographic questionnaires are administered and clinical outcomes assessed. Missed clinic visits were measured as the self-reported number of clinic visits missed in the past 6 months and dichotomized into none or one or more visits missed. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between risk factors and missed visits. Results Between January 2013 and March 2020, 2937 PLWH were enrolled, of whom 2807 (95.6%) had initiated ART and 2771 had complete data available for analyses. Compared to PLWH 50+, missed clinic visits were more common among those 18–29 years (aOR 2.33, 95% CI 1.65–3.29), 30–39 years (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.19–2.13), and 40–49 years (aOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07–1.89). As compared to PLWH on ART for &lt; 2 years, those on ART for 4+ years were less likely to have missed clinic visits (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55–0.95). Missed clinic visits were associated with alcohol use (aOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.05–1.70), a history of incarceration (aOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07–1.88), depression (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13–1.91), and viral non-suppression (aOR 2.50, 95% CI 2.00–3.12). As compared to PLWH who did not miss any ART in the past month, missed clinic visits were more common among those who missed 1–2 days (aOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.65–2.64) and 3+ days of ART (aOR 7.06, 95% CI 5.43–9.19). Conclusions Inconsistent clinic attendance is associated with worsened HIV-related outcomes. Strategies to improve visit adherence are especially needed for young PLWH and those with depression.",

    "abstract": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a proven biomedical strategy to prevent HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). Despite oral PrEP is safe and effective in MSM, the use of PrEP has been discouraging, especially in high-risk MSM. And there are no relevant studies showing the use of PrEP in high-risk MSM. The purpose of this study was to get the rate of PrEP use and the factors influencing PrEP use among high-risk MSM.A cross-sectional study was conducted through an electronic questionnaire on the \"i guardian Platform\", and \"snowballing\" method was used to recruit MSM in six cities in China, including Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Changsha, Jinan and Nanjing in China, from January to April 2021. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the factors associated with the use of PrEP among high-risk MSM who had heard about PrEP.Among the 1865 high-risk MSM who had heard of PrEP, the rates of those who were willing to use PrEP, had knowledge awareness of PrEP, and had used PrEP were 96.7%, 24.7%, and 22.4%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of PrEP use in high-risk MSM showed that more PrEP was used by those who were 26 years or older (OR = 1.86, 95%CI 1.17 ~ 2.99), had master degree or above (OR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.21 ~ 4.72), had unstable work (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.16 ~ 2.96), had tested five or more HIV times in the past year (OR = 3.09, 95% CI 1.65 ~ 6.04), had consulted PrEP (OR = 22.05, 95% CI 14.87 ~ 33.91) and had PrEP knowledge awareness (OR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.41 ~ 2.55) (P < 0.05).The rate of PrEP use in high-risk MSM was relatively low. PrEP was used more by high-risk MSM with unstable jobs, higher education, frequent HIV testing, and PrEP counseling. Public education on PrEP for MSM should continue to be enhanced to help them use PrEP in a timely and accurate manner.",

This cross-sectional study explores factors associated with ART adherence among stable people living with HIV on ART in Cambodia.We used baseline survey data from a quasi-experimental study conducted in 2021. The participants were recruited from 20 ART clinics in nine provinces for face-to-face interviews. A structured questionnaire collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, ART adherence, perceived ART self-efficacy, mental health, quality of life, stigma, and discrimination. We conducted bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with ART adherence.Out of the 4101 participants, 86.5% reported adhering to ART in the past two months. The adjusted odds of ART adherence were significantly higher among participants in older age groups than those aged 15-29, participants with elevated cholesterol than those without it, participants who exhibited strong self-efficacy in health responsibility to maintain life than those with poor self-efficacy in health responsibility, participants who scored < 3 on the stigma and discrimination scale than those who scored ≥ 3, participants who scored ≥ 42 on the mental component of the quality-of-life scale than those who scored < 42. The adjusted odds of ART adherence were significantly lower in participants who earned > 301 USD per month than those who earned ≤ 100 USD per month.The ART adherence rate among stable people living with HIV in this study was comparable to that of the general people living with HIV in Cambodia. The results suggest the need for innovative interventions to further reduce stigma and discrimination and strategies to improve the self-efficacy and mental health of people living with HIV to improve ART adherence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Low-adherence to Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) negatively affects the clinical, immunological, and virologic outcomes of patients. Adherence is the most important factor in determining Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) treatment success and long-term viral suppression which ultimately reduces morbidity and mortality. Thus, this study aimed to identify factors affecting adherence to antiretroviral therapy among adolescents and youth living with HIV. Methods Facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 21 to April 30, 2020 among 316 respondents in selected five high-loaded hospitals with adolescent and youth clients using systematic random sampling technique. Patients’ adherence was assessed when they had reportedly taken 95% or higher of their prescribed antiretroviral drugs in the five days before the interview. Data were collected, entered into EPI Data and exported to SPSS for analysis. Binary logistic regression was used to see the association between dependent and independent variables. Results In this study, 316 respondents participated in the study, with a 99.7% response rate. The mean age of respondents were 17.94 years and majority of them (58.5%) were females. The overall ART adherence among adolescents and youths was found to be 70.6%. Being female (AOR = 0.323, 95% CI, 0.164–0.637), presence of opportunistic infection (AOR = 0.483, 95% CI, 0.249–0.936), taking additional medication beside ART (AOR = 0.436, 95% CI, 0.206–0.922) and availability of youth friendly services within the facility (AOR = 2.206, 95% CI, 1.031–4.721) were found to be predictors. Conclusion The adherence rate in this study was low which is below the recommended adherence level. Being female, taking additional medication beside ART and presence of opportunistic infection were determinants of adherence. As a result, significant work must be done on opportunistic infection prevention through health education and promotion for screening and risk reduction. Similarly, adolescents and youths service integration with the ART Clinic is strongly advised.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background As children living with HIV transition from adolescence into adulthood, they face a considerable burden of psychiatric disorders (PDs) which may vary between the perinatally and behaviorally infected. The knowledge of the pattern of these PDs in relation to the varying needs of the adolescents living with HIV (ALWHIV) is unclear but necessary for maximizing their linkage to care and improving their quality of life in Botswana. Aim To determine the pattern of PDs in ALWHIV in Botswana; to compare and explore the differences in the pattern and their associated factors between congenitally infected adolescents (CIAs) and behaviorally infected adolescents (BIAs). Methods A cross-sectional survey of 622 ALWHIV (399 CIA and 223 BIA) with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Kid Screen. Results The participants' mean age (SD) was 17.71 (1.60) years, with more males (54%), of whom 52.9% had at least one PD, with depression (23.6%) and generalised anxiety disorder (18.0%) being the most prevalent. The externalising disorders were associated with being CIA (OR = 3.99; 95% CI:1.87–8.54), male gender (OR = 3.93; 95% CI:2.02–7.64), and a viral load of 400 and above copies (OR = 3.53; 95%CI:1.92–6.48). Internalising disorders were associated with being BIA (OR = 3.64; 95%; CI: 2.39–5.56), females (OR = 2.59; 95% CI:1.75–3.83), poor counselling (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.42–3.51) and struggling to accept HIV status (OR = 1.73; 95% CI:1.14–2.62). Conclusions Depression and anxiety disorders were the most prevalent PDs in ALWHIV, who differed in psychiatric presentations, the BIAs being more likely to present with internalizing disorders, while the CIAs had more externalizing disorders. Due to the varying needs of ALWHIV, individualized management plans that consider gender, mode of infection, and other psycho-social needs, should be further studied and encouraged.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Poor adherence and under-utilization of antiretroviral therapy (ART) services have been major setbacks to achieving 95-95-95 policy goals in Sub-Saharan Africa. Social support and mental health challenges may serve as barriers to accessing and adhering to ART but are under-studied in low-income countries. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of interpersonal support and depression scores with adherence to ART among persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the Volta region of Ghana. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 181 PLWH 18 years or older who receive care at an ART clinic between November 2021 and March 2022. The questionnaire included a 6-item simplified ART adherence scale, the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the 12-item Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12 (ISEL-12). We first used a chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test to assess the association between these and additional demographic variables with ART adherence status. We then built a stepwise multivariable logistic regression model to explain ART adherence. Results ART adherence was 34%. The threshold for depression was met by 23% of participants, but it was not significantly associated with adherence in multivariate analysis(p = 0.25). High social support was reported by 48.1%, and associated with adherence (p = 0.033, aOR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.09–5.88). Other factors associated with adherence included in the multivariable model included not disclosing HIV status (p = 0.044, aOR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.03–4.54) and not living in an urban area (p = 0.00037, aOR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.11–0.52). Conclusion Interpersonal support, rural residence, and not disclosing HIV status were independent predictors of adherence to ART in the study area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV partner disclosure rates remain low among pregnant women living with HIV in many African countries despite potential benefits for women and their families. Partner disclosure can trigger negative responses like blame, violence, and separation. Women diagnosed with HIV late in pregnancy have limited time to prepare for partner disclosure. We sought to understand challenges around partner disclosure and non-disclosure faced by women diagnosed with HIV late in pregnancy in South Africa and Uganda and to explore pathways to safe partner disclosure. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with pregnant women and lactating mothers living with HIV ( n = 109), disaggregated by antenatal care (ANC) initiation before and after 20 weeks of gestation, male partners ( n = 87), and health workers ( n = 53). All participants were recruited from DolPHIN2 trial sites in Kampala (Uganda) and Gugulethu (South Africa). Topic guides explored barriers to partner disclosure, effects of non-disclosure, strategies for safe disclosure. Using the framework analysis approach, we coded and summarised data based on a socio-ecological model, topic guides, and emerging issues from the data. Data was analysed in NVivo software. Results Our findings illustrate pregnant women who initiate ANC late experience many difficulties which are compounded by the late HIV diagnosis. Various individual, interpersonal, community, and health system factors complicate partner disclosure among these women. They postpone or decide against partner disclosure mainly for own and baby’s safety. Women experience stress and poor mental health because of non-disclosure while demonstrating agency and resilience. We found many similarities and some differences around preferred approaches to safe partner disclosure among female and male participants across countries. Women and male partners preferred healthcare workers to assist with disclosure by identifying the ‘right’ time to disclose, mentoring women to enhance their confidence and communication skills, and providing professional mediation for partner disclosure and couple testing. Increasing the number of counsellors and training them on safe partner disclosure was deemed necessary for strengthening local health services to improve safe partner disclosure. Conclusion HIV diagnosis late in pregnancy amplifies existing difficulties among pregnant women. Late ANC initiation is an indicator for the likelihood that a pregnant woman is highly vulnerable and needs safeguarding. Respective health programmes should be prepared to offer women initiating ANC late in pregnancy additional support and referral to complementary programmes to achieve safe partner disclosure and good health.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Young female sex workers (YFSWs) face a higher risk of HIV infection compared to older workers, but there is a lack of comprehensive data on their sexual practices and HIV infection risks, which may present unique challenges and vulnerabilities. The study aimed to identify high-risk sexual practices associated with HIV infection among YFSWs in Lubumbashi. Methods We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study and used a comprehensive sample of all YFSWs who presented to the HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infections Screening and Treatment Center in Lubumbashi between April 2016 and December 2017. We collected data on socio-demographic characteristics and behavioral risk factors of female sex workers were collected using a structured questionnaire. Using STATA version 16, multivariate logistic regression was fitted and the results were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results A total of 572 YFSWs were included in the study, 19 of whom were HIV-positive (3.3%; 95% CI: 2.1–5.1%). Participants who were forced to have sex (aOR = 12.2; 95% CI: 3.2–46.4; p &lt; 0.0001), those who did not use condoms systematically (aOR = 4.1; 95% CI: 1.3–13.0; p = 0.018), and those who had anal sex (aOR = 23.8; 95% CI: 6.9–82.4; p &lt; 0.0001) were more likely to be HIV-positive. Conclusion The study reveals a concerning trend of higher hospital HIV prevalence among YFSWs compared to the general Congolese population. It also highlights a significant link between high-risk sexual practices and HIV infection, highlighting the need for urgent interventions.",

This study aimed to determine whether certain ART medications are more \"forgiving\" of poor adherence in achieving viral suppression. We identified subgroups of ART medication usage and determined the extent to which ART adherence is associated with viral suppression across those subgroups. Data came from claims and clinical records (2017–2019) of 3,552 HIV-positive adult members of a Medicaid managed care plan. Pharmacy fill data were examined to characterize ART medications using latent class analysis (LCA), which captures the complexity of real-world ART usage (i.e., multiple medications, ART switching). LCA yielded five ART medication patterns over three years, mostly characterized by recent medications and formulations of ART, though they varied in number of tablets and in medication class. Mixed effects logistic regression models were estimated to determine whether odds of viral suppression differed by ART adherence level. After adjusting for covariates, those with at least 90% adherence (i.e., 90 to < 95%) did not significantly differ from those with 95% adherence or greater in terms of viral suppression, which corroborates existing clinical recommendations. These findings can inform provider-patient communication for people with HIV, especially those who have difficulty maintaining adherence. This includes those experiencing unstable housing, mental health conditions, or substance use.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid disorders have significant clinical sequelae, including impaired growth in children, metabolic abnormalities, and impaired cognitive function. However, available studies on burden of thyroid diseases in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly its prevalence and its interaction with HIV related factors (like CD4 count), are controversial. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary and analysis on the extent of thyroid dysfunctions in this population. Following Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a comprehensive search was done through Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and World Health Organization Virtual Health Library Regional Portal. Using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software version 3.3, we calculated the pooled prevalence and standardized mean difference (SMD) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 30 studies met the eligibility criteria and were further included for the analyses. The most common types of thyroid dysfunction identified among HIV patients were subclinical hypothyroidism (7.7%), overt hypothyroidism (2.7%), sick euthyroid syndrome (2.47%), isolated low FT4 (1.80%), and overt hyperthyroidism (0.7%). Hypothyroidism among HIV patients was significantly associated with lower CD4 count (p < 0.001). The analysis revealed that only FT4 levels had significant differences between patients with HIV and healthy people (p = 0.013). Individuals with HIV are at risk of developing variable manifestations of thyroid abnormalities. While being not abundant in the HIV population, monitoring of thyroid dysfunction is essential due to the potential for progression to overt hypothyroidism and associated adverse health outcomes.",

Dietary management in people with HIV patients is the key to sustaining their day-to-day activities and contributing to their lively hood. The level of dietary diversity among HIV-positive patients in Ethiopia shows considerable variation, ranging from 29 to 71.3%. This study aimed to assess the pooled prevalence of low dietary diversity and associated factors among HIV-positive patients attending ART clinics in Ethiopia. Multiple international database searching methods (articles found in PubMed/MEDLINE, Google scholar Africa, Hinari journal online, Embase, Scopus) and Ethiopian university repository online have been covered in this systemic review and meta-analysis. Data were extracted using Microsoft excel and analyzed by using the Stata version 14 software program. The heterogeneity between studies and publication bias was detected by using the I2 test and a funnel plot test respectively. The pooled prevalence of low dietary diversity among People with HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy in Ethiopia was 55.9% 95% CI (45.73, 66.09) based on the random effect analysis. This systemic review and meta-analysis showed that only HIV positive patients with an antiretroviral therapy duration of less than one year (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.3, 4.1), and having low wealth quintile (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.5, 4.4) were factors significantly associated with low dietary diversity among People with HIV patients on ant-retroviral therapy clinics of Ethiopia. The overall pooled prevalence of low dietary diversity among People with HIV patients attending antiretroviral therapy clinics in Ethiopia was high. We strongly recommend holistic nutritional interventions to address nutritional problems and promote the overall health status of HIV-positive patients in Ethiopia.",

We conducted a multi-center study in Mwanza, Tanzania to (1) describe causes of hospitalization for PLWH on DTG; (2) determine in-hospital and 3-month post-hospital mortality; (3) examine factors associated with overall mortality; and (4) determine changes in trends and predictors of mortality pre- and post-DTG era. Between August 2020 and February 2021, hospitalized PLWH on dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy were enrolled and followed for three months after hospitalization. The primary outcome was mortality within 3-months of hospitalization. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios to identify predictors of mortality. Of the 154 enrolled patients, the median [interquartile range] age was 42 [33-50] years and 57% were female. Suspected immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-adherence leading to an HIV-associated admission were common. The overall all-cause mortality was 42%. Male sex, using DTG-based regimen for < 3 months, diagnosis of suspected IRIS, diagnosis of ART side effect, advanced WHO clinical stage, CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3, hemoglobin level 7-11.9 gm/dl and hemoglobin level < 7 gm/dl were all independent risk factors for death. In conclusion, the mortality rate of hospitalized PLWH in Africa remains high in the DTG era. Clinical trials are urgently needed to test novel interventions for improving survival in this high-risk group. In the meantime, hospital clinicians should be aware of the very high mortality among PLWH with IRIS and those with ART side effect to ensure that all possible diagnostic and therapeutic options are explored.",

    "abstract": "Anal cancer incidence is increased in people with HIV (PWH), up to 60 times higher in men who have sex with men, and almost 15 times higher among women with HIV. Screening and treating high-grade lesions (HSIL) have proven to reduce the incidence of invasive anal cancer. In 2020, we started implementing a high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) clinic at INCan, a tertiary care oncologic center, as part of a screening program for PWH from the HIV clinic. We describe the barriers and difficulties in implementing an HRA Clinic from January 2020 to April 2021, including physician training, the certification process, discrepancies between cytology and histopathologist results, and the lack of experience of gastrointestinal pathologists in HPV-related lesions. During the first 18 months of the HRA clinic implementation, 124 studies were performed, and 85 biopsies were done. The prevalence of HSIL was 22%. Initially, when a gastrointestinal pathologist reviewed anal canal biopsies, a second opinion was requested from a genitourinary pathologist who examined 72 of the biopsies; there were discrepancies in the diagnosis in 61% of the cases, with more advanced intraepithelial lesions in 43% of cases. Specifically, gastrointestinal pathologists missed 68% of HSILs. The difficulties we faced were not having access to adequate anoscopes. Training and certification are a long way to go. Also, women's reachability was low. Diagnosis and management of anal HSIL have become a standard of care in the prevention of Anal Carcinoma in PWIH, the population with the highest incidence of this neoplasia. Implementing HRA programs requires correct supplies and equipment, which are not always locally available; investing in physicians' training and an experienced pathologist in HPV-associated lesions interpretation is also imperative. More advocacy is needed for HIV programs to incorporate and invest in anal cancer screening.",

Some countries have successfully eliminated HIV infections among newborn babies. This study was nested within the DRIBS (Drug Resistance testing among Infants at Baseline Study), which enrolled 100 infants at the time of treatment initiation between 2017 and 2023. Infants were followed for two years. Viral load (VL) was measured every six months and after completion of the three sessions of intensified adherence counseling (IAC). IAC and HIV drug resistance testing were performed for VL greater than 1000 copies/ml. The median age at diagnosis was 79 (IQR, 57.75;140.75) days, with 4% of patients diagnosed within 6 weeks after delivery. The median age at the initiation of therapy was 110.5 (IQR, 87.0–162.0) days. The median baseline %CD4 was 26 (IQR, 18.75;32), with 9% of the babies being severely immunosuppressed (%CD4 < 15%). The median baseline log viral load was 4.44 (IQR, 3.19–5.58). At six months, 30% and 60% of the patients had a VL < 50 and < 1000 copies/ml, respectively. At 12 months, 36% and 69% of patients had a VL < 50 and < 1000 copies/ml, respectively. At 24 months, 63% and 83% had VL < 50 and < 1000 copies/ml, respectively. Post-IAC VL revealed that 35% of the children had low-level viremia (LLV) compared to mothers 11.5%. Kaplan-Meyer survival estimates showed that while it took 72 weeks for 50% of the mothers and infants to attain a VL less than 1000 copies/ml, it took 96 weeks for the infants to attain a VL < 50 copies/ml. A Viral load < 1000 copies/ml is achieved much more slowly in pediatric patients, implying that it might take longer for babies to achieve the third 95 (95% virally suppressed) of the UNAIDS targets. Furthermore, the greater prevalence of LLV in pediatric patients than in mothers has important implications for the response to therapy.",

Hence, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of HIV Self-Testing (HIVST) and associated factors among Female sex workers in Waliso Town in Central Ethiopia. Method A community-based Cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 October–November 30, 2023, among female sex workers using snowball sampling. A total of 400 participants were included in the study. Data was collected using pre-tested, structured self-administered, and interviewer-administered questionnaires using face-to-face interviews. A binary logistic regression model was fitted using SPSS version 26 to identify factors associated with HIV self-testing. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR), 95% confidence interval, and a p -value &lt; 0.05 was used to judge the statistically significant variables. Results The prevalence of HIV self-testing among female sex workers in Waliso town was found to be 37% (95% CI: 32, 42). Education status (attended high school and above) (AOR = 7.62[95% CI 2.55,24.67], marital status (divorced) (AOR = 2.1[95% CI 1.23,3.6], those whose both parents dead (AOR = 2.72[95% CI 1.4,5.28] and before sex whether they asked their partner test status (AOR = 0.17[95% CI 0.07,0.37] were statistically significant. Conclusion This study revealed that HIV self-tests among female sex workers were lower than the 95% national target. Education status, marital status, parent`s living status and knowing the partner HIV status before sex were found to be predictors of HIV self-test. Our findings underscore the need to develop evidence-based strategies to improve HIV testing uptake by FSWs and improve community-based services.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background To evaluate long-term changes in weight and metabolic parameters in people with HIV-1 (PWH) initiating first-line antiretroviral therapy. Methods Analysis of two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials (1489: NCT02607930; 1490: NCT02607956). PWH received bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) or dolutegravir (DTG)-based treatment (Study 1489: dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine [DTG/ABC/3TC]; Study 1490: DTG + F/TAF) for 144 weeks, followed by B/F/TAF (96-week open-label extension up to Week 240). Weight and metabolic parameters were assessed through Week 144 by randomized treatment assignment. Weight changes by baseline viral load and CD4 count were evaluated in PWH receiving B/F/TAF from baseline through Week 240. Multivariate modeling explored baseline factors associated with absolute weight and weight change through Week 240 and weight gain ≥ 10% at Week 240. Results Median weight and body mass index (BMI) increased over time with B/F/TAF ( n = 628), DTG/ABC/3TC ( n = 315), and DTG + F/TAF ( n = 325). There were no significant differences in change in weight or BMI between the B/F/TAF and DTG + F/TAF groups or between the B/F/TAF and DTG/ABC/3TC groups at Week 144 in either trial, nor were there differences in other metabolic parameters, including incidence of treatment-emergent diabetes mellitus and hypertension through Week 144. Among PWH receiving B/F/TAF (baseline through Week 240), weight increases were greatest soon after initiating antiretroviral therapy (i.e., Weeks 0–48), particularly in participants with baseline viral load &gt; 100,000 copies/ml and/or CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/µl. In multivariate modeling (B/F/TAF pooled data), lower baseline CD4 count and higher HIV-1 RNA were associated with lower baseline weight and greater weight gain, but not absolute weight, from Week 48 through Week 240. Conclusions No significant difference in weight change from baseline to Week 144 was found between bictegravir and DTG, or between B/F/TAF and a non-TAF-containing regimen, in these two randomized trials. Furthermore, weight gain following treatment initiation was greatest in the first year of treatment and most pronounced in individuals with more advanced HIV at baseline, supporting the hypothesis that weight gain following initial treatment is linked to a “return to health” in people with advanced HIV.",

    "abstract": "Achieving and maintaining viral suppression and optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy are crucial for improving health outcomes in general population of people living with HIV. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of monetary incentives on these key treatment goals. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching the Cochrane Library, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus databases from inception to March 2025. We included randomized controlled trials comparing monetary incentives with routine care in people living with HIV. The primary outcomes were viral suppression and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. This study was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42024524374). Thirteen randomized controlled trials were included. Compared with routine care, monetary incentives significantly improved viral suppression (OR = 1.39,95%CI: 1.11, 1.74); p = 0.004; I²=42%), adherence to antiretroviral therapy (OR = 1.62,95%CI: 1.13,2.31; p = 0.008; I²=30%) and retention in care (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.57; p = 0.03; I²=9%). The difference in CD4 + T-cell counts between groups did not reach statistical significance (SMD = -38.90, 95% CI: -77.35 to -0.45; p = 0.05), with low heterogeneity (I² = 28%). Monetary incentives effectively improve viral suppression and adherence to antiretroviral therapy among people living with HIV. Integrating monetary incentives into HIV care models could be a promising strategy to optimize treatment outcomes. Further research is needed to assess the long-term sustainability and cost-effectiveness of such interventions.",

Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the light chain of the neurofilament protein (NFL) can serve as a sensitive indicator of central nervous system (CNS) injury. To assess whether interrupting antiretroviral treatment of HIV infection might have a deleterious effect on the CNS, we measured NFL levels in HIV-infected subjects interrupting therapy. We identified subjects who had CSF HIV RNA concentrations below 50 copies/mL at the time combination antiretroviral therapy was interrupted, and for whom CSF samples were available before and after the interruption.A total of 8 subjects were studied. The median (range) CSF NFL level at baseline was <125 (<125-220) ng/L (normal <250 ng/L). All 8 subjects exhibited an increase in CSF and plasma HIV RNA after stopping therapy, accompanied by intrathecal immunoactivation as evidenced by CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (7/8 patients) and increased CSF neopterin concentration (5/6 patients). Three subjects showed a consistent increase in CSF NFL, rising from <125 ng/L to a maximum of 880 (at day 148), 1,010 (day 58) and 10,930 ng/L (day 101). None exhibited new neurological symptoms or signs, or experienced functional deterioration during the period off treatment; of 5 who underwent brief quantitative neurological testing, none showed worsening performance.These findings suggest that resurgence of active HIV replication may result in measurable, albeit subclinical, CNS injury. Further studies are needed to define the frequency and pathobiological importance of the increase in CSF NFL.",

Total lymphocyte counts (TLCs) have not proven sufficiently accurate in identifying subjects with low CD4 counts. We developed clinical algorithms using TLCs, hemoglobin (Hb), and body mass index (BMI) to identify patients who require ART. We conducted a cross-sectional study of HIV-infected adults in Uganda, who presented for assessment for ART-eligibility with WHO clinical stages I, II or III. Two by two tables were constructed to examine TLC thresholds, which maximized sensitivity for CD4 cell counts ≤ 200 cells μL, while minimizing the number offered ART with counts > 350 cells μL. Hb and BMI values were then examined to try to improve model performance. 1787 subjects were available for analysis. Median CD4 cell counts and TLCs, were 239 cells/μL and 1830 cells/μL, respectively. Offering ART to all subjects with a TLCs ≤ 2250 cells/μL produced a sensitivity of 0.88 and a false positive ratio of 0.21. Algorithms that treated all patients with a TLC <2000 cells/μL, excluded all patients with a TLC >3000 cells/μL, and used Hb and/or BMI values to determine eligibility for those with TLC values between 2000 and 3000 cells/μL, marginally improved accuracy. TLCs appear useful in predicting who would be eligible for ART based on CD4 cell count criteria. Hb and BMI values may be useful in prioritizing patients for ART, but did not improve model accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the consequent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has protean manifestations, including muscle wasting and cardiomyopathy, which contribute to its high morbidity. The pathogenesis of these myopathies remains partially understood, and may include nutritional deficiencies, biochemical abnormalities, inflammation, and other mechanisms due to viral infection and replication. Growing evidence has suggested that HIV-1-related proteins expressed by the host in response to viral infection, including Tat and gp120, may also be involved in the pathophysiology of AIDS, particularly in cells or tissues that are not directly infected with HIV-1. To explore the potentially independent effects of HIV-1-related proteins on heart and skeletal muscles, we used a transgenic rat model that expresses several HIV-1-related proteins (e.g., Tat, gp120, and Nef). Outcome measures included basic heart and skeletal muscle morphology, glutathione metabolism and oxidative stress, and gene expressions of atrogin-1, muscle ring finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) and Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGFβ1), three factors associated with muscle catabolism. Consistent with HIV-1 associated myopathies in humans, HIV-1 transgenic rats had increased relative heart masses, decreased relative masses of soleus, plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles, and decreased total and myosin heavy chain type-specific plantaris muscle fiber areas. In both tissues, the levels of cystine (Cyss), the oxidized form of the anti-oxidant cysteine (Cys), and Cyss:Cys ratios were significantly elevated, and cardiac tissue from HIV-1 transgenic rats had altered glutathione metabolism, all reflective of significant oxidative stress. In HIV-1 transgenic rat hearts, MuRF-1 gene expression was increased. Further, HIV-1-related protein expression also increased atrogin-1 (~14- and ~3-fold) and TGFβ1 (~5-fold and ~3-fold) in heart and plantaris muscle tissues, respectively. We provide compelling experimental evidence that HIV-1-related proteins can lead to significant cardiac and skeletal muscle complications independently of viral infection or replication. Our data support the concept that HIV-1-related proteins are not merely disease markers, but rather have significant biological activity that may lead to increased oxidative stress, the stimulation of redox-sensitive pathways, and altered muscle morphologies. If correct, this pathophysiological scheme suggests that the use of dietary thiol supplements could reduce skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction in HIV-1-infected individuals.",

Hence, assessment of safety and acceptability among HIV positive men and women is important. Acceptability of Carraguard, the Population Council's lead microbicide candidate was assessed in a Phase I safety study among healthy HIV-positive sexually abstinent women and men, and sexually active women (20 per group), in Durban, South Africa. Participants were randomized to use Carraguard gel, placebo gel, or no product. All women in the gel arms applied 4 ml gel vaginally every evening for 14 intermenstrual days (women in the sexually active group inserted gel within 1 hour prior to sex on days when sex occurred), and sexually abstinent men applied gel directly to the penis every evening for 7 days. Acceptability was assessed by face-to-face structured questionnaires and semi-structured in-depth interviews with all participants. Gel use questions were applicable to participants in the gel arms only (13 sexually abstinent women, 14 sexually active women, and 13 abstinent men).Overall, 93% of the women liked the study gel (Carraguard or placebo) very much, 4% disliked it somewhat, and 4% were neutral. 15% of men and women disliked the gel's color, smell, or packaging. Most women and men reported never experiencing pain or irritation during or after gel application. Although over two thirds of the women preferred some lubrication during sex, some of the women felt that the gel was frequently too wet. Twenty-one percent of women and 42% of men said they felt covert use of a microbicide would be acceptable. Over 60% of women and men would prefer to use a microbicide alone instead of using it with a condom.Acceptability of Carraguard among HIV-positive women and men in Durban was good. The wetness experienced by the women may be attributed to the delivery of gel volume. The applicator was designed to deliver 4 mls whereas in fact between 4 ml to 5 mls were actually dispensed. Condom migration in the event of a partially effective product is of concern.",

In this study markers of inflammation and coagulation in HIV-infected patients using antiretroviral therapy with or without ABC were examined to pinpoint a pathogenic mechanism. Given the important role of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels in predicting cardiovascular risk, patient groups were also analyzed according to hsCRP levels. Patients treated with ABC and a matched control group treated without ABC were selected retrospectively. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and markers of endothelial cell activation (von Willebrand factor (vWF), factor VIII), fibrin formation (fibrinogen, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), endogenous thrombin potential (ETP)), anticoagulation markers (protein C and S, activated protein C sensitivity ratio (APCsr)) and inflammation markers (IL-6, hsCRP) were measured in citrated plasma. A total of 81 patients were included of whom 27 patients used an ABC-containing regimen and 54 used a non-ABC-containing regimen. Patient characteristics were not significantly different between the groups except for longer duration of use of the current antiretroviral regimen in the ABC group (p = 0.01). The median time on ABC was 68 months (interquartile range 59-80 months). No differences in coagulation and inflammation markers according to ABC use were observed. For the whole patient group elevated vWF and F1+2 levels were observed in 23% and 37%, respectively. Compared to the reference ranges for the general population increased APCsr was found in 79% and lower protein C and VEGF levels in 40% and 43%, respectively. Patients in the high-risk category for cardiovascular disease with hsCRP levels > 3 mg/L had significantly higher fibrinogen, D-dimer, F1+2 and ETP levels compared to patients from the low-risk category with hsCRP levels < 1 mg/L. HIV-infected patients using ABC showed no specific abnormalities in coagulation or inflammation markers that might explain the increased risk of myocardial infarction. For the whole group, regardless of ABC use, evidence of a prothrombotic state was observed. Thirty-three percent of patients with long-term use of antiretroviral treatment had hsCRP levels above 3 mg/L, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease in HIV-uninfected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Adequate antiretroviral drug potency is essential for obtaining therapeutic benefit, however, the behavioral aspects of proper adherence and readiness to medication, often determine therapeutic outcome. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the level and determinants of nonadherence and nonreadiness to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) at Gondar University Teaching Hospital and Felege Hiwot Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted between July and September 2008 using structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. All consecutive adult outpatients who were receiving antiretroviral treatment for at least three months, seen at both hospitals during the study period and able to give informed consent were included in the study. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with nonadherence and nonreadiness.A total of 504 study subjects were included in this study. The prevalence rates of nonadherence and nonreadiness to HAART were 87 (17.3%) and 70 (13.9%) respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that medication adverse effects, nonreadiness to HAART, contact with psychiatric care service and having no goal had statistically significant association with nonadherence. Moreover, unwillingness to disclose HIV status was significantly associated with nonreadiness to HAART.In this study the level of nonadherence and nonreadiness to HAART seems to be encouraging. Several factors associated with nonadherance and nonreadiness to HAART were identified. Efforts to minimize nonadherence and nonreadiness to HAART should be integrated in to regular clinical follow up of patients.",

    "abstract": "Among HIV-infected persons initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), early CD4+ lymphocyte count increases are well described. However, whether CD4+ levels continue to increase or plateau after 4-6 years is controversial.To address this question and identify other determinants of CD4+ response, we analyzed data for 1,846 persons from a prospective HIV military cohort study who initiated HAART, who had post-HAART CD4+ measurements, and for whom HIV seroconversion (SC) date was estimated.CD4+ count at HAART initiation was ≤ 200 cells/mm3 for 23%, 201-349 for 31%, 350-499 for 27%, and ≥500 for 19%. The first 6 months post-HAART, the greatest CD4+ increases (93-151 cells) occurred, with lesser increases (22-36 cells/year) through the first four years. Although CD4+ changes for the entire cohort were relatively flat thereafter, HIV viral load (VL) suppressors showed continued increases of 12-16 cells/year. In multivariate analysis adjusting for baseline CD4+ and post-HAART time interval, CD4+ responses were poorer in those with: longer time from HIV SC to HAART start, lower pre-HAART CD4+ nadir, higher pre-HAART VL, and clinical AIDS before HAART (P < 0.05).Small but positive long-term increases in CD4+ count in virally suppressed patients were observed. CD4+ response to HAART is influenced by multiple factors including duration of preceding HIV infection, and optimized if treatment is started with virally suppressive therapy as early as possible.",

The immune system's role in HIV infected patients is complex with cytokine expression strongly influencing HIV infection and replication.We determined the expression patterns of 10 cytokines by Luminex multi-analyte profiling in 17 IRIS nested case-control pairs participating in a prospective South African cohort initiating anti-retroviral therapy.Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) expression was significantly elevated in IRIS cases compared to controls (median 9.88 pg/ml versus 2.68 pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.0057), while other cytokines displayed non-significant differences in expression. Significant correlation was observed between IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ expression in the IRIS patients.Significantly increased expression levels of IFN-γ suggest that this cytokine possibly plays a role in IRIS pathology and is a potential diagnostic marker.",

    "abstract": "Separately, chronic alcohol ingestion and HIV-1 infection are associated with severe skeletal muscle derangements, including atrophy and wasting, weakness, and fatigue. One prospective cohort study reported that 41% of HIV-infected patients met the criteria for alcoholism, however; few reports exist on the co-morbid effects of these two disease processes on skeletal muscle homeostasis. Thus, we analyzed the atrophic effects of chronic alcohol ingestion in HIV-1 transgenic rats and identified alterations to several catabolic and anabolic factors.Relative plantaris mass, total protein content, and fiber cross-sectional area were reduced in each experimental group compared to healthy, control-fed rats. Alcohol abuse further reduced plantaris fiber area in HIV-1 transgenic rats. Consistent with previous reports, gene levels of myostatin and its receptor activin IIB were not increased in HIV-1 transgenic rat muscle. However, myostatin and activin IIB were induced in healthy and HIV-1 transgenic rats fed alcohol for 12 weeks. Catabolic signaling factors such as TGFβ1, TNFα, and phospho-p38/total-p38 were increased in all groups compared to controls. There was no effect on IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in control-fed, transgenic rats. However, the co-morbidity of chronic alcohol abuse and HIV-1-related protein expression decreased expression of the two anabolic factors, CT-1 and CNTF.Consistent with previous reports, alcohol abuse accentuated skeletal muscle atrophy in an animal model of HIV/AIDS. While some catabolic pathways known to drive alcoholic or HIV-1-associated myopathies were also elevated in this co-morbid model (e.g., TGFβ1), consistent expression patterns were not apparent. Thus, specific alterations to signaling mechanisms such as the induction of the myostatin/activin IIB system or reductions in growth factor signaling via CT-1- and CNTF-dependent mechanisms may play larger roles in the regulation of muscle mass in alcoholic, HIV-1 models.",

We selected 14 articles that compared the sexual behavior of people with and without ART for this analysis.We included both cross-sectional studies that compared different ART-naïve and ART-experienced participants and longitudinal studies examining the behavior of the same individuals pre- and post-ART start. Meta-analyses were performed both stratified by type of study and combined. Outcome variables assessed for association with ART experience were any sexual activity, unprotected sex and having multiple sexual partners. Random-effect models were applied to determine the overall odds ratios. Sub-group analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed to examine sources of heterogeneity among the studies. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the stability of the overall odds ratio in the presence of outliers.The meta-analysis failed to show a statistically significant association of any sexual activity with ART experience. It did, however, show an overall statistically significant reduction of any unprotected sex, having multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex with HIV negative or unknown HIV status with ART experience. Meta-regression showed no interaction between duration of ART use or recall period of sexual behavior with the sexual activity variables. However, there was an association between the percentage of married or cohabiting participants included in a study and reductions in the practice of unprotected sex with ART.In general, this meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in risky sexual behavior among people on ART in sub-Saharan Africa. Future studies should investigate the reproducibility and continuity of the observed positive behavioural changes as the duration of ART lasts a decade or more.",

To study the frequency, clinical presentation and outcome of paradoxical tuberculosis associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) in HIV infected patients in a TB hospital in North India. A retrospective chart review of HIV-infected TB patients on anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) at time of ART initiation over a 3 year period. Medical records were reviewed for clinical manifestations and outcome in patients who developed TB-IRIS. 514 HIV-infected patients were enrolled between January 2006 and December 2008. Thirteen (12.6%) of 103 patients who had received ART and ATT simultaneously developed paradoxical TB-IRIS. Clinical presentations of paradoxical TB-IRIS included new lymphadenopathy (n = 3), increase in size of existing lymphadenopathy (n = 3), worsening of existing pulmonary lesions (n = 2), appearance of new pleural effusion (n = 1) and prolonged high grade fever (n = 2). Four patients developed new tubercular meningitis as manifestation of TB-IRIS. Our cases developed TB-IRIS a median of 15 days after starting ART (IQR 15–36). TB-IRIS patients were older (> 35 years) than those with no IRIS (P = 0.03), but were not distinguishable by CD4 T-cell count, duration of ATT before ART or the outcome of TB treatment. Eight (62%) patients had a complete recovery while 5 (38%) patients with TB-IRIS died, of which majority (n = 3) had meningitis. Paradoxical TB-IRIS is a frequent problem during concomitant ATT and ART in HIV-TB co infected patients in north India. Meningitis is a potentially life threatening manifestation of TB-IRIS.",

The reasons for hospitalization have changed; OIs are no longer the most common reason for admission. This study describes the patient population, admission diagnosis and hospital course of HIV patients in Colombia in the ART era.Patients admitted with HIV/AIDS at six hospitals in Medellin, Colombia between August 1, 2014 and July 31, 2015 were included. Demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were prospectively collected.551 HIV-infected patients were admitted: 76.0% were male, the median age was 37 (30-49). A new diagnosis of HIV was made in 22.0% of patients during the index admission. 56.0% of patients of the entire cohort had been diagnosed with HIV for more than 1 year and 68.9% were diagnosed in an advanced stage of the disease. More than 50.0% of patients had CD4 counts less than 200 CD4 cells/μL and viral loads greater than 100,000 copies. The main reasons for hospital admissions were OIs, tuberculosis, esophageal candidiasis and Toxoplasma encephalitis. The median hospital stay was 14 days (IQR 8-23). Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was required in 10.3% of patients and 14.3% were readmitted to the hospital; mortality was 5.4%.Similar to other countries in the developing world, in Colombia, the leading cause of hospitalization among HIV-infected patients remain opportunistic infections. However, in-hospital mortality was low, similar to those described for high-income countries. Strategies to monitor and optimize the adherence and retention in HIV programs are fundamental to maximize the benefit of ART.",

However, it is not currently used for routine CSF testing in China. Knowledge of CNS opportunistic infections among people living with HIV in China is limited.Intensive cerebrospiral fluid (CSF) testing was performed to evaluate for bacterial, viral and fungal etiologies. Pathogen-specific primers were used to detect DNA from cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and John Cunningham virus (JCV) via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Cryptococcal meningitis accounted for 63.0% (34 of 54) of all causes of meningitis, 13.0% (7/54) for TB, 9.3% (5/54) for Toxoplasma gondii. Of 54 samples sent for viral PCR, 31.5% (17/54) were positive, 12 (22.2%) for CMV, 2 (3.7%) for VZV, 1 (1.9%) for EBV, 1 (1.9%) for HHV-6 and 1 (1.9%) for JCV. No patient was positive for HSV. Pathogen-based treatment and high GCS score tended to have a lower mortality rate, whereas patients with multiple pathogens infection, seizures or intracranial hypertension showed higher odds of death.CNS OIs are frequent and multiple pathogens often coexist in CSF. Cryptococcal meningitis is the most prevalent CNS disorders among AIDS. The utility of molecular diagnostics for pathogen identification combined with the knowledge provided by the investigation may improve the diagnosis of AIDS related OIs in resource-limited developing countries, but the cost-efficacy remains to be further evaluated.",

Patient demographic data were obtained via face-to-face interviews using a standardized questionnaire when blood samples were collected. Genotyping of HIV-1 drug resistance (DR) was implemented using an in-house assay.In this study, the overall prevalence of HIV-1 DR was 35.5%. The prevalence of HIV-1 DR in participants experiencing treatment failure and ART-naïve participants was 51.9 and 5.9%, respectively. Mutations in protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-NRTI (NNRTIs), as well as dual and multiple mutations were extensively seen in participants experiencing treatment failure. The proportions of NNRTI mutations (χ2 = 9.689, p = 0.002) and dual mutations in NRTIs and NNRTIs (χ2 = 39.958, p < 0.001) in participants experiencing treatment failure were significantly higher than those in ART-naïve participants. The distributions of M184V/I and M41L mutations differed significantly among three main HIV-1 genotypes identified. Viral load, symptoms in the past 3 months, CD4 counts, transmission route, and the duration of ART were found to be associated with HIV-1 DR.Our results suggest that new prevention and control strategies should be formulated according to the epidemic characteristics of HIV-1-resistant strains in Hebei Province, where antiretroviral drugs are widely used.",

    "abstract": "While HIV, AIDS and atypical Mycobacterium infections are closely linked, the use of Integrase-Inhibitor based cART, notably raltegravir-based regimens is more widespread. RAL should be double-dosed to 800 mg semi-daily in situation of rifampicin co-medication, because RAL is more rapidly metabolized due to rifampicin-induced Uridine-5’-diphosph- gluronosyl-transferase (UGT1A1). Recently, it was speculated that chewed RAL might lead to increased absorption, which might compensate the inductive effect of rifampicin-rapid metabolized RAL, as part of cost-saving effects in countries with high-tuberculosis prevalence and less economic power. We report measurement of raltegravir pharmacokinetics in a 34-year AIDS-patient suffering from disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection with necessity of parenteral rifampicin treatment. RAL levels were measured with HPLC (internal standard: carbamazepine, LLQ 11 ng/ml, validation with Valistat 2.0 program (Arvecon, Germany)). For statistical analysis, a two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples was used. High intra-personal variability in raltegravir serum levels was seen. Comparable Cmax concentrations were found for 800 mg chewed and swallowed RAL, as well as for 400 mg chewed and swallowed RAL. While Cmax seems to be more dependent from overall RAL dosing than from swallowed or chewed tablets, increased AUC12 is clearly linked to higher RAL dosages per administration. Anyway, chewed raltegravir showed a rapid decrease in serum levels. We found no evidence that chewed 400 mg semi-daily raltegravir in rifampicin co-medication leads to optimized pharmacokinetics. There is need for more data from randomized trials for further recommendations.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 entry into host cells is mediated by interactions between the virus envelope glycoprotein (gp120/gp41) and host-cell receptors. N-glycans represent approximately 50% of the molecular mass of gp120 and serve as potential antigenic determinants and/or as a shield against immune recognition. We previously reported that N-glycosylation of recombinant gp120 varied, depending on the producer cells, and the glycosylation variability affected gp120 recognition by serum antibodies from persons infected with HIV-1 subtype B. However, the impact of gp120 differential glycosylation on recognition by broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or by polyclonal antibodies of individuals infected with other HIV-1 subtypes is unknown.Recombinant multimerizing gp120 antigens were expressed in different cells, HEK 293T, T-cell, rhabdomyosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Chinese hamster ovary cell lines. Binding of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies from sera of subtype A/C HIV-1-infected subjects with individual gp120 glycoforms was assessed by ELISA. In addition, immunodetection was performed using Western and dot blot assays. Recombinant gp120 glycoforms were tested for inhibition of infection of reporter cells by SF162 and YU.2 Env-pseudotyped R5 viruses.We demonstrated, using ELISA, that gp120 glycans sterically adjacent to the V3 loop only moderately contribute to differential recognition of a short apex motif GPGRA and GPGR by monoclonal antibodies F425 B4e8 and 447-52D, respectively. The binding of antibodies recognizing longer peptide motifs overlapping with GPGR epitope (268 D4, 257 D4, 19b) was significantly altered. Recognition of gp120 glycoforms by monoclonal antibodies specific for other than V3-loop epitopes was significantly affected by cell types used for gp120 expression. These epitopes included CD4-binding site (VRC03, VRC01, b12), discontinuous epitope involving V1/V2 loop with the associated glycans (PG9, PG16), and an epitope including V3-base-, N332 oligomannose-, and surrounding glycans-containing epitope (PGT 121). Moreover, the different gp120 glycoforms variably inhibited HIV-1 infection of reporter cells.Our data support the hypothesis that the glycosylation machinery of different cells shapes gp120 glycosylation and, consequently, impacts envelope recognition by specific antibodies as well as the interaction of HIV-1 gp120 with cellular receptors. These findings underscore the importance of selection of appropriately glycosylated HIV-1 envelope as a vaccine antigen.",

    "abstract": "The extreme HIV diversity posts a great challenge on development of an effective anti-HIV vaccine. To solve this problem, it is crucial to discover an appropriate immunogens and strategies that are able to prevent the transmission of the diverse viruses that are circulating in the world. Even though there have been a number of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies (bNAbs) been discovered in recent years, induction of such antibodies to date has only been observed in HIV-1 infection. Here, in this mini review, we review the progress in development of HIV vaccine in eliciting broad immune response, especially production of bNAbs, discuss possible strategies, such as polyvalent sequential vaccination, that facilitates B cell maturation leading to bNAb response.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigate the published evidence of outcome and risk of kidney transplantation in HIV-positive patients following the PRISMA guidelines. Methods Searches of PubMed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE identified 27 cohort studies and 1670 case series evaluating the survival of HIV-positive kidney transplant patients published between July 2003 and May 2018. The regimens for induction, maintenance therapy and highly active antiretroviral therapy, acute rejection, patient and graft survival, CD4 count and infectious complications were recorded. We evaluated the patient survival and graft survival at 1 and 3 years respectively, acute rejection rate and also other infectious complications by using a random-effects analysis. Results At 1 year, patient survival was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95; 0.98), graft survival was 0.91 (95% CI 0.88; 0.94), acute rejection was 0.33 (95% CI 0.28; 0.38), and infectious complications was 0.41 (95% CI 0.34; 0.50), and at 3 years, patient survival was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90; 0.97) and graft survival was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74; 0.87). Conclusions With careful selection and evaluation, kidney transplantation can be performed with good outcomes in HIV-positive patients.",

    "abstract": "Better understanding of drug resistance patterns in HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is required to inform public health policies in high prevalence settings. The aim of this study was to characterise the acquired drug resistance in HIV-infected children failing first-line ART in a decentralised rural HIV programme. Plasma samples were collected from 101 paediatric patients (≤15 yrs of age) identified as failing ART. RNA was extracted from the plasma, reverse transcribed and a 1.3 kb region of the pol gene was amplified and sequenced using Sanger sequencing protocols. Sequences were edited in Geneious and drug resistance mutations were identified using the RegaDB and the Stanford resistance algorithms. The prevalence and frequency of mutations were analysed together with selected clinical and demographic data in STATA v11. A total of 101 children were enrolled and 89 (88%) were successfully genotyped; 73 on a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen and 16 on a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen at the time of genotyping. The majority of patients on an NNRTI regimen (80%) had both nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and NNRTI resistance mutations. M184V and K103N were the most common mutations amongst children on NNRTI-based and M184V among children on PI-based regimens. 30.1% had one or more thymidine analogue mutation (TAM) and 6% had ≥3 TAMs. Only one child on a PI-based regimen harboured a major PI resistance mutation. Whilst the patterns of resistance were largely predictable, the few complex resistance patterns seen with NNRTI-based regimens and the absence of major PI mutations in children failing PI-based regimens suggest the need for wider access to genotypic resistance testing in this setting.",

    "abstract": "CD4 cells are a type of white blood cells that plays a significant role in protecting humans from infectious diseases. Lack of information on associated factors on CD4 cell count reduction is an obstacle for improvement of cells in HIV positive adults. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate baseline factors that could affect initial CD4 cell count change after highly active antiretroviral therapy had been given to adult patients in North West Ethiopia.A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 792 HIV positive adult patients who already started antiretroviral therapy for 1 month of therapy. A Chi square test of association was used to assess of predictor covariates on the variable of interest. Data was secondary source and modeled using generalized linear models, especially Quasi-Poisson regression.The patients' CD4 cell count changed within a month ranged from 0 to 109 cells/mm3 with a mean of 15.9 cells/mm3 and standard deviation 18.44 cells/mm3. The first month CD4 cell count change was significantly affected by poor adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (aRR = 0.506, P value = 2e-16), fair adherence (aRR = 0.592, P value = 0.0120), initial CD4 cell count (aRR = 1.0212, P value = 1.54e-15), low household income (aRR = 0.63, P value = 0.671e-14), middle income (aRR = 0.74, P value = 0.629e-12), patients without cell phone (aRR = 0.67, P value = 0.615e-16), WHO stage 2 (aRR = 0.91, P value = 0.0078), WHO stage 3 (aRR = 0.91, P value = 0.0058), WHO stage 4 (0876, P value = 0.0214), age (aRR = 0.987, P value = 0.000) and weight (aRR = 1.0216, P value = 3.98e-14).Adherence to antiretroviral therapy, initial CD4 cell count, household income, WHO stages, age, weight and owner of cell phone played a major role for the variation of CD4 cell count in our data. Hence, we recommend a close follow-up of patients to adhere the prescribed medication for achievements of CD4 cell count change progression.",

    "abstract": "Psychosocial factors have been linked with loss to follow-up (LTFU) and clinical outcomes among people living with HIV (PLH), however little is known about the effect of psychosocial support on LTFU among PLH in treatment and care. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of NAMWEZA (\"Yes, together we can\") friends' psychosocial support intervention on clinical outcomes and LTFU among PLH. NAMWEZA is based on a novel program using \"appreciative inquiry\", positive psychology approaches to empower, promote positive attitudes and foster hope. PLH participating in the NAMWEZA intervention in HIV care clinics in Dar es Salaam Tanzania were compared with non-exposed PLH obtained from facilities that routinely collect clinical information and both followed longitudinally for 24 months. Baseline sociodemographic, clinical measures (CD4 cell count, hemoglobin (HGB), weight), and LTFU measures were collected. Chi square, Fisher's exact tests, and t-tests were used to compare the frequencies for categorical variables and the means of continuous variables from the intervention and the comparison groups to identify variables that were significantly different across the two groups. Random effects models were performed to examine the bivariate associations between the intervention status and clinical outcomes. At the end of 24 months of follow-up mean CD4 count and HGB levels increased significantly in both intervention and comparison groups (p = 0.009 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Weight increased significantly only in the intervention group (p = 0.003). Cumulative LTFU was three times higher in the comparison compared to the intervention (p < 0.001) group. Having a low CD4 count, extremes of weight, low HGB, younger age, and male gender were significantly associated with LTFU among the unexposed group, while being on ART for duration of 12 months or more was protective against LTFU in those intervened. Among PLH on ART, exposed or not exposed to NAMWEZA intervention, clinical care outcomes improved over time. LTFU was much higher in the comparison group with factors commonly known to predict LTFU only apparent in the comparison group. NAMWEZA could be a promising peer-facilitated model to reduce LTFU among PLH in care that can be integrated in ART services; however, more research is needed to evaluate its longer term effects.",

Eligible patient charts were reviewed for information on TB treatment, socio-demographics, laboratory parameters (Hemoglobin, CD4cells count and lactate dehydrogenase) and clinical presentation using a semi structured data extraction form.A total of 183 charts were reviewed; 106/183 were males (57.9%), the median age was 35 (IQR, 28-45). Fifty six (30.6%) patients had a possible misdiagnosis as TB and their median time on TB treatment was 3.5 (1-5.3) months. In multivariate analysis the presence of chest pain had an odd ratio (OR) of 4.4 (95% CI 1.89-10.58, p < 0.001) and stage III and IV lymphoma disease had an OR of 3.22 (95% CI 1.08-9.63, p < 0.037) for possible misdiagnosis of lymphoma as TB.A high proportion of patients with HIV associated lymphoma attending UCI are misdiagnosed and treated as TB.

We evaluated the association of self-reported adherence (SRA) and antiretroviral (ART) drug levels on blip occurrence in US Military HIV Natural History Study (NHS) participants who initiated the single-tablet regimen efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF). ART-naïve NHS participants started on EFV/FTC/TDF between 2006 and 2013 who achieved VL suppression (<50 copies/mL) within 12 months and had available SRA and stored plasma samples were included. Participants with viral blips were compared with those who maintained VL suppression without blips. Untimed EFV plasma levels were evaluated on consecutive blip and non-blip dates by high performance liquid chromatography, with a level ≥1 mcg/mL considered therapeutic. SRA was categorized as ≥85 or <85 %. Descriptive statistics were performed for baseline characteristics and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the relationship between covariates and blip occurrence. A total of 772 individuals met inclusion criteria, including 99 (13 %) blip and 673 (87 %) control participants. African-American was the predominant ethnicity and the mean age was 29 years for both groups. SRA ≥ 85 % was associated with therapeutic EFV levels at both blip and non-blip time points (P = 0.0026); however no association was observed between blips and SRA or EFV levels among cases. On univariate analysis of cases versus controls, blips were associated with higher mean pre-treatment VL (HR 1.45, 95 % CI 1.11–1.89) and pre-treatment CD4 count <350 cells/µL (68.1 vs 49.7 %). Multivariate analysis also showed that blips were associated with a higher mean VL (HR 1.42, 95 % CI 1.08–1.88; P = 0.0123) and lower CD4 count at ART initiation, with CD4 ≥500 cells/µL having a protective effect (HR 0.45, 95 % CI 0.22–0.95; P = 0.0365). No association was observed for demographic characteristics or SRA. Blips are commonly encountered in the clinical management of HIV-infected patients. Although blip occurrence was not associated with SRA or EFV blood levels in our study, blips were associated with HIV-related factors of pre-ART high VL and low CD4 count. Additional studies are needed to determine the etiology of blips in HIV-infected patients.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, Ethiopia adopted different strategies of prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). Prior to implementation of Option A in 2011, there was no provision of prophylaxis for PMTCT. With 'Option A', PMTCT interventions relied on maternal CD4 count. In early 2013, ''Option B+'' has been started; with this option, antiretroviral therapy is started and continued for life to any HIV positive pregnant mother irrespective of CD4 count with an enhanced treatment for the baby. Though there are a number of studies which evaluated the effectiveness of PMTCT interventions, the current study assessed the real-world effectiveness of PMTCT options in a setting where there is limitation of resources.This study tried to address three questions: what proportion of babies tested by DNA-PCR are HIV infected in the first 2 months of life? How does the type of PMTCT intervention affect presence of HIV infection at this age? What are the factors affecting HIV transmission, after controlling for type of PMCT-HIV intervention?We assessed records of 624 registered HIV exposed infants and 412 mothers who were delivered at Bishoftu Hospital from May 2006 to August 2014. Presence of HIV infection at 6-8 weeks of age was assessed from the records. Maternal and infant risk factors for infection at this age were analyzed. Data were collected using standard data abstraction format and were analyzed using SPSS version 20.Among all the infants who were delivered at the hospital during the study period, 624/936 (66.7 %) had undergone early infant diagnosis at 6-8 weeks. Twenty-seven (4.3 %) were positive for HIV DNA PCR at the age of 6-8 weeks. None of the infants who received ''Option B+'' had a positive HIV DNA PCR result. HIV infection rate was highest among those who took either no prophylaxis or single dose Nevirapine (11.5 and 11.1 % respectively). Those who took single dose Nevirapine and Zidovudine had HIV positivity rate of 3.9 %. Many of the covariates which were shown to be predictors on bivariate analysis were found not to be independent predictors on multivariate analysis.PMTCT ''Option B+'' resulted in zero HIV infection rates among the included infants. There was a high loss to follow up rate at 6-8 weeks of age. The authors recommend that a better strategy of linkage to care and treatment should be devised for HIV exposed infants.",

Rehabilitation is well positioned to address disability and maximize healthy aging. An international collaborative network, called the Canada-International HIV and Rehabilitation Research Collaborative (CIHRRC), works to guide this emerging field. In this article, we report findings from CIHRRC’s aim to identify emerging research priorities in HIV, aging and rehabilitation from the perspectives of people living with HIV, clinicians, researchers, representatives from community organizations and policy stakeholders. Methods We conducted a multi-stakeholder multi-method international consultation with people living with HIV, researchers, clinicians and representatives of community-based organizations to identify research priorities in HIV, aging and rehabilitation. Stakeholders identified research priorities during a one-day International Forum comprised of presentations and facilitated discussion. We collated and analyzed data using content analytical techniques, resulting in a framework of research priorities. Results Sixty-nine stakeholders from countries including Canada (n = 62; 90%), the United Kingdom (n = 5; 7%), United States (n = 1; 1%) and Australia (n = 1; 1%) attended the International Forum on HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation Research. Stakeholders represented community-based organizations (n = 20; 29%), academic institutions (n = 18; 26%), community or institutional healthcare organizations (n = 11; 16%), research or knowledge production organizations (n = 10; 14%), and organizations representing government or industry (n = 10; 14%). The Framework of Research Priorities in HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation includes seven research priorities: (1) nature, extent and impact of disability, concurrent health conditions and chronic inflammation with HIV; (2) prevalence, severity and impact of frailty; (3) community and social participation aging with HIV; (4) strategies for chronic disease management and healthy aging with HIV; (5) facilitators and barriers to access and engagement in, rehabilitation; (6) effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for healthy aging with HIV; and (7) advancing development and use of patient reported outcome measures in HIV and aging. The Framework highlights methodological considerations to approach the priorities and the importance of knowledge translation and exchange to apply research knowledge into practice, programs and policy. Conclusions These priorities offer a foundation for collaboration among international and multidisciplinary teams to advance the field of HIV, aging and rehabilitation in order to promote healthy aging with HIV.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Antiretroviral adherence is essential to HIV treatment efficacy. Various self-reported measures are commonly used for assessing antiretroviral adherence. Limited data are available regarding the validity of those self-reported measures in comparison with long-term objective biomarkers of adherence measures such as hair measures. Methods Self-reported adherence (frequency, percentage, and visual analog scale [VAS]) and hair tenofovir concentration were evaluated at a single time point from 268 people living with HIV in China. The responses to each of three self-reported measures were converted into percentage and then dichotomized as “optimal” (100%) vs. “suboptimal” (less than 100%) adherence. Two composite adherence scores (CAS) were created from the three self-reported measures: (1) an overall adherence was the average percentage of the three self-reported measures; (2) responses were termed optimal adherence if participants reporting optimal adherence in all three self-reported measures, while were termed suboptimal adherence. Hair tenofovir concentration was also dichotomized as “optimal” (above the limit of quantitation, 36 pg/mg) vs. “suboptimal” adherence (blow 36 pg/mg). Spearman correlation, kappa statistics, and logistic regression analysis were used to calculate the correlations, agreements, and predictions of self-reported measures with hair measure, respectively. Results Overall adherence, but any of the three self-reported adherence, was correlated with hair tenofovir concentration ( r = 0.13, p &lt; 0.05). Self-reported optimal adherence in VAS and CAS measures were agreed with and predicted optimal adherence assessed by hair measure (Kappa = 0.107, adjusted OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.03–3.45; Kappa = 0.109, adjusted OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.02–3.18; all p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Conclusion VAS may be a good individual self-reported measure for antiretroviral adherence, and CAS may be a good composite self-reported measure for antiretroviral adherence.",

This study examined the influence of disclosure on health outcomes in children living with HIV and their caregivers. Methods Using a cross-sectional design, 155 HIV-positive children between age 6–15 years and their caregivers were administered standardized questionnaires measuring adherence to medication, children's psychological well-being, caregiver burden, and caregivers’ psychological health. Results Results indicated that only 33.5% of the children sampled knew their status. Disclosure of HIV status was significantly related to medication adherence, psychological wellbeing, the burden of caregiving, and the length of the disclosure. A child’s age and level of education were the only demographic variables that significantly predicted disclosure of HIV status. In a hierarchical analysis, after controlling for all demographic variables medication adherence, psychological well-being and burden of caregiving were found to be significant predictors of disclosure of status in children living with HIV. Conclusions Findings suggest the need for disclosure of status among children living with HIV for a positive impact on their medication adherence and psychological health. These findings underscore the need for the development of context-specific interventions that will guide and encourage disclosure of status by caregivers to children living with HIV.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) at institutions of higher learning are at high risk of HIV, and conventional HIV testing services may not reach them sufficiently. HIV self-testing (HIVST) scalability can be informed by identifying AGYW who have used or are interested in using HIVST. We aimed to determine factors associated with use and willingness to use HIVST among female university students. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 483 female students at Makerere University, Uganda. Proportions of students who have used or are willing to use HIVST and their associated factors were determined. Modified Poisson regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results The median age of the participants was 22 (Interquartile range [IQR] 21–23) years, and 21% had never tested for HIV. Over 93% were willing to utilize HIVST, and 19% had ever used HIV self-test kits. Increasing age (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.23 per year, 95% CI 1.07–1.43) was significantly associated with HIVST use. Predictors of willingness to self-test for HIV were college type (arts vs. science-based, aPR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88–0.97), number of sexual partners (one, aPR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.12 or ≥ 2, aPR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04–1.19, vs. none), alcohol (aPR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00–1.09) or injection drug (aPR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00–1.09) use, a history of sexually transmitted infections in past 12 months (aPR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.09), and HIV testing experience (tested in past 12 months, aPR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02–1.22 or over 12 months, aPR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03–1.24, vs. never tested). Conclusion HIVST was highly acceptable despite its limited use. This study demonstrates female student characteristics that can be leveraged to scale up HIVST programs in higher institutions of learning.",

The objective of this manuscript was to assessed the barriers in the acknowledgement and uptake focusing the demand side. Methods An online questionnaire survey was conducted from December 2018 to January 2019. All participants were required to scan two-dimensional code which was the online crowdsourcing survey platform to complete the electronic questionnaire anonymously. Results Among 1915 MSM from thirty-four cities of China, 512 (26.7%) versus 1617 (84.4%) had an objective or subjective need of PrEP, respectively. One hundred and six (5.5%) reported affordability and only 23 (1.2%) had ever taken it. Age, living alone and occupation were associated with the objective needs. Age, income, sexual behavior were associated with actual usage. The participants who they had objective need to use PrEP are the population which we should focus on. Conclusion A wide disconnect exists among the objective need, willingness, affordability and uptake of PrEP. Cost was the most prevalent barrier, accounting for 78.22% of individuals who needed and wished for PrEP but finally failed to receive it. The findings might facilitate optimizing future allocation of resources to better promote PrEP in Chinese MSM.",

In this report, we described a rare case of monkeypox with an underlying immune deficiency caused by human immunodeficiency virus infection which was combined with syphilis. This report discusses differences in the initial clinical presentation and clinical course compared to typical monkeypox cases.We report the case of a 32-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection who was admitted to a hospital in Southern Florida. The patient presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, fever, cough and left-sided chest wall pain. Physical examination revealed a pustular skin rash, consisting of generalised exanthema with small white and red papules. Upon arrival, he was found to be in sepsis with lactic acidosis. Chest radiography showed left-sided pneumothorax and minimal atelectasis in the left mid-lung, with a small pleural effusion at the left lung base. An infectious disease specialist raised the possibility of monkeypox, and the lesion sample tested positive for monkeypox deoxyribonucleic acid. In this case, the possible diagnosis of skin lesions varied because the patient tested positive for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus. For that reason, the differential diagnosis of monkeypox infection is prolonged owing to its initial atypical clinical features.Patients with underlying immune deficiency who have human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis can present with atypical clinical features and delay proper diagnosis, which can increase the risk of spreading monkeypox in hospitals. Thus, patients with rash and risky sexual behaviour should be screened for monkeypox or other sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, and a readily available, rapid, and accurate test is necessary to stop the spread of the disease.",

Inflammation associated non-communicable diseases, including atherosclerosis, are becoming recognized complication of HIV infection. We studied the effect of pitavastatin on atherosclerotic-associated inflammatory biomarkers in PLHIV receiving ART. Methods A randomized, double-blind, crossover study was conducted in HIV-infected persons with dyslipidemia and receiving atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) to evaluate the effect of 2 mg/day pitavastatin treatment versus placebo. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), cytokines, and cellular markers in PLHIV receiving 12 weeks of pitavastatin or placebo were investigated. Results A total of 24 HIV-infected individuals with a median (interquartile range) age of 46 (41–54) years were recruited, and the median CD4 T cell count was 662 (559-827) cells/mm 3 . The median duration of ATV/r use was 36 (24–48) months. Significant change in levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) between pitavastatin treatment and placebo at week 12 from baseline was observed (27.1 vs. 20.5 pg/mL; p=0.023). However, there were no significant changes from baseline of hs-CRP and other plasma cytokine levels at week 12 of pitavastatin or placebo. Regarding cellular markers, percentages of HLA-DR + CD38 - CD4 + T cells and PD1 + CD4 + T cells significantly decreased from baseline in PLHIV receiving pitavastatin for 12 weeks, as compared to placebo (− 0.27 vs. 0.02%; p=0.049 and − 0.23 vs. 0.23%; p=0.022, respectively). Conclusions Pitavastatin treatment increases basic FGF levels, and lowers HLA-DR + CD38 - CD4 + T cells, and PD1 + CD4 + T cells. Further study on the effects of pitavastatin on preventing cardiovascular diseases in PLHIV should be pursued.",

    "abstract": "Efavirenz is the preferred non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for first-line antiretroviral treatment in many countries. For women of childbearing potential, advantages of efavirenz are balanced by concerns that it is teratogenic. This paper reviews evidence of efavirenz teratogenicity and considers implications in common clinical scenarios. Concerns of efavirenz-induced fetal effects stem from animal studies, although the predictive value of animal data for humans is unknown. Four retrospective cases of central nervous system birth defects in infants with first trimester exposure to efavirenz have been interpreted as being consistent with animal data. In a prospective pregnancy registry, which is subject to fewer potential biases, no increase was detected in overall risk of birth defects following exposure to efavirenz in the first-trimester. For women planning a pregnancy or not using contraception, efavirenz should be avoided if alternatives are available. According to WHO guidelines for resource-constrained settings, benefits of efavirenz are likely to outweigh risks for women using contraception. Women who become pregnant while receiving efavirenz often consider drug substitution or temporarily suspending treatment. Both options have substantial risks for maternal and fetal health which, we argue, appear unjustified after the critical period of organogenesis (3–8 weeks post-conception). Efavirenz-based triple regimens, initiated after the first trimester of pregnancy and discontinued after childbirth, are potentially an important alternative for reducing mother-to-child transmission in pregnant women who do not yet require antiretroviral treatment. Current recommendations for care for women who become pregnant while receiving efavirenz may need to be re-considered, particularly in settings with limited alternative drugs and laboratory monitoring. With current data limitations, additional adequately powered prospective studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "HIV lipodystrophy syndrome is a recognized complication of potent antiretroviral therapy and is characterized by often dramatic changes in various body fat stores, both central and peripheral. Given prior findings of heightened body image dysphoria among HIV-infected men with lipodystrophy as compared to HIV-infected men without lipodystrophy, we sought to determine body image among HIV-infected and HIV-negative women and to determine the relationship of HIV and lipodystrophy with body image. Our a priori hypothesis was that women with HIV and lipodystrophy would have significantly poorer body image as compared to women without HIV and to women with HIV without lipodystrophy.116 women responded to two previously validated self-report instruments (Body Image Quality of Life Index (BIQLI) and the Situational Inventory of Body-Image Dysphoria-Short Form (SIBID-S)) on body image. 62 (53% subjects) HIV-infected women were recruited at the university-based HIV clinic. 54 (47% subjects) HIV-negative female controls were recruited from another study evaluating bone density in otherwise healthy controls. 96% identified their sexual orientation as women having sex with men. Among the HIV-infected group, 36 reported the presence of lipodystrophic characteristics and 26 reported no lipodystrophic changes. Agreement regarding the presence of lipodystrophy between physician and subject was 0.67 as measured by the kappa coefficient of agreement. Compared to HIV-negative women, HIV-positive women demonstrated poor body image as measured by BIQLI (p = 0.0009). Compared with HIV-infected women who denied lipodystrophy, HIV-infected women with self-reported lipodystrophy demonstrated poor body image as measured by BIQLI (p = 0.02) and SIBID-S scales (p = 0.001).We demonstrate that HIV and lipodystrophy status among women is associated with poor body image. Universal efforts should be made in the HIV medical community to recognize body image issues particularly among persons affected by lipodystrophy so that appropriate intervention and support may be provided.",

    "abstract": "HLA-G gene is a non-classical MHC class 1 molecule that is highly expressed in the trophoblast at the maternal-fetal interface. In an attempt to elucidate possible immunological mechanisms facilitating protection of infants born to human immunodeficiency virus type (HIV-1) infected mothers, we have been studying genetic variations in the coding and untranslated regions of HLA-G antigen between HIV-1-infected mothers and their infected or uninfected infants. This study investigated whether HLA-G DNA sequence variants are associated with perinatal HIV-1 transmission.Genomic DNA samples were obtained from a nested case-control study of 34 mother-child pairs co-enrolled in a cohort of the Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study in New York. The samples were from two groups predominantly of African-American and Hispanic origin: In the first group, both mother and child were HIV-1-infected; in the second group, only the mother was infected while the child remained uninfected. Genotyping of HLA-G gene were performed on the extracted DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using PCR based sequencing and restriction fragment-length polymorphism analyses. Among the studied HLA-G exons, dissimilarities in HLA-G DNA sequence variants between the HIV-1 non-transmitting mother child pairs were mostly observed in exon 8-3'-untranslated region at nucleotide positions T3742A, C3743T, G3777C (P = 0.001). Non-transmitting HIV-1 mother child pairs exhibited dissimilarities at nucleotide position C3743T allele with decreased risk of perinatal HIV-1 transmission, compared with HIV-1 transmitting mother-child pairs carrying this allele (odds ratio 0.02 [95% confidence interval 0.00-0.15] P = 0.00001). In addition, heterozygous dissimilarities at nucleotide positions C634G and 714 insT/G in the 5'-upstream regulatory region were observed between the mother child pairs of the HIV-1-non-transmitting group while homozygous similarities of C634C, and either 714insG/G or mother-child pairs with similar 714insT/G were observed among the transmitting group in the same region.This study identified new variants in the HLA-G gene and provides further evidence that dissimilarities in the HLA-G DNA sequence variants could influence the transmission of HIV-1 from infected mothers to their infants.",

    "abstract": "Despite multiple sexual exposure to HIV-1 virus, some individuals remain HIV-1 seronegative (exposed seronegative, ESN). The mechanisms underlying this resistance remain still unclear, although a multifactorial pathogenesis can be hypothesised. Although several genetic factors have been related to HIV-1 resistance, the homozigosity for a mutation in CCR5 gene (the 32 bp deletion, i.e. CCR5-Delta32 allele) is presently considered the most relevant one. In the present study we analysed the genotype at CCR5 locus of 30 Italian ESN individuals (case group) who referred multiple unprotected heterosexual intercourse with HIV-1 seropositive partner(s), for at least two years. One hundred and twenty HIV-1 infected patients and 120 individuals representative of the general population were included as control groups. Twenty percent of ESN individuals had heterozygous CCR5-Delta 32 genotype, compared to 7.5% of HIV-1 seropositive and 10% of individuals from the general population, respectively. None of the analysed individuals had CCR5-Delta 32 homozygous genotype. Sequence analysis of the entire open reading frame of CCR5 was performed in all ESN subjects and no polymorphisms or mutations were identified. Moreover, we determined the distribution of C77G variant in CD45 gene, which has been previously related to HIV-1 infection susceptibility. The frequency of the C77G variant showed no significant difference between ESN subjects and the two control groups. In conclusion, our data show a significantly higher frequency of CCR5-Delta 32 heterozygous genotype (p = 0.04) among the Italian heterosexual ESN individuals compared to HIV-1 seropositive patients, suggesting a partial protective role of CCR5-Delta 32 heterozygosity in this cohort.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of HAART has initially improved the quality of life (QoL) of HIV-positive (HIV+) patients, however body fat redistribution (BFR) and metabolic disorders associated with long-term HAART use may attenuate this improvement. As access to treatment improves in sub-Saharan Africa, the disfiguring nature of BFR (peripheral atrophy and/or central adiposity) may deter treatment adherence and initiatives and decrease QoL. We examined the relationship between BFR and domains of QoL in HAART-treated HIV+ African men and women with (HIV+BFR, n = 50) and without (HIV+noBFR, n = 50) BFR in Rwanda.HIV+ subjects with BFR were less satisfied with their body image (4.3 +/- 0.1 versus 1.5 +/- 0.2; p < .001), self-esteem and social life (4.1 +/- 1.4 versus 2.1 +/- 0.3; p = 0.003). HIV+BFR were more ashamed in public (4.5 +/- 1.2 versus 1.1 +/- 1.1), reported less confident about their health (4.6 +/- 1.4 versus 1.5 +/- 1.2) and were frequently embarrassed due to body changes (4.1 +/- 1.1 versus 1.1 +/- 0.9) (p < .001) than HIV+noBFR. HIV+ Rwandan women with BFR reported more dissatisfaction with psychological (8.3 +/- 2.9 versus 13.7 +/- 1.9), social relationships (6.9 +/- 2.3 versus 11.1 +/- 4.1) and HIV HAART-specific domain of wellbeing (3.1 +/- 4.8 versus 6.3 +/- 3.6) (p < .001). Age was associated with independence (r2 = 0.691; p = 0.009) and marital status was associated with psychological (r2 = 0.593; p = 0.019) and social relationships (r2 = 0.493; p = 0.007). CD4 count (r2 = 0.648; p = 0.003) and treatment duration (r2 = 0.453; p = 0.003) were associated with HIV HAART-specific domain of wellbeing. HIV+ Rwandan women with BFR were significantly more affected by abdominal adiposity (p < .001), facial and buttocks atrophy (p < .05) than HIV+ men with BFR.Body fat alterations negatively affect psychological and social domains of quality of life. These symptoms may result in stigmatization and marginalization mainly in HAART-treated African women, adversely affecting HAART adherence and treatment initiatives. Efforts to evaluate self-perceived body fat changes may improve patients' wellbeing, HAART adherence and treatment outcomes and contribute towards stability in quality of life continuum.",

    "abstract": "Co-infections of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. Tb) are steadily increasing and represent a major health crisis in many developing countries. Both pathogens individually stimulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) release from infected cells and TNF, in turn, enhances the replication of each. A recent report on a Phase I clinical trial suggested that etanercept (soluble TNF receptor) might be beneficial in treating HIV/M. Tb co-infected patients. We sought to determine if a small molecule inhibitor of TNF synthesis and activity could block replication of either organism and thus be a potential adjunct to existing drugs targeting these agents. LMP-420, a novel anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits TNF, was tested for HIV-1 inhibition both alone and in combination with AZT (3' -azido-3-deoxythymidine). LMP-420 alone was tested against M. Tb. HIV-1 infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or M. Tb-infected human alveolar macrophages (AM) were treated with a single dose of LMP-420 and viral or bacterial replication determined after 7 or 5 days respectively. Viral replication was determined from supernatant p24 levels measured by ELISA. M. Tb replication was determined by bacterial culture of macrophage lysates. LMP-420 alone inhibited HIV replication over 7 days with an IC50 of ~300 nM. Combination of LMP-420 with AZT doubled the level of HIV inhibition observed with AZT alone. LMP-420 alone inhibited the replication of virulent M. Tb by >80%, more than that observed with anti-TNF antibody alone. Inhibition of TNF with inexpensive, small-molecule, orally-active drugs may represent a useful strategy for enhancing the activity of currently-available antiviral and anti-M. Tb agents, particularly in those areas where co-infections with these pathogens act to synergistically enhance each other.",

To provide patients with maximal treatment options, massively parallel sequencing of the envelope V3 domain, in combination with tropism prediction tools, was evaluated as an alternative tropism determination strategy. Plasma samples from twelve HIV-1 infected individuals with failing phenotyping results were available. The samples were submitted to massive parallel sequencing and to confirmatory recombinant phenotyping using a fraction of the gp120 domain.A cut-off for sequence reads interpretation of 5 to10 times the sequencing error rate (0.2%) was implemented. On average, each sample contained 7 different V3 haplotypes. V3 haplotypes were submitted to tropism prediction algorithms, and 4/14 samples returned with presence of a dual/mixed (D/M) tropic virus, respectively at 3%, 10%, 11%, and 95% of the viral quasispecies. V3 tropism prediction was confirmed by gp120 phenotyping, except for two out of 4 D/M predicted viruses (with 3 and 95%) which were phenotypically R5-tropic. In the first case, the result was discordant due to the limit of detection for the phenotyping technology, while in the latter case the prediction algorithms were not computing the viral tropism correctly.Although only demonstrated on a limited set of samples, the potential of the combined use of \"deep sequencing + prediction algorithms\" in cases where routine gp160 phenotype testing cannot be employed was illustrated. While good concordance was observed between gp120 phenotyping and prediction of R5-tropic virus, the results suggest that accurate prediction of X4-tropic virus would require further algorithm development.",

    "abstract": "Allopathic practitioners in India are outnumbered by practitioners of traditional Indian medicine and homeopathy (TIMH), which is used by up to two-thirds of its population to help meet primary health care needs, particularly in rural areas. India has an estimated 2.5 million HIV infected persons. However, little is known about TIMH use, safety or efficacy in HIV/AIDS management in India, which has one of the largest indigenous medical systems in the world. The purpose of this review was to assess the quality of peer-reviewed, published literature on TIMH for HIV/AIDS care and treatment.Of 206 original articles reviewed, 21 laboratory studies, 17 clinical studies, and 6 previous reviews of the literature were identified that covered at least one system of TIMH, which includes Ayurveda, Unani medicine, Siddha medicine, homeopathy, yoga and naturopathy. Most studies examined either Ayurvedic or homeopathic treatments. Only 4 of these studies were randomized controlled trials, and only 10 were published in MEDLINE-indexed journals. Overall, the studies reported positive effects and even \"cure\" and reversal of HIV infection, but frequent methodological flaws call into question their internal and external validity. Common reasons for poor quality included small sample sizes, high drop-out rates, design flaws such as selection of inappropriate or weak outcome measures, flaws in statistical analysis, and reporting flaws such as lack of details on products and their standardization, poor or no description of randomization, and incomplete reporting of study results.This review exposes a broad gap between the widespread use of TIMH therapies for HIV/AIDS, and the dearth of high-quality data supporting their effectiveness and safety. In light of the suboptimal effectiveness of vaccines, barrier methods and behavior change strategies for prevention of HIV infection and the cost and side effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for its treatment, it is both important and urgent to develop and implement a rigorous research agenda to investigate the potential risks and benefits of TIMH and to identify its role in the management of HIV/AIDS and associated illnesses in India.",

    "abstract": "Human embryonic stem (hES) cells hold considerable promise for cell replacement and gene therapies. Their remarkable properties of pluripotency, self-renewal, and tractability for genetic modification potentially allows for the production of sizeable quantities of therapeutic cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Dendritic cells (DC) arise from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and are important in many innate and adaptive immune functions. With respect to HIV-1 infection, DCs play an important role in the efficient capture and transfer of the virus to susceptible cells. With an aim of generating DCs from a renewable source for HIV-1 studies, here we evaluated the capacity of hES cell derived CD34+ cells to give rise to DCs which can support HIV-1 infection.Undifferentiated hES cells were cultured on S17 mouse bone marrow stromal cell layers to derive CD34+ HPCs which were subsequently grown in specific cytokine differentiation media to promote the development of DCs. The hES derived DCs (hES-DC) were subjected to phenotypic and functional analyses and compared with DCs derived from fetal liver CD34+ HPC (FL-DC). The mature hES-DCs displayed typical DC morphology consisting of veiled stellate cells. The hES-DCs also displayed characteristic phenotypic surface markers CD1a, HLA-DR, B7.1, B7.2, and DC-SIGN. The hES-DCs were found to be capable of antigen uptake and stimulating naïve allogeneic CD4+ T cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction assay. Furthermore, the hES-DCs supported productive HIV-1 viral infection akin to standard DCs.Phenotypically normal and functionally competent DCs that support HIV-1 infection can be derived from hES cells. hES-DCs can now be exploited in applied immunology and HIV-1 infection studies. Using gene therapy approaches, it is now possible to generate HIV-1 resistant DCs from anti-HIV gene transduced hES-CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells.",

    "abstract": "The latency of HIV-1 in resting CD4+ T-lymphocytes constitutes a major obstacle for the eradication of virus in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). As yet, no approach to reduce this viral reservoir has proven effective.Nine subjects on effective ART were included in the study and treated with high dosage intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for five consecutive days. Seven of those had detectable levels of replication-competent virus in the latent reservoir and were thus possible to evaluate. Highly purified resting memory CD4+ T-cells were activated and cells containing replication-competent HIV-1 were quantified. HIV-1 from plasma and activated memory CD4+ T-cells were compared with single genome sequencing (SGS) of the gag region. T-lymphocyte activation markers and serum interleukins were measured.The latent HIV-1 pool decreased with in median 68% after IVIG was added to effective ART. The reservoir decreased in five, whereas no decrease was found in two subjects with detectable virus. Plasma HIV-1 RNA >or= 2 copies/mL was detected in five of seven subjects at baseline, but in only one at follow-up after 8-12 weeks. The decrease of the latent HIV-1 pool and the residual plasma viremia was preceded by a transitory low-level increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA and serum interleukin 7 (IL-7) levels, and followed by an expansion of T regulatory cells. The magnitude of the viral increase in plasma correlated to the size of the latent HIV-1 pool and SGS of the gag region showed that viral clones from plasma clustered together with virus from activated memory T-cells, pointing to the latent reservoir as the source of HIV-1 RNA in plasma.The findings from this uncontrolled proof-of-concept study suggest that the reservoir became accessible by IVIG treatment through activation of HIV-1 gene expression in latently-infected resting CD4+ T-cells. We propose that IVIG should be further evaluated as an adjuvant to effective ART.",

    "abstract": "High early mortality rate among HIV infected patients following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource limited settings may indicate high pre-treatment mortality among ART-eligible patients. There is dearth of data on pre-treatment mortality in ART programmes in sub-Sahara Africa. This study aims to determine pre-treatment mortality rate and predictors of pre-treatment mortality among ART-eligible adult patients in a West Africa clinic-based cohort.All HIV-infected patients aged 15 years or older eligible for ART between June 2004 and September 2009 were included in the analysis. Assessment for eligibility was based on the Gambia ART guideline. Survival following ART-eligibility was determined by Kaplan-Meier estimates and predictors of pre-treatment mortality determined by Cox proportional hazard models.Overall, 790 patients were assessed as eligible for ART based on their clinical and/or immunological status among whom 510 (64.6%) started treatment, 26 (3.3%) requested transfer to another health facility, 136 (17.2%) and 118 (14.9%) were lost to follow-up and died respectively without starting ART. ART-eligible patients who died or were lost to follow-up were more likely to be male or to have a CD4 T-cell count < 100 cells/μL, while patients in WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 were more likely to die without starting treatment. The overall pre-treatment mortality rate was 21.9 deaths per 100 person-years (95% CI 18.3 - 26.2) and the rate for the composite end point of death or loss to follow-up was 47.1 per 100 person-years (95% CI 41.6 - 53.2). Independent predictors of pre-treatment mortality were CD4 T-cell count <100 cells/μL (adjusted Hazard ratio [AHR] 3.71; 95%CI 2.54 - 5.41) and WHO stage 3 or 4 disease (AHR 1.91; 95% CI 1.12 - 3.23). Forty percent of ART-eligible patients lost to follow-up seen alive at field visit cited difficulty with the requirement of disclosing their HIV status as reason for not starting ART.Approximately one third of ART-eligible patients did not start ART and pre-treatment mortality rate was found high among HIV infected patients in our cohort. CD4 T-cell count <100 cells/μL is the strongest independent predictor of pre-treatment mortality. The requirement to disclose HIV status as part of ART preparation counselling constitutes a huge barrier for eligible patients to access treatment.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has been available free of charge in Tanga, Tanzania since 2005. However we have found that a high percentage of women referred from prevention of mother-to-child transmission services to the Care and Treatment Clinics (CTC) for HAART never registered at the CTCs. Few studies have focused on the motivating and deterring factors to presenting for HAART particularly in relation to women. This study seeks to remedy this gap in knowledge. Methodology A qualitative approach using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions was chosen to understand these issues as perceived and interpreted by HIV infected women themselves. RESULTS: The main deterrent to presenting for treatment appears to be fear of stigmatization including fear of ostracism from the community, divorce and financial distress. Participants indicated that individual counselling and interaction with other people living with HIV encourages women, who are disinclined to present for HAART, to do so, and that placing the entrance to the CTC so as to provide discrete access increases the accessibility of the clinic. CONCLUSION: Combating stigma in the community, although it is essential, will take time. Therefore necessary steps towards encouraging HIV infected women to seek treatment include reducing self-stigma, assisting them to form empowering relationships and to gain financial independence and emphasising the beneficial effect of treatment for themselves and for their children by example. Furthermore ensuring a discrete location of the CTC can increase its perceived accessibility.",

    "abstract": "The true prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases among street children in Nepal is virtually unknown while information on related behavioural risk factors in this population is non-existent. The risk of HIV infection among street children and adolescents may be especially high due to their marginalized social and economic conditions. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of HIV infection among a sample of street children and youth of Kathmandu and to identify risk factors associated with HIV infection in this group.A sample of street children and youth was recruited based on the purposive sampling of ten streets in Kathmandu, Nepal, known to have a high density of street children and youth. A total of 251 street children (aged 11-16 years) and youth (aged 17-24 years) were enrolled, with informed consent, from November, 2008 through June, 2009. Most of the participants (95%) were male. Case status was determined by serological assessment of HIV status; data on risk factors were obtained using structured survey interviews. HIV prevalence and rates of a number of behavioural risk factors suspected to play a role in HIV transmission among street children and youth were determined, including unprotected sex, intravenous drug use, and other risky sex and substance use behaviours.Among the 251 children and youth, we found an overall HIV prevalence of 7.6%. As the sample size of females was small (n = 13) and the behavioural risk factors are likely to be quite different for boys and girls, we conducted separate analyses by gender. As our small sample of females is unlikely to be representative and lacks power for statistical testing, our report focuses on the results for the males surveyed.The strongest behavioural risk factor to emerge from this study was intravenous drug use; 30% of the male subjects were injecting drug users and 20% of those were HIV positive. Furthermore, frequency of drug injection was a highly significant predictor with a dose-response relationship; males reporting occasional injection drug use were nearly 9 times more likely to be HIV positive than never users, while weekly drug injectors had over 46 times the risk of non-users, controlling for exposure to group sex, the only other significant risk factor in the multivariate model.This sample of street children and youth of Kathmandu has a nearly 20-fold higher prevalence of HIV infection than the general population of Nepal (0.39%). The children and youth engage in number of high risk behaviours, including intravenous drug use, putting them at significant risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.",

    "abstract": "The impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) remains controversial. We evaluate impact of HAART prescription in HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU of Tourcoing Hospital from January 2000 to December 2009.There were 91 admissions concerning 85 HIV-infected patients. Reasons for ICU admission were an AIDS-related diagnosis in 46 cases (51%). Fifty two patients (57%) were on HAART at the time of ICU admission, leading to 21 immunovirologic successes (23%). During the ICU stay, HAART was continued in 29 patients (32%), and started in 3 patients (3%). Only one patient experienced an adverse event related to HAART. Mortality rate in ICU and 6 months after ICU admission were respectively 19% and 27%. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative unajusted survival probability over 6 months were higher in patients treated with HAART during the ICU stay (Log rank: p = 0.04). No benefit of HAART in ICU was seen in the adjusted survival proportion at 6 months or during ICU stay. Prescription of HAART during ICU was associated with a trend to lower incidence of new AIDS-related events at 6 months (respectively 17% and 34% with and without HAART, p = 0.07), and with higher incidence of antiretroviral resistance after ICU stay (respectively 25% and 7% with and without HAART, p = 0.02).Our results suggest a lower death rate over 6 months in critically ill HIV-infected patients taking HAART during ICU stay. The optimal time to prescribe HAART in critically ill patients needs to be better defined.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption is prevalent amongst HIV positive population. Importantly, chronic alcohol use is reported to exacerbate HIV pathogenesis. Although alcohol is known to increase oxidative stress, especially in the liver, there is no clinical evidence that alcohol increases oxidative stress in HIV positive patients. The mechanism by which alcohol increases oxidative stress in HIV positive patients is also unknown. To examine the effects of alcohol use on oxidative stress we recruited HIV+ patients who reported mild-to-moderate alcohol use. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to reduce the effect of other therapeutic drugs metabolized via the hepatic system as well as the effect of co-morbidities such as active tuberculosis on the interaction between alcohol and HIV infection, respectively. Blood samples were collected from HIV-negative alcohol-users and HIV positive alcohol-users followed by collection of plasma and isolation and fractionation of monocytes from peripheral blood. We then determined oxidative DNA damage, glutathione level, alcohol level, transcriptional level of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and several antioxidant enzymes, and plasma level of cytokines. Compared to HIV-negative alcohol users, HIV-positive alcohol users demonstrated an increase in oxidative DNA damage in both plasma and CD14+ monocytes, as well as, a relative increase in oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSSG/GSH) in plasma samples. These results suggest an increase in oxidative stress in HIV-positive alcohol users compared with HIV-negative alcohol users. We also examined whether alcohol metabolism, perhaps by CYP2E1, and antioxidant enzymes are involved in alcohol-mediated increased oxidative stress in HIV-positive patients. The results showed a lower plasma alcohol level, which was associated with an increased level of CYP2E1 mRNA in monocytes, in HIV-positive alcohol users compared with HIV-negative alcohol users. Furthermore, the transcription of major antioxidants enzymes (catalase, SOD1, SOD2, GSTK1), and their transcription factor, Nrf2, were reduced in monocytes obtained from HIV positive alcohol users compared to the HIV-negative alcohol user group. However, no significant change in levels of five major cytokines/chemokines were observed between the two groups. The data suggests that alcohol increases oxidative stress in HIV+ patients, perhaps through CYP2E1- and antioxidant enzymes-mediated pathways. The enhanced oxidative stress is accompanied by a failure of cellular antioxidant mechanisms to maintain redox homeostasis. Overall, the enhanced oxidative stress in monocytes may exacerbate HIV pathogenesis in HIV positive alcohol users.",

    "abstract": "HIV infection among children, particularly those under 24 months of age, is often rapidly progressive; as a result guidelines recommend earlier access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV infected children. Losses to follow-up (LTFU) and death in the interval between diagnosis and initiation of ART profoundly limit this strategy. This study explores correlates of LTFU and death prior to ART initiation among children.The study is based on 337 HIV-infected children enrolled into care at an urban centre in The Gambia, including those alive and in care when antiretroviral therapy became available and those who enrolled later. Children were followed until they started ART, died, transferred to another facility, or were LTFU. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the hazard of death or LTFU according to the baseline characteristics of the children.Overall, 223 children were assessed as eligible for ART based on their clinical and/or immunological status among whom 73 (32.7%) started treatment, 15 (6.7%) requested transfer to another health facility, 105 (47.1%) and 30 (13.5%) were lost to follow-up and died respectively without starting ART. The median survival following eligibility for children who died without starting treatment was 2.8 months (IQR: 0.9 - 5.8) with over half (60%) of all deaths occurring at home. ART-eligible children less than 2 years of age and those in WHO stage 3 or 4 were significantly more likely to be LTFU when compared with their respective comparison groups. The overall pre-treatment mortality rate was 25.7 per 100 child-years of follow-up (95% CI 19.9 - 36.8) and the loss to programme rate was 115.7 per 100 child-years of follow-up (95% CI 98.8 - 137). In the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, significant independent predictors of loss to programme were being less than 2 years of age and WHO stage 3 or 4. The Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) for loss to programme was 2.06 (95% CI 1.12 - 3.83) for being aged less than 2 years relative to being 5 years of age or older and 1.92 (95% CI 1.05 - 3.53) for being in WHO stage 3 or 4 relative to WHO stage 1 or 2.Earlier enrolment into HIV care is key to achieving better outcomes for HIV infected children in developing countries. Developing strategies to ensure early diagnosis, elimination of obstacles to prompt initiation of therapy and instituting measures to reduce losses to follow-up, will improve the overall outcomes of HIV-infected children.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) cannot be experienced if they are not taken as prescribed. Yet, not all causes of non-adherence are dependent on the patient. Having to pay for medication reduces adherence rates. Non- adherence has severe public health implications which must be addressed locally and globally. This paper seeks to describe the trends in adherence rates reported in Cameroon and to investigate the determinants of adherence to ART in the Cameroon Mobile Phone SMS (CAMPS) trial. We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, CINAHL, EMBASE and PSYCINFO) for publications on adherence to ART in Cameroon (from January 1999 to May 2012) and described the trend in reported adherence rates and the factors associated with adherence. Data were extracted in duplicate. We used multivariable analyses on the baseline data for 200 participants in the CAMPS trial to determine the factors associated with adherence in four models using different measures of adherence (more than 90% or 95% on the visual analogue scale, no missed doses and a composite measure: 100% on the visual analogue scale, no missed doses and all pills taken on time). We identified nine studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Adherence to ART in Cameroon has risen steadily between 2000 and 2010, corresponding to reductions in the cost of medication. The factors associated with adherence to ART in Cameroon are grouped into patient, medication and disease related factors. We also identified factors related to the health system and the patient-provider relationship. In the CAMPS trial, education, side effects experienced and number of reminder methods were found to improve adherence, but only using multiple reminder methods was associated with better adherence in all the regression models (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 4.11, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.89, 8.93; p<0.001; model IV). Reducing the cost of ART is an important aspect of ensuring adequate adherence rates. Using multiple reminder methods may have a cumulative effect on adherence to ART, but should be investigated further.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is based on the same individual components, but has received several amendments to the original definition. In this study, we verified the prevalence of metabolic syndrome according to different criteria, and the impact of each component on the diagnostic. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled HIV infected patients from a HIV/AIDS reference Center in southern Brazil. Metabolic syndrome was identified according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP-ATPIII), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) criteria, and using a standardized questionnaire and blood testing. Results A sample of 1240, out of 1295, HIV-infected patients was enrolled. Males were on average older, more educated, and had shorter time since the HIV diagnosis. The population attributable risk (PAR) for waist circumference explained 80% of the prevalence among men and women (AHA/NHLBI criteria). Triglycerides had the highest impact on prevalence of metabolic syndrome according to all criteria, independently of age, skin color and HAART use, among men. Conclusions In this large sample of HIV infected patients, the overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome, under either classification, was noticeable and the AHA/NHLBI definition accounted for the highest prevalence.",

EHF was observed in 8 (22%) of individuals at a median of 56 days. 6/8 EHF cases were asymptomatic and resolved with HAART continuation, however one subject with underlying cirrhosis died following rapid hepatic decompensation. EHF was significantly associated with higher baseline ALT (79 IU/L vs 36 IU/L non-EHF, p = 0.008) and HBV DNA (9.9 log10 c/ml vs 8.4 log10 c/ml non EHF, p = 0.009), and subsequent serological change. HBeAg loss occurred in 75% of EHF cases versus 22% in non-EHF (p = 0.04), and HBsAg loss in 25% of EHF cases versus 4% of non-EHF (p = 0.053).EHF after HBV active HAART initiation was frequently observed in this population. Timing of EHF, association with elevated ALT and HBV DNA and high rate of seroconversion are all consistent with immune restoration as the likely underlying process.NCT00192595.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy (PN) which is the most common neurological complication of HIV infection is under recognised and undertreated especially in resource limited settings. This ailment which has a negative impact on the quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients exists in different clinical patterns of which HIV-associated Sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is the most common affecting up to two thirds of patients with advanced disease in some settings. In Cameroon where HIV is a major public health problem, the burden of HIV-SN has not yet been well defined.Using the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screening (BPNS) tool validated by the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) we carried out a cross sectional study to determine the prevalence of HIV-SN and its associated factors among HIV-1 patients at the Douala General Hospital between 1st July and 31st October 2011. HIV-SN was defined as the presence of neuropathic symptoms and at least an abnormal perception of vibrations of a 128Hz tuning fork on the great toe or abnormal ankle reflexes or both and expressed as a percentage of the study population.Out of 295 patients studied, 21% had HIV-SN. In HIV-SN patients the median duration of HIV infection was 79.8 months (IQR 46 - 107.5) and their median CD4 count 153cells/μL (IQR 80 - 280). Patient recall and clinical chart review showed that, 83.9% had neuropathic symptoms prior to HAART initiation and 16.1% after HAART initiation. Low CD4 count, history of alcohol intake and history of anti-tuberculosis treatment were strongly associated with HIV-SN (AOR 2.5, 2.8 and 2.9 respectively).HIV-SN is common among patients with advanced HIV infection in Cameroon. This simple diagnostic tool (BPNS) should therefore be routinely used to detect those with HIV-SN or at risk so as to minimise the negative impact it has on their quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) compromises the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART), resulting in treatment failure of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Although more than a decade has passed since ART was introduced into Indonesia, information on TDR is limited. Here, a genotypic study of TDR among ART-naïve individuals was conducted in Surabaya, Indonesia.HIV-1 seropositive participants were recruited from the communities of commercial sex workers and intravenous drug users as well as from the university teaching hospital in Surabaya. Protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes were sequenced in order to conduct HIV-1 subtyping and phylogenetic analysis and to detect TDR. TDR was defined as the presence of at least one surveillance drug resistance mutation on the WHO list or major drug resistance mutations in the International AIDS Society-USA panel.Fifty two and 47 of the PR and RT genes, respectively, were successfully sequenced in the 58 samples. HIV-1 subtyping revealed that 86.3% (50/58) of the sequenced samples were classified as CRF01_AE, 8.6% as subtype B, 3.4% as B/CRF01_AE, and 1.7% as A/G/CRF01_AE. TDR of PR inhibitors was not detected in this study. In contrast, TDR of RT inhibitors was detected in 4.3% (2/47) of samples. In addition, minor drug resistance mutations were detected in 98.1% (51/52) and 12.8% (6/47) of PR and RT genes, respectively.This study clarified the predominance of the CRF01_AE strain in Surabaya, Indonesia. The prevalence of TDR was below 5%, indicating that the currently available first-line regimen is still effective in Surabaya. However, the prevalence might be underestimated since we detected only major population of HIV-1 in individuals. Therefore, continuous surveillance is required in order to detect the emergence of TDR in the early phase.",

    "abstract": "Because of the shared mean of transmission, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of an important cause of co-morbidity and mortality in peoples living with HIV/AIDS. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the sero-prevalence of HBV infection and associated risk factors in HIV/AIDS positive individuals attending ART clinic at Mekelle hospital, Mekelle, Northern Ethiopia. A cross sectional study was conducted from August to October 2014 in HIV/AIDS positive adult individuals. Socio-demographic data and other explanatory variables were collected from 508 study participants using pre-tested and structured questionnaire-based interviews. Serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected using commercially available rapid test and third generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Bivariate and multivariate analysis, using SPSS V.20.0, were performed to assess the variables associated with HBV infection and P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. A total of 508 study participants, 305 females and 203 males were included in this study with the mean (+SD) age of 37.8 + 9.6. The sero-prevalence of HBsAg was 5.9 %. Male gender (AOR = 2.6, 95 % CI 1.2–5.7), multiple sexual partners (AOR = 4.2, 95 % CI 1.3–13.1) and CD4 count <200 cells/μl (AOR = 3.5, 95 % CI 1.1–11.2) were significantly associated with HBsAg positivity. The prevalence of HBsAg was similar to the general population. However, HIV/AIDS positive individuals with reduced CD4 count, <200 cells/μl, showed a significant association with HBsAg seropositivity. Therefore, we recommended, all HIV/AIDS positive individuals should be screened for HBsAg during their follow for better treatment outcome and minimize risks of HBV transmission.",

    "abstract": "Regimen change is a major challenge for the sustainability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment program. In a resource limited setting where treatment options are limited, designing strategies to increase the durability of original regimen are essential. However, information's on rate of initial regimen change and its predictors is scarce in Ethiopia. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the rate of initial highly active anti retroviral therapy (HAART) regimen change and its predictors among adult HIV patients at the University of Gondar Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. An institutional based retrospective follow up study was conducted among 410 adult HIV patients started HAART from January 2010 to December 2014. Simple random sampling technique was used to select patient records using computer generated random number. Data were collected from patient chart using data extraction tool. The Kaplan–Meier curve was used to estimate the median duration of regimen change. Life table was used to estimate the cumulative survival for initial regimen change and log rank test to compare regimen change survival curves between the different categories of explanatory variables. Bivariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model were used to identify predictors of initial regimen change. The overall incidence rate of initial regimen change was 10.11 (95 % CI 8.29, 12.6) per 100 person years (PY). Baseline WHO clinical stage III (AHR = 1.92, 95 % CI 1.12–3.35), occurrence of tuberculosis (TB) on the initial regimen (AHR = 8.33, 95 % CI 4.47–15.53), side effect on the initial regimen (AHR = 25.27, 95 % CI 15.12–42.00) and co-medication with ART (AHR = 2.5, 95 % CI 1.46–4.34) were significant predictors of initial regimen change. The rate of initial HAART regimen change was found to be high. Having WHO clinical stage III, co-medication with ART, occurrence of tuberculosis and side effect on initial regimen were independent predictors of regimen change. Hence, close follow-up and screening of patient for side effect and tuberculosis is important.",

    "abstract": "Current treatment for HIV-1 largely relies on chemotherapy through the administration of antiretroviral drugs. While the search for anti-HIV-1 vaccine remain elusive, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) have been far-reaching and has changed HIV-1 into a manageable chronic infection. There is compelling evidence, including several side-effects of ARTs, suggesting that eradication of HIV-1 cannot depend solely on antiretrovirals. Gene therapy, an expanding treatment strategy, using RNA interference (RNAi) and programmable nucleases such as meganuclease, zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR–Cas9) are transforming the therapeutic landscape of HIV-1. TALENS and ZFNS are structurally similar modular systems, which consist of a FokI endonuclease fused to custom-designed effector proteins but have been largely limited, particularly ZFNs, due to their complexity and cost of protein engineering. However, the newly developed CRISPR–Cas9 system, consists of a single guide RNA (sgRNA), which directs a Cas9 endonuclease to complementary target sites, and serves as a superior alternative to the previous protein-based systems. The techniques have been successfully applied to the development of better HIV-1 models, generation of protective mutations in endogenous/host cells, disruption of HIV-1 genomes and even reactivating latent viruses for better detection and clearance by host immune response. Here, we focus on gene editing-based HIV-1 treatment and research in addition to providing perspectives for refining these techniques.",

Dolutegravir (DTG, S/GSK1349572), a second-generation drug that overcomes such shortcomings, is under spotlight. The purpose of this study is to review the evidence for DTG use in clinical settings, including its efficacy and safety. PubMed, EMbase, Ovid, Web of Science, Science Direct, and related websites were screened from establishment until July 2013, and scientific meeting proceedings were manually searched. Two reviewers independently screened 118 citations repeatedly to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of DTG-based regimen with those of RAL- or elvitegravir-based regimens. Using the selected studies with comparable outcome measures and indications, we performed a meta-analysis based on modified intention-to-treat (mITT), on-treatment (OT), and as-treated (AT) virological outcome data. Independent data extraction and quality assessment were conducted. Four unique studies were included with the use of DTG in antiretroviral therapy-naive patients. In therapy-naive patients, DTG combined with abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) resulted in a significantly better virological outcome with a mITT relative risk (RR)of 1.07 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI 1.03–1.12). Evidence further supported use of DTG had a better virological suppression in the 50 mg once daily group (mITT RR 1.07; 95 % CI 1.03–1.12) as well as in the sub-analysis in dolutegravir/efavirenz(DTG/EFV) and dolutegravir/raltegravir (DTG/RAL) groups (RR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.03–1.15; RR 1.06, 95 % CI 0.98–1.15, respectively). In the matter of safety of DTG-based regimen, the risk of any event was RR 0.98 (95 % CI 0.94–1.01), the risk of serious adverse events (AEs) was RR 0.84 (95 % CI 0.62–1.15), and the risk of drug-related serious AEs was RR 0.33 (95 % CI 0.13–0.79).

The utility and safety of VSV as a vaccine vector was recently demonstrated near the end of the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa where VSV pseudotyped with the Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein was proven safe in humans and provided protective efficacy against EBOV in a human phase III clinical trial. A team of Canadian scientists, led by Dr. Gary Kobinger, is now working with International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) in developing a VSV-based HIV vaccine that will combine unique Canadian research on the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein and on the VSV vaccine vector.

    "abstract": "Mental health (MH) comorbidities reduce retention in care for persons living with HIV (PLWH) and are associated with poor health outcomes. Optimizing retention in primary care is vital, as poor retention is associated with delayed receipt of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, ARV non-adherence, and poor health outcomes, including failure to suppress viral load, decreased CD4 counts, and clinically significant ARV drug resistance. We hypothesized that MH service utilization would be associated with improved retention in care for patients with HIV and MH comorbidities. This is a retrospective analysis of PLWH initiating outpatient HIV health care at a university-affiliated HIV clinic between January 2007 and December 2013. We examined the association between MH service utilization and retention in care, the outcome of interest, using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Overall, 627 (84.4%) out of 743 patients were retained in care using the Health Resources & Services Administration HIV/AIDS Bureau (HRSA/HAB) metric. A multivariable model adjusted for several sociodemographic factors, MH comorbidities, and MH service utilization. The results suggest that lack of health insurance (public ORadj = 0.3, p < 0.01; no insurance ORadj = 0.4, p < 0.01) and ≥ 3 MH comorbidities (ORadj = 0.3, P = 0.01) were associated with decreased retention in care. Conversely, older age (> 45 years, ORadj. = 1.6, p = 0.14) and ≥ 3 MH service utilization visits (ORadj. = 6.8, p < 0.01) were associated with increased retention in care. Even in the absence of documented MH comorbidities, improved retention in care was observed with increasing MH service utilization. In order to achieve the US-based National HIV/AIDS Strategy goal of 90% retention in care for PLWH, MH service utilization should be considered along with other evidence-based interventions to improve retention for PLWH newly engaged in care.",

This study describes access, utilization and ongoing social support needs among adolescents living with HIV aged 15–17 in transition from pediatric to adult HIV care in Cambodia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 328 adolescents, randomly selected from 11 antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics across the country. Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarize their characteristics, access to social support and ongoing support needs among male and female adolescents. Mean age of the study participants was 15.8 (SD = 0.8) years. Just over half (55.2%) were male. Most had at least one deceased parent (mother 50.9%; father 60.5%), and majority were living with biological parents (40.8%) or relatives (49.3%). A third came from families with an ID poor card, and 21.0% were working for pay. Almost half (46.6%) reported that their family had received social support for their health care, including food support (76.5%), school allowance (62.1%), transport allowance to ART clinics (53.6%), psychosocial counseling (35.3%), vocational training (22.9%) or home visits (11.1%). Several ongoing social support needs were identified, including ongoing inability to cover health expenses unless they are supported by health insurance or health equity fund (55.0%). In addition, adolescents reported having been asked to come back earlier than their scheduled appointment (13.7%), having had to purchase their own drugs (2.7%), experiencing HIV stigma (32.0%), having been denied housing or food due to HIV (8.2%) or failing to attend school within the past month partly because of HIV (16.8%). Two-thirds did not have access to peer support groups. Social protection mechanisms are reaching some adolescents in need, while other remain without social support due to discontinuities in health and social care. Multi-sectoral interventions, supporting school attendance, adolescent-friendly clinic scheduling, reductions in child employment, mitigation of HIV-related stigma and strengthening of peer-to-peer support are required to improve coverage of social protection interventions for adolescents in transition.",

    "abstract": "Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an alarming problem in North African countries, but few studies have analyzed the geographical distribution of the epidemic. Libya, the second largest country in Africa and with the longest coast on the Mediterranean basin facing Europe, has experienced major outbreaks of HIV infection. Since then, no studies have followed up on the burden of HIV infections. To plan interventions and allocate resources, spatial analysis of HIV/AIDS clusters are required in order to identify epidemic foci and trends in the country. The objective of this study was to assess HIV infection clustering and trends in Libya. Information on all recorded HIV/AIDS cases during 1993–2017 were extracted from the National Reporting System. A total of 8015 newly diagnosed HIV cases with address information were included. Spatial autocorrelation and spatial–temporal analysis were used to identify HIV clusters. Spatial correlations between cases and socio-demographic factors were determined using spatial regression. HIV cases steadily increased within the Libyan population, particularly among those aged < 27 years. Spatiotemporal analysis showed marked geographic and temporal variation of HIV infection, particularly during 2005–2012. The risk factors varied from one region to another, and the contribution of injection drug use to infection increased with time. Four clusters in three time periods were identified, three on the Mediterranean coast and one in the south. HIV is an emerging problem in Libya, particularly among young adults. The infection rate varies greatly among the regions and districts, particularly within certain definable geographical areas. Effective intervention strategies are needed to contain HIV infections, especially within the endemic areas.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Rapid diagnostic Test (RDT) kits are the preferred assays for HIV testing in many countries. Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission, Know Your Status Campaigns, Blood-Safety, Voluntary Counseling and Testing are major strategies adapted to control transmission of the virus and the pivot of these interventions is either screening or diagnosing individuals through testing. There are reports of inconsistent sensitivity and specificity with whole blood and serum samples collected from the same individual. Little is known about the diagnostic characteristics of First Response HIV-1-2 RDT kit, used as a single test kit in national HIV prevention and control programmes. The debate has always centered on choosing between whole blood and serum in a case where a single test kit that runs on only blood specimen will be used for testing. The variations in specificities and sensitivities with whole blood and serum samples imply that some individuals who might be true positives will be missed and elude care. This study determined the best blood-based specimen type (whole blood or serum) that improves performance of First Response HIV RDT kit in detecting HIV-specific antibodies.A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 280 HIV infected and non-infected patients from May 2015 to June 2015. Blood samples from each participant were separated into whole blood and serum, and tested on First Response HIV-1-2 kits (Premier Medical Corporation Ltd., Kachigam, India) using Electro-chemi-luminescence assay (ECLIA) as reference assay.First Response HIV-1-2 RDT kit showed 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity with whole blood specimen and 100 % sensitivity and 82.86 % specificity with serum specimen for the detection of HIV-1. The positive and negative predictive values were 100, 100 and 85.35, 82.86 % for whole blood and serum respectively.Whole blood specimen(s) from an individual have higher specificity, positive and negative predictive values than serum. Whole blood is the primary specimen to use on First Response HIV-1-2 RDT kit when screening peripheral blood for HIV-1-specific antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The link between food insecurity and depression in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) has been explored in numerous studies; however, the existing evidence is inconclusive due to inconsistent results. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between food insecurity and depression in PLWHA. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus to identify relevant studies. A random-effect model was used for conducting the meta-analysis. We assessed the risk of publication bias by funnel plot and Egger’s regression asymmetry test. Results In this review, seven studies were included in the final analysis. Our meta-analysis revealed that food insecurity significantly increased the risk of depression in PLWHA [RR 2.28 (95% CI 1.56–3.32)]. This association remained significant after adjusting for the confounding effects of drug use [RR 1.63 (95% CI 1.27–2.10)], social support [RR 2.21 (95% CI 1.18–4.16)] as well as ART drugs [RR 1.96 (95% CI 1.17–3.28)]. Our subgroup and sensitivity confirmed the robustness of the main analysis. Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis suggest a significant association between food insecurity and increased risk of depression PLWHA. Therefore, early screening and management of food insecurity in PLWHA seem to be necessary.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) remain disproportionately affected by HIV. In a rural area of South Africa with an annual incidence (2011–2015) of 5 and 7% per annum for 15–19 and 20–24-year olds respectively, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could provide AGYW with a form of HIV prevention they can more easily control. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we describe findings from a study conducted in 2017 that assessed knowledge of and attitudes toward PrEP to better understand community readiness for an AGYW PrEP rollout. Methods We used descriptive analysis of a quantitative demographic survey (n = 8,414 ages 15–86) to identify population awareness and early PrEP adopters. We also conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 52 potential PrEP gatekeepers (health care workers, community leaders) to assess their potential influence in an AGYW PrEP rollout and describe the current sexual health landscape. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and iteratively coded to identify major themes. Results PrEP knowledge in the general population, measured through a demographic survey, was low (n = 125/8,414, 1.49% had heard of the drug). Medicalized delivery pathways created hostility to AGYW PrEP use. Key informants had higher levels of knowledge about PrEP and saw it as a needed intervention. Community norms around adolescent sexuality, which painted sexually active youth as irresponsible and disengaged from their own health, made many ambivalent towards a PrEP rollout to AGYW. Health care workers discussed ways to shame AGYW if they tried to access PrEP as they feared the drug would encourage promiscuity and “risky” behaviour. Others interviewed opposed provision on the basis of health care equity and feared PrEP would divert both drug and human resources from treatment programs. Conclusions The health system in this poor, high-HIV incidence area had multiple barriers to a PrEP rollout to AGYW. Norms around adolescent sexuality and gatekeeper concerns that PrEP could divert health resources from treatment to prevention could create barriers to PrEP roll-out in this setting. Alternate modes of delivery, particularly those which are youth-led and demedicalize PrEP, must be explored.",

The division of infectious diseases of ASST (Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale) Spedali Civili Hospital of Brescia had to face a great number of inpatients with severe COVID-19 infection and to ensure the continuum of care for almost 4000 outpatients with HIV infection actively followed by us. In a recent manuscript we described the impact of the pandemic on continuum of care in our HIV cohort expressed as number of missed visits, number of new HIV diagnosis, drop in ART (antiretroviral therapy) dispensation and number of hospitalized HIV patients due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this short communication, we completed the previous article with data of HIV plasmatic viremia of the same cohort before and during pandemic. Methods We considered all HIV-patients in stable ART for at least 6 months and with at least 1 available HIV viremia in the time window March 01–November 30, 2019, and another group of HIV patients with the same two requisites but in different time windows of the COVID-19 period (March 01–May 31, 2020, and June 01–November 30, 2020). For patients with positive viremia (PV) during COVID-19 period, we reported also the values of viral load (VL) just before and after PV. Results: the percentage of patients with PV during COVID-19 period was lower than the previous year (2.8% vs 7%). Only 1% of our outpatients surely suffered from pandemic in term of loss of previous viral suppression. Conclusions Our efforts to limit the impact of pandemic on our HIV outpatients were effective to ensure HIV continuum of care.",

The main objective of this study was to assess these factors as potential barriers to adherence among patients receiving care in central Haiti.A cross-sectional study was conducted among PLH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the TB/HIV clinic at St. Therese Hospital in Hinche, Haiti. A total of 426 potential participants were approached during their follow-up visits from June to August 2019, of whom 411 participated in the study. After giving informed consent, study participants completed a structured interview that included the Self-Report Item Scale (SRIS), a standard measure, to assess adherence. Socio-demographic, economic and clinical factors were assessed for their association with adherence.The 411 participating patients represented 39% of the patient population at the TB/HIV clinic during the timeframe of the study. The mean age was 43.7 years (range: 19-80), 65.5% were female and 78.1% had only achieved a primary level of schooling. Nearly 78% had received ART for less than 10 years, 3.41% reported having poor adherence and 28% less than excellent adherence. Factors related to poor adherence in bivariate analysis were age less than 40 years (OR: 6.32, 95% CI 2.04-10.58, p < 0.01) and inability to meet basic needs (OR: 2.70, 95% CI 1.04-7.0, p = 0.03).To improve medication adherence, the hospital should strengthen patient counselling of younger recipients of ART and provide financial assistance and other social service interventions. Studies should be implemented in other HIV management centers in Haiti and similar contexts to examine barriers to ART adherence with the goal of improving prognosis and survival in the long-term among PLH in resource-limited setting.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the discontinuation of first ART before and after the availability of better tolerated and less complex regimens by comparing the frequency, reasons and associations with patient characteristics. Methods A total of 3019 ART-naive patients registered in the HIV-TR cohort who started ART between Jan 2011 and Feb 2017 were studied. Only the first modification within the first year of treatment for each patient was included in the analyses. Reasons were classified as listed in the coded form in the web-based database. Cumulative incidences were analysed using competing risk function and factors associated with discontinuation of the ART regimen were examined using Cox proportional hazards models and Fine-Gray competing risk regression models. Results The initial ART regimen was discontinued in 351 out of 3019 eligible patients (11.6%) within the first year. The main reason for discontinuation was intolerance/toxicity (45.0%), followed by treatment simplification (9.7%), patient willingness (7.4%), poor compliance (7.1%), prevention of future toxicities (6.0%), virologic failure (5.4%), and provider preference (5.4%). Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based (aHR = 4.4, [95% CI 3.0–6.4]; p &lt; 0.0001) or protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens (aHR = 4.3, [95% CI 3.1–6.0]; p &lt; 0.0001) relative to integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI)-based regimens were significantly associated with ART discontinuation. ART initiated at a later period (2015-Feb 2017) (aHR = 0.6, [95% CI 0.4–0.9]; p &lt; 0.0001) was less likely to be discontinued. A lower rate of treatment discontinuation for intolerance/toxicity was observed with InSTI-based regimens (2.0%) than with NNRTI- (6.6%) and PI-based regimens (7.5%) (p &lt; 0.001). The percentage of patients who achieved HIV RNA &lt; 200 copies/mL within 12 months of ART initiation was 91% in the ART discontinued group vs. 94% in the continued group (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion ART discontinuation due to intolerance/toxicity and virologic failure decreased over time. InSTI-based regimens were less likely to be discontinued than PI- and NNRTI-based ART.",

We describe the viral load (VL) cascade, the incidence of virological failure and associated risk factors among people living with HIV receiving first-line ART in an HIV cohort in Myanmar treated by the Médecins Sans Frontières in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Sports Myanmar. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study, including adult patients with at least one HIV viral load test result and having received of at least 6 months’ standard first-line ART. The incidence rate of virological failure (HIV viral load ≥ 1000 copies/mL) was calculated. Multivariable Cox’s regression was performed to identify risk factors for virological failure. Results We included 25,260 patients with a median age of 33.1 years (interquartile range, IQR 28.0–39.1) and a median observation time of 5.4 years (IQR 3.7–7.9). Virological failure was documented in 3,579 (14.2%) participants, resulting in an overall incidence rate for failure of 2.5 per 100 person-years of follow-up. Among those who had a follow-up viral load result, 1,258 (57.1%) had confirmed virological failure, of which 836 (66.5%) were switched to second-line treatment. An increased hazard for failure was associated with age ≤ 19 years (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR 1.51; 95% confidence intervals, CI 1.20–1.89; p &lt; 0.001), baseline tuberculosis (aHR 1.39; 95% CI 1.14–1.49; p &lt; 0.001), a history of low-level viremia (aHR 1.60; 95% CI 1.42–1.81; p &lt; 0.001), or a history of loss-to-follow-up (aHR 1.24; 95% CI 1.41–1.52; p = 0.041) and being on the same regimen (aHR 1.37; 95% CI 1.07–1.76; p &lt; 0.001). Cumulative appointment delay was not significantly associated with failure after controlling for covariates. Conclusions VL monitoring is an important tool to improve programme outcomes, however limited coverage of VL testing and acting on test results hampers its full potential. In our cohort children and adolescents, PLHIV with history of loss-to-follow-up or those with low-viremia are at the highest risk of virological failure and might require more frequent virological monitoring than is currently recommended.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Maintaining optimal adherence and viral suppression in people living with HIV (PLWH) is essential to ensure both preventative and therapeutic benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Prisoners bear a particularly high burden of HIV infection and are highly likely to transmit to others during and after incarceration. However, the level of treatment adherence and viral suppression in incarcerated populations in low-income countries is unknown. This study aimed to determine factors affecting optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy and viral suppression amongst HIV-infected prisoners in South Ethiopia. Methods A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted between June 1, 2019 and May 31, 2020 to compare the level of adherence and viral suppression between incarcerated and non-incarcerated PLWH. Patient information including demographic, socio-economic, behavioral, and incarceration-related characteristics were collected using a structured questionnaire. Medication adherence was assessed according to self-report and pharmacy refill. Plasma viral load measurements undertaken within the study period were prospectively extracted to determine viral suppression. Univariate and multivariate logistic and fractional regression models were used to analyse data. Results Seventy-four inmates living with HIV (ILWH) and 296 non-incarcerated PLWH participated in the study. While ILWH had a significantly higher pharmacy refill adherence compared to non-incarcerated PLWH (89 vs 75%), they had a slightly lower dose adherence (81% vs 83%). The prevalence of viral non-suppression was also slightly higher in ILWH (6.0%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7–14.6%) compared to non-incarcerated PLWH (4.5%; 95%CI: 2.4–7.5%). Overall, missing ART appointments, dissatisfaction with ART services, inability to comply with a specified medication schedule, and types of methods used to monitor the schedule (e.g., news time on radio/TV or other social cues) were significantly associated with non-adherence according to self-report. In ILWH specifically, accessing ART services from a hospital, inability to properly attend clinic appointments, depressive symptoms, and lack of social support predicted NA. Viral non-suppression was significantly higher in males, people of age 31to 35 years and in those who experienced social stigma, regardless of their incarceration status. Conclusions Sub-optimal dose adherence and viral suppression are generally higher in HIV-infected prisoners in South Ethiopia compared to their non-incarcerated counterparts. A multitude of factors were found to be responsible for this requiring multilevel intervention strategies focusing on the specific needs of prisoners.",

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding its safety in real-clinical settings due to ADEs and being a recently introduced drug there is need to actively monitor for ADEs, hence this study aimed to establish the prevalence and factors associated with ADEs among patients on dolutegravir-based regimen at the Immune Suppression Syndrome (ISS) Clinic- Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH).A mixed design study was conducted at ISS Clinic-MRRH among 375 randomly selected patients who had been exposed to DTG-based regimen for at-least 12 weeks. These were interviewed to obtain data on socio-demographics, dietary habits and their files reviewed for ADEs. Data entry was done using Epi-data 3.0 and exported to SPSS 25.0 for analysis. Prevalence was determined as a percentage, and ADE associated factors assessed using bivariate analysis, those found significant were further subjected to multivariate analysis and considered significant at P < 0.05.The prevalence of ADEs among patients on DTG-based regimen was found to be 33.1% (124/375) with 5.6% (7/124) participants discontinued from treatment due ADEs, 4 due to hyperglycemia and 3 liver toxicity.

Patients with undetectable viral load at initiation of DTG-based regimen were 67.6% less likely to experience ADEs (AOR = 0.324, 95% CI 0.1167-0.629).This study reports a prevalence of 33.1% of ADEs among patients on DTG-based regimen. The most commonly experienced ADE was allergy. Male sex, early HIV disease stage at entry into care and detectable viral load at initiation of DTG-based regimen were significantly associated with ADEs.

Although, HIV viral load is reduced by antiretroviral therapy (ART), the number of people on ART continues to rise in Ghana. In the Kumasi Metropolis, Ghana, we looked at the socio-demographic factors associated with medication adherence among PLHIV.A quantitative study involving 420 PLHIV who sought healthcare at the Kumasi South Regional Hospital was conducted utilizing a cross-sectional study design. We employed a structured questionnaire to collect data on medication adherence using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) and socio-demographic factors that influence medication adherence. The data were analysed using Stata 14.2. Frequencies and percentages were used to present the descriptive data. The association between socio-demographic factors and medication adherence among PLHIV was investigated using both univariate and multivariate analyses.More than half (53.10%) of PLHIV adhered to ART. Place of residence was significantly established to be influencing medication adherence among PLHIV. PLHIV who were residing in urban centers (aOR = 3.61; CI = 2.24-5.82) were more likely to adhere to medication as compared to those who resided in rural areas.Slightly more than half of PLHIV took their medicines as prescribed. Government and Policymakers such as the Ghana AIDS Commission, Ministry of Health, and Ghana Health Service should incorporate socio-demographic factors such as place of residence while creating and executing medication adherence initiatives to evaluate HIV management regimen for PLHIV.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an acquired defect of the cellular immunity associated with the infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The disease has reached pandemic proportion and has been considered a public health concern. This study is aimed at analyzing the trend of HIV/AIDS research in Nigeria. Method We used the PUBMED database to a conduct bibliometric analysis of HIV/AIDS-related research in Nigeria from 1986 to 2021 employing “HIV”, “AIDS”, “acquired immunodeficiency syndrome”, “Human immunodeficiency virus”, and “Nigeria” as search description. The most common bibliometric indicators were applied for the selected publications. Result The number of scientific research articles retrieved for HIV/AIDS-related research in Nigeria was 2796. Original research was the predominant article type. Articles authored by 4 authors consisted majority of the papers. The University of Ibadan was found to be the most productive institution. Institutions in the United States dominated external production with the University of Maryland at the top. The most utilized journal was PLoS ONE. While Iliyasu Z. was the most productive principal author, Crowel TA. was the overall most productive author with the highest collaborative strength. The keyword analysis using overlay visualization showed a gradual shift from disease characteristics to diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Trend in HIV/AIDS research in Nigeria is increasing yet evolving. Four articles were retracted while two had an expression of concern. Conclusion The growth of scientific literature in HIV/AIDS-related research in Nigeria was found to be high and increasing. However, the hotspot analysis still shows more unexplored grey areas in future.",

    "abstract": "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated clinical efficacy in preventing HIV infection, yet its uptake remains low. This study, conducted in five PrEP implementing districts in Lesotho, examined factors motivating persons at risk of HIV infection to adopt or reject PrEP when offered freely.In-depth interviews were undertaken with stakeholders directly engaged with PrEP policy (n = 5), program implementation (n = 4), and use (current PrEP users = 55, former PrEP users = 36, and PrEP decliners (n = 6)). Focus group discussions (n = 11, 105 total participants) were conducted with health staff directly providing HIV and PrEP services.Demand for PrEP was reported highest among those at greatest risk for HIV acquisition: those in serodiscordant relationships and/or engaged in sex work. Culturally sensitive PrEP counseling was described as an opportunity to transfer knowledge, build trust, and address user concerns. Conversely, top-down counseling resulted in PrEP distrust and confusion about HIV status. Key motivations for PrEP uptake revolved around sustaining core social relationships, desire for safer conception, and caring for ailing relatives. The decline of PrEP initiation was driven by a combination of individual-level factors (risk perception, perceived side effects, disbelief of the drug's efficacy and PrEP's daily pill regimen), societal factors (lack of social support and HIV-related stigma), and structural factors related to PrEP access.Our findings suggest strategies for effective national PrEP rollout and implementation include: (1) demand creation campaigns which highlight positive aspects of PrEP, while simultaneously addressing apprehensions for uptake; (2) strengthening health provider counseling capacity; and (3) addressing societal and structural HIV-related stigma.",

It predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals, including those living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Case Presentation We present a unique case of bifocal malakoplakia in a 49-year-old man, previously with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and HIV positive, presented with respiratory symptoms, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. He had various infections including Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Candida, with evolving lung and gastrointestinal issues. Despite treatment attempts, he deteriorated due to respiratory distress, multi-organ failure, and coagulopathy, leading to his unfortunate demise. Conclusion This report presents a distinctive and complex case of malakoplakia in an HIV-positive patient, a rare inflammatory disorder originally described by Michaelis and Gutmann in 1902. The hallmark Michaelis-Gutmann organisms were observed, confirming the diagnosis. While typically affecting the urinary tract, this case demonstrates the exceptional ability of malakoplakia to manifest in various organ systems, including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and more. Although Escherichia coli is a prevalent associated pathogen, the exact cause remains elusive. Treatment, often involving surgical excision and antibiotic therapy, underscores the challenging nature of managing this condition in immunocompromised individuals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Maternal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) commonly occurs from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding which accounts for almost all the new HIV infections among children aged 0–14 years. Despite major efforts and progress in controlling and preventing HIV, it continues to pose a great public health threat, especially in Indonesia. This study assessed the factors associated with the knowledge of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV among reproductive-age women in Indonesia. Methods This study used data from the 2017 Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey ( IDHS). We sampled 39,735 reproductive-age women (15–49 years) for analysis. Using Stata version 16.0, multilevel logistic regression models were fitted, and the results were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with their confidence intervals (CIs). Results The study found that 72% of women had knowledge of MTCT of HIV. Women who were aged between 45 and 49 years (aOR = 1.65, 95%CI = 1.46–1.88) had higher odds of knowledge of MTCT of HIV than those aged 15–19 years. Women who attained higher education (aOR = 2.92, 95%CI = 2.06–4.15) had increased odds of knowledge of MTCT of HIV than those with no formal education. Women who had four children (aOR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05–1.35) had higher odds of knowledge of MTCT of HIV than nulliparous women. Women who frequently read newspapers/magazines (aOR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.06–1.25) and frequently used the internet almost every day (aOR = 1.28, 95%CI = 1.19–1.38) had higher odds of knowledge of MTCT of HIV than those who did not read newspapers/magazines and non-users of internet, respectively. Women within the richer (aOR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.02–1.20) and the richest (aOR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.04–1.25) wealth quintile higher odds of knowledge of MTCT of HIV than those in the poorest wealth quantile. Women who resided in rural areas were less likely to have knowledge of MTCT of HIV (aOR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.74–0.86) than those in urban settlements. Conclusions Knowledge of MTCT of HIV was slightly above average. The study findings on the factors associated with knowledge of MTCT of HIV provide evidence for policymakers and clinicians to utilize in the quest to eliminate MTCT of HIV among children. We recommend that awareness programs should consider the key findings from this study when delivering public education or when developing interventions to improve women’s knowledge on MTCT of HIV.",

We present pooled TANGO and SALSA efficacy and safety results dichotomized by age (&lt; 50 and ≥ 50 years). Methods Week 48 data from the open-label phase 3 TANGO and SALSA trials evaluating switch to once-daily dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) fixed-dose combination vs continuing current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) were pooled. Proportions of participants with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 and &lt; 50 copies/mL (Snapshot, intention-to-treat exposed) and safety were analyzed by age category. Adjusted mean change from baseline in CD4 + cell count was assessed using mixed-models repeated-measures analysis. Results Of 1234 participants, 80% of whom were male, 29% were aged ≥ 50 years. Among those aged ≥ 50 years, 1/177 (&lt; 1%) DTG/3TC participant and 3/187 (2%) CAR participants had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks; proportions with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL were high in both treatment groups (≥ 92%), consistent with overall efficacy and similar to observations in participants aged &lt; 50 years (≥ 93%). Regardless of age category, CD4 + cell count increased or was maintained from baseline with DTG/3TC. Change from baseline in CD4 + /CD8 + ratio was similar across age groups and between treatment groups. One CAR participant aged &lt; 50 years had confirmed virologic withdrawal, but no resistance was detected. In the DTG/3TC group, incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar across age groups. Proportions of AEs leading to withdrawal were low and comparable between age groups. Although drug-related AEs were generally low, across age groups, drug-related AEs were more frequent in participants who switched to DTG/3TC compared with those who continued CAR. While few serious AEs were observed in both treatment groups, more were reported in participants aged ≥ 50 years vs &lt; 50 years. Conclusions Among individuals with HIV-1, switching to DTG/3TC maintained high rates of virologic suppression and demonstrated a favorable safety profile, including in those aged ≥ 50 years despite higher prevalence of concomitant medication use and comorbidities.

However, there is a lack of data on the post-pandemic period. This study aims to evaluate the resumption of HIV services and retention in care for adolescents and young people in the period following the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using interrupted time series analysis. Three periods were considered: pre-pandemic (form June 2019 to March 2020), pandemic (form April 2020 to March 2022) post-pandemic (from April 2022 to March 2023). Six outcome measures were considered: number of outpatient visits, HIV tests, HIV positivity ratio, the antiretroviral treatment (ART) non-adherence ratio, recall ratio, and the return ratio for adolescent and young adults on ART. Results During the study period, 447,515 outpatient visits and 126,096 HIV tests were recorded. After a reduction at the beginning of the pandemic period, both visits and tests increased during the pandemic (p &lt; 0.05) and decreased in the post-pandemic (p &lt; 0.05), recovering the pre-pandemic trends. The HIV positivity ratio slightly decreased from 3.3% to 1.7% during the study period (p &lt; 0.05). The ART non-adherence ratio decreased from 23.4% to 2.4% throughout the study period (p &lt; 0.05), with a drop at the beginning of the post-pandemic period (p &lt; 0.05). The recall ratio increased during the study period (p &lt; 0.05) with a drop at the beginning of the pandemic and post-pandemic periods (p &lt; 0.05). The return ratio decreased at the beginning of the pandemic (p &lt; 0.05) but returned to the pre-pandemic ratio in the post-pandemic period. Conclusions The post-pandemic values of the investigated outcomes were comparable to pre-pandemic period, or even improved. Differently from other services, such as the community activities, that have been severely affected by COVID-19 pandemic, the HIV service system has shown resilience following emergency situation.",

This study aims to identify determinants of virologic failure among adult clients on ART at health facilities in Oromia region of Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based unmatched case-control study was conducted at health facilities in Oromia region from August 1 to September 1, 2022. The study cases were clients with virologic-confirmed first-line ART failure, while controls were clients on first-line ART with a suppressed viral load. A total of 135 cases and 268 control participants were selected using simple random sampling techniques, and data were collected by reviewing the client’s document. Epi-Info7 was used for data entry and SPSS version 20 for data analysis. Variables having a P-value of less than 0.25 in the bi-variable analysis were included in multivariable logistic regression. Determinants of virologic failure were determined based on an adjusted odds ratio using 95% CI and a P-value of &lt; 0.05. Result In this study, clients with an age ≥ 35 years (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.6, 7.0), clients with a baseline regimen of AZT + 3TC + NVP (AOR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.4, 8.8), clients with a base-line CD4 count &lt; 350 mm 3 (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.5), being single marital status (AOR = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.4, 10.5), TB-HIV coinfection (AOR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.3, 5.1), and having opportunistic infection other than TB in the last six months (AOR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.5, 6.3) were factors significantly associated with virologic failure while clients within the appointment spacing model (AOR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.10) is inversely associated with virologic failure. Conclusion This study showed that age ≥ 35 years, being single, baseline ART regimen with (AZT + 3TC + NVP), baseline CD4 cell count &lt; 350 mm 3 , Tb-co infection, and opportunistic infection in the last 6 months were factors associated with virologic failure.

In 2021, the uptake of TB preventive treatment among the children and adolescents living with HIV at the Baylor-Uganda HIV clinic was 45%, which was below the national target of 90%. Minimal evidence documents the enablers and barriers to TB preventive treatment (TPT) initiation and completion among children and adolescents living with HIV(CALHIV). We explored the facilitators and barriers to TPT initiation and completion among CALHIV among adolescents aged 10-19years and caretakers of children below 18years. We conducted a qualitative study from February 2022 to March 2023, at three paediatric and adolescent HIV treatment centers in Uganda. In-depth interviews were conducted at TPT initiation and after completion for purposively selected health workers, adolescents aged 10–19 years living with HIV, and caretakers of children aged below 18years. The desire to avoid TB disease, previous TB treatment, encouragement from family members, and ministry of health policies emerged as key facilitators for the children and adolescents to initiate TPT. Barriers to TPT initiation included; TB and HIV-related stigma, busy carer and adolescent work schedules, reduced social support from parents and family, history of drug side effects, high pill burden and fatigue, and perception of not being ill. TPT completion was enabled by combined TPT and ART refill visits, delivery of ART and TPT within the community, and continuous education and counseling from health workers. Reported barriers to TPT completion included TB and HIV-related stigma, long waiting time. Non-disclosure of HIV status by caretakers to CALHIV and fear of side effects was cited by health workers as a barrier to starting TPT. Facilitators of TPT initiation and completion reported by healthcare workers included patient and caretaker health education, counselling about benefits of TPT and risk of TB disease, having same appointment for TPT and ART refill to reduce patient waiting time, adolescent-friendly services, and appointment reminder phone calls. The facilitators and barriers of TPT initiation and completion among CALHIV span from individual, to health system and structural factors. Health education about benefits of TPT and risk of TB, social support, adolescent-friendly services, and joint appointments for TPT and ART refill are major facilitators of TPT initiation and completion among CALHIV in Uganda.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between HIV serostatus disclosure and sexual risk behavior is inconsistent across studies. As men who have sex with men (MSM) are emerging as the key affected population in Bangkok, Thailand with reported HIV prevalence of 30%, we assessed whether HIV disclosure is associated with protected sex in this population.A risk behavior questionnaire was administered using Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interviewing (ACASI) to determine whether HIV serostatus disclosure was associated with protected sex in 200 HIV-positive MSM in Bangkok. HIV serostatus disclosure to the most recent sexual partner prior to or at the time of the sexual encounter was assessed. Protected sex was defined as insertive or receptive anal intercourse with a condom at the most recent sexual encounter.The mean age was 30.2 years, CD4 was 353 cells/mm3, and one-third was on antiretroviral therapy. At the most recent sexual encounter, HIV serostatus disclosure rate was low (26%); 60.5% of subjects had not discussed their serostatus at all, while 5.5% had not revealed their true serostatus. Seventeen percent reported unprotected anal intercourse and about half had sex with their primary partners. The serostatus of the most recent sexual partner was HIV-positive in 19.2%, HIV-negative in 26.4%, and unknown in 54.4% of subjects. There was no association between disclosure and protected sex, with 41 of 48 (85.4%) disclosers and 104 of 126 (82.5%) of non-disclosers reported protected sex (p = .65). Subjects with HIV-positive partners were less likely to report protected sex overall (20 of 33, 60.6%) compared to those with HIV negative (82 of 96, 85.4%) or unknown (41 of 45, 91.1%) partners (p = .001). Age (27-32 years vs. ≤26 years, p = .008), primary partner status (p < .001), and HIV-positive serostatus of sexual partner (p < .001) were significantly associated with disclosure in the multivariate analyses.Rates of HIV disclosure to sexual partners by HIV-positive MSM in Bangkok are low. Despite low rates of HIV serostatus disclosure, most HIV-positive MSM reported protected sex with their partners at risk for infection. Future studies should focus on understanding barriers to disclosure and factors driving risk behavior amongst MSM in Thailand.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The objective of this study is to identify the critical formulation parameters controlling distribution and function for the rectal administration of microbicides in humans. Four placebo formulations were designed with a wide range of hydrophilic characteristics (aqueous to lipid) and rheological properties (Newtonian, shear thinning, thermal sensitive and thixotropic). Aqueous formulations using typical polymers to control viscosity were iso-osmotic and buffered to pH 7. Lipid formulations were developed from lipid solvent/lipid gelling agent binary mixtures. Testing included pharmaceutical function and stability as well as in vitro and in vivo toxicity. Results The aqueous fluid placebo, based on poloxamer, was fluid at room temperature, thickened and became shear thinning at 37°C. The aqueous gel placebo used carbopol as the gelling agent, was shear thinning at room temperature and showed a typical decrease in viscosity with an increase in temperature. The lipid fluid placebo, myristyl myristate in isopropyl myristate, was relatively thin and temperature independent. The lipid gel placebo, glyceryl stearate and PEG-75 stearate in caprylic/capric triglycerides, was also shear thinning at both room temperature and 37°C but with significant time dependency or thixotropy. All formulations showed no rectal irritation in rabbits and were non-toxic using an ex vivo rectal explant model. Conclusions Four placebo formulations ranging from fluid to gel in aqueous and lipid formats with a range of rheological properties were developed, tested, scaled-up, manufactured under cGMP conditions and enrolled in a formal stability program. Clinical testing of these formulations as placebos will serve as the basis for further microbicide formulation development with drug-containing products.",

Participants in the US Military HIV Natural History Study were included if taking HAART for ≥6 months with concurrent use of EI-AEDs phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital for ≥28 days. Virologic outcomes were compared to HAART-treated participants taking AEDs that are not CYP450 enzyme-inducing (NEI-AED group) as well as to a matched group of individuals not taking AEDs (non-AED group). For participants with multiple HAART regimens with AED overlap, the first 3 overlaps were studied. EI-AED participants (n = 19) had greater virologic failure (62.5%) compared to NEI-AED participants (n = 85; 26.7%) for the first HAART/AED overlap period (OR 4.58 [1.47-14.25]; P = 0.009). Analysis of multiple overlap periods yielded consistent results (OR 4.29 [1.51-12.21]; P = 0.006). Virologic failure was also greater in the EI-AED versus NEI-AED group with multiple HAART/AED overlaps when adjusted for both year of and viral load at HAART initiation (OR 4.19 [1.54-11.44]; P = 0.005). Compared to the non-AED group (n = 190), EI-AED participants had greater virologic failure (62.5% vs. 42.5%; P = 0.134), however this result was only significant when adjusted for viral load at HAART initiation (OR 4.30 [1.02-18.07]; P = 0.046). Consistent with data from pharmacokinetic studies demonstrating that EI-AED use may result in subtherapeutic levels of HAART, EI-AED use is associated with greater risk of virologic failure compared to NEI-AEDs when co-administered with HAART. Concurrent use of EI-AEDs and HAART should be avoided when possible.",

We tested the potential of cART intensification by Maraviroc plus Raltegravir to decrease proviral HIV-1 DNA levels in lymphoid cells during a randomized trial.We randomly assigned for 48 weeks 22 patients to continue their current first line regimen of Truvada® plus Kaletra® or intensify it with Maraviroc and Raltegravir. The primary objective was to obtain a 50% decrease in proviral HIV-1 DNA levels in lymphoid cells with intensification. Blood samples were drawn at W-2, W0, W2, W4, W12, W24 and W48. Plasma viremia, cellular proviral DNA and cellular RNA, 2-LTR circles and lymphocytes subsets were assayed using validated methods. Patients in the intensified group underwent a gut biopsy at baseline and W48 to measure proviral DNA levels. Statistical analysis used parametric and non-parametric tests.Ten patients in each arm completed the trial. The 2 populations were comparable at baseline. No change in the reservoir size was observed in the intensified arm compared to the control arm measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). No change in the reservoir size was observed in gut proviral DNA in the intensified arm. In this group, no increase in 2-LTR circles was observed as early as 2 weeks after intensification and no change was found in residual plasma RNA levels measured by the single copy assay. However, a decrease in CD8(+) T cells activation was observed at 24 and 48 weeks, as well as in PBMCs HIV-1 RNA levels.We conclude that the intensification of a Protease Inhibitor regimen with Maraviroc and Raltegravir does not impact the blood proviral DNA reservoir of HIV but can decrease the cell-associated HIV RNA, the CD8 activation and has a possible impact on rectal proviral HIV DNA in some patients.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier number NCT00935480.",

While structural barriers have been well described, a greater understanding of social and behavioral factors that may relate to maternal uptake of early infant HIV testing services is urgently needed. The aim of this study was to explore how gender power dynamics within couples affect HIV-positive women's uptake of early infant HIV testing at a large health center in Lusaka, Zambia.In 2014, 320 HIV-positive married postpartum women were recruited at a large public health facility in Lusaka to participate in a cross-sectional survey. Data on uptake of early infant HIV testing by 4-6 weeks of age was collected through medical records. Simple and multiple logistic regression models determined significant predictors of maternal uptake of early infant HIV testing.In the adjusted model, uptake of early infant HIV testing was associated with female-directed emotional intimate partner violence (aOR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21-0.79; p < 0.01), HIV status disclosure to the male partner (aOR 13.73, 95% CI 3.59-52.49, p < 0.001), and maternal postpartum ART adherence (aOR 2.28, 95% CI 1.15-4.55, p < 0.05).Domestic relationship dynamics, including emotional violence and HIV status disclosure to the male partner, may play an important role in maternal uptake of early infant HIV testing. These findings provide additional evidence for the link between intimate partner violence against women and poor HIV-related health outcomes. Programs that adequately screen for and address various forms of intimate partner violence within the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission are recommended.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) the most fatal presentation of tuberculosis (TB) especially in HIV-infected patients is a real diagnostic and therapeutic challenge worldwide. In Cameroon where HIV and TB are amongst the leading public health problems, the magnitude of TBM has not been defined. Therefore, the objective of this cross sectional study was to describe the presentation and in-hospital outcome of TBM among HIV patients in Douala as well as its diagnostic difficulties.We did a clinical case note analysis of all HIV-1 infected patients treated for TBM in the Internal medicine unit of the Douala General Hospital, between January 1st 2004 and December 31st 2009. The diagnosis of TBM was made using clinical, laboratory [cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis] and/or brain computerised tomographic (CT) scan features.During the study period, 8% (54/672) of HIV-infected patients had TBM. Their mean age was 40.3 ± 12.7 years. The main presenting complaint was headache in 74.1% (40/54) of patients. Their median CD4 cell count was 16 cells/mm3 (IQR: 10 - 34). CSF analysis showed median protein levels of 1.7 g/l (IQR: 1.3 - 2.2), median glucose level of 0.4 g/l (IQR: 0.3 - 0.5) and median white cell count (WCC) count of 21 cells/ml (IQR: 12 - 45) of which mononuclear cells were predominant in 74% of CSF. Acid fast bacilli were found in 1.9% (1/54) of CSF samples. On CT scan hydrocephalus was the main finding in 70.6% (24/34) of patients. In hospital case fatality was 79.6% (43/54).TBM is a common complication in HIV-infected patients in Douala with high case fatality. Its presumptive diagnosis reposes mostly on CSF analysis, so clinicians caring for HIV patients should not hesitate to do lumbar taps in the presence of symptoms of central nervous system disease.",

We used Single Genome Amplification (SGA) to analyze the frequency of K103N, Y181C and G190A in serial plasma samples of three individual patients. We also performed standard genotype HIV drug resistance assay in 204 patients of this cohort study to analyze the frequency of these mutations.In the SGA sequences, the K103N decreased and vanished, while the frequency of Y181C and G190A increased in individual patient receiving long-term Antiretroviral Therapy (ART). In the sequences of standard genotype HIV drug resistance assay, the frequency of K103N, Y181C and G190A had the similar pattern with that in SGA sequences. Among these patients, the viral suppression were still sufficient after receiving ART for 72 months, and 78.6% (160/204) patients could have their CD4 count over than 200cells/ul.In some patients, first-line ART had the possibility to provide sufficient treatment effect for over than 72 months, but in long-term treatment, the dominant NNRTI drug resistance mutation K103N could reduced, while the proportion of variants with mutation Y181C or G190A may increased.

Identifying the demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of people living with HIV (PLHIV) is essential to inform optimal management strategies in this resource-limited country.To create a \"snapshot\" of the PLHIV seeking anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in Myanmar, data were collected from the registration cards of all patients who had been prescribed ART at two large referral hospitals in Yangon, prior to March 18, 2016.Anti-retroviral therapy had been prescribed to 2643 patients at the two hospitals. The patients' median [interquartile range (IQR)] age was 37 (31-44) years; 1494 (57%) were male. At registration, injecting drug use was reported in 22 (0.8%), male-to-male sexual contact in eleven (0.4%) and female sex work in eleven (0.4%), suggesting that patients under-report these risk behaviours, that health care workers are uncomfortable enquiring about them or that the two hospitals are under-servicing these populations. All three explanations appear likely. Most patients were symptomatic at registration with 2027 (77%) presenting with WHO stage 3 or 4 disease. In the 2442 patients with a CD4+ T cell count recorded at registration, the median (IQR) count was 169 (59-328) cells/mm3. After a median (IQR) duration of 359 (185-540) days of ART, 151 (5.7%) patients had died, 111 (4.2%) patients had been lost to follow-up, while 2381 were alive on ART. Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection was common: 1083 (41%) were already on anti-TB treatment at registration, while a further 41 (1.7%) required anti-TB treatment during follow-up. Only 21 (0.8%) patients were prescribed isoniazid prophylaxis therapy (IPT); one of these was lost to follow-up, but none of the remaining 20 patients died or required anti-TB treatment during a median (IQR) follow-up of 275 (235-293) days.People living with HIV in Yangon, Myanmar are generally presenting late in their disease course, increasing their risk of death, disease and transmitting the virus. A centralised model of ART prescription struggles to deliver care to the key affected populations. TB co-infection is very common in Myanmar, but despite the proven efficacy of IPT, it is frequently not prescribed.",

The prevalence of High Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (HSIL) and genotypes of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) were also determined, as well as risk factors associated with the presence of HR-HPV in anal mucosa. Methods This is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of the quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccine. The study enrolled from May 2012 to May 2014. Vaccine and placebo were administered at 0, 2 and 6 months (V1, V2, V3 clinical visits). Vaccine antibody titres were evaluated at 7 months. Cytology (Thin Prep ® Pap Test), HPV PCR genotyping (Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test), and high-resolution anoscopy (Zeiss 150 fc© colposcope) were performed at V1. Results Patients (n = 162; mean age 37.9 years) were screened for inclusion; 14.2% had HSIL, 73.1% HR-HPV and 4.5% simultaneous infection with HPV16 and 18. Study participants (n = 129) were randomized to qHPV vaccine or placebo. The most common adverse event was injection-site pain predominating in the placebo group [the first dose (83.6% vs. 56.1%; p = 0.0001]; the second dose (87.8% vs. 98.4%; p = 0.0001); the third dose (67.7% vs. 91.9%; p = 0.0001). The vaccine did not influence either the viral load of HIV or the levels of CD4. Of those vaccinated, 76% had antibodies to HPV vs. 30.2% of those receiving placebo (p = 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, Older age was associated with lower HR-HPV infection (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96–0.99), and risk factor were viral load of HIV &gt;200 copies/µL (RR 1.42 95% CI 1.17–1.73) and early commencement of sexual activity (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.001–1.811). Conclusions This trial showed significantly higher anti-HR-HPV antibody titres in vaccinated individuals than in unvaccinated controls. There were no serious adverse events attributable to the vaccine. In our cohort, 1 of every 7 patients had HSIL and the prevalence of combined infection by genotypes 16 and 18 was low. This suggests that patients could benefit from receiving qHPV vaccine. Older age was the main protective factor against HR-HPV infection, and non-suppressed HIV viremia was a risk factor.

We measured recognition of wild type and A3G/F-mutated epitopes by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from HIV-infected individuals and found that A3G/F-induced mutations overwhelmingly diminished CTL recognition of HIV peptides, in a human histocompatibility-linked leukocyte antigen (HLA)-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found corresponding enrichment of A3G/F-favored motifs in CTL epitope-encoding sequences within the HIV genome. These findings illustrate that A3G/F-mediated mutations mediate immune evasion by HIV in vivo. Therefore, we suggest that vaccine strategies target T cell or antibody epitopes that are not poised for mutation into escape variants by A3G/F action.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background We evaluate the impact of clinic-based PMTCT community support by trained lay health workers in addition to standard clinical care on PMTCT infant outcomes. Methods In a cluster randomized controlled trial, twelve community health centers (CHCs) in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, were randomized to have pregnant women living with HIV receive either: a standard care (SC) condition plus time-equivalent attention-control on disease prevention (SC; 6 CHCs; n = 357), or an enhanced intervention (EI) condition of SC PMTCT plus the “Protect Your Family” intervention (EI; 6 CHCs; n = 342). HIV-infected pregnant women in the SC attended four antenatal and two postnatal video sessions and those in the EI, four antenatal and two postnatal PMTCT plus “Protect Your Family” sessions led by trained lay health workers. Maternal PMTCT and HIV knowledge were assessed. Infant HIV status at 6 weeks postnatal was drawn from clinic PCR records; at 12 months, HIV status was assessed by study administered DNA PCR. Maternal adherence was assessed by dried blood spot at 32 weeks, and infant adherence was assessed by maternal report at 6 weeks. The impact of the EI was ascertained on primary outcomes (infant HIV status at 6 weeks and 12 months and ART adherence for mothers and infants), and secondary outcomes (HIV and PMTCT knowledge and HIV transmission related behaviours). A series of logistic regression and latent growth curve models were developed to test the impact of the intervention on study outcomes. Results In all, 699 women living with HIV were recruited during pregnancy (8–24 weeks), and assessments were completed at baseline, at 32 weeks pregnant (61.7%), and at 6 weeks (47.6%), 6 months (50.6%) and 12 months (59.5%) postnatally. Infants were tested for HIV at 6 weeks and 12 months, 73.5% living infants were tested at 6 weeks and 56.7% at 12 months. There were no significant differences between SC and EI on infant HIV status at 6 weeks and at 12 months, and no differences in maternal adherence at 32 weeks, reported infant adherence at 6 weeks, or PMTCT and HIV knowledge by study condition over time. Conclusion The enhanced intervention administered by trained lay health workers did not have any salutary impact on HIV infant status, ART adherence, HIV and PMTCT knowledge.

The aim of this study was to explore and measure the interaction between LD, mental health, and quality of life of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals seen in a metabolic clinic. We conducted a single-site cross-sectional study including all HIV-infected patients attending the LIPO group and metabolism day clinic at the University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland between January 31, 2008 and November 28, 2013. Data on LD were prospectively collected using the HIV Outpatient Study (HOPS) score, the Lipodystrophy Case Definition (LDCD), ART regimens, anthropometric measures, imaging, and standardized questionnaires. Quality of life was evaluated using a visual analog scale of 0–100. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory scales, respectively. One hundred ninety-four patients (54.6% male; 45.4% female; median age, 50 years) on successful ART (median CD4 cell count, 569.0 cells/mm3; median viral load, 20 copies/mL) were evaluated. Among these, 62.7, 63.5 and 35.5% of patients reported at least one body site affected by fat hypertrophy, atrophy or both, respectively. Using the LDCD score conservative definition, including imaging and biological values, 57.8% were diagnosed with LD. Of these, 39.7% suffered from severe/very severe LD. Depression was reported by 35.6% of individuals; 51.9% had anxiety symptoms and 49.5% reported poor quality of life (defined as being inferior to 50% on a scale from 0 to 100%). LD (odds ratio (OR = 5.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07–25.37, p-value: 0.040), depression (OR = 4.67, 95% CI 1.08–20.31, p-value 0.040), and anxiety (OR = 7.83, 95% CI 1.91–32.03, p-value 0.004) all affected significantly the quality of life. LD, depression and anxiety were frequent features among HIV-infected individuals seen in the metabolic clinic and significantly impacted on their quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells specialize in killing virally infected- or tumor cells and are part of the innate immune system. The activational state of NK cells is determined by the balance of incoming activating and inhibitory signals mediated by receptor-ligand binding with the target cell. These receptor-ligand bonds mainly consist of the killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), which are expressed at the cell surface of NK cells, and their ligands: the highly variable human leukocyte antigen -class I molecules (HLA). Absence of an inhibitory receptor-ligand bond lowers the NK cell activation threshold, whereas an activating receptor-ligand bond stimulates the cell, potentially overcoming this threshold and triggering NK cell activation. NK cells influence the course of infection as well as the acquisition of HIV-1. Several lines of evidence relate the activating NK cell receptor KIR3DS1, in the presence or absence of its putative ligand HLA-Bw4, with slower disease progression as well as resistance to HIV-1 infection. Overall, resistance to HIV-1 infection predominantly correlates with activating KIR/HLA profiles, consisting of e.g. activating KIRs, group B haplotypes, or inhibitory KIRs in absence of their ligands. Such a conclusion is less evident for studies of HIV-1 disease progression, with studies reporting beneficial as well as detrimental effects of activating KIR/HLA genotypes. It is likely that KIR/HLA association studies are complicated by the complexity of the KIR and HLA loci and their mutual interactions, as well as by additional factors like route of HIV exposure, immune activation, presence of co-infections, and the effect of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. One newly discovered NK cell activation pathway associated with resistance to HIV-1 infection involves the presence of an iKIR/HLA mismatch between partners. The absence of such an iKIR/HLA bond renders donor-derived allogeneic HIV-1 infected cells vulnerable to NK cell responses during HIV-1 transmission. Therefore, theoretically, HIV-1 would be eliminated before it has the chance to infect the autologous cells in the recipient. While this \"alloreactive\" NK cell mechanism is especially relevant to HIV transmission in monogamous couples, it would be interesting to investigate how it could influence resistance to HIV in other settings. The objective of this review is to summarize the knowledge about these autologous and alloreactive NK cell responses with regard to HIV-1 outcome.",

This will hold true for the design of a successful therapeutic HIV vaccine targeted at controlling reactivated virus following cessation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). The HIV accessory protein Nef functions by interfering with HIV antigen presentation through the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) pathway thereby suppressing CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL)-mediated killing of HIV infected cells. Thus, this important impediment to HIV vaccine success must be circumvented.

    "abstract": "Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and its major complication pulmonary embolism (PE) are collectively known as venous thromboembolism. In Uganda, the prevalence of DVT among HIV patients has not been previously published. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and sonographic features of lower limb deep venous thrombosis among HIV positive patients on anti-retroviral treatment (ART).This was a cross sectional study in which HIV positive patients on ART were recruited from an out-patient HIV clinic at Mulago National Referral Hospital. Patients were randomly selected and enrolled until a sample size of 384 was reached. Study participants underwent compression and Doppler ultrasound studies of both lower limb deep veins using Medison Sonoacer7 ultrasound machine.We found a prevalence of DVT of 9.1% (35 of 384 participants) among HIV patients on ART. The prevalence of latent (asymptomatic) DVT was 2.3%. Among 35 patients with DVT, 42.8% had chronic DVT; 31.1% had acute DVT and the rest had latent DVT. Among the risk factors, the odds of occurrence of DVT among patients with prolonged immobility were 4.81 times as high as in those with no prolonged immobility (p = 0.023; OR = 4.81; 95% CI 1.25-18.62). Treatment with second line anti-retroviral therapy (ART) including protease inhibitors (PIs) was associated with higher odds of DVT occurrence compared with first line ART (p = 0.020; OR = 2.38; 95% CI 1.14-4.97). The odds of DVT occurrence in patients with a lower CD4 count (< 200 cells/µl) were 5.36 times as high as in patients with CD4 counts above 500 cells/µl (p = 0.008). About 48.6% patients with DVT had a low risk according to Well's score.DVT was shown in nearly 10% of HIV patients attending an out-patient clinic in an urban setting in Uganda. Risk factors included protease inhibitors in their ART regimen, prolonged immobility, and low CD4 count (< 200 cells/µl). Clinicians should have a low threshold for performing lower limb Doppler ultrasound scan examination on infected HIV patients on ART who are symptomatic for DVT. Therefore, clinicians should consider anti-coagulant prophylaxis and lower deep venous ultrasound screening of patients who are on second line ART regimen with low CD4 cell counts and/or with prolonged immobility or hormonal contraception.",

We investigated the impact of CYP 516G>T and 983T>C on plasma nevirapine concentration and clinical outcomes in a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected Kenyan women.Study subjects were 66 HIV-1-seropositive women taking nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy. Plasma collected at week 12 was analyzed for nevirapine concentration by high performance liquid chromatography. Baseline samples were genotyped for CYP2B6 516G>T and 983T>C single nucleotide polymorphisms by real-time polymerase chain reaction. CD4 cell count, plasma viral load, and genotypic drug resistance in plasma and genital secretions were assessed at baseline and during follow up. We evaluated the effect of each genotype on plasma nevirapine concentration at week 12 and on change in CD4 cell count at months 3, 6 and 12. Associations between plasma nevirapine concentration and clinical outcomes were analyzed by logistic or linear regression.Women with CYP2B6 516TT genotype (n=9) had higher mean nevirapine plasma levels (14.33 μg/mL) compared to those with heterozygous 516GT (9.18 μg/mL; n=25) and wild- type 516GG (7.95 μg/mL; n=32) genotypes (P=0.01). Women heterozygous for the CYP2B6 983TC genotype (n=13) had higher mean nevirapine plasma levels (12.94 μg/mL), compared to women with the homozygous 983TT (8.35 μg/mL; n=53) genotype (P=0.007). In Generalized Estimating Equation analysis, plasma nevirapine levels predicted greater change in CD4 cell count after ART initiation (adjusted beta 119.4 cells/μL, 95% CI, 27.3-211.5 cells/μL, P=0.01). The CYP2B6 983TT genotype also predicted greater change in CD4 cell count (adjusted beta 68.6 cells/μL, 95% CI, 3.9-133.4 cells/μL, P=0.04). We found no associations between CYP2B6 genotypes and virologic response or toxicity.CYP2B6 516G>T and CYP2B6 983T>C genotypes were strongly associated with plasma nevirapine concentration, which predicted immunologic response in women on nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy. These data support continued work on the potential utility of human genetic testing to inform nevirapine dosage optimization for individual patients.",

Our aim was to determine whether HIV infection is a risk factor for worse outcomes in patients with coronaray artery disease.

We included all patients who survived an incident AMI occurring on or after 1st January 2005. Our primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at one year; secondary outcomes included AMI recurrence and cardiovascular-related hospitalisations. Comparisons used Cox and logistic regression analyses, respectively. There were 133 HIV+, (SHCS) and 5,328 HIV-negative [HIV-] (AMIS) individuals with incident AMI. In the SHCS and AMIS registries, patients were predominantly male (72% and 85% male, respectively), with a median age of 51 years (interquartile range [IQR] 46–57) and 64 years (IQR 55–74), respectively.

Microbicides and vaccines studies have shown that immune activation at the genital tract is a risk factor for HIV infection. Furthermore, lower level of immune activation, or what we call immune quiescence, has been associated with a lower risk of HIV acquisition. This unique phenotype is observed in highly-exposed seronegative individuals from different populations including female sex workers from the Pumwani cohort in Nairobi, Kenya. Here, we review the link between immune activation and susceptibility to HIV infection. We also describe a new concept in prevention where, instead of targeting the virus, we modulate the host immune system to resist HIV infection. Mimicking the immune quiescence phenotype might become a new strategy in the toolbox of biomedical methods to prevent HIV infection. Clinical trial registration on clinicaltrial.gov: #NCT02079077",

    "abstract": "People living with HIV (PLHIV) constantly need to address social issues such as the cost of accessing care, stigma, and lack of social support which impacts on their level of adherence to clinic visits or antiretroviral treatment leading to adverse health outcomes. This study examined the social barriers in accessing care by clients who returned to care after transient loss to follow-up. This study was a cross-sectional survey of PLHIV from 99 US CDC PEPFAR-supported HIV clinics located in 10 of Nigeria's 36 states and Federal Capital Territory, who were momentarily lost to follow-up but returned to care after tracking. Demographic and social factors at bivariate and multivariate level were analyzed to determine the predictors of difficulty in accessing HIV clinics. Of the 7483 clients tracked, 1386 (18.5%) were confirmed to be in care, 2846 (38.2%) were lost to follow-up (LTFU), 562 (7.5%) returned to care, 843 (11.2%) discontinued care, 827 (11.1%) transferred out to other facilities for care, 514 (6.8%) had died while 505 (6.7%) could not be reached by phone or located at their addresses. 438 out of the 562 (78%) returnee PLHIV gave consent and participated in the study. 216 out of the 438 (50%) clients who returned to care were transiently lost to follow-up because they had difficulty accessing their HIV clinic. Also, 126/438 (29%) of returnee PLHIV were previously lost to follow-up. Difficult access to a HIV clinic was significantly influenced by prior LTFU (OR 2.5 [95% CI 1.3–4.8], p = 0.008), history of being stigmatized (OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.1–3.8], p = 0.02), lack of social or financial support (OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.3–6.0], p = 0.01) and perceived in-adequate healthcare workers support (OR 3.8 [95% CI 1.2–11.2], p = 0.02). Age (p = 0.218) and gender (p = 0.771) were not significant determinants of difficult access to an HIV clinic. Stigma, lack of support and prior loss to follow-up event are essential factors affecting retention in care. Social constructs such as home-based visits, community-based care services, transportation subsidies, and robust strong social systems should be built into HIV service delivery models to improve retention in care of people on HIV treatment. The authors advocate for further studies on how differentiated care models impact on retention of patients in care.",

We used three waves of data from the World Health Organisation Study on Global Ageing and adult health- Well Being of Older People Study cohort in Uganda, conducted in 2009, 2012–2013 and 2015–2016. The cohort included HIV-negative and HIV-positive persons aged 50 years and older recruited from multiple rural and peri-urban sites in Uganda. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. Time-dependent ART data were collected from medical records using a data-abstraction form. This study was conducted before the universal test and treat policy came into effect. We fitted Cox survival models to estimate hazard ratios to compare the risk of death between groups, adjusted for age, sex, marital status and hypertension. Of 623 participants, 517 (82.9%) of respondents had follow-up data and were included in this analysis. We observed 1571 person-years of follow-up from 274 people who were HIV-negative, and 1252 from 243 who were HIV-positive.

Point-of-care tenofovir (POC-TFV) testing has been proposed as a solution to facilitate real-time antiretroviral adherence monitoring, but little is known about how health care providers, people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving ART, and people receiving PrEP will perceive POC-TFV testing. Methods We conducted an exploratory qualitative study to assess perspectives on the utility and interest in POC-TFV testing from potential end users. We conducted three focus group discussions (FGDs) among 17 PLWH receiving ART and four individuals receiving PrEP, as well as eight in-depth interviews (IDIs) with health care providers in the Seattle area and presented participants with a hypothetical urine-based POC-TFV test. FGDs and IDIs were audio recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed to describe emerging themes. Results Overall, study participants demonstrated divergent opinions about the POC-TFV test. Among study participants, PLWH were most ambivalent about POC-TFV testing, first demonstrating reluctance to TFV-level monitoring and shifting positions during the FGDs. However, all PLWH participants were receptive to POC-TFV testing if requested by their provider. PrEP participants were generally supportive of POC-TFV testing for routine adherence monitoring and emphasized potential value in self-administered testing. Providers’ perceptions were equally divided – half suggested POC-TFV testing would be valuable, particularly for people receiving PrEP, while half indicated the test would have little benefit for most individuals receiving ART or PrEP in the U.S. All providers agreed that POC-TFV test results could be beneficial for assessing discrepancies in viral load results and self-reported adherence among PLWH. The study also revealed that a low-cost, non-urine-based POC-TFV test with a long-term limit of detection would be preferred over the hypothetical urine-based test. Conclusions Our findings indicate POC-TFV testing may be beneficial for routine, clinic-based adherence monitoring, particularly for individuals receiving PrEP or for PLWH with persistent viremia or following recent ART initiation. These findings should also be used to formulate a target product profile for a POC-TFV test and to guide further developments in tools for objective antiretroviral adherence monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV Self-Testing (HIVST) is universally accepted as an innovative strategy complimenting existing HIV testing services to archive the UNAIDS, 95-95-95 goals by 2030. However, the adoption of HIVST is lagging in most sub-Saharan countries, including Tanzania. This study aimed to determine the level of knowledge, acceptability, and willingness to use HIVST among Medical students in Kilimanjaro region, Tanzania. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study using a self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire was conducted from May to June 2019 among 271 medical students aged 18–44 years enrolled in a degree of Medicine course at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College. Results A total of 271 participants were enrolled (response rate of 100%). The mean age was 23.9 (SD 2.9), the majority (91%) were Christians, being single (92%), and a half (50.2%) were males. More than half (55.7%) was sexually active, 67.5% reported the age of first sexual debut at 19 years and above. The majority (81.5%) reported that they had one sexual partner, 37% used condoms during the last sexual act. The majority (98.7%) had never had a sexually transmitted disease during the past 3 months, 22.5% reported using alcohol when having sex. More than three-quarters (79%) ever tested for HIV, and 41.6% tested for HIV in the past year. More than two-thirds (67.9%) had a high level of knowledge on oral fluid HIV self-test. Being a female was related with high level of knowledge (P = 0.225). The acceptability of HIVST was 62.7%, and about two-thirds showed a willingness to buy a self-test kit if available for public use. Conclusions The high level of knowledge on oral fluid HIV self-testing, acceptability and willingness to buy self-test kit if available for public use among sexually active medical students underscores the importance of introducing HIVST as a complementary approach for existing HIV testing services in this setting. To make HIVST effective, interventionist should address concerns associated with self-testing, such as lack of pre and post-test counseling, suicidal risks after receiving HIV positive results, perceived risks of inaccurate HIVST test results, lack of linkage to care of individuals receiving HIV positive results, perceived risks of intimate partner violence, coercive testing of a female partner, and perceived high cost of buying self-test kits.",

This study aimed to evaluate levels of PrEP acceptability and explore factors associated with willingness to use PrEP among MSM in Liuzhou, China. Methods Between November 2017 and May 2019, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 829 MSM. The study participants were recruited through a nonprobability sampling method. The participants’ demographics, HIV/AIDS knowledge, sexual behaviors, drug use and HIV test history were collected.

Results A total of 829 MSM completed the survey, and 30.28% (95% CI 27.3–33.4) were willing to use PrEP. In multivariate logistic regression, factors associated with a higher willingness to use PrEP included Zhuang or Han ethnic origin, recruitment through peer introduction or gay venues, pursuit of a higher education level, previous HIV testing and oral sex with a man. Conversely, having casual sex in the past 6 months was associated with a lower willingness to use PrEP. Conclusions MSM in Liuzhou reported a relatively low level of willingness to use PrEP. The results indicate the need for effective education, targeted intervention, and implementation strategies to promote PrEP acceptance among MSM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The growing burden of the HIV and non-communicable disease (NCD) syndemic in Sub- Saharan Africa has necessitated introduction of integrated models of care in order to leverage existing HIV care infrastructure for NCDs. However, there is paucity of literature on treatment outcomes for multimorbid patients attending integrated care. We describe 12-month treatment outcomes among multimorbid patients attending integrated antiretroviral treatment (ART) and NCD clubs in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods As part of an integrated clubs (IC) model pilot implemented in 2016 by the local government at two primary health care clinics in Cape Town, we identified all multimorbid patients who were enrolled for IC for at least 12 months by August 2017. Mean adherence percentages (using proxy of medication collection and attendance of club visits) and optimal disease control (defined as the proportion of participants achieving optimal blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin control and HIV viral load suppression where appropriate) were calculated at 12 months before, at the point of IC enrolment and 12 months after IC enrolment. Predictors of NCD control 12 months post IC enrolment were investigated using multivariable logistic regression. Results As of 31 August 2017, 247 HIV-infected patients in total had been enrolled into IC for at least 12 months. Of these, 221 (89.5%) had hypertension, 4 (1.6%) had diabetes mellitus and 22 (8.9%) had both diseases. Adherence was maintained before and after IC enrolment with mean adherence percentages of 92.2% and 94.2% respectively. HIV viral suppression rates were 98.6%, 99.5% and 99.4% at the three time points respectively. Retention in care was high with 6.9% lost to follow up at 12 months post IC enrolment. Across the 3 time-points, optimal blood pressure control was achieved in 43.1%, 58.9% and 49.4% of participants while optimal glycaemic control was achieved in 47.4%, 87.5% and 53.3% of participants with diabetes respectively. Multivariable logistic analyses showed no independent variables significantly associated with NCD control. Conclusion Multimorbid adults living with HIV achieved high levels of HIV control in integrated HIV and NCD clubs. However, intensified interventions are needed to maintain NCD control in the long term.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Zambia recently achieved UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets for HIV epidemic control; however, inpatient facilities continue to face a large burden of patients with advanced HIV disease and HIV-related mortality. Management of advanced HIV disease, following guidelines from outpatient settings, may be more difficult within complex inpatient settings. We evaluated adherence to HIV guidelines during hospitalization, including opportunistic infection (OI) screening, treatment, and prophylaxis. Methods We reviewed inpatient medical records of people living with HIV (PLHIV) admitted to the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia between December 1, 2018 and April 30, 2019. We collected data on patient demographics, antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV biomarkers, and OI screening and treatment—including tuberculosis (TB), Cryptococcus, and OI prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (CTX). Screening and treatment cascades were constructed based on the 2017 WHO Advanced HIV Guidelines. Results We reviewed files from 200 charts of patients with advanced HIV disease; of these 92% (184/200) had been on ART previously; 58.1% (107/184) for more than 12 months. HIV viral load (VL) testing was uncommon but half of VL results were high. 39% (77/200) of patients had a documented CD4 count result. Of the 172 patients not on anti-TB treatment (ATT) on admission, TB diagnostic tests (either sputum Xpert MTB/RIF MTB/RIF or urine TB-LAM) were requested for 105 (61%) and resulted for 60 of the 105 (57%). Nine of the 14 patients (64%) with a positive lab result for TB died before results were available. Testing for Cryptococcosis was performed predominantly in patients with symptoms of meningitis. Urine TB-LAM testing was rarely performed. Conclusions At a referral hospital in Zambia, CD4 testing was inconsistent due to laboratory challenges and this reduced recognition of AHD and implementation of AHD guidelines. HIV programs can potentially reduce mortality and identify PLHIV with retention and adherence issues through strengthening inpatient activities, including reflex VL testing, TB-LAM and serum CrAg during hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Since the scale-up of routine viral load (VL) testing started in 2016, there is limited evidence on VL suppression rates under programmatic settings and groups at risk of non-suppression. We conducted a study to estimate VL non-suppression (&gt; 1000 copies/ml) and its risk factors using \"routine\" and \"repeat after enhanced adherence counselling (EAC)\" VL results. Methods We conducted an analytic cross-sectional study using secondary VL testing data collected between 2014 and 2018 from a centrally located laboratory. We analysed data from routine tests and repeat tests after an individual received EAC. Our outcome was viral load non-suppression. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with having VL non-suppression for routine and repeat VL. Results We analysed 103,609 VL test results (101,725 routine and 1884 repeat test results) collected from the country’s ten provinces. Of the 101,725 routine and 1884 repeat VL tests, 13.8% and 52.9% were non-suppressed, respectively. Only one in seven (1:7) of the non-suppressed routine VL tests had a repeat test after EAC. For routine VL tests; males (vs females, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.19, [95% CI 1.14–1.24]) and adolescents (10–19 years) (vs adults (25–49 years), aOR = 3.11, [95% CI 2.9–3.31]) were more at risk of VL non-suppression. The patients who received care at the secondary level (vs primary, aOR = 1.21, [95% CI 1.17–1.26]) and tertiary level (vs primary, aOR = 1.63, [95% CI 1.44–1.85]) had a higher risk of VL non-suppression compared to the primary level. Those that started ART in 2014–2015 (vs &lt; 2010, aOR = 0.83, [95% CI 0.79–0.88]) and from 2016 onwards (vs &lt; 2010, aOR = 0.84, [95% CI 0.79–0.89]) had a lower risk of VL non-suppression. For repeat VL tests; young adults (20–24 years) (vs adults (25–49 years), (aOR) = 3.48, [95% CI 2.16 -5.83]), adolescents (10–19 years) (vs adults (25–49 years), aOR = 2.76, [95% CI 2.11–3.72]) and children (0–9 years) (vs adults (25–49 years), aOR = 1.51, [95% CI 1.03–2.22]) were at risk of VL non-suppression. Conclusion Close to 90% suppression in routine VL shows that Zimbabwe is on track to reach the third UNAIDS target. Strategies to improve the identification of clients with high routine VL results for repeating testing after EAC and ART adherence in subpopulations (men, adolescents and young adolescents) at risk of viral non-suppression should be prioritised.",

Despite recent advances, uncertainty remains around its exact definition in PLWHA. In this systematic review and Meta-analysis, we explored relevant databases (PUBMED, EMBASE, CROI) for studies evaluating polypharmacy in PLWHA from January 2000 to August 2021 to ascertain the exact numerical threshold that defines this morbidity. Two independent reviewers extracted and reviewed relevant variables for analyses. The review included a total of 31 studies involving n = 53,347 participants with a mean age of 49.5 (SD ± 17.0) years. There was a total of 36 definitions, with 93.5% defining polypharmacy as the concomitant use of 5 or more medications. We found significant variation in the numerical definition of polypharmacy, with studies reporting it as “minor” (N = 3); “major” (N = 29); “severe” (N = 2); “excessive” (N = 1); and “higher” (N = 1). Most studies did not incorporate a duration (84%) in their definition and excluded ART medications (67.7%). A plurality of studies in PLWHA have established that polypharmacy in this cohort of patients is the intake of ≥ 5 medications (including both ART and non-ART). To standardize the approach to addressing this rising morbidity, we recommend incorporation of this definition into national and international PLWHA treatment guidelines.",

Myocardial fibrosis is well-described in HIV infection acquired in adulthood. We evaluate the burden of fibrosis by cardiac magnetic resonance in people with perinatal HIV infection. Methods Individuals with perinatally acquired HIV (pnHIV) diagnosed before 10 years-old and on antiretroviral treatment for ≥ 6 months were matched with uninfected controls. Patients with significant cardiometabolic co-morbidities and pregnancy were excluded. Diffuse fibrosis was assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with native T1 mapping for calculation of extracellular volume fraction (ECV). Viability was assessed with late gadolinium enhancement. The normality of fibrosis was assessed using the Komogrov-Smirnov test. Fibrosis between the groups was analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test, as the data was not normally distributed. Statistical significance was defined as a p-valve &lt; 0.05. Results Fourteen adults with pnHIV group and 26 controls (71% female and 86% Black race) were assessed. The average (± standard deviation) age in the study group was 29 (± 4.3) years-old. All pnHIV had been on ART for decades. Demographic data, CMR functional/volumetric data, and pre-contrast T1 mapping values were similar between groups. Diastolic function was normal in 50% of pnHIV patients and indeterminate in most of the remainder (42%). There was no statistically significant difference in ECV between groups; p = 0.24. Conclusion Perinatally-acquired HIV was not associated with diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Larger prospective studies with serial examinations are needed to determine whether pnHIV patients develop abnormal structure or function more often than unaffected controls.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated mucocutaneous condition characterized by hypersensitivity reactions to antigenic stimuli from infectious agents and certain drugs. The most commonly implicated infectious agents associated with EM include herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae . Other infectious diseases reported to trigger EM include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and several opportunistic infections. However, studies focusing on EM and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are scarce. even though the incidence of EM among HIV-infected individuals have increased, the direct and indirect mechanisms that predispose HIV-infected individuals to EM are not well understood. In turn, this makes diagnosing and managing EM in HIV-infected individuals an overwhelming task. Individuals with HIV infection are prone to acquiring microorganisms known to trigger EM, such as HSV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Treponema pallidum, histoplasmosis, and many other infectious organisms. Although HIV is known to infect CD4 + T cells, it can also directly bind to the epithelial cells of the oral and genital mucosa, leading to a dysregulated response by CD8 + T cells against epithelial cells. HIV infection may also trigger EM directly when CD8 + T cells recognize viral particles on epithelial cells due to the hyperactivation of CD8 + T-cells. The hyperactivation of CD8 + T cells was similar to that observed in drug hypersensitivity reactions. Hence, the relationship between antiretroviral drugs and EM has been well established. This includes the administration of other drugs to HIV-infected individuals to manage opportunistic infections. Thus, multiple triggers may be present simultaneously in HIV-infected individuals. This article highlights the potential direct and indirect role that HIV infection may play in the development of EM and the clinical dilemma that arises in the management of HIV-infected patients with this condition. These patients may require additional medications to manage opportunistic infections, many of which can also trigger hypersensitivity reactions leading to EM.",

This study aimed to describe factors independently associated with viral load non-suppression among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) on ART in the Tanga region. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of routinely collected data from ALHIV on ART from October 2018 to April 2022. We extracted data from the Care and Treatment Clinics form number 2 (CTC2) database that included age, sex, BMI, World Health Organization HIV clinical disease stage, marital status, ART duration, viral load suppression, facility level, and Dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimen. We did descriptive analysis using frequencies to describe the study participants’ socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to identify factors associated with viral load non-suppression (VLS). Viral load non-suppression was defined as viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ml. A total of 4735 ALHIV on ART were extracted from CTC2, then 2485 were excluded (2186 missed viral load results, 246 were lost to follow-up, and 53 deaths). Results 2250 ALHIV on ART were tested for viral load, of whom 2216 (98.62%) adolescents were on first-line ART, and 2024 (89.96%) participants were virally suppressed, while 226 (10.04%) were virally non-suppressed. In addition, 2131 (94.71%) of participants were using a DTG-based regimen; of them, 1969 (92.40%) were virally suppressed. Not using a DTG-based regimen (HR: 9.36, 95% CI 3.41–15.31) and dispensary facility level (HR: 3.61, 95% CI 1.44–7.03) were independently associated with increased hazard for viral load non-suppression. In addition, adolescents aged between 15 and 19 years are less likely to be virally suppressed (HR: 0.55, 95% CI 0.30–0.99). Conclusions The dispensary facility level and not using a DTG-based regimen were significantly associated with viral load non-suppression. HIV intervention strategies should ensure a DTG-based regimen utilization in all adolescents living with HIV, and techniques used by higher-level health facilities should be disseminated to lower-level facilities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV/AIDS continues to be a significant contributor to illness and death, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we conducted a qualitative assessment to understand Client and Healthcare Provider Perspectives on Differential Service Delivery Models in Uganda. The purpose was to establish strengths and weaknesses within the services delivery models, inform policy and decision-making, and to facilitate context specific solutions. Methods Between February and April 2023, a qualitative cross-sectional study was utilised to gather insights from a targeted selection of individuals, including People Living with HIV (PLHIV), healthcare workers, HIV focal persons, community retail pharmacists, and various stakeholders. The data collection process included eleven in-depth interviews, nine key informant interviews, and eight focus group discussions carried out across eight districts in Central Uganda. The collected data was analyzed through inductive thematic analysis with the aid of Excel. Results The various Differentiated Service Delivery Models (DSDMs), notably Community-Client-Led Drug Distribution (CCLAD), Community Drug Distribution Point (CDDP), Community Retail Pharmacy Drug Distribution Point (CRPDDP), and the facility-based Facility Based Individual Model (FBIM), were reported to have several positive impacts. These included improved treatment adherence, efficient management of antiretroviral (ARV) supplies, reduced exposure to infectious diseases, enhanced healthcare worker hospitality, minimized travel time for ART refills, stigma reduction, and decreased waiting times. Concern was raised about the lack of improvement in HIV status disclosure, opportunistic infection treatment, adherence to seasonal appointments, and sustainability due to the overreliance of the DSDMs on donor funding, suggesting potential discontinuation without funding. Doubts about health workers’ commitment surfaced. Notably, the CCLAD model displayed self-sustainability, with clients financially supporting group members to collect medicines. Conclusion Community-based DSDMs, such as CCLAD and CDDP, improve ART refill convenience, social support, and client experiences. These models reduce travel and waiting times, lowering infection risks. Addressing challenges and enhancing facility-based models is vital. In order to maintain funding after donor funding ends, sustainability measures like cross-subsidization can be used. If well implemented, the DSDMs have the potential to produce better or comparable ART outcomes compared to the FBIM model.",

    "abstract": "Oral HIV self-testing (HIVST) among men is relatively low and still inadequate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Delivering HIVST kits by pregnant women attending antenatal care to their partners is a promising strategy for increasing HIV testing among men. However, even amidst the HIV testing interventions, most men do not know their HIV status. This study, aimed to determine the proportion of partners who received and used oral HIVST kits delivered by pregnant women, associated factors, barriers, and facilitators for uptake. We conducted an exploratory sequential mixed methods study among 380 sampled partners. Lists of partners from HIVST logbooks whose women picked an HIVST kit were obtained and systematic sampling was done to recruit participants. Fourteen (14) male partners were purposively selected for in-depth interviews to identify barriers and facilitators. We used modified poison regression to determine factors associated with oral HIVST. We used an inductive thematic analysis for qualitative analysis. Out of 380 participants, 260(68.4%) received an oral HIVST kit from their pregnant women, and 215(82.7%) used it for HIVST. Oral HIVST was associated with; Information Education and Communication like availability of HIVST guiding materials (aPR = 1.64, 95%CI: 1.48–1.82), being reached at home (aPR = 1.04, 95%CI 1.01–1.08), and being aware of the woman's HIV status (aPR = 1.04, 95%CI 0.99–1.09). In-depth results identified barriers to uptake as, lack of trust in the HIVST kit results, fear of test outcome in the presence of their partner and inclination that the HIV status of their women is the same as theirs; Facilitators included convenience, ease of use, prior awareness of their HIV status, and fear of relationship consequences and breakup. Delivery of oral HIVST kits to men through pregnant women reached a high number of men and achieved high uptake. Accessing information, education, communication and the kit's convenience were major reasons for uptake among men who received the kit as; trust issues affected its use among partners. Scaling up the delivery of oral HIVST kits at all departments of hospitals through women seeking health services is paramount to support HIV screening among men to reach the UNAIDS 95 strategy.",

The percentage of CD4 positive cells is a more easily measured and less variable number. We analyzed sequential CD4 and CD8 numbers, percentages and ratios in 218 of our HIV infected patients to determine the most reliable predictor of an AIDS-related event. Results The CD4 percentage was an unsurpassed predictor of the occurrence of AIDS-related events when all subsets of patients are considered. The CD4 absolute count was the next most reliable, followed by the ratio of CD4/CD8 percentages. The value of CD4 percentage over the CD4 absolute count was seen even after the introduction of highly effective HIV therapy. Conclusion The CD4 percentage is unsurpassed as a parameter for predicting the onset of HIV-related diseases. The extra time and expense of measuring the CD4 absolute count may be unnecessary.",

    "abstract": "The high rate of HIV-1 mutation and increasing resistance to currently available antiretroviral (ART) therapies highlight the need for new antiviral agents. Products derived from natural sources have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication during various stages of the virus life cycle, and therefore represent a potential source of novel therapeutic agents. To expand our arsenal of therapeutics against HIV-1 infection, we investigated aqueous extract from Sargassum fusiforme (S. fusiforme) for ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection in the periphery, in T cells and human macrophages, and for ability to inhibit in the central nervous system (CNS), in microglia and astrocytes.S. fusiforme extract blocked HIV-1 infection and replication by over 90% in T cells, human macrophages and microglia, and it also inhibited pseudotyped HIV-1 (VSV/NL4-3) infection in human astrocytes by over 70%. Inhibition was mediated against both CXCR4 (X4) and CCR5 (R5)-tropic HIV-1, was dose dependant and long lasting, did not inhibit cell growth or viability, was not toxic to cells, and was comparable to inhibition by the nucleoside analogue 2', 3'-didoxycytidine (ddC). S. fusiforme treatment blocked direct cell-to-cell infection spread. To investigate at which point of the virus life cycle this inhibition occurs, we infected T cells and CD4-negative primary human astrocytes with HIV-1 pseudotyped with envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which bypasses the HIV receptor requirements. Infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 (VSV/NL4-3) was also inhibited in a dose dependant manner, although up to 57% less, as compared to inhibition of native NL4-3, indicating post-entry interferences.This is the first report demonstrating S. fusiforme to be a potent inhibitor of highly productive HIV-1 infection and replication in T cells, in primary human macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes. Results with VSV/NL4-3 infection, suggest inhibition of both entry and post-entry events of the virus life cycle. Absence of cytotoxicity and high viability of treated cells also suggest that S. fusiforme is a potential source of novel naturally occurring antiretroviral compounds that inhibit HIV-1 infection and replication at more than one site of the virus life cycle.",

To test the importance of Rev nucleolar trafficking in the HIV-1 replication cycle, we created a nucleolar localizing Rev Response Element (RRE) decoy and tested this for its anti-HIV activity. The RRE decoy provided marked inhibition of HIV-1 replication in both the CEM T-cell line and in primary CD34+ derived monocytes.

We aimed at exploring rates and predictors of ART combination changes in clinical practice in Treat Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD). Methods Rates of ART changes were examined in patients who started first line triple or more ART combination in TAHOD, and had at least one follow-up visit. Rates of ART changes were summarised per follow-up year, and factors associated with changes assessed using random-effect Poisson regression. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine durations of patients in their first, second and third regimen. Results A total of 1846 patients initiated an ART combination with at least three drugs. Median follow up time for the first treatment was 3.2 years. The overall rate of ART change was 29 per 100-person-year. In univariate analyses, rate of treatment change was significantly associated with exposure category, the country income category, the drug class combination, calendar year and the number of combinations. In multivariate analysis, compared to d4T/3TC/NVP, starting ART with another NNRTI-containing regimen, with PI only or with a triple NRTI regimen was associated with a higher risk of combination change (relative risk (RR) 1.6 (95% CI 1.64 – 1.96), p &lt; 0.001, RR 3.39 (2.76 – 4.16) p &lt; 0.001, RR 6.37 (4.51 – 9.00), p &lt; 0.001). Being on a second or a third combination regimen was also associated with a decreased rate of ART change, compared with first ART combination (RR 0.82 (0.68 – 0.99), p = 0.035, RR 0.77 (0.61 – 0.97), p = 0.024). Sites with fewer than 12 drugs used had an increased rate of treatment changes (1.31 (1.13 – 1.51), p &lt; 0.001). Injecting drug users, and other/unknown exposure was found to increase rate of treatment change (1.24 (1.00 – 1.54), p = 0.055). Percentages of patients who stopped treatment due to adverse events were 31, 27 and 32 in 1st, 2nd and 3rd treatment combinations, respectively. Conclusion Our study suggests that drug availability impacts on ART prescription patterns. Our data, reflecting real clinic use in Asia, suggest that around half of all patients require second combination ART by 3 years after treatment initiation.",

This may cause a decrease in viral load and improvement in clinical as well as immunological status.

Mycobacteria are the pathogens that most frequently provoke IRD and mycobacterial IRD is a common cause of morbidity in HIV-infected patients co-infected with mycobacteria. We hypothesised that the excessive effector immune response in mycobacterial IRD reflects impaired regulation by IL-10. Results We studied two patients who experienced mycobacterial IRD during ART. One patient developed a second episode of IRD with distinct clinical characteristics. Findings were compared with patients 'at risk' of developing IRD who had uneventful immune recovery. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from all subjects were stimulated with mycobacterial antigens in the form of purified protein derivative (PPD). Supernatants were assayed for IFNγ and IL-10. In response to PPD, PBMC from IRD patients generated IFNγ during the first IRD episode, whilst cells from non-IRD controls produced more IL-10. Conclusion We present preliminary data from two HIV-infected patients showing an imbalance between IFNγ and IL-10 responses to mycobacterial antigens during mycobacterial IRD. Our findings suggest that imbalanced effector and regulatory cytokine responses should be investigated as a cause of IRD.",

    "abstract": "Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is increasing in resource-limited settings (RLS) and can successfully reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality. However, virologic failure and development of viral drug resistance can result in reduced treatment options and disease progression. Additionally, transmission of resistant virus, and particularly multi-drug resistance, could become a public health concern. This study evaluated treatment success and development of ART drug resistance after short-term treatment among patients attending the Comprehensive HIV Care Centre (CCC) of Coast Province General Hospital, Mombasa, Kenya. One hundred and fifty HIV-infected individuals receiving ART were consecutively recruited to participate in the study. After determination of plasma viral load, patients with detectable viral load levels were subjected to genotypic drug resistance testing. At the time of sampling, 132 of the 150 participants were on ART for more than 6 months (median 21 months, IQR = 12-26). An efficient viral load reduction to below 50 copies/ml was observed in 113 (85.6%) of them. Of the 19 patients with a detectable viral load, sequencing of the protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) gene was successful in 16. Eleven (11) of these 16 patients were infected with a subtype A1 virus. Major PR mutations were absent, but mutations associated with drug resistance in RT were detected in 14 of the 16 patients (87.5%). High-level resistance against at least 2 drugs of the ART regimen was observed in 9/14 (64.3%). The 3TC mutation M184V and the NNRTI mutation K103N were most frequent but also the multi-drug resistance Q151M and the broad NRTI cross-resistance K65R were observed. The results of this study revealed a high rate of treatment success after short term ART in patients treated at a public provincial hospital in a RLS. Nevertheless, the observed high risk of accumulation of resistance mutations among patients failing treatment and the selection of multi-drug resistance mutations in some, remains of great concern for future treatment options and potential transmission to partners.",

We carried out a study to establish the effect of ADCs on immunological recovery among patients initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART).A retrospective cohort of 427 HIV-1 patients who were initiated on ART between January 2002 and December 2006 was studied. Data on ADCs was retrieved from Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) data base and backed up by chart reviews. We employed Kaplan-Meier survival curves to estimate median time to 50 CD4 cells/microl from the baseline value to indicate a good immunological recovery process. Cox proportional hazard models were used at multivariate analysis.The median time to gaining 50 CD4 cells/microl from the baseline value after ART initiation was longer in the ADC (9.3 months) compared to the non-ADC group (6.9 months) (log rank test, p = 0.027). At multivariate analysis after adjusting for age, sex, baseline CD4 count, baseline HIV viral load, total lymphocyte count and adherence level, factors that shortened the median time to immunological recovery after ART initiation were belonging to the non-ADC group (HR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.03-1.28, p = 0.028), adherence to ART of >or= 95% (HR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.57-3.15, p = 0.001) and a total lymphocyte count >or= 1200 cells/mm3 (HR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.22-2.78, p = 0.003).

    "abstract": "Abstract Roche's protease inhibitor nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept ® ) produced between March 2007-June 2007 was found to contain elevated levels of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), a known mutagen (alkylator) – leading to a global recall of the drug. EMS levels in a daily dose (2,500 mg Viracept/day) were predicted not to exceed a dose of ~2.75 mg/day (~0.055 mg/kg/day based on 50 kg patient). As existing toxicology data on EMS did not permit an adequate patient risk assessment, a comprehensive animal toxicology evaluation of EMS was conducted. General toxicity of EMS was investigated in rats over 28 days. Two studies for DNA damage were performed in mice; chromosomal damage was assessed using a micronucleus assay and gene mutations were detected using the MutaMouse transgenic model. In addition, experiments designed to extrapolate animal exposure to humans were undertaken. A general toxicity study showed that the toxicity of EMS occurred only at doses ≥ 60 mg/kg/day, which is far above that received by patients. Studies for chromosomal damage and mutations in mice demonstrated a clear threshold effect with EMS at 25 mg/kg/day, under chronic dosing conditions. Exposure analysis (C max ) demonstrated that ~370-fold higher levels of EMS than that ingested by patients, are needed to saturate known, highly conserved, error-free, mammalian DNA repair mechanisms for alkylation. In summary, animal studies suggested that patients who took nelfinavir mesylate with elevated levels of EMS are at no increased risk for carcinogenicity or teratogenicity over their background risk, since mutations are prerequisites for such downstream events. These findings are potentially relevant to &gt;40 marketed drugs that are mesylate salts.",

    "abstract": "While the introduction of combination highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens represents an important advance in the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, tolerability can be an issue and the use of several different agents may produce problems. The switch of combination HAART to ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) monotherapy may offer the opportunity to maintain antiviral efficacy while reducing treatment complexity and the risks of toxicity. Current European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) guidelines recognise ritonavir-boosted PI monotherapy with twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir or once-daily darunavir/ritonavir as a possible option in patients who have intolerance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or for treatment simplification. Clinical trials data for PI boosted monotherapy are encouraging, showing substantial efficacy in the majority of patients; however, further data are required before this approach can be recommended as a routine treatment. Available data indicate that the most suitable candidates for the use of boosted PI monotherapy are long-term virologically suppressed patients who have demonstrated good adherence to antiretroviral therapy, who do not have chronic hepatitis B, have no history of treatment failure on PIs and are able to tolerate low-dose ritonavir.",

Because of highly active antiretroviral therapy, increasing number of children, infected perinatally, are surviving into adolescence and are becoming sexually active and need reproductive health services. The objective of this article is to review the methods of contraception appropriate for HIV-positive adolescents with a special focus on hormonal contraceptives. Delaying the start of sexual life and the use of two methods thereafter, one of which is the male condom and the other a highly effective contraceptive method such as hormonal contraception or an intrauterine device, is currently the most effective option for those who desire simultaneous protection from both pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Health care providers should be aware of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions between hormonal contraception and antiretrovirals. There is an urgent need for more information regarding metabolic outcomes of hormonal contraceptives, especially the effect of injectable progestins on bone metabolism, in HIV-positive adolescent girls.",

    "abstract": "The enumeration of absolute CD4 counts is of primary importance for many medical conditions especially HIV infection where therapeutic initiation depends on the count. These ranges tend to vary across populations. However, these ranges have not been comprehensively established in the Kenyan population. Therefore, this study aimed at establishing the reference ranges for the CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes in normal healthy individuals in Kenya. A total of 315 individuals of the ages between 16 and 60 years old, in 5 different regions of the country, were recruited into the study. They were screened for diseases that potentially cause lymphocyte homeostasis perturbation. CD4/CD8 Counts were performed by use of a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, NJ) equipped with automated acquisition and analysis software. Results were analysed according to age, sex and region. Results were presented as means and ranges (in parenthesis) generated non parametrically as 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles as follows; In general population; CD3 1655 (614-2685 cells/μL ), CD4 920 (343-1493 cells/μL), and CD8 646 (187-1139 cells/μL), while according to sex, females; CD3 1787 (697-2841 cells/μL), CD4 1010 (422-1572 cells/μL), CD8 659 (187-1180 cells/μL); males; CD3 1610 (581-2641 cells/μL), CD4 889(320-1459 cells/μL) and CD8 644 (185-1140 cells/μL). The general reference ranges for CD4/CD8 ratios were as follows; general population 1.57(0.50-2.74), males 1.51(0.49-2.64) and females 1.69(0.55-2.95). The lymphocyte reference ranges for the Kenyan population are fairly comparable to those established in other African populations. The ranges also differ appreciably from those established in Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Furthermore, the study reported significant differences in the ranges of different population clusters within Kenya, as well us between males and females.",

Little is known about Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) specific immune restoration in relation to immunologic and virologic outcomes after long-term HAART during co-infections with latent and active TB.A total of 232 adults, including 59 HIV patients with clinical TB (HIV + TB+), 125 HIV patients without clinical TB (HIV + TB-), 13 HIV negative active TB patients (HIV-TB+), and 10 HIV negative Tuberculin Skin TST positive (HIV-TST+), and 25 HIV-TST- individuals were recruited. HAART was initiated in 113 HIV + patients (28 TB + and 85 TB-), and anti-TB treatment for all TB cases. CD4+ T-cell count, HIV RNA load, and IFN-γ responses to ESAT-6/CFP-10 were measured at baseline, 6 months (M6), 18 months (M18) and 24 months (M24) after HAART initiation.The majority of HIV + TB- (70%, 81%, 84%) as well as HIV + TB + patients (60%, 77%, 80%) had virologic success (HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml) by M6, M18 and M24, respectively. HAART also significantly increased CD4+ T-cell counts at 2 years in HIV + TB + (from 110.3 to 289.9 cells/μl), HIV + TB- patients (197.8 to 332.3 cells/μl), HIV + TST- (199 to 347 cells/μl) and HIV + TST + individuals (195 to 319 cells/μl). Overall, there was no significant difference in the percentage of patients that achieved virologic success and in total CD4+ counts increased between HIV patients with and without TB or LTBI. The Mtb specific IFN-γ response at baseline was significantly lower in HIV + TB + (3.6 pg/ml) compared to HIV-TB + patients (34.4 pg/ml) and HIV + TST + (46.3 pg/ml) individuals; and in HIV-TB + patients compared to HIV-TST + individuals (491.2 pg/ml). By M18 on HAART, the IFN-γ response remained impaired in HIV + TB + patients (18.1 pg/ml) while it normalized in HIV + TST + individuals (from 46.3 to 414.2 pg/ml).Our data show that clinical and latent TB infections do not influence virologic and immunologic outcomes of ART in HIV patients. Despite this, HAART was unable to restore optimal TB responsiveness as measured by Mtb specific IFN-γ response in HIV/TB patients. Improvement of Mtb-specific immune restoration should be the focus of future therapeutic strategies.",

Yet, the magnitude of TB disease on mortality is poorly understood. Methods Using a prospective cohort of 22,477 adult patients who initiated ART between August 2000 and June 2009 in Uganda, we assessed the effect of active pulmonary TB disease at the initiation of ART on all-cause mortality using a Cox proportional hazards model. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to control for potential confounding. Stratification and covariate adjustment for PS and not PS-based multivariable Cox models were also performed. Results A total of 1,609 (7.52%) patients had active pulmonary TB at the start of ART. TB patients had higher proportions of being male, suffering from AIDS-defining illnesses, having World Health Organization (WHO) disease stage III or IV, and having lower CD4 cell counts at baseline (p &lt; 0.001). The percentages of death during follow-up were 10.47% and 6.38% for patients with and without TB, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) for mortality comparing TB to non-TB patients using 1,686 PS-matched pairs was 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08 – 1.75), less marked than the crude estimate (HR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.49 – 2.04). The other PS-based methods and not PS-based multivariable Cox model produced similar results. Conclusions After controlling for important confounding variables, HIV patients who had TB at the initiation of ART in Uganda had an approximate 37% increased hazard of overall mortality relative to non-TB patients.",

    "abstract": "Opioids may have effects on susceptibility to HIV-infection, viral replication and disease progression. Injecting drug users (IDU), as well as anyone receiving opioids for anesthesia and analgesia may suffer the clinical consequences of such interactions. There is conflicting data between in vitro experiments showing an enhancing effect of opioids on HIV replication and clinical data, mostly showing no such effect. For clarification we studied the effects of the opioids heroin and morphine on HIV replication in cultured CD4-positive T cells at several concentrations and we related the observed effects with the relevant reached plasma concentrations found in IDUs. Latently-infected ACH-2 T lymphoblasts were incubated with different concentrations of morphine and heroine. Reactivation of HIV was assessed by intracellular staining of viral Gag p24 protein and subsequent flow cytometric quantification of p24-positive cells. The influence of the opioid antagonist naloxone and the antioxidants N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) on HIV reactivation was determined. Cell viability was investigated by 7-AAD staining and flow cytometric quantification. Morphine and heroine triggered reactivation of HIV replication in ACH-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations above 1 mM (EC50 morphine 2.82 mM; EC50 morphine 1.96 mM). Naloxone did not interfere with heroine-mediated HIV reactivation, even at high concentrations (1 mM). Opioids also triggered necrotic cell death at similar concentrations at which HIV reactivation was observed. Both opioid-mediated reactivation of HIV and opioid-triggered cell death could be inhibited by the antioxidants GSH and NAC. Opioids reactivate HIV in vitro but at concentrations that are far above the plasma levels of analgesic regimes or drug concentrations found in IDUs. HIV reactivation was mediated by effects unrelated to opioid-receptor activation and was tightly linked to the cytotoxic activity of the substances at millimolar concentrations, suggesting that opioid-mediated reactivation of HIV was due to accompanying effects of cellular necrosis such as activation of reactive oxygen species and NF-κB.",

    "abstract": "A number of antiviral agents used against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis B virus (HBV) mono or co-infection have been associated with real nephrotoxicity (including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), atazanavir, indinavir and lopinavir) or apparent changes in renal function (e.g. cobicistat, ritonavir, rilpivirine and dolutegravir). Patients with HIV are at higher risk of acute and chronic renal dysfunction, so baseline assessment and ongoing monitoring of renal function is an important part of routine management of patients with HIV. Given the paucity of evidence in this area, we sought to establish a consensus view on how routine monitoring could be performed in Australian patients on ART regimens, especially those involving TDF. A group of nephrologists and prescribers (an HIV physician and a hepatologist) were assembled by Gilead to discuss practical and reasonable renal management strategies for patients particularly those on TDF-based combination regimens (in the case of those with HIV-infection) or on TDF-monotherapy (in the case of HBV-mono infection). The group considered which investigations should be performed as part of routine practice, their frequency, and when specialist renal referral is warranted. The algorithm presented suggests testing for serum creatinine along with plasma phosphate and an assessment of urinary protein (rather than albumin) and glucose. Here we advocate baseline tests of renal function at initiation of therapy. If creatinine excretion inhibitors (e.g. cobicistat or rilpivirine) are used as part of the ART regimen, we suggest creatinine is rechecked at 4 weeks and this value used as the new baseline. Repeat testing is suggested at 3-monthly intervals for a year and then at least yearly thereafter if no abnormalities are detected. In patients with abnormal baseline results, renal function assessment should be performed at least 6 monthly. In HBV mono-infected patients advocate that a similar testing protocol may be logical.",

    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves the survival and quality of life of HIV-positive individuals, but the effects of long-term ART use do eventually manifest. The Complications of Long-Term Antiretroviral Therapy cohort study in Uganda (CoLTART) was established to investigate the metabolic and renal complications of long-term ART use among Ugandan adults. We describe the CoLTART study set-up, aims, objectives, study methods, and also report some preliminary cross-sectional study enrolment metabolic and renal complications data analysis results.HIV-positive ART naïve and experienced adults (18 years and above) in Uganda were enrolled. Data on demographic, dietary, medical, social economic and behaviour was obtained; and biophysical measurements and a clinical examination were undertaken. We measured: fasting glucose and lipid profiles, renal and liver function tests, full blood counts, immunology, virology and HIV drug resistance testing. Plasma samples were stored for future studies.Between July 2013 and October 2014, we enrolled 1095 individuals, of whom 964 (88.0%) were ART experienced (6 months or more), with a median of 9.4 years (IQR 7.0-9.9) on ART. Overall, 968 (88.4%) were aged 35 years and above, 711 (64.9%) were females, 608 (59.6%) were or had ever been on a Tenofovir ART regimen and 236 (23.1%) on a Protease Inhibitor (PI) regimen. There were no differences in renal dysfunction between patients on Tenofovir and Non-Tenofovir containing ART regimens. Patients on PI regimens had higher total cholesterol, lower high density lipoprotein, higher low density lipoprotein, higher triglycerides, and a high atherogenic index for plasma than the non-PI regimen, p = 0.001 or < 0.001. Patients on Non-PI regimens had higher mean diastolic hypertension than patients on PI regimens, p < 0.001.Our finding of no differences in renal dysfunction between patients on Tenofovir and those on Non-Tenofovir containing ART regimens means that Tenofovir based first line ART can safely be initiated even in settings without routine renal function monitoring. However, integration of cardiovascular risk assessment, preventive and curative measures against cardiovascular disease are required. The CoLTART cohort is a good platform to investigate the complications of long-term ART use in Uganda.",

It was used both as a continuous score and as a categorical variable, defining 'most frail' a FI > 0.45. FI change across transplant (deltaFI, ΔFI) was calculated as the difference between year 1 FI (FI–Y1) and pre-transplant FI (FI–t0). The outcomes measures were mortality and \"otpimal LT\" (defined as being alive without multi-morbidity). Median value of FI–t0 was 0.48 (IQR 0.42–0.52), FI–Y1 was 0.31 (IQR 0.26–0.41). At year five mortality rate was 45%, \"optimal transplant\" rate at year 1 was 38%. All the patients who died in the post-LT were most frail in the pre-LT. ΔFI was a predictor of mortality after correction for age and MELD (HR = 1.10, p = 0.006) and was inversely associated with optimal transplant after correction for age (HR = 1.04, p = 0.01). We validated FI as a valuable health measure in HIV transplant.

    "abstract": "While efficacy data exist, there are limited data on the outcomes of patients on third-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa in actual practice. Being able to identify predictors of switch to third-line ART will be essential for planning for future need. We identify predictors of switch to third-line ART among patients with significant viraemia on a protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line ART regimen. Additionally, we describe characteristics of all patients on third-line at a large public sector HIV clinic and present their early outcomes. Retrospective analysis of adults (≥ 18 years) on a PI-based second-line ART regimen at Themba Lethu Clinic, Johannesburg, South Africa as of 01 August 2012, when third-line treatment became available in South Africa, with significant viraemia on second-line ART (defined as at least one viral load ≥ 1000 copies/mL on second-line ART after 01 August 2012) to identify predictors of switch to third-line (determined by genotype resistance testing). Third-line ART was defined as a regimen containing etravirine, raltegravir or ritonavir boosted darunavir, between August 2012 and January 2016. To assess predictors of switch to third-line ART we used Cox proportional hazards regression among those with significant viraemia on second-line ART after 01 August 2012. Then among all patients on third-line ART we describe viral load suppression, defined as a viral load < 400 copies/mL, after starting third-line ART. Among 719 patients in care and on second-line ART as of August 2012 (with at least one viral load ≥ 1000 copies/mL after 01 August 2012), 36 (5.0% over a median time of 54 months) switched to third-line. Time on second-line therapy (≥ 96 vs. < 96 weeks) (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR): 2.53 95% CI 1.03–6.22) and never reaching virologic suppression while on second-line ART (aHR: 3.37 95% CI 1.47–7.73) were identified as predictors of switch. In a separate cohort of patients on third-line ART, 78.3% (47/60) and 83.3% (35/42) of those in care and with a viral load suppressed their viral load at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Our results show that the need for third-line is low (5%), but that patients' who switch to third-line ART have good early treatment outcomes and are able to suppress their viral load. Adherence counselling and resistance testing should be prioritized for patients that are at risk of failure, in particular those who never suppress on second-line and those who have been on PI-based regimen for extended periods.",

    "abstract": "The widespread global access to antiretroviral drugs has led to considerable reductions in morbidity and mortality but, unfortunately, the risk of virologic failure increases with the emergence, and potential transmission, of drug resistant viruses. Detecting and quantifying HIV-1 drug resistance has therefore become the standard of care when designing new antiretroviral regimens. The sensitivity of Sanger sequencing-based HIV-1 genotypic assays is limited by its inability to identify minority members of the quasispecies, i.e., it only detects variants present above ~ 20% of the viral population, thus, failing to detect minority variants below this threshold. It is clear that deep sequencing-based HIV-1 genotyping assays are an important step change towards accurately monitoring HIV-infected individuals. We implemented and verified a clinically validated HIV-1 genotyping assay based on deep sequencing (DEEPGEN™) in two clinical laboratories in the United Kingdom: St. George's University Hospitals Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (London) and at NHS Lothian (Edinburgh), to characterize minority HIV-1 variants in 109 plasma samples from ART-naïve or -experienced individuals. Although subtype B HIV-1 strains were highly prevalent (44%, 48/109), most individuals were infected with non-B subtype viruses (i.e., A1, A2, C, D, F1, G, CRF02_AG, and CRF01_AE). DEEPGEN™ was able to accurately detect drug resistance-associated mutations not identified using standard Sanger sequencing-based tests, which correlated significantly with patient's antiretroviral treatment histories. A higher proportion of minority PI-, NRTI-, and NNRTI-resistance mutations was detected in NHS Lothian patients compared to individuals from St. George's, mainly M46I/L and I50 V (associated with PIs), D67 N, K65R, L74I, M184 V/I, and K219Q (NRTIs), and L100I (NNRTIs). Interestingly, we observed an inverse correlation between intra-patient HIV-1 diversity and CD4+ T cell counts in the NHS Lothian patients. This is the first study evaluating the transition, training, and implementation of DEEPGEN™ between three clinical laboratories in two different countries. More importantly, we were able to characterize the HIV-1 drug resistance profile (including minority variants), coreceptor tropism, subtyping, and intra-patient viral diversity in patients from the United Kingdom, providing a rigorous foundation for basing clinical decisions on highly sensitive and cost-effective deep sequencing-based HIV-1 genotyping assays in the country.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasingly wider availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), some people living with HIV (PLHIV) and eligible for treatment have opted to adopt self-care practices thereby risking early AIDS-related mortality.A qualitative study was conducted in urban Zambia to gain insights into PLHIV self-care practices and experiences and explore the implications for successful delivery of ART care. Between March 2010 and September 2011, in-depth interviews were conducted with PLHIV who had dropped out of treatment (n=25) and those that had opted not to initiate medication (n=37). Data was entered into and managed using Atlas ti, and analysed inductively using latent content analysis.PHIV used therapeutic and physical health maintenance, psychological well-being and healthy lifestyle self-care practices to maintain physical health and mitigate HIV-related symptoms. Herbal remedies, faith healing and self-prescription of antibiotics and other conventional medicines to treat HIV-related ailments were used for therapeutic and physical health maintenance purposes. Psychological well-being self-care practices used were religiosity/spirituality and positive attitudes towards HIV infection. These practices were modulated by close social network relationships with other PLHIV, family members and peers, who acted as sources of emotional, material and financial support. Cessations of sexual relationships, adoption of safe sex to avoid re-infections and uptake of nutritional supplements were the commonly used risk reduction and healthy lifestyle practices respectively.While these self-care practices may promote physical and psychosocial well-being and mitigate AIDS-related symptoms, at least in the short term, they however undermine PLHIV access to ART care thereby putting PLHIV at risk of early AIDS-related mortality. The use of scientifically unproven herbal remedies raises health and safety concerns; faith healing may create fatalism and resignation with death while the reported self-prescription of antibiotics to treat HIV-related infections raises concerns about future development of microbial drug resistance amongst PLHIV. Collectively, these self-care practices undermine efforts to effectively abate the spread and burden of HIV and reduce AIDS-related mortality. Therefore, there is need for sensitization campaigns on the benefits of ART and the risks associated with widespread self-prescription of antibiotics and use of scientifically unproven herbal remedies.",

Logistic-regression modeling was used to ascertain factors associated with HCV therapy initiation and achievement of sustained viral response (SVR).Of 196 and 163 patients that were enrolled in the HIV primary care and hepatology models, 48 and 26 were treated for HCV, respectively (p = 0.043).

Prior psychiatric medication use correlated negatively with HCV treatment initiation (OR: 0.6, p = 0.045). In adjusted analysis the strongest predictor of HCV treatment initiation was CD4+ count (≥400/mm3, OR: 2.1, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in either clinic model (primary care vs. hepatology) in the rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (29% vs. 16%), loss to follow-up (8 vs. 8%), or HCV SVR (44 vs. 35%).Using a HIV primary care model increased the number of HIV patients who initiate HCV therapy with comparable outcomes to a hepatology model.",

There are, however, several rather unique and interesting aspects of these post-transcriptional processes on HIV transcripts. Capping of the highly structured 5' end of HIV mRNAs is influenced by the viral TAT protein and a population of HIV mRNAs contains a trimethyl-G cap reminiscent of U snRNAs involved in splicing. HIV polyadenylation involves active repression of a promoter-proximal polyadenylation signal, auxiliary upstream regulatory elements and moonlighting polyadenylation factors that have additional impacts on HIV biology outside of the constraints of classical mRNA 3' end formation. This review describes these post-transcriptional novelties of HIV gene expression as well as their implications in viral biology and as possible targets for therapeutic intervention.",

While previous studies have identified risk factors for PVL rebound among PWID, no study has examined the perspectives of PWID who have experienced PVL rebound episodes. We conducted an ethno-epidemiological study to investigate the circumstances surrounding the emergence of rebound episodes among PWID in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Comprehensive clinical records linked to a community-based prospective observational cohort of HIV-positive drug users were used to identify PWID who had recently experienced viral rebound. In-depth qualitative interviews with 16 male and 11 female participants explored participant perspectives regarding the emergence of viral rebound. A timeline depicting each participant's HIV viral load and adherence to ART was used to elicit discussion of circumstances surrounding viral rebound. Viral rebound episodes were shaped by interplay between various individual, social, and environmental factors that disrupted routines facilitating adherence. Structural-environmental influences resulting in non-adherence included housing transitions, changes in drug use patterns and intense drug scene involvement, and inadequate care for co-morbid health conditions. Social-environmental influences on ART adherence included poor interactions between care providers and patients producing non-adherence, and understandings of HIV treatment that fostered intentional treatment discontinuation. This study describes key pathways which led to rebound episodes among PWID receiving ART and illustrates how environmental forces may increase vulnerability for non-adherence leading to treatment failure. Our findings have potential to help inform interventions and supports that address social-structural forces that foster non-adherence among PWID.",

This study aimed to characterize the genetic diversity and to determine the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) between individuals recently or chronically diagnosed with HIV-1 from Paraná, Brazil. A total of 260 HIV-1 positive antiretroviral therapy-naïve patients were recruited to participate on the study, of which 39 were recently diagnosed. HIV-1 genotyping was performed using sequencing reaction followed by phylogenetic analyses to determine the HIV-1 subtype. TDRM were defined using the Calibrated Population Resistance Tool program. The HIV-1 subtypes frequency found in the studied population were 54.0% of subtype B, 26.7% subtype C, 6.7% subtype F1 and 12.7% recombinant forms. The overall prevalence of TDRM was 6.7%, including 13.3% for recently diagnosed subjects and 5.9% for the chronic group. The prevalence of resistance mutations found in this study is considered moderate, thus to perform genotyping tests before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy may be important to define the first line therapy and contribute for the improvement of regional prevention strategies for epidemic control.",

    "abstract": "As in non-infected subjects, statins and aspirin have a pivotal preventive role in reducing the cardiovascular related morbidity and mortality in HIV infected patients. The persistence of immune activation in these subjects, could contribute to accelerate atherosclerosis, therefore, these treatments that reduce inflammation could provide additional cardiovascular protection. However the current guidelines for the use of these drugs in general population are dissimilar, with important differences between American and European ones. Aim of the present position paper is to provide recommendations aimed to overcome the actual differences and limitations among the current ones and to adapt them to the needs of HIV infected patients.We propose to adopt the new ACC/AHA guidelines, simple to use and cost effective, to use the ASCVD score that seems to estimate more accurately the cardiovascular risk among these patients. We suggest to start statin therapy in all patients with a calculated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater. Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin should be preferred. LDL-C target may be adopted. Aspirin should be always associated with a statin, in secondary prevention, while in primary prevention it should be reserved only to patients with ≥ 20% 10-year risk particularly adherent to treatments, and with low risk of bleeding. We suggest to start with a dose of 100 mg/day. Finally, management of antiplatelet agents or novel oral anticoagulants may include selecting antiretrovirals with a lower potential for drug interactions or choosing agents least likely to interact with antiretrovirals.As demonstrated in surveys, HIV physicians are generally highly committed regarding CVD and autonomous in prescribing statins and ASA. Consequently, in the light of the previously discussed discrepancies among the different guidelines and of the incomplete indications regarding HIV-positive persons, the present suggestions could overcome the actual differences and limitations among the current ones.",

Methods In a prospective cohort study from June 2016 to May 2017, all newly HIV diagnosed patients at the HIV/AIDS Unit of the Hospital Eugenio Espejo in Quito, Ecuador were evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression followed by a second assessment 8–12 weeks after antiretroviral therapy containing efavirenz was initiated. Results A total of 79 patients, mainly males younger than 35 years were studied. Majority of them were on TDF/FTC/EFV. Initial score in Hamilton Rating Scale revealed that less than 30% had no depression symptoms while almost 40% had mild depression. However, in the second assessment, 22.6% of the subjects had a score in the Hamilton Rating Scale compatible with severe or very severe depression (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.28; p = 0.05). Conclusion In our cohort study, depression was much higher in patients on Efavirenz-containing treatments.

Evidence shows that mortality has been high particularly in the first 3 to 6 months of initiating antiretroviral therapy. Hence, the study aimed to assess the Epidemiology of survival pattern and its determinants among adult HIV positive patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy. Methods Retrospective cohort study was employed among a total of 455 records of patients who were enrolled on antiretroviral therapy from September 2006 to August 2010. Socio-demographic, clinical, immunological, behavioral, and date of antiretroviral treatment initiation including date of follow up status were extracted. Significant predictor variables were identified by fitting Cox’s proportional hazard model using a backward stepwise method and statistical significance variables were declared based on a p-value less than 0.05. Results A total of 455 adult HIV/AIDS patients on ART contributed to 886.05-person-year of observation and 65.7% were alive and on treatment, 17.1% were lost to follow up and 7.5% died. The study showed that the estimated mortality was 4.4%, 5.3%, 6.1%, 7%, 7.5% and 7.5% at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months of follow up period, respectively. The overall incidence rate of mortality was 4.2 per 100 person-years of observation. In multivariate analysis age 45 and above (AHR: 3.72, 95% CI 1.21–11.4), bedridden functional status (AHR: 17.4, 95% CI 6.21–48.79), poor ART drug adherence (AHR: 4.52,95% CI 2.05–9.96), Tuberculosis co-infection (AHR: 4.1, 95% CI 1.84–9.13), non-disclosure (AHR: 4.9, 95% CI 1.82–12.89) and severe anemia (AHR: 5.1, 95% CI 1.81–14.21) were found predictors. Conclusion Patients with older age, tuberculosis infection, bedridden patients and severe anemia were predictors. Tracing poorly adhered patients and giving drug counseling as well as encouraging them for disclosure to their families is crucial to improve their survival.",

The prevalence of viral load suppression in Uganda among all adults and children living with HIV is 59.6% and 39.3% respectively. High viral load compromises on the quality of life of an individual, and as well increases on the risk of transmission of the virus to the unborn for pregnant mothers and to the spouse. The UNAID 90-90-90 campaign recommends that 90% know their status, 90% get treatment and 90% have viral suppression. Non-adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is one of the causes of the high viral load. The world health organization recommends Intensified Adherence Counselling (IAC) be given to all individuals with a high viral load. The perceptions, attitudes and practices of people receiving IAC is important in understanding how best IAC should be implemented. Methods A qualitative study was done among 30 purposively selected individuals/guardians of children receiving ART and IAC at Kyabugimbi Health Center Four [HC IV (mini-hospital headed by a medical doctor)]. Data collected from Focus Group Discussion as audio-recordings in local language (Runyankole) was transcribed and later translated into English. Translated transcripts were analyzed manually using thematic content analysis. Results The major themes identified include: adherence to ART; change of attitude towards ART after IAC, IAC expectation and outcomes, IAC and stigma, and improving social support through IAC for PLWHIV. Conclusion Participating in IAC to be informative and led to change in their perceptions of HIV and better understanding the reasons for adherence to ART. IAC influenced the change in attitude and behavior thus seeking social support and mitigate stigma, which lead to a better ART adherence. However, there is need to improve on the way it is delivered both in structural setting and break down and packaging of information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Support groups for people living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) have continued to evolve since their emergence over two decades ago. In addition to providing HIV education and fostering psychosocial support, recent efforts have shifted the focus to socio-economic activities and retention in care. The sense of urgency to adopt new treatment and prevention strategies in sub-Saharan Africa necessitates greater engagement of established HIV care programs, especially among researchers seeking to conduct implementation research, promote prevention strategies and optimize treatment as prevention. To maximize the utility of support groups in doing so, efforts to create an organized, collaborative framework should be considered. This paper aims to describe the process of refocusing an adult HIV peer-support group and illustrate how a structured program was strengthened to sustain implementation research in resource-limited settings, while promoting patient recruitment and retention. A multidisciplinary team of scientists supporting an HIV peer-support group spearheaded the implementation process that authored the successes, challenges and lessons documented over eight years. Psychosocial support, nutrition care and support, adherence education and income generating projects were the main interventions employed. The initiative resulted in seven peer-reviewed publications, submission of 23 scientific abstracts, scientific dissemination at 12 international conferences. Eleven research studies and 16 income generating projects were successfully conducted over eight years. More than 900 patients participated in peer-support group activities every month and 400 were engaged in income generating activities. This multidisciplinary structured program was valuable in the retention and recruitment of patients for implementation research and benefits extended to psychosocial support, microeconomic projects, and improved nutrition. The support group contributed to strengthening implementation research through providing a platform for identification of research priorities, patient recruitment and retention in studies and dissemination of research findings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Older people living with HIV (OPLWH) require significant levels of support, including healthcare and rehabilitation interventions. People living with HIV are living longer, but still experience health-related impairments that affect functional activity, participation in day-to-day interactions, livelihoods and overall quality of life. Physical activity and exercise should be included as part of the comprehensive medical management for OPLWH but the investigation of prior studies reveal a gap in understanding and prescription. Our study aimed to explore the perceptions of OPLWH about physical activity and exercise. Methods The study adopted a phenomenological, qualitative design, using in-depth interviews, to understand OPLWH perceptions of physical activity and exercise, and their need for, and access to, physical activity and exercise programmes in a community in South Africa. Nine [9] males and seven [7] females participated in the study. Results Sixteen individuals voluntarily participated in face-to-face, semi-structured interviews which took place at the healthcare facility where they received regular treatment. All participants were 50 years and older. Personal gratification and the ability to perform activities of daily living as well as participate in community activities were believed to be strong motivators for exercise participation, while barriers to exercise were attributed to physical health issues; lack of proper instruction as well as stigma associated with HIV status within their communities. Participants also favored a combination of aerobic, flexibility and strength activities, as well as proper supervision and instruction within a group exercise setting. Conclusion The qualitative nature of our study provided an in-depth understanding of the perceptions of OPLWH towards physical activity and exercise. Our study highlighted the factors that hinder adherence to physical activity and exercise in this population. Many indicated that they would love to engage in structured physical activity programmes, but did not know where, when or how to begin. Creating a suitable environment with proper supervision and instruction by suitably qualified health professionals are essential when developing a community-based exercise programme for OPLWH.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Cambodia, nearly half of pregnant women attend antenatal care (ANC), which is an entry point of services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). However, most of ANC services are provided in health centres or fields, where laboratory services by technicians are not available. In this study, those voluntary confidential counselling and testing (VCCT) counsellors involved in PMTCT were trained by experienced laboratory technicians in our centre on HIV testing using Determine (Abbot Laboratories) HIV1/2 test kits through a half-day training course, which consisted of use of a pipette, how to process whole blood samples, and how to read test result. The trained counsellors were midwives working for ANC and delivery ward in our centre without any experience on laboratory works. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of the training by evaluating the proficiency of the trained non-laboratory staffs. The trained counsellors withdrew blood sample after pre-test counselling following ANC, and performed the rapid test. Laboratory technicians routinely did the same test and returned reports of the test results to counsellors. Reports by the counsellors and the laboratory technicians were compared, and discordant reports in two groups were re-tested with the same rapid test kit using the same blood sample. Cause of discordance was detected in discussion with both groups. Of 563 blood samples tested by six trained VCCT counsellors and three laboratory technicians, 11 samples (2.0%) were reported positive in each group, however four discordant reports (0.7%) between the groups were observed, in which two positive reports and two negative reports by the counsellors were negative and positive by the laboratory technicians, respectively. Further investigation confirmed that all the reports by the counsellors were correct, and that human error in writing reports in the laboratory was a cause of these discordant reports. These findings lead us the conclusion that the half-day training using the rapid and simple test was feasible for non-laboratory staffs to attain enough proficiency to implement VCCT services for PMTCT in resource-limited settings, and that human error was more likely to occur in laboratory before giving reports to counsellors.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: RNA based antiviral approaches against HIV-1 are among the most promising for long-term gene therapy. These include ribozymes, aptamers (decoys), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Lentiviral vectors are ideal for transduction of such inhibitory RNAs into hematopoietic stem cells due to their ability to transduce non-dividing cells and their relative refractiveness to gene silencing. The objective of this study is to introduce an HIV-1 Tar aptamer either alone or in combination with an anti-CCR5 ribozyme into CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells via an HIV-based lentiviral vector to derive viral resistant progeny T cells and macrophages. RESULTS: High efficiency and sustained gene transfer into CD34+ cells were achieved with lentiviral vector constructs harboring either Tar decoy or Tar decoy in combination with CCR5 ribozyme. Cells transduced with these constructs differentiated normally into T-lymphocytes in vivo in thy/liv grafts of SCID-hu mice, and into macrophages in vitro in the presence of appropriate growth factors. When challenged in vitro, the differentiated T lymphocytes and macrophages showed marked resistance against HIV-1 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Viral resistant transgenic T cells and macrophages that express HIV-1 Tar aptamer either alone or in combination with an anti-CCR5 ribozyme could be obtained by lentiviral gene transduction of CD34+ progenitor cells. These results showed for the first time that expression of these anti-HIV-1 transgenes in combination do not interfere with normal thymopoiesis and thus have set the stage for their application in stem cell based gene therapy for HIV/AIDS.",

    "abstract": "Although the impact of Aboriginal status on HIV incidence, HIV disease progression, and access to treatment has been investigated previously, little is known about the relationship between Aboriginal ethnicity and outcomes associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We undertook the present analysis to determine if Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal persons respond differently to HAART by measuring HIV plasma viral load response, CD4 cell response and time to all-cause mortality.A population-based analysis of a cohort of antiretroviral therapy naïve HIV-positive Aboriginal men and women 18 years or older in British Columbia, Canada. Participants were antiretroviral therapy naïve, initiated triple combination therapy between August 1, 1996 and September 30, 1999. Participants had to complete a baseline questionnaire as well as have at least two follow-up CD4 and HIV plasma viral load measures. The primary endpoints were CD4 and HIV plasma viral load response and all cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between Aboriginal status and CD4 cell response, HIV plasma viral load response and all-cause mortality while controlling for several confounder variables.A total of 622 participants met the study criteria. Aboriginal status was significantly associated with no AIDS diagnosis at baseline (p = 0.0296), having protease inhibitor in the first therapy (p = 0.0209), lower baseline HIV plasma viral load (p < 0.001), less experienced HIV physicians (P = 0.0133), history of IDU (p < 0.001), not completing high school (p = 0.0046), and an income of less than $10,000 per year (p = 0.0115). Cox proportional hazards models controlling for clinical characteristics found that Aboriginal status had an increased hazard of mortality (HR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.77-5.48) but did not with HIV plasma viral load response (HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.89-1.48) or CD4 cell response (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.73-1.23).Our study demonstrates that HIV-infected Aboriginal persons accessing HAART had similar HIV treatment response as non-Aboriginal persons but have a shorter survival. This study highlights the need for continued research on medical interventions and behavioural changes among HIV-infected Aboriginal and other marginalized populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Sustained use of antiretroviral therapy has been consistently shown to be one of the primary predictors of long-term effectiveness. Switching and discontinuation reflect patient and provider decisions that may limit future treatment options. In this study, we utilize data reported at semi-annual study visits from three prospective cohort studies, the AIDS Link to IntraVenous Exposure (ALIVE), the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), and the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), to investigate determinants of HAART modification with a particular focus on reported injection drug use (IDU). Methods Longitudinal data collected between 1996 and 2004 contributed from 2,266 participants (37% with a reported history of IDU) who reported initiating their first HAART regimen during follow-up were utilized. Separate proportional-hazards models were used to identify factors measured prior to HAART-initiation associated with the time to first HAART discontinuation and first switch of components of HAART among continuous HAART users. Results The use of PI- vs. NNRTI-based regimens among HAART users with and without any history of IDU was similar over follow-up. The median time to a first report of discontinuation of HAART was 1.1 years for individuals with a history of IDU but 2.5 years for those without a history of IDU and multivariate analyses confirmed overall that individuals with a history of IDU were at greater risk for HAART discontinuation (adj RH = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.03–1.48). However, when restricting to data contributed after 1999, there was no longer any significant increased risk (adj RH = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.81–1.36). After adjusting for pre-HAART health status and prior ARV exposure, individuals who were ethnic/racial minorities, reported an annual income &lt; $10,000/year, and were not employed were at significantly greater risk for HAART discontinuation. The median time to a first change in HAART regimen was approximately 1.5 years after first HAART report and was not elevated among those with a history of IDU (adj RH = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.89–1.34). Conclusion Our analyses demonstrate that injection drug use by itself does not appear to be an independent risk factor for HAART switching or discontinuation in more recent years. However, as continued HAART use is of paramount importance for long-term control of HIV infection, efforts to improve maintenance to therapy among disadvantaged and minority populations remain greatly needed.",

    "abstract": "Thus far gene therapy strategies for HIV/AIDS have used either conventional retroviral vectors or lentiviral vectors for gene transfer. Although highly efficient, their use poses a certain degree of risk in terms of viral mediated oncogenesis. Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system offers a non-viral method of gene transfer to avoid this possible risk. With respect to conferring HIV resistance, stable knock down of HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 by the use of lentiviral vector delivered siRNAs has proved to be a promising strategy to protect cells from HIV-1 infection. In the current studies our aim is to evaluate the utility of SB system for stable gene transfer of CCR5 and CXCR4 siRNA genes to derive HIV resistant cells as a first step towards using this system for gene therapy.Two well characterized siRNAs against the HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 were chosen based on their previous efficacy for the SB transposon gene delivery. The siRNA transgenes were incorporated individually into a modified SB transfer plasmid containing a FACS sortable red fluorescence protein (RFP) reporter and a drug selectable neomycin resistance gene. Gene transfer was achieved by co-delivery with a construct expressing a hyperactive transposase (HSB5) into the GHOST-R3/X4/R5 cell line, which expresses the major HIV receptor CD4 and and the co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. SB constructs expressing CCR5 or CXCR4 siRNAs were also transfected into MAGI-CCR5 or MAGI-CXCR4 cell lines, respectively. Near complete downregulation of CCR5 and CXCR4 surface expression was observed in transfected cells. During viral challenge with X4-tropic (NL4.3) or R5-tropic (BaL) HIV-1 strains, the respective transposed cells showed marked viral resistance.SB transposon system can be used to deliver siRNA genes for stable gene transfer. The siRNA genes against HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are able to downregulate the respective cell surface proteins and thus confer resistance against viral infection by restricting viral entry. These studies have demonstrated for the first time the utility of the non-viral SB system in conferring stable resistance against HIV infection and paved the way for the use of this system for HIV gene therapy studies.",

    "abstract": "Access to antiretroviral drugs for HIV-1 infection has increased in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) during the past few years. Mutations in the HIV-1 genome are often associated with treatment failure as indicated by viral replication and elevated levels of virus in the blood. Mutations conferring resistance to antiretroviral drugs are based on comparing gene sequences with corresponding consensus sequences of HIV-1 subtype B that represents only 10% of the AIDS pandemic. The HIV pandemic in SSA is characterized by high viral genetic diversity. Before antiretroviral drugs become more widely available, it is important to characterize baseline naturally occurring genetic mutations and polymorphisms associated with antiretroviral drug resistance among circulating HIV-1 subtypes. The prevalence of mutations associated with antiretroviral drug resistance in protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions among antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected pregnant women was investigated in Bukoba (Kagera) and Moshi (Kilimanjaro) municipalities, Tanzania, between September and December 2005. The HIV-1 pol gene was amplified using primers recognizing conserved viral sequences and sequenced employing BigDye chemistry from 100 HIV-1 seropositive treatment-naïve pregnant women and 61 HIV-1 seropositive women who had received a single dose of Nevirapine (sdNVP). Positions 1–350 of the RT and 1–99 of the PR genes were analyzed for mutations based on the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database. HIV-1 subtypes A, C, D, CRF10_CD and Unique Recombinant Forms (URF) were detected. Primary mutations associated with NRTI and NNRTI resistance were detected among 3% and 4% of treatment-naïve strains, respectively. Primary mutations associated with NRTI and NNRTI resistance were detected in 1.6% and 11.5% of women who had received sdNVP, respectively. None of the primary mutations associated with PI resistance was found. Polymorphisms detected in RT and PR sequences were mainly mutations that are found in the consensus sequences of non-B subtypes Based on the WHO HIV Drug Resistance Research Network Threshold of less than 5%, the baseline prevalence of primary mutations among treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected pregnant women in Kagera and Kilimanjaro regions was low. The significance of HIV-1 subtype B polymorphic positions with respect to antiretroviral resistance identified among the prevalent HIV-1 subtypes is unknown. More studies addressing the correlation between polymorphic mutations, antiretroviral resistance and clinical outcome are warranted in regions where non-B subtypes are prevalent.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The population of HIV replicating within a host consists of independently evolving and interacting sub-populations that can be genetically distinct within anatomical compartments. HIV replicating within the brain causes neurocognitive disorders in up to 20-30% of infected individuals and is a viral sanctuary site for the development of drug resistance. The primary determinant of HIV neurotropism is macrophage tropism, which is primarily determined by the viral envelope ( env ) gene. However, studies of genetic aspects of HIV replicating in the brain are hindered because existing repositories of HIV sequences are not focused on neurotropic virus nor annotated with neurocognitive and neuropathological status. To address this need, we constructed the HIV Brain Sequence Database. Results The HIV Brain Sequence Database is a public database of HIV envelope sequences, directly sequenced from brain and other tissues from the same patients. Sequences are annotated with clinical data including viral load, CD4 count, antiretroviral status, neurocognitive impairment, and neuropathological diagnosis, all curated from the original publication. Tissue source is coded using an anatomical ontology, the Foundational Model of Anatomy, to capture the maximum level of detail available, while maintaining ontological relationships between tissues and their subparts. 44 tissue types are represented within the database, grouped into 4 categories: (i) brain, brainstem, and spinal cord; (ii) meninges, choroid plexus, and CSF; (iii) blood and lymphoid; and (iv) other (bone marrow, colon, lung, liver, etc). Patient coding is correlated across studies, allowing sequences from the same patient to be grouped to increase statistical power. Using Cytoscape, we visualized relationships between studies, patients and sequences, illustrating interconnections between studies and the varying depth of sequencing, patient number, and tissue representation across studies. Currently, the database contains 2517 envelope sequences from 90 patients, obtained from 22 published studies. 1272 sequences are from brain; the remaining 1245 are from blood, lymph node, spleen, bone marrow, colon, lung and other non-brain tissues. The database interface utilizes a faceted interface, allowing real-time combination of multiple search parameters to assemble a meta-dataset, which can be downloaded for further analysis. Conclusions This online resource, which is publicly available at http://www.HIVBrainSeqDB.org , will greatly facilitate analysis of the genetic aspects of HIV macrophage tropism, HIV compartmentalization and evolution within the brain and other tissue reservoirs, and the relationship of these findings to HIV-associated neurological disorders and other clinical consequences of HIV infection.",

Several candidate vaccines against HIV-1 aim at stimulating cellular immune responses, either alone or together with the induction of neutralizing antibodies, and assays able to measure CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses need to be implemented. At present, the IFN-gamma-based ELISPOT assay is considered the gold standard and it is broadly preferred as primary assay for detection of antigen-specific T-cell responses in vaccine trials. However, in spite of its high sensitivity, the measurement of the sole IFN-gamma production provides limited information on the quality of the immune response. On the other hand, the introduction of polychromatic flow-cytometry-based assays such as the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) strongly improved the capacity to detect several markers on a single cell level.The cumulative analysis of 275 samples from 31 different HIV-1 infected individuals using an ICS staining procedure optimized by our laboratories revealed that, following antigenic stimulation, IFN-gamma producing T-cells were also producing MIP-1beta whereas T-cells characterized by the sole production of IFN-gamma were rare. Since the analysis of the combination of two functions decreases the background and the measurement of the IFN-gamma+ MIP-1beta+ T-cells was equivalent to the measurement of the total IFN-gamma+ T-cells, we adopted the IFN-gamma+ MIP-1beta+ data analysis system to evaluate IFN-gamma-based, antigen-specific T-cell responses. Comparison of our ICS assay with ELISPOT assays performed in two different experienced laboratories demonstrated that the IFN-gamma+ MIP-1beta+ data analysis system increased the sensitivity of the ICS up to levels comparable to the sensitivity of the ELISPOT assay.The IFN-gamma+ MIP-1beta+ data evaluation system provides a clear advantage for the detection of low magnitude HIV-1-specific responses. These results are important to guide the choice for suitable highly sensitive immune assays and to build reagent panels able to accurately characterize the phenotype and function of responding T-cells. More importantly, the ICS assay can be used as primary assay to evaluate HIV-1-specific responses without losing sensitivity in comparison to the ELISPOT assay.",

Whether HIV-KS is a true malignancy or a reactive hyperplastic inflammatory condition is debatable. Oedema of the face, legs and hands is a prominent feature of HIV-KS and is probably caused by lymphoedema related to the HIV-KS lesions. The cases of two HIV-seropositive subjects with KS-associated facial lymphoedema are reported. Extensive oral HIV-KS in association with facial oedema in the absence of anti-retroviral treatment appears to be an indication of a poor prognosis.",

The ACTION study was a randomized, open-label, multicenter, 48-week trial that compared the safety and efficacy of a triple nucleoside regimen versus a protease inhibitor plus a dual nucleoside regimen in HIV-1 treatment-naïve subjects.279 HIV-infected subjects with HIV-1 RNA (VL) >5000 but < 200,000 copies/mL (c/mL) and CD4+ count >/= 100 cells/mm3 were randomized (1:1) to receive abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine (ABC/3TC/ZDV) twice-daily or atazanavir (ATV) once-daily plus lamivudine/zidovudine (3TC/ZDV) twice-daily.

We aimed to investigate RC-101 stability under several conditions including the presence of human vaginal fluids (HVF), enabling the efficient design of a safe and effective microbicide product. Stability studies (temperature, pH, and oxidation) were performed by HPLC, Circular Dichroism, and Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Additionally, the effect of HVF on formulated RC-101 was evaluated with fluids collected from healthy volunteers, or from subjects with bacterial vaginosis (BV). RC-101 was monitored by LC-MS/MS for up to 72 h.RC-101 was stable at pH 3, 4, and 7, at 25 and 37°C. High concentrations of hydrogen peroxide resulted in less than 10% RC-101 reduction over 24 h. RC-101 was detected 48 h after incubation with normal HVF; however, not following incubation with HVF from BV subjects.Our results emphasize the importance of preformulation evaluations and highlight the impact of HVF on microbicide product stability and efficacy. RC-101 was stable in normal HVF for at least 48 h, indicating that it is a promising candidate for microbicide product development. However, RC-101 stability appears compromised in individuals with BV, requiring more advanced formulation strategies for stabilization in this environment.",

Body composition by body impedance analysis, CD4 count, and fasting serum total cholesterol (total-C), triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were measured. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was calculated from Friedewald equation if TG < 400 and measured directly if TG ≥ 400 mg/dl.

HIV serostatus (p = 0.005) and among HIV+ women lower CD4 count (p = 0.04) were associated with higher TG. BMI was independently associated with higher LDL (p = 0.01), and higher total body fat was strongly associated with higher total-C and LDL. Framingham risk scores were < 2% in both groups. In this cohort of non-obese African women HDL and TG, but not LDL, were adversely associated with HIV infection. As HDL is a strong predictor of cardiovascular (CV) events in women, this HIV-associated difference may confer increased risk for CV disease in HIV-infected women.",

The HIV infected individuals have more viruses in blood than saliva, possibly due to the potent HIV-inhibitory properties of saliva. The case presented here is of a primary HIV infections following a human bite where in the saliva was not blood stained but it got smeared on a raw nail bed of a recipient. The blood and saliva of the source and blood of the recipient showed a detectable viral load with 91% sequence homology of C2-V3 region of HIV gp120 between the two individuals. The recipient did not receive PEP [post exposure prophylaxis] as his family physician was unaware of salivary transmission. The family physician should have taken PEP decision after proper evaluation of the severe and bleeding bite. Hence it is necessary to treat the HIV infected human bites with post exposure prophylaxis.",

We describe these events and their associated factors in children with AIDS in Brazil.This study is based on two representative retrospective multi-center cohorts including a total 1,859 children with AIDS, infected via mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), between 1983-2002. Opportunistic illnesses were described and analyzed over time. The association of demographic, clinical and operational data with the occurrence of opportunistic diseases was assessed.In total, 1,218 (65.5%) had at least one event of an opportunistic disease. Variables significantly associated with occurrence of these events included: region of residence (OR 2.68-11.33, as compared to the Northern region), age < 1 year at diagnosis (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.81-3.61, p < 0.001), and non-performance of MTCT prevention measures (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.21-2.07, p < 0.001). Protective factors included year of HIV diagnosis in the HAART era (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15-0.76, p = 0.009) and ART use (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.77, p < 0.001).

The data reinforce the need for scaling up prevention of MTCT, early diagnosis of infection, and improvement of comprehensive pediatric care.",

ART-naïve HIV patients [n = 67; aged 31 (19 to 48) years] were enrolled in the JakCCANDO Project. Echocardiography and carotid Doppler ultrasonography were performed before ART (V0) and after 3, 6, and 12 months (V3–12). Antibodies reactive with CMV lysate or IE-1 protein were assessed at each timepoint and CMV DNA was identified at V0. Markers of adverse cardiovascular prognosis [left ventricular mass index, ejection fraction and carotid intimal media thickness (cIMT)] were similar to healthy controls, but increased at V12. Internal diameters of the carotid arteries and systolic blood pressure correlated with HIV disease severity at V0, but cardiac parameters and cIMT did not. E/A ratios (left ventricular diastolic function) were lower in patients with CMV DNA at V0, but this effect waned by V6. Levels of antibody reactive with CMV IE-1 correlated inversely with CD4 T cell counts at V0, and levels at V6–V12 correlated directly with the right cIMT. Overall the severity of HIV disease and the response to ART have only subtle effects on cardiovascular health in this young Asian population. CMV replication before ART may have a transient effect on cardiac health, whilst antibody reactive with CMV IE-1 may mark a high persistent CMV burden with cumulative effects on the carotid artery.",

    "abstract": "For patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), treatment interruptions can impact patient outcomes and result in the accumulation of drug resistance mutations leading to virologic failure. There are minimal published data on the impact of an ART stock shortage on development of drug resistance mutations (DRMs). In this report, we evaluate data from patients enrolled in the Government of Nigeria National ART Program that were receiving treatment at the time of a national drug shortage in late 2003. We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of samples collected between December 2004 and August 2005 from ART patients in virologic failure that either had a treatment interruption or did not during the late 2003 drug shortage period at the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH). Plasma virus was genotyped, sequence data were edited and analyzed, and mutation profiles were categorized to evaluate predicted drug susceptibility. Data were analyzed to examine factors associated with development of resistance mutations. A genotypic sensitivity score to the alternate recommended regimen was computed to assess drug susceptibility if regimens were changed. A total of 56 patients were included in this evaluation (28 interrupted, 28 uninterrupted). Patients in the interrupted group had more DRMs than those in the uninterrupted group (p < 0.001); interrupted patients were more likely than uninterrupted patients to have one or more TAM-2 mutations (57.1% interrupted vs. 21.3% uninterrupted; p = 0.04). There was a statistically significant difference in resistance to both d4T (53.7% interrupted vs. 17.9 uninterrupted; p = 0.011) and AZT (64.3% interrupted vs. 25.0% uninterrupted; p = 0.003) by drug interruption status. Examining genotypic sensitivity scores, we found that 67.9% of the interrupted patients, as compared to 25.0% of the uninterrupted patients, did not have full susceptibility to one drug in the regimen to which guidelines recommended they be switched (p = 0.001). In this small observational study, we found evidence of a difference in resistance profiles and ART susceptibility between those that were stocked-out of drug versus those that were not. We believe that these data are relevant for many other low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) that also experienced similar ART shortages as they rapidly scaled up their national programs.",

    "abstract": "Highly effective antiviral treatment can suppress HIV-1 infection, but the chronic effects of HIV-1-related viral proteins, including gp120 and Tat, on organs such as the lungs can be damaging. HIV-1 transgenic rodent models are useful for studying the systemic effects of these proteins independently of viral infection. We have previously shown that HIV-1 transgene expression (and therefore, HIV-1-related protein expression) in rats decreases alveolar macrophage zinc levels and phagocytic capacity by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesized that HIV-1 transgene expression induces chronic inflammation and zinc sequestration within the liver and thereby decreases zinc bioavailability in the lung. We examined the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), the zinc storage protein, metallothionein (MT1), and the zinc exporter, ZNT1 in the livers and the lungs of wild type and HIV-1 transgenic rats ± dietary zinc supplementation. In addition, we measured zinc levels, the zinc importing protein ZIP1, and the phagocytic capacity in the alveolar macrophages.HIV-1 transgene expression increased the liver-specific expression of TNFα, suggesting a chronic inflammatory response within the liver in response to HIV-1-related protein expression. In parallel, HIV-1 transgene expression significantly increased MT1 and ZNT1 expression in the liver as compared to the lung, a pattern that is consistent with zinc sequestration in the liver as occurs during systemic inflammation. Further, HIV-1 transgene expression decreased intracellular zinc levels and increased expression of ZIP1 in the alveolar macrophages, a pattern consistent with zinc deficiency, and decreased their bacterial phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, dietary zinc supplementation in HIV-1 transgenic rats decreased gene expression of TNFα, MT1, and ZNT1 in the liver while simultaneously increasing their expression in the lung. In parallel, zinc supplementation increased alveolar macrophage intracellular zinc levels and bacterial phagocytic capacity in HIV-1 transgenic rats.Taken together, these findings suggest that chronic HIV-1-related protein expression causes liver inflammation and zinc sequestration, which in turn limits zinc bioavailability in the lung and thereby impairs alveolar macrophage phagocytic function. Importantly, dietary zinc supplementation decreases liver inflammation and zinc sequestration and restores alveolar macrophage phagocytic function in HIV-1 transgenic rats, a result with potential clinical implications for improving lung health in HIV-1-infected individuals.",

We undertook this study in a tertiary HIV care centre to document the risk factors for colonization and to determine the prevalence of MRSA colonization among HIV-positive outpatients in Singapore.This was a cross-sectional study in which factors associated with MRSA positivity among patients with HIV infection were evaluated. A set of standardized questionnaire and data collection forms were available to interview all recruited patients. Following the interview, trained nurses collected swabs from the anterior nares/axilla/groin (NAG), throat and peri-anal regions. Information on demographics, clinical history, laboratory results and hospitalization history were retrieved from medical records.MRSA was detected in swab cultures from at least 1 site in 15 patients (5.1%). Inclusion of throat and/or peri-anal swabs increased the sensitivity of NAG screening by 20%. Predictors for MRSA colonization among HIV-positive patients were age, history of pneumonia, lymphoma, presence of a percutaneous device within the past 12 months, history of household members hospitalized more than two times within the past 12 months, and a most recent CD4 count less than 200.This study highlights that a proportion of MRSA carriers would have been undetected without multiple-site screening cultures. This study could shed insight into identifying patients at risk of MRSA colonization upon hospital visit and this may suggest that a risk factor-based approach for MRSA surveillance focusing on high risk populations could be considered.",

    "abstract": "Despite the conventional approaches to HIV prevention being the bedrock for early reductions in HIV infections in Uganda, innovations that demonstrate reduction in risk to infection in vulnerable populations need to be embraced urgently. In the past 2 years, a USAID-funded project tested a quality improvement for behavior change model (QBC) to address barriers to behavioral change among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) at high risk of HIV infection. The model comprised skills building to improve ability of AGYW to stop risky behavior; setting up and empowering community quality improvement (QI) teams to mobilize community resources to support AGYW to stop risky behavior; and service delivery camps to provide HIV prevention services and commodities to AGYW and other community members. We recruited and followed a cohort of 409 AGYW at high risk of HIV infection over a 2-year period to examine the effect of the QBC model on risky behaviors. High-risk behavior was defined to include transactional sex, having multiple sexual partners, and non-use of condoms in high-risk sex. We documented unique experiences over the period to assess the effect of QBC model in reducing risky behavior. We analyzed for variances in risk factors over time using repeated measures ANOVA. There were statistically significant declines in high-risk behavior among AGYW over the QBC roll-out period (p < 0.05). Univariate analysis indicated reduction in AGYW reporting multiple sexual partners from 16.6% at baseline to 3.2% at follow up and transactional sex from 13.2 to 3.6%. The proportion of AGYW experiencing sexual and other forms of gender based violence reduced from 49% a baseline to 19.5% at follow up due to the complementary targeting of parents and partners by QI teams. The QBC model is appropriate for the context of northern Uganda because it provides a framework for the community to successfully drive HIV prevention efforts and therefore is recommended as a model for HIV prevention in high-risk groups.",

    "abstract": "Studies relating to long-term virological outcomes among children on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) from low and middle-income countries are limited. Perinatally HIV infected, ART-naive children, between 2 and 12 years of age, initiating NNRTI-based ART during 2010–2015, with at least 12 months of follow-up, were included in the analysis. CD4 cell counts and plasma HIV-1 RNA were measured every 24 weeks post-ART initiation. Immunologic failure was defined as a decrease in the CD4 count to pre-therapy levels or below and virologic failure as HIV-RNA of > 1000 copies/ml at 48 weeks after ART initiation. Genotypic resistance testing was performed for children with virologic failure. Logistic regression analysis was done to identify predictors of virologic failure. Three hundred and ninety-three ART-naïve children living with HIV [mean (SD) age: 7.6 (3) years; mean (SD) CD4%: 16% (8); median (IQR) HIV-RNA: 5.1 (3.5–5.7) log10 copies/ml] were enrolled into the study. At 48 weeks, significant improvement occurred in weight-for-age and height-for-age z-scores from baseline (all p < 0.001). The immunologic response was good; almost 90% of children showing an increase in their absolute CD4+ T cell count to more than 350 cells/mm3. Immunological failure was noted among 11% (28/261) and virologic failure in 29% (94/328) of children. Of the 94 children with virologic failure at 12 months, 36 children showed immunologic failure while the rest had good immunologic improvement. There was no demonstrable correlation between virologic and immunologic failure. 62% had reported > 90% adherence to ART. At the time of virologic failure, multiple NNRTI-associated mutations were observed: 80%—K103N and Y181C being the major NNRTI mutations—observed. Sensitivity (95% CI) of immunologic failure to detect virologic failure was 7% (2–12), specificity 97% (92.4–98.9), PPV 44% (13.7–78.8) and NPV was 72% (65–77.9). There were no statistically significant predictors to detect children who will develop virologic failure on treatment. Considerable immunological improvement is seen in children with ART initiation, but may not be an effective tool to monitor treatment response in the long-term. There is a lack of correlation between immunologic and virologic response while on ART, which may lead to a delay in identifying treatment failures. Periodic viral load monitoring is, therefore, a priority.",

Patients were randomized into an immediate therapy arm (starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 7 days after initiation of OI treatment) versus a deferred arm (starting ART after completing the OI-therapy). All patients were followed for 24 weeks. The rates of clinical progression (death, new or relapsing opportunistic infections (OI) and other grade 4 clinical endpoints) were compared, using a combined primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were hospitalization rates after completion of OI treatment, incidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), virologic and immunological outcome, adherence to proteinase-inhibitor based antiretroviral therapy (ART) protocol and quality of life.61 patients (11 patients suffering TE, 50 with PCP) were enrolled. No differences between the two therapy groups in all examined primary and secondary endpoints could be identified: immunological and virologic outcome was similar in both groups, there was no significant difference in the incidence of IRIS (11 and 10 cases), furthermore 9 events (combined endpoint of death, new/relapsing OI and grade 4 events) occurred in each group.In summary, this study supports the notion that immediate initiation of ART with a ritonavir-boosted proteinase-inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is safe and has no negative effects on incidence of disease progression or IRIS, nor on immunological and virologic outcomes or on quality of life.",

    "abstract": "While Brazil has had a long-standing policy of free access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all in need, the epidemiological impact of ART on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA suppression in this middle-income country has not been well evaluated. We estimate first-line ART effectiveness in a large Brazilian cohort and examine the socio-demographic, behavioral, clinical and structural factors associated with virologic suppression.Virologic suppression on first-line ART at 6, 12, and 24 months from start of ART was defined as having a viral load measurement ≤400 copies/mL without drug class modification and/or discontinuation. Drug class modification and/or discontinuation were defined based on the class of a particular drug. Quasi-Poisson regression was used to quantify the association of factors with virologic suppression.From January 2000 through June 2010, 1311 patients started first-line ART; 987 (75%) patients used NNRTI-based regimens. Virologic suppression was achieved by 77%, 76% and 68% of patients at 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Factors associated with virologic suppression at 12 months were: >8 years of formal education (compared to <4 years, risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.03-1.24), starting ART in 2005-2010 (compared to 2000-2004, RR 1.25 95% CI 1.15-1.35), and clinical trial participation (compared to no participation, RR 1.08 95% CI 1.01-1.16). Also at 12 months, women showed less virologic suppression compared to heterosexual men (RR 0.90 95% CI 0.82-0.99). For the 24-month endpoint, in addition to higher education, starting ART in the later period, and clinical trial participation, older age and an NNRTI-based regimen were also independently associated with virologic suppression.Our results show that in Brazil, a middle-income country with free access to treatment, over three-quarters of patients receiving routine care reached virologic suppression on first-line ART by the end of the first year. Higher education, more recent ART initiation and clinical trial participation were associated with improved outcomes both for the 12-month and the 24-month endpoints, suggesting that further studies are needed to understand what aspects relating to these factors lead to higher virologic suppression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In many countries in Asia, the HIV epidemic is in a concentrated phase, with high prevalence in certain risk groups, such as men who inject drugs. There is also a rapid increase of HIV among women. The latter might be due to high levels of sero-discordant couples and increasing transmission from male to female partners over time. Methods All adult married patients initiating antiretroviral treatment at four out-patient clinics in Quang Ninh province in north-eastern Vietnam between 2007 and 2009 were asked to participate in the study. Clinical information was extracted from patients’ records, and a structured questionnaire was used to collect social, demographic and economic data. Results Two hundred eighty-eight married patients for whom information on the HIV status of their spouse was available were included in the study. Overall, the sero-discordance rate was 58%. The sero-discordance rate was significantly higher among married males, 71% had spouses not infected, than married females, of whom 18% had spouses not infected. Other factors associated with a high rate of sero-discordance were injection drug use (IDU) history, tuberculosis (TB) history and the availability of voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) in residential locations. High sero-concordance was associated with college/university education. Conclusion The sero-discordance was significantly higher among married males than married females. Other factors also related to high sero-discordance were history of IDU, history of TB and the availability of VCT in residential locations. In contrast, college/university education and female sex were significantly related to low sero-discordance. To contain the increasing HIV prevalence among women, measures should be taken to prevent transmission among sero-discordant couples. Trial registration NCT01433601",

    "abstract": "Tenofovir (TDF) based regimen was reported to have better immunological outcomes. Unfortunately, there is limited information regarding the immunologic outcome associated with this regimen in Ethiopia, as its routine utilization in this setting begun since 2013.A 2 years retrospective cohort study was conducted at Jimma University Specialized Hospital, 346 km Southwest of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A total of 280 patients' data from September 2012 to July 2014 was extracted from records from February 10, 2015 to March 10, 2015. Records were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data on socio-demographic, clinical and drug related variables were collected; entered into EpiData 3.1 and analyzed by STATA 13.1. Mixed effect linear regression was performed to assess difference in CD4+ change between groups adjusting for baseline characteristics. The change in predicted CD4 count attributed to each regimen was also assessed by marginal analysis. P < 0.05 for slopes of the random effect linear regression was used as indicators for presence of association.The mean (SD) duration of cohort follow up was 714.2 (69.6) and 708.8 (78.9) days (P = 0.753) for TDF and AZT groups respectively. The minimum follow up duration was 7.4 and 8.9 months for TDF and AZT groups respectively. Most of TDF (93.6%) and AZT (91.4%) groups completed their follow up, 5 (3.6%) TDF and 6 (4.3%) AZT groups died and 4 (2.9%) TDF and 6 (4.3%) AZT groups were lost for follow-up (P = 0.769). There was statistically significant difference in immunologic recovery between the groups (B = +34.08, 95% CI [7.8, 60.35], P = 0.027) over time. The predicted CD4+ count for TDF/3TC/EFV was (B = +347.65 cells/mm3, P < 0.001) whereas that of AZT/3TC/EFV was (B = +281.54 cells/mm3, P < 0.001).TDF based regimens have shown more efficacy compared to AZT based regimens though AZT based regimens are more affordable in low income countries like Ethiopia. However, we recommend further study with quality design to assess the prevalence of sub-optimal CD4+ response (net CD4 gain <50 cells/µl/6 month) in this set-up among TDF users.",

    "abstract": "Extramarital sex is a potential driver of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission for long-term couples in sub-Saharan Africa. It is increasingly recognized that preventing sexual risk behaviours requires an understanding and adjustment of sexual relationship factors beyond the individual level. We investigated the association between extramarital affairs and HIV status, factors associated with extramarital affairs, and created insights in the context and pathways for married men and women in rural Tanzania who engage in extramarital affairs. A cross-sectional sequential explanatory mixed method design was employed. The WHO-Social determinants of health perspective guided the study. Using logistic regression, we analysed the MZIMA project community surveillance representative sample of 3884 married partners aged 15+ residing in Ifakara town, Tanzania (2012–2013). Multinomial logistic regression analysis established the relative risk ratio (RRR) of different social and economic factors with lifetime (proxy) and recent (12 months prior to survey) extramarital affairs. Logistic regression analysis determined the association between extramarital affairs and HIV status. Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions explored the quantitative findings, capturing the experiences and norms regarding extramarital affairs. We found a significant association between lifetime (proxy) extramarital affairs and HIV infection among women only. The RRR of having extramarital affairs (lifetime proxy) was significantly higher among Village Community Bank (VICOBA) members, the re-married, consumers of alcohol, those from southern regions, non-Muslims, and those with older age. In the case of recent extramarital affairs (12 months prior to survey), associations were significant for the same variables except for religion, having an income was also associated with the outcome. Qualitative narratives reflected that, desire to prove manhood (masculinity) supported by societal normative beliefs such as; ‘it is not realistic for a man to stay without extramarital partner’ and religious beliefs; ‘a man shall dominate a woman’ encouraged men’s extramarital affairs. For women, striving for financial autonomy, obligations to pay back debts borrowed from several VICOBA, and limited support from their husbands encouraged their engagement in extramarital affairs. Low relationship quality (conflict and sexual dissatisfaction) were reported to encourage both men and women’s extramarital affairs. The findings show that the link between extramarital affairs and HIV has a gender dimension in which women are more likely to acquire HIV through extramarital affairs (case of recent extramarital affairs (12 months prior to survey). Future programs seeking to address risk sexual behaviors in Tanzanian marriages can consider context-sensitive interventions which address aspects beyond ‘individual risk’ and women’s financial uncertainties, and include couple’s relationship quality, excessive alcohol behaviors, normative masculinity ideology and societal norms, that encourage women’s economic dependence and men’s engagement in multiple sexual partnerships. Microfinance projects (e.g. VICOBA) could be a platform for gender-transformative approaches, combining economic empowerment and HIV risk protection strategies.",

    "abstract": "The South African public health system plays an important role in the delivery of HIV testing and treatment services. The health system is also an important conduit for targeted behaviour change communication with the expectation that clients who undergo counselling from health personnel, adopt safer sexual practices. Literature remains mixed on the impact these HIV services have on risky sexual behaviour. This analysis examines the sexual behaviour of clients following the utilisation of HIV testing and treatment services in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa.Data were used from two consecutive cross-sectional household surveys undertaken from June 2014 to June 2015 (2014/2015 survey) and from July 2015 to June 2016 (2015/2016 survey) in the uMgungundlovu District of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Collectively, 20,048 randomly selected individuals aged 15 to 49 years old were interviewed across the two surveys. Utilisation of HIV testing and treatment services were used as independent variables and three sexual risk behaviours were used as dependent variables. Multiple regression models assessed the impact HIV testing and treatment services had on sexual risk behaviour while controlling for socio-demographic characteristics.Having tested for HIV had no association with any of the three sexual risk behaviours. However, receiving an HIV positive diagnosis reduced the likelihood of using condoms inconsistently with the respondents' most recent partner (AOR: 0.64; 95% CI 0.54-0.77). Antiretroviral use was negatively associated with inconsistent condom use (AOR: 0.45; 95% CI 0.35-0.58) and number of sexual partners in the previous year (AOR: 0.61; 95% CI 0.46-0.81).Results indicate that HIV testing and treatment services and the assumed exposure of clients to behaviour change communication, had a limited effect in reducing risky sexual behaviour. Data suggests that the engagement between health personnel and individuals accessing HIV testing and treatment services does not necessarily translate into the adoption of safer sexual practices, with the exception of individuals testing positive for HIV and those on ARV treatment, who had adopted safer sexual practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Increased intestinal barrier permeability and subsequent gut microbial translocation are significant contributors to inflammatory non-AIDS comorbidities in people living with HIV (PLWH). Evidence in animal models have shown that markers of intestinal permeability and microbial translocation vary over the course of the day and are affected by food intake and circadian rhythms. However, daily variations of these markers are not characterized yet in PLWH. Herein, we assessed the variation of these markers over 24 h in PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a well-controlled environment. Methods As in Canada, PLWH are predominantly men and the majority of them are now over 50 years old, we selected 11 men over 50 receiving ART with undetectable viremia for more than 3 years in this pilot study. Blood samples were collected every 4 h over 24 h before snacks/meals from 8:00 in the morning to 8:00 the next day. All participants consumed similar meals at set times, and had a comparable amount of sleep, physical exercise and light exposure. Plasma levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and fungal (1→3)-β-D-Glucan (BDG) translocation markers, along with markers of intestinal damage fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and regenerating islet-derived protein-3α (REG3α) were assessed by ELISA or the fungitell assay. Results Participants had a median age of 57 years old (range 50 to 63). Plasma levels of BDG and REG3α did not vary significantly over the course of the study. In contrast, a significant increase of LPS was detected between 12:00 and 16:00 (Z-score: − 1.15 ± 0.18 vs 0.16 ± 0.15, p = 0.02), and between 12:00 and 24:00 (− 1.15 ± 0.18 vs 0.89 ± 0.26, p &lt; 0.001). The plasma levels of I-FABP at 16:00 (− 0.92 ± 0.09) were also significantly lower, compared to 8:00 the first day (0.48 ± 0.26, p = 0.002), 4:00 (0.73 ± 0.27, p &lt; 0.001) or 8:00 on secondary day (0.88 ± 0.27, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Conversely to the fungal translocation marker BDG and the gut damage marker REG3α, time of blood collection matters for the proper evaluation for LPS and I-FABP as markers for the risk of inflammatory non-AIDS co-morbidities. These insights are instrumental for orienting clinical investigations in PLWH.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Early detection of viremia in HIV infected patients on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is important to prevent disease progression as well as accumulation of drug resistance mutations. This makes HIV viral load (VL) monitoring indispensable in HIV infected patients on ART. However VL, being an expensive test, results in heavy financial burden on health services. Hence, cheaper surrogate markers of viremia are desired to reduce overall cost of management of HIV infected patients. Methods We enrolled aviremic (n = 63, M:F = 31:32) and viremic (n = 43, M:F = 21:22) HIV infected patients at 1 year after ART initiation. Viremic individuals were identified as those having a plasma VL of more than 1000 copies/µl and aviremic individuals as less than 40 copies/µl. The study participants also included immuno-virologically discordant patients as they demonstrate differential degrees of immune-reconstitution and are likely to harbour concomitant infections influencing levels of immune-activation markers screened as the surrogate markers. Immune activation markers viz. plasma hs-CRP, soluble-CD14 and Galectin-9 levels were estimated by ELISA, IL-6 by luminex assay and percentages of CD38+ CD8+ cells were determined by flow cytometry. The levels were compared between viremic and aviremic patients and correlated with plasma viral load. Receiver operated curve (ROC) analysis was done for plasma Galectin-9 levels. Results Viremic patients had significantly higher levels of Galectin-9 and %CD38+ CD8+ cells (p values &lt; 0.0001) than aviremic patients. Levels of the other activation markers did not differ between viremic and aviremic individuals. Galectin-9 levels (r = 0.76) and %CD38+ CD8+ cells (r = 0.39) correlated positively with VL. Area under curve for Galectin-9 levels for distinguishing between viremic and aviremic individuals was 0.98. Youden index, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for Galectin-9 levels were 0.87, 0.97, 0.90, 0.87 and 0.98, respectively, at the cut-off value of 5.79 ng/ml. Conclusions Plasma Galectin-9 levels could identify viremic individuals with sensitivity and specificity of more than 90%. Thus, they showed a potential to serve as a surrogate marker of viremia in HIV infected patients on ART and would have cost implications on HIV management especially in resource-limited settings. However, the findings need to be confirmed in the patients on ART for different durations of time.",

Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were diagnosed with HIV at Open Arms Healthcare Center or were linked to the clinic for HIV care by the Mississippi State Department of Health Disease Intervention Specialists from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. Initial viral load, CD4+ T cell count, issuance of an electronic prescription (e-script), subsequent viral loads until suppressed and patient demographics were collected for each individual seen in clinic during the review period. Viral suppression was defined as a viral load less than 200 copies/mL. Rapid ART initiation was defined as receiving an e-script for antiretrovirals within seven days of diagnosis. Results Between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018, 70 individuals were diagnosed with HIV and presented to Open Arms Healthcare Center, of which 63 (90%) completed an initial HIV counseling visit. Twenty-seven percent of patients were provided with an e-script for ART within 7 days of diagnosis. The median time to linkage to care for this sample was 12 days and 5.5 days for rapid ART starters (p &lt; 0.001). Median time from diagnosis to viral suppression was 55 days for rapid ART starters (p = 0.03), a 22 day decrease from standard time to viral suppression. Conclusion Our results provide a similar level of evidence that rapid ART initiation is effective in decreasing time to viral suppression. Evidence from this evaluation supports the use of rapid ART initiation after an initial HIV diagnosis, including same-day treatment.",

The impact of Tb co-infection in the establishment and maintenance of the HIV reservoir is unclear. Method We enrolled 13 HIV-infected patients with microbiologically confirmed Tb and 10 matched mono-HIV infected controls. Total HIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma interleukin-7 (IL-7) concentrations and the activities of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) were measured for all the participants prior to therapy and after antiretroviral therapy (ART). Results After a duration of 16 (12, 22) months’ ART, patients co-infected with Tb who were cured of Tb maintained higher levels of HIV DNA compared with mono-HIV infected patients [2.89 (2.65- 3.05) log 10 copies/10 6 cells vs. 2.30 (2.11–2.84) log 10 copies/10 6 cells, P = 0.008]. The levels of on-ART HIV DNA were positively correlated with the baseline viral load ( r = 0.64, P = 0.02) in Tb co-infected group. However, neither plasma IL-7 concentration nor plasma IDO activity was correlated with the level of on-ART HIV DNA. Conclusions Tb co-infection was associated with the increased surrogate marker of the HIV reservoir, while its mechanism warrants further examination.",

In a cross-sectional study of HIV-Positive adults on ART, at enrolment into a prospective cohort to study the long-term complications of ART in Uganda, information on biophysical measurements, medical history, clinical examination and renal function tests (RFTs) was collected. Fractional Tubular phosphate reabsorption and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were calculated.

Durations of TDF exposure were also compared. Between July 2013 and October 2014, we enrolled 953 individuals on ART for 6 or more months, median duration on ART was 9.3 years, 385 (40.4 %) were on non-TDF and 568 (59.6 %) on TDF-ART regimens. The proportion of participants with Proteinuria (>30 mg/dl) was higher among the TDF-ART group than the non-TDF ART group. However, in multivariable analysis, there were no significant differences in the adjusted mean differences of eGFR, serum urea, serum creatinine, fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate and serum phosphates when patients on TDF-ART were compared with those on non-TDF containing ART. There were no differences in renal function even when different durations on Tenofovir were compared. We found no differences in renal function among patients on Tenofovir and non-Tenofovir containing ART for almost a decade. Tenofovir based first line ART can therefore safely be initiated even in settings without routine renal function monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Resistance to antiretroviral drugs is a major challenge among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Mutations that arise as a result of this are diverse across the various drugs, drug classes, drug regimens and subtypes. In Uganda, there is a paucity of information on how these mutations differ among the different drug regimens and the predominant HIV-1 subtypes. The purpose of this study was to determine mutation profile differences between first-line drug regimens: TDF/3TC/EFV and AZT/3TC/EFV and HIV-1 subtypes: A and D in Uganda. The study also investigated the potential usage of rilpivirine, doravirine and etravirine in patients who failed treatment on efavirenz. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 182 archived plasma samples obtained from patients who were experiencing virological failure between 2006 and 2017 at five Joint Clinical Research Center (JCRC) sites in Uganda. Sanger sequencing of the Reverse Transcriptase (RT) gene from codons 1–300 was done. Mutation scores were generated using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database. A Chi-square test was used to determine the association between drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and drug regimens or HIV-1 subtypes. Results The prevalence of DRMs was 84.6% among patients failing a first-line efavirenz (EFV)-based regimen. The most prevalent Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI) mutations were M184V/I (67.3%), K219/Q/E (22.6%) and K65R (21.1%). While K103N (50.8%) and G190A/S/E/G (29.1%) were the most prevalent Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNTRI) mutations. As expected, discriminatory DRMs such as K65R, L74I, and Y115F were noted in Tenofovir (TDF) containing regimens while the Thymidine Analogue Mutations (TAMs) L210W and T215 mutations were in Zidovudine (AZT)-based regimens. No significant difference (p = 0.336) was found for overall DRMs between HIV-1 subtypes A and D. Among the patients who had resistance to EFV, 37 (23.6%) were susceptible to newer NNRTIs such as Rilpivirine and Etravirine. Conclusion Accumulation of DRMs between AZT/3TC/EFV and TDF/3TC/EFV is comparable but individual mutations that confer resistance to particular drugs should be considered at virological failure. Having either HIV-1 subtype A or D is not associated with the acquisition of DRMs, therefore HIV diversity should not determine the choice of treatment. Rilpivirine, etravirine and doravirine had minimal benefits for patients who failed on efavirenz.",

Eight experts collaborated in the design of the semi-structured interview guide which explored the following topics: illicit drug use, knowledge and beliefs about DDIs and their impact on ART adherence, the effects of using illicit drugs on health, QoL, and use of health-care resources. Four of those experts, who were PLHIV and members of the executive boards of non-government organizations (NGOs) from four Spanish regions, recruited the participants through their NGOs and carried out the face-to-face interviews. Content analysis of the qualitative data was conducted with the support of the MAXQDA 12 program.Participants were mainly men (85.7%) and only 14.3% of them were heterosexual. Content analysis showed that the most frequently consumed illicit drugs were poppers, cocaine, and cannabis. Participants were polydrug users and this was, in many cases, prior to HIV diagnosis. Most participants presented theoretical potential moderate DDIs that would require monitoring. More than three quarters of them were not aware of these DDIs. Participants reported interactive toxicity beliefs that lead to intentional nonadherence behaviors. In most cases (n = 17), the participant's doctor knew about their drug use, however only six of them had had an open dialogue with their physician about it. Illicit drug use led to some health-related problems, mainly sexually transmitted infections. A positive QoL's self-perception was found among several participants that used recreational illicit drugs.Adequate information about DDIs and clues about how to manage ART when PLHIV are using illicit drugs could reduce the negative effects of such interactions and improve ART adherence and QoL.",

All 10 patients were promptly treated with antifungal treatment for a prolonged duration and early antiviral therapy (ART). Among them, seven patients were farmers. Nine patients were discharged after full recovery, while one patient died during hospitalization, resulting in a mortality rate of 10%. All patients initially presented symptoms and signs of an increase in intracranial pressure, mainly manifesting as headache, dizziness, vomiting, fever, decreased muscle strength, diplopia or even altered consciousness with seizures in severe patients. Nine patients (90%) showed lateral ventricle dilatation or intracranial infectious lesions on brain CT. Cerebrospinal fluid findings included elevated intracranial pressure, increased leukocyte count, low glucose, low chloride and high cerebrospinal fluid protein. The median CD4+ T count of patients was 104 cells/μL (IQR, 36-224 cells/μL) at the onset of the disease. The CD4+ T cell counts of three patients who eventually died were significantly lower (W = 6.00, p = 0.020) than those of the patients who survived.The common clinical symptoms of T. marneffei central nervous system infection are associated with high intracranial pressure and intracranial infectious lesions. Earlier recognition and diagnosis and a prolonged course of amphotericin B treatment followed by itraconazole combined with early ART might reduce the mortality rate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection constitute a deadly infectious disease synergy disease and major public health problem throughout the world. The risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV) is 21 times higher than the rest of the world population. The overlap of latent TB infection and HIV infection has resulted in marked increases in TB incidence in countries with dual epidemics. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the single most significant way to reduce incident TB in PLHIV, besides early ART initiation, isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is the key intervention to prevent TB among PLHIV. This prospective cohort and longitudinal study aimed to document; retention, adherence, development of active TB disease, possible adverse drug reactions and completion among patients initiated on IPT in Jan 2019. Methods This was both a prospective cohort and longitudinal study nested within a national quality improvement collaborative in which multiple quality improvement teams tested changes in care delivery to improve the delivery of IPT. The prospective cohort were HIV patients without TB disease initiated on a dosage of Isoniazid 300 mg/day for adults and 150 mg/day for children for a period of 6 months. Association statistics were used to describe patient characteristics and outcomes. Variables with p-value &lt; 0.05 were used to determine linear by linear associations between patient characteristics assumed to influence both primary and secondary outcomes. Variables with a p-value &lt; 0.05 were included in the logistical regression model. The final model included those factors that retained statistical significance. The odds ratios (OR) and adjusted OR (AOR) along with its 95% confidence interval were used to determine the power of relationship in determining the outcomes of interest. The model was tested for fitness using goodness-of-fit Hosmer–Lemeshow tests. Results The completion of IPT was at 89%. A significant proportion of patients adhered to treatment (89%) and kept their appointment schedules-retention (89%). All patients (100%) received IPT at each appointment visit. Only 4% of patients experienced side effects of isoniazid (INH) but none of them developed active TB at the end of the 6 month INH dose. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of covariates of IPT completion revealed a strong and statistical association between IPT completion and age, gender, retention and side effects of INH. Our multivariate model found that children below 15 years were less likely to complete INH than patients ≥ 15 years ( AOR = 0.416, p = 0.230, df = 1). Female patients were 2 times more likely to complete INH dose than male patients (AOR = 1.598, p = 0.018). Patients who kept all their appointment schedules were 10 times more likely to complete IPT than those who missed one or more schedules ( AOR = 10.726, p = 0.000, df = 1). We also found that patients who did not report any side effects associated with INH were 2 times more likely to complete INH ( AOR = 1.958, p = 0.016, df = 1) than patients who reported one or more side effects. Conclusion Treatment completion is the end-point of the IPT initiation strategy in Uganda. With a completion rate of 89%, our results seem re-assuring and suggest that improvement collaborative is an effective approach to achieving results through combined efforts. The high rates of completion are encouraging indicators of progress in the implementation of collaborative activities in the study setting. However, such collaboratives would require periodic evaluation to prevent possible relapses in progress attained.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction With increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV mortality rates are declining and people living with HIV (PLWH) are surviving longer. We characterized CD4 recovery and viral suppression among adults aged &lt; 50 and ≥ 50 years living with HIV who initiated ART in the African Cohort Study (AFRICOS). Methods Beginning in January 2013, PLWH at twelve clinics in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Nigeria underwent medical history review, CD4 and viral load testing as part of the ongoing African Cohort Study (AFRICOS). ART-naïve PLWH who initiated ART within 30 days of enrollment and had at least one year of follow-up were included in these analyses. To compare ART response in participants &lt; 50 years and ≥ 50 years old, changes in CD4 count and viral load suppression after ART initiation were examined at different time points using linear and binomial regression with generalized estimating equations. Variables for time since ART initiation and the interaction between age group and time on ART were included in the model to evaluate longitudinal changes in CD4 recovery and viral suppression by age. Results Between January 2013 and September 2019, 2918 PLHV were enrolled in the cohort. Of these, 443 were ART naïve and initiated on ART within 30 days of enrollment, with 90% (n = 399) aged &lt; 50 years old at ART initiation. At ART initiation, participants aged 50 and older had a higher median CD4 count compared to participants younger than 50 years of age although it did not reach statistical significance (306 cells/mm 3 , IQR:130–547 vs. 277cells/mm 3 , IQR: 132–437). In adjusted models examining CD4 recovery and viral suppression there were no significant differences by age group over time. By the end of follow-up viral suppression was high among both groups of adults (96% of adults ≥ 50 years old and 92% of adults &lt; 50 years old). Conclusion This study found no difference in long-term CD4 recovery or viral suppression by age at ART initiation. We found that particularly among younger adults participants had lower median CD4 counts at ART initiation, suggesting the importance of identifying and putting this population on treatment earlier in the disease course.",

Data on the carriage rate of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae among HIV infected children is lacking in Ethiopia. Hence this study was aimed to investigate fecal carriage of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae among HIV infected children at the University of Gondar comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV infected children from January to April 2020. Stool specimens were collected from 161 study participants by convenient sampling and cultured on MacConkey agar. Biochemical identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing including ESBL production were carried out. Data were analyzed by SPSS version-20 and P-value &lt; 0.05 on multivariate logistic regression analysis was regarded as statistically significant. Results From a total of 161 study participants male to female ratio was 1:1.1. Moreover; 96.3% of participants were in HIV stage-I and 90.1% had at least a year highly active antiretroviral therapy exposure. A total of 186 Enterobacteriaceae, with E. coli 60% and K. pneumonia 16.13% predominance were isolated from 161 participants. Majority of isolates were most resistant to amoxicillin (95.1%) and sensitive to CHL (94.1%), CXT (91.4%) and CAZ (91.4%). There were 71(38.17%) multidrug resistant isolates, 13 of which were also ESBL producers. The overall ESBL carriage rate was 32/161 (19.9%). History of antibiotic use was the independent factor associated with ESBL carriage (AOR 3.23 (95% CI 1.054–9.88)) and P-value of 0.04. Conclusion ESBL carriage rate of HIV infected children was considerable. Previous antibiotic use was the independent factor. Regular screening for antibiotic resistance on HIV patients before prescription and large-scale antibiotic resistance survey including healthy community may be important.",

Here, we evaluated virologic outcomes of patients switched to DTG functional mono- or dual therapy with a non-cytosine nucleoside analog (NA). Methods This retrospective, single center study included treatment-experienced patients switched to regimens containing ≥ 2 antiretrovirals between 8/13/13–11/22/14 who were later found to be on DTG functional mono- or dual therapy with a non-cytosine NA based on historical genotypes. Eligible patients were either suppressed or viremic at baseline and had ≥ 2 HIV-1 RNA measurements at least 4 weeks apart following switch. Demographics, laboratory values and clinical parameters were extracted from the charts of all eligible patients during study treatment until 12/31/2018 and were summarized using descriptive statistics. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL following switch. Results Of 70 patients switched to DTG functional mono- or dual therapy, 39 were eligible; 19 (49%) were on DTG functional monotherapy and 20 (51%) were on DTG functional dual therapy with a non-cytosine NA. Historical genotypes indicated that all had an M184V/I, and 23 (59%) had an M184V/I and ≥ 1 additional NA mutation. The median duration of follow-up on study treatment was 50 weeks (range 12–244). Following switch, 32/39 (82%) patients achieved or maintained an HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL and 7 (18%) had persistent HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL. Five viremic patients were found to be on functional dual therapy with DTG plus a non-cytosine NA and 2 were on DTG functional monotherapy. Five of these patients had post-switch genotypes ordered as a part of routine clinical care and there was no evidence of treatment-emergent resistance. Five were switched to a different DTG-containing regimen and achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, 1 was switched to a non-DTG containing regimen and achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL and 1 was lost-to-follow up at week 36. Conclusions In this real-world cohort, the majority of whom had virus with the M184V/I and ≥ 1 additional NA mutation, switching to DTG functional mono-or dual therapy with a non-cytosine NA resulted in persistent HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL in 18%. None with post-switch genotypes developed treatment-emergent resistance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neuroimaging has been a critical tool for understanding the neuropathological underpinnings observed in HIV. The pathophysiology of HAND is chiefly driven by neuroinflammation. Despite adhering to cART, low levels of viraemia probably persist in the brain in some patients leading to chronic immune activation with resultant neuroinflammation and consequent neuronal injury. MR spectroscopy has been widely used as a biomarker for the presence and severity of HAND in several studies. By studying the MRS signatures, it is possible to characterise the presence of neuroinflammation and neural injury. Furthermore, metabolite concentrations measured by MRS could be used as a quantitative indicator of HIV cerebral involvement, thereby affording the opportunity to assess the efficacy of cART in HAND. However, currently there are three significant limitations in the MRS HIV research literature: the relative paucity of prospective studies, the small number of regions of interrogation due to current methodology (single voxel MRS), and the evolving understanding of the impact of co-morbidities (e.g. ageing, mood disorders, alcoholism etc.) on MRS measurements. This review critically addresses the current literature of MRS studies in people living with HIV (PWH) with HAND to determine its value, especially in the context of the current cART era. In addition, we discuss technical considerations related to the disease and the future direction in HAND using MRS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Understanding the experiences, needs, preferences, and behaviors of people living with HIV (PLHIV) are critical to tailor HIV treatment. However, there is limited empirical evidence in Ethiopia on the views of PLHIV regarding their experiences with current antiretroviral therapy (ART) services and preferred models of HIV treatment. Hence, this study aimed to explore the patients’ experiences of taking medications and preferences for ART service provision in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A phenomenological study design was employed. In this study, stable and 18 years old and above PLHIVs, who had been using ART service at four public hospitals and two health centers in East Gojjam, West Gojjam and Awi zones, and Bahir Dar city administration of Amhara National Regional State, Northwest Ethiopia, were purposively selected. Fifteen in-depth interviews were conducted from July 2021 to September 2021 to collect data. ATLAS.ti version 9 software was used for coding translated transcripts. A thematic analysis approach was employed. Findings Participants in this study had reported positive and negative experiences in receiving ART services and also varied preferences toward ART service features. The study identified five themes on experiences for ART service and 15 attributes of ART service characteristics. The identified themes were stigma, time, availability of drugs and providers, costs for clinic visits, and provider-patient interaction. The fifteen attributes were buddy system, ART refill (individualized or group), ART packaging and labeling, drug formulation and administration, ART room labeling, distance, location of service, preferences on involvement in treatment decision-making, the person providing ART refills, provider’s attitude, spatial arrangement of ART room, time of health facility operation, time spent at clinics, and total cost of the visit. Conclusions The results raise awareness for the positive and negative experiences of patients informing us about barriers and supporting factors in ART service provision. They open up the potential for HIV treatment service improvement. The preferences of PLHIVs toward ART service delivery features were heterogeneous. Policy and program efforts should tailor ART services that suit patients’ needs and priorities in Ethiopia. Future research should further assess the reasons for patients’ distrust of the community ART delivery models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Viral load (VL) monitoring of pregnant women living with HIV (PWLHIV) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) may contribute to lowering the risk of vertical transmission of HIV. The aims of this study were to assess the uptake of HIV VL testing among PWLHIV at entry to the prevention-of-mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services and identify facilitatory factors and barriers to HIV VL access. Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted at 15 health facilities in Mutare district, Manicaland Province, Zimbabwe from January to December 2018. This analysis was complemented by prospective interviews with PWLHIV and health care providers between October 2019 and March 2020. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Risk factors were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. Open-ended questions were analysed and recurring and shared experiences and perceptions of PWLHIV and health care providers identified. Results Among 383 PWLHIV, enrolled in antenatal care (ANC) and receiving ART, only 121 (31.6%) had a VL sample collected and 106 (88%) received their results . Among these 106 women, 93 (87.7%) had a VL &lt; 1000 copies/mL and 77 (73%) a VL &lt; 50 copies/mL. The overall median duration from ANC booking to VL sample collection was 87 (IQR, 7–215) days. The median time interval for the return of VL results from date of sample collection was 14 days (IQR, 7–30). There was no significant difference when this variable was stratified by time of ART initiation. VL samples were significantly less likely to be collected at local authority compared to government facilities (aOR = 0.28; 95% CI 0.16–0.48). Barriers to VL testing included staff shortages, non-availability of consumables and sub-optimal sample transportation. Turnaround time was prolonged by the manual results feedback system. Conclusions and recommendation The low rate of HIV VL testing among PWLHIV in Mutare district is a cause for concern. To reverse this situation, the Ministry of Health should consider interventions such as disseminating antiretroviral guidelines and policies electronically, conducting regular PMTCT mentorship for clinical staff members, and utilising point of care testing and telecommunication devices like mHealth to increase uptake of VL testing and improve results turnaround time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The long-term efficacy and safety of the 2-drug regimen dolutegravir (DTG) + lamivudine (3TC) and 3-drug single-tablet regimens recommended for antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive people with HIV-1 (PWH) have yet to be compared directly in clinical trials. This indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was conducted to compare the durability of efficacy and long-term safety of DTG + 3TC vs second-generation, integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based, 3-drug, single-tablet regimens bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) and DTG/abacavir/3TC (DTG/ABC/3TC) at Week 144 after treatment initiation. Methods A systematic literature review identified 4 trials evaluating the treatment regimens of interest in ART-naive PWH (GEMINI-1, GEMINI-2, GS-US-380-1489, and GS-US-380-1490). Safety, efficacy, and tolerability results were compared using fixed-effects Bucher ITC methodology to calculate relative outcomes. Results Rates of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, US Food and Drug Administration Snapshot analysis) and virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL) as well as mean change in CD4 + cell count were similar with DTG + 3TC, BIC/FTC/TAF, and DTG/ABC/3TC at Week 144. Serious adverse events occurred less frequently with DTG + 3TC compared with both BIC/FTC/TAF (odds ratio [OR], 0.51; 95% CI 0.29–0.87; P = 0.014) and DTG/ABC/3TC (OR, 0.38; 95% CI 0.19–0.75; P = 0.006). Discontinuations and overall adverse events were similar across all 3 regimens. Conclusions These results suggest that the 2-drug regimen DTG + 3TC offers comparable and durable efficacy with fewer serious adverse events vs BIC/FTC/TAF and DTG/ABC/3TC through 144 weeks of treatment in ART-naive PWH. These long-term comparative data support the therapeutic value of DTG + 3TC for PWH.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS through the 95-95-95 target requires 95% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral treatment (ART) to be virally suppressed. Viral Load (VL) non-suppression has been found to be associated with suboptimal ART adherence, and Intensive Adherence Counselling (IAC) has been shown to lead to VL re-suppression by over 70% in PLHIV on ART. Currently, there is data paucity on VL suppression after IAC in adult PLHIV in Uganda. This study aimed to evaluate the proportion of VL suppression after IAC and associated factors among adult PLHIV on ART at Kiswa Health Centre in Kampala, Uganda. Methods Study was a retrospective cohort design and employed secondary data analysis to review routine program data. Medical records of adult PLHIV on ART for at least six months with VL non-suppression from January 2018 to June 2020 at Kiswa HIV clinic were examined in May 2021. Descriptive statistics were applied to determine sample characteristics and study outcome proportions. Multivariable modified Poisson regression analysis was employed to assess predictors of VL suppression after IAC. Results Analysis included 323 study participants of whom 204 (63.2%) were female, 137 (42.4%) were between the age of 30 and 39 years; and median age was 35 years (interquartile range [IQR] 29–42). Participant linkage to IAC was 100%. Participants who received the first IAC session within 30 days or less after unsuppressed VL result were 48.6% (157/323). Participants who received recommended three or more IAC sessions and achieved VL suppression were 66.4% (202/304). The percentage of participants who completed three IAC sessions in recommended 12 weeks was 34%. Receipt of three IAC sessions (ARR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.15–1.53, p &lt; 0.001), having baseline VL of 1,000–4,999 copies/ml (ARR = 1.47, 95%CI: 1.25–1.73, p &lt; 0.001) and taking Dolutegravir containing ART regimen were factors significantly associated with VL suppression after IAC. Conclusion VL suppression proportion of 66.4% after IAC in this population was comparable to 70%, the percentage over which adherence interventions have been shown to cause VL re-suppression. However, timely IAC intervention is needed from receipt of unsuppressed VL results to IAC process completion.",

    "abstract": "Despite substantial antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Tanzania, viral load suppression (VLS) among HIV-positive children receiving ART remains intolerably low. This study was conducted to determine factors affecting the nonsuppression of VL in children with HIV receiving ART in the Simiyu region; thus, an effective, sustainable intervention to address VL nonsuppression can be developed in the future.We conducted a cross-sectional study including children with HIV aged 2-14 years who were currently presenting to care and treatment clinics in the Simiyu region. We collected data from the children/caregivers and care and treatment center databases. We used Stata™ to perform data analysis. We used statistics, including means, standard deviations, medians, interquartile ranges (IQRs), frequencies, and percentages, to describe the data. We performed forward stepwise logistic regression, where the significance level for removal was 0.10 and that for entry was 0.05. The median age of the patients at ART initiation was 2.0 years (IQR, 1.0-5.0 years), and the mean age at HIV VL (HVL) nonsuppression was 8.8 ± 2.99 years. Of the 253 patients, 56% were female, and the mean ART duration was 64 ± 33.07 months. In multivariable analysis, independent predictors of HVL nonsuppression were older age at ART initiation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.012-1.443) and poor medication adherence (AOR, 0.06; 95% CI 0.004-0.867).This study showed that older age at ART initiation and poor medication adherence play significant roles in HVL nonsuppression. HIV/AIDS programs should have intensive interventions targeting early identification, ART initiation, and adherence intensification.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background South Africa is reported to have the highest burden of HIV with an estimated 8.2 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) in 2021- despite adopting the World Health Organisation (WHO) universal HIV test and treat (UTT) recommendations in 2016. As of 2021, only an estimated 67% (5.5 million) of all PLHIV were accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART), as per recorded clinic appointments attendance. Studies in sub-Saharan Africa show that people living in low-income households experience multiple livelihood-related barriers to either accessing or adhering to HIV treatment including lack of resources to attend to facilities and food insecurity. We describe the interactions between managing household income and ART adherence for PLHIV in low-income urban and semi-urban settings in the Western Cape, South Africa. Methods We draw on qualitative data collected as part of the HPTN 071 (PopART) HIV prevention trial (2016 – 2018) to provide a detailed description of the interactions between household income and self-reported ART adherence (including accessing ART and the ability to consistently take ART as prescribed) for PLHIV in the Western Cape, South Africa. We included data from 21 PLHIV (10 men and 11 women aged between 18 and 70 years old) from 13 households. As part of the qualitative component, we submitted an amendment to the ethics to recruit and interview community members across age ranges. We purposefully sampled for diversity in terms of age, gender, and household composition. Results We found that the management of household income interacted with people’s experiences of accessing and adhering to ART in diverse ways. Participants reported that ART adherence was not a linear process as it was influenced by income stability, changing household composition, and other financial considerations. Participants reported that they did not have a fixed way of managing income and that subsequently caused inconsistency in their ART adherence. Participants reported that they experienced disruptions in ART access and adherence due to competing household priorities. These included difficulties balancing between accessing care and/or going to work, as well as struggling to cover HIV care-related costs above other basic needs. Conclusion Our analysis explored links between managing household income and ART adherence practices. We showed that these are complex and change over the course of treatment duration. We argued that mitigating negative impacts of income fluctuation and managing complex trade-offs in households be included in ART adherence support programmes.",

In this study, we examined the prevalence of these phenomena using 8-color cytokine flow cytometry, and tested the hypothesis that these two findings were causally related. We analyzed cytokine profiles and memory/effector phenotypes of HIV-specific and CMV-specific T cells using short-term in vitro stimulation with HIV or CMV peptide pools. Nineteen HIV-positive subjects with progressive disease and twenty healthy, HIV-negative subjects were examined. Among HIV-infected subjects, there were significantly fewer CD8+ IL-2+ T cells responding to HIV compared to CMV, with no significant difference in CD4+ IL-2+ T cells. The majority of CMV-specific T cells in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects appeared to be terminally differentiated effector cells (CD8+ CD27- CD28- CD45RA+ or CD8+ CD27- CD28- CD45RA-). In HIV-positive subjects, the most common phenotype of HIV-specific T cells was intermediate in differentiation (CD8+ CD27+ CD28- CD45RA-). These differences were statistically significant, both as absolute cell frequencies and as percentages. There was a significant correlation between the absolute number of HIV-specific CD8+ IL-2+ T cells and HIV-specific CD8+ CD27- CD28- CD45RA+ terminal effector cells.

    "abstract": "Current anti-AIDS therapeutic agents and treatment regimens can provide a dramatically improved quality of life for HIV-positive people, many of whom have no detectable viral load for prolonged periods of time. Despite this, curing AIDS remains an elusive goal, partially due to the occurrence of drug resistance. Since the development of resistance is linked to, among other things, fluctuating drug levels, our long-term goal has been to develop nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems that can improve therapy by more precisely controlling drug concentrations in target cells. The theme of the current study is to investigate the value of combining AIDS drugs and modifiers of cellular uptake into macromolecular conjugates having novel pharmacological properties.Bioconjugates were prepared from different combinations of the approved drug, saquinavir, the antiviral agent, R.I.CK-Tat9, the polymeric carrier, poly(ethylene) glycol and the cell uptake enhancer, biotin. Anti-HIV activities were measured in MT-2 cells, an HTLV-1-transformed human lymphoid cell line, infected with HIV-1 strain Vbu 3, while parallel studies were performed in uninfected cells to determine cellular toxicity. For example, R.I.CK-Tat9 was 60 times more potent than L-Tat9 while the addition of biotin resulted in a prodrug that was 2850 times more potent than L-Tat9. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies suggest that variations in intracellular uptake and intracellular localization, as well as synergistic inhibitory effects of SQV and Tat peptides, contributed to the unexpected and substantial differences in antiviral activity.Our results demonstrate that highly potent nanoscale multi-drug conjugates with low non-specific toxicity can be produced by combining moieties with anti-HIV agents for different targets onto macromolecules having improved delivery properties.",

    "abstract": "A 4-week, uninterrupted treatment with 9-(2-phosphonyl-methoxypropyly)adenine (PMPA, commonly called tenofovir) completely prevents simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmne) infection in cynomolgus macaques if treatment begins within 24 hours after SIVmne inoculation, but is less effective if treatment is delayed or duration of treatment is shortened. Critical factors for efficacy include timing and duration of treatment, potency of antiretroviral drug and a contribution from antiviral immune responses. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of one or more treatment interruptions plus SIVmne re-exposures on efficacy of PMPA treatment to prevent SIVmne infection in cynomolgus macaques. We also evaluated whether macaques with pre-existing SIV immune responses show increased efficacy of treatment. Eight PMPA-treated, virus-negative and seronegative macaques, and five PMPA-treated, virus-negative but weakly or strongly seropositive macaques were re-inoculated with SIVmne and treated with PMPA starting 24 hr post inoculation. Thereafter, they received either a 5-week treatment involving one interruption plus one SIVmne challenge or a 10-week treatment involving six interruptions plus six SIVmne challenges early during treatment. Parameters measured were plasma SIV RNA, SIV-antibody response, CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets and in vivo CD8+ cell-suppression of virus infection.All seronegative macaques developed persistent antibody response beginning 4 to 8 weeks after stopping PMPA-treatment in absence of viremia in a majority of macaques and coinciding with onset of intermittent viremia in other macaques. In contrast, all weakly or strongly seropositive macaques showed immediate increase in titers (> 1600) of SIV antibodies, even before the end of PMPA-treatment, and in absence of detectable viremia. However, in vivo CD8+-cell depletion revealed CD8 cell-suppression of viremia and persistence of virus in the macaques as long as 2 years after PMPA-treatment, even in aviremic macaques. Unlike untreated macaques, a treated macaque controlled viral replication and blocked CD4+ T cell depletion when challenged with a heterologous chimeric SIV/HIV-1 virus called SHIV89.6P.A single interruption plus one SIVmne challenge was as sufficient as six interruptions plus six SIVmne challenges in reducing efficacy of PMPA, but results in long-term persistence of virus infection suppressed by CD8+ cells. Efficacy of PMPA treatment was highest in macaques with pre-existing SIV immune responses.",

    "abstract": "As HIV treatment is scaled-up in resource-poor settings, the timely identification of persons with HIV infection remains an important challenge. Most people with HIV are unaware of their status, and those who are often present late in the course of their illness. Free-standing voluntary counseling and testing sites often have poor uptake of testing. We aimed to evaluate a 'provider-initiated' HIV testing strategy in a primary care clinic in rural resource-poor Haiti by reviewing the number of visits made to clinic before an HIV test was performed in those who were ultimately found to have HIV infection. In collaboration with the Haitian Ministry of Health, a non-governmental organization (Partners In Health) scaled up HIV care in central Haiti by reinforcing primary care clinics, instituting provider-initiated HIV testing and by providing HIV treatment in the context of primary medical care, free of charge to patients. Among a cohort of people with HIV infection, we assessed retrospectively for delays in or 'missed opportunities' for diagnosis of HIV by the providers in one clinic. Of the first 117 patients diagnosed with HIV in one clinic, 100 (85%) were diagnosed at the first medical encounter. Median delay in diagnosis for the remaining 17 was only 62 days (IQR 19 – 122; range 1 – 272). There was no statistical difference in CD4 cell count between those with and without a delay. 3787 HIV tests were performed in the period reviewed. Provider-initiated testing was associated with high volume uptake of HIV testing and minimal delay between first medical encounter and diagnosis of HIV infection. In scale up of HIV care, provider-initiated HIV testing at primary care clinics can be a successful strategy to identify patients with HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "Gut immune components are severely compromised among persons with AIDS, which allows increased translocation of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the systemic circulation. These microbial LPS are reportedly increased in chronically HIV-infected individuals and findings have correlated convincingly with measures of immune activation. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an adverse consequence of the restoration of pathogen-specific immune responses in a subset of HIV-infected subjects with underlying latent infections during the initial months of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). Whether IRIS is the result of a response to a high antigen burden, an excessive response by the recovering immune system, exacerbated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or a lack of immune regulation due to inability to produce regulatory cytokines remains to be determined. We theorize that those who develop IRIS have a high burden of proinflammatory cytokines produced also in response to systemic bacterial LPS that nonspecifically act on latent mycobacterial antigens. We also hypothesize that subjects that do not develop IRIS could have developed either tolerance (anergy) to persistent LPS/tubercle antigens or could have normal FOXP3+ gene and that those with defective FOXP3+ gene or those with enormous plasma LPS could be vulnerable to IRIS. The measure of microbial LPS, anti-LPS antibodies and nonspecific plasma cytokines in subjects on HAART shall predict the role of these components in IRIS.",

Although the mechanism of transformation and leukemogenesis is not fully elucidated, there is evidence to suggest that the viral oncoprotein Tax plays a crucial role in these processes through the regulation of several pathways including NF-kappaB and the cell cycle pathways. The observation that NF-kappaB, which is strongly induced by Tax, is indispensable for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype of HTLV-1 by regulating the expression of various genes involved in cell cycle regulation and inhibition of apoptosis provides a possible molecular target for these infected cells. To develop potential new therapeutic strategies for HTLV-1 infected cells, in this present study, we initially screened a battery of NF-kappaB and CDK inhibitors (total of 35 compounds) to examine their effects on the growth and survival of infected T-cell lines. Two drugs namely BMS-345541 and Purvalanol A exhibited higher levels of growth inhibition and apoptosis in infected cell as compared to uninfected cells. BMS-345541 inhibited IKKbeta kinase activity from HTLV-1 infected cells with an IC50 (the 50% of inhibitory concentration) value of 50 nM compared to 500 nM from control cells as measured by in vitro kinase assays. The effects of Purvalanol A were associated with suppression of CDK2/cyclin E complex activity as previously shown by us. Combination of both BMS-345541 and Purvalanol A showed a reduced level of HTLV-1 p19 Gag production in cell culture. The apparent apoptosis in these infected cells were associated with increased caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage. The potent and selective apoptotic effects of these drugs suggest that both BMS-345541 and Purvalanol A, which target both NF-kappaB and CDK complex and the G1/S border, might be promising new agents in the treatment of these infected patients.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring dynamics in HIV-1 infection and risk behaviours is important in evaluating, adjusting and scaling up prevention programmes. The objective of this study was to estimate trends in the prevalence of HIV-1 infection and risk behaviours over 15 years in a rural village population in Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania using repeated population-based cross-sectional surveys.Four rounds of HIV-1 sero-epidemiological and behavioural surveys were completed during 1991 to 2005 in the study village. House-to-house registrations of people aged 15-44 years with an address in the village were conducted before each survey. All consenting individuals were then interviewed for pertinent risk behaviours and tested for HIV-1 seropositivity.Participation proportions ranged from 73.0% to 79.1%. Overall, age and sex-adjusted HIV-1 prevalence increased from 3.2% in 1991 to 5.6 % in 2005 (relative increase 75.0%; ptrend < 0.001). The increase was significant for both men and women (ptrends < 0.001) and more evident among women aged 35-44 years (2.0% to 13.0%, ptrend < 0.001). Among participants aged 15-24 years a decrease in number of sexual partners was observed with a corresponding stable HIV-1 prevalence. Participants aged 25-44 years continued to report multiple sexual partners, and this was corroborated with increased HIV-1 prevalence trend (4.0% to 9.0%, ptrends < 0.001). Among men aged 25-44 years and women aged 15-24 years significant increases in condom use were observed (ptrend < 0.01).The HIV-1 prevalence seems to have increased among older participants but remained stable among younger participants. Encouraging trends toward safer sex practices were observed among young participants, while only modest behavioural changes were seen among the older participants. Prevention efforts in rural areas need to be intensified and to address people of all ages.",

The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, is a key player in the clearance of pathogens and influences the level of inflammation and macrophage activation.We hypothesize that low availability of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, either due to vitamin D deficiency or due to polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor or in its activating/inactivating enzymes, contributes to the appearance of IRIS. Furthermore, drug interactions with the enzymatic pathways of vitamin D could favour the development of IRIS.Our hypothesis could be explored by a case-control study to assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral treatment who develop and do not develop IRIS.If the role of vitamin D in IRIS is confirmed, we would be able to screen patients at risk for IRIS by screening for vitamin D deficiency. After confirmation by means of a clinical trial, vitamin D supplementation could be a cheap and safe way to reduce the incidence of IRIS.",

    "abstract": "Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are an important category of drugs for both chemotherapy and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. However, current non-human primate (NHP) models utilizing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or commonly used chimeric SHIV (SIV expressing HIV-1 envelope) are inadequate due to the insensitivity to NNRTIs. To develop a NHP model for evaluation of NNRTI compounds, we characterized a RT-SHIV virus that was assembled by replacing the SIV mac239 reverse transcriptase (RT) with that of HIV-1HXB2. Since RT-SHIV exhibited in vitro characteristics of high infectivity, CCR5-usage, and sensitivity to HIV-1 specific NNRTIs, this virus was thought to be suitable for mucosal transmission and then was used to carry out a vaginal transmission study in pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina).RT-SHIV exhibited in vitro characteristics of an infectious CCR5-tropic chimeric virus. This virus was not only highly sensitive to HIV-1 RT specific NNRTIs; its replication was also inhibited by a variety of NRTIs and protease inhibitors. For in vivo vaginal transmission studies, macaques were either pretreated with a single dose of DMPA (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) or left untreated before intravaginal inoculation with 500 or 1,000 TCID50 of RT-SHIV. All macaques became systemically infected by 2 or 3 weeks post-inoculation exhibiting persistent high viremia, marked CD4+T cell depletion, and antiviral antibody response. DMPA-pretreated macaques showed a higher mean plasma viral load after the acute infection stage, highly variable antiviral antibody response, and a higher incidence of AIDS-like disease as compared with macaques without DMPA pretreatment.This chimeric RT-SHIV has exhibited productive replication in both macaque and human PBMCs, predominantly CCR5-coreceptor usage for viral entry, and sensitivity to NNRTIs as well as other anti-HIV compounds. This study demonstrates rapid systemic infection in macaques following intravaginal exposure to RT-SHIV. This RT-SHIV/macaque model could be useful for evaluation of NNRTI-based therapies, microbicides, or other preventive strategies.",

We demonstrate that the unprecedented power of deep sequencing in conjunction with computational data analysis has great potential for clinical diagnostics and basic research. Specifically, we analyzed longitudinal deep sequencing data from patients in a study with Vicriviroc, a drug that blocks the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5. Sequences covered the V3-loop of gp120, known to be the main determinant of co-receptor tropism. First, we evaluated this data with a computational model for the interpretation of V3-sequences with respect to tropism, and we found complete agreement with results from phenotypic assays. Thus, the method could be applied in cases where phenotypic assays fail. Second, computational analysis led to the discovery of a characteristic pattern in the quasi-species that foreshadows switches of co-receptor tropism. This analysis could help to unravel the mechanism of tropism switches, and to predict these switches weeks to months before they can be detected by a phenotypic assay.",

Therapy decisions could be further improved, both in terms of predicting length of current therapy success and in preserving followup therapy options, through better knowledge of mutational pathways- here defined as specific locations on the viral genome which, when mutant, alter the risk that additional specific mutations arise. We limit the search to locations in the reverse transcriptase region of the HIV-1 genome which host resistance mutations to nucleoside (NRTI) and non-nucleoside (NNRTI) reverse transcriptase inhibitors (as listed in the 2008 International AIDS Society report), or which were mutant at therapy start in 5% or more of the therapies studied.A Cox proportional hazards model was fit to each location with the hazard of a mutation at that location during therapy proportional to the presence/absence of mutations at the remaining locations at therapy start. A pathway from preexisting to occurring mutation was indicated if the covariate was both selected as important via smoothly clipped absolute deviation (a form of regularized regression) and had a small p-value. The Cox model also allowed controlling for non-genetic parameters and potential nuisance factors such as viral resistance and number of previous therapies. Results were based on 1981 therapies given to 1495 distinct patients drawn from the EuResist database.The strongest influence on the hazard of developing NRTI resistance was having more than four previous therapies, not any one existing resistance mutation. Known NRTI resistance pathways were shown, and previously speculated inhibition between the thymidine analog pathways was evidenced. Evidence was found for a number of specific pathways between NRTI and NNRTI resistance sites. A number of common mutations were shown to increase the hazard of developing both NRTI and NNRTI resistance. Viral resistance to the therapy compounds did not materially effect the hazard of mutation in our model.The accuracy of therapy outcome prediction tools may be increased by including the number of previous treatments, and by considering locations in the HIV genome which increase the hazard of developing resistance mutations.",

The association of TDF and renal dysfunction has remained an area of interest.We conducted a retrospective review of all patients on TDF from July 2007 to December 2009 in our institution and evaluated their renal function. Absolute change of creatinine clearance (CLCr) using Cockroft-Gault equation from baseline was calculated at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Overall, 226 patients were included in the study. Ninety percent were male. The median age was 46 yrs old (23-82), median weight was 60 kg (IQR 53.75-68), median CD4 count was 127 cells/mm3 (IQR 38-258) and median CLCr 82.7 mL/min (IQR 71.4-101.7) on initiation of TDF. The median decline of CLCr from baseline was -3.9 ml/min (IQR -12.3 to 7.6), and -3.6 ml/min (IQR -12.4 to 6.7) at 12 (n = 102), 24 months (n = 75) respectively. Eighteen of 226 patients had a decline in renal function to </=50 ml/min. Majority of which had an improvement of CLCr on follow up. Only 80% of patients ever received monitoring of renal function.While we noted renal toxicity to be rare and transient among our cohort receiving TDF as part of their ARV regimen, these results reflect the short term renal effects of TDF given that ARV treatment is lifelong. Given that laboratory monitoring may be difficult to implement in many situations, future prospective studies looking into an evidence based algorithm for less frequent renal function monitoring than current guideline recommendations may be helpful.",

Here, we present a mini review on strategies employed for the development of HIV vaccines with an emphasis on a well-established vaccine technology, the killed whole-virus vaccine approach. Recently, we reported an evaluation of the safety and the immunogenicity of a genetically modified and killed whole-HIV-1 vaccine designated as SAV001 [1]. HIV-1 Clade B NL4-3 was genetically modified by deleting the nef and vpu genes and substituting the coding sequence of the Env signal peptide with that of honeybee melittin to produce an avirulent and replication efficient HIV-1. This genetically modified virus (gmHIV-1 NL4-3 ) was propagated in a human T cell line followed by virus purification and inactivation by aldrithiol-2 and γ-irradiation. We found that SAV001 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. HIV-1 NL4-3 -specific polymerase chain reaction showed no evidence of vaccine virus replication in participants receiving SAV001 and in human T cells infected in vitro. Furthermore, SAV001 with an adjuvant significantly increased the antibody response to HIV-1 structural proteins. Moreover, antibodies in the plasma from these vaccinations neutralized tier I and tier II of HIV-1 B, A, and D subtypes. These results indicated that the killed whole-HIV vaccine is safe and may trigger appropriate immune responses to prevent HIV infection. Utilization of this killed whole-HIV vaccine strategy may pave the way to develop an effective HIV vaccine.",

We conducted a secondary longitudinal analysis of one rural and one urban cohort of patients who initiated ART in Uganda between April 2004 and July 2007 followed up-to 2016. Data on sexual behavior were collected every 6 months for 3.5 years in individuals on ART ≥ 4 years (baseline) when a behavioral questionnaire was introduced. Risky sexual behavior was defined as sexual intercourse with ≥ 2 partners or inconsistent or no condom use in previous 6 months. We report characteristics overall, and by cohort. We used multivariable generalized estimating equations logistic regression to assess the effects of time on ART on risky sexual behavior. Of 1012 participants, 402 (39.8%) were urban and 610 (60.2%) were rural residents. Mean age was 42.8 years (SD 8.5). Mean duration of follow-up was 51.3 months (SD 15.3), but longer for urban than rural participants (64.5 vs 36.4 months). Risky sexual behavior declined from 33.1% at baseline to 9.6% after 3.5 years of follow-up in the rural cohort (p ≤ 0.01 for the test of trend) and was unchanged from 9.7% at baseline to 9.9% after 3.5 years in the urban cohort (p = 0.51). Receiving care at a rural clinic (aOR 4.99, 95% CI 3.64–6.84); male gender (aOR 1.66, 95% CI 1.26–2.19) and being younger (aOR 5.60, 95% CI 3.80–8.25 for 18–34 years and aOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.74–3.14 for 35–44 years) were associated with increased odds of risky sexual behavior. Not being married (aOR 0.25; 95% CI 0.19–0.34), and longer time on ART (aOR 0.71 95% CI 0.67–0.76) were associated with reduced odds of risky sex. We observed a decline in risky sexual behavior in rural people on long-term (≥ 4 years) ART. Rural, male and young individuals had higher odds of self-reported risky sexual behavior. ART programs should continue to emphasize risk reduction practices, especially among people receiving care in rural health facilities, males, younger individuals and those who are married.",

We conducted a population-based birth cohort study (N = 667 mother-infant dyads) in South Africa to investigate whether maternal alcohol use and HIV affected gestational outcomes. Descriptive data analysis was conducted for all variables using frequency distributions, measures of central tendency, and estimates of variance. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to determine whether maternal alcohol use, maternal HIV status and other risk factors (socioeconomic status, smoking, depression) predicted infant outcomes. Our results showed severity of recent alcohol use and lifetime alcohol use predicted low birth weight. Similarly lifetime alcohol use predicted shorter infant length, smaller head length, smaller head circumference, and early gestational age. However, HIV status was not a significant predictor of gestational outcomes. The unexpected finding that maternal HIV status did not predict any of the gestational outcomes may be due to high rates of ART usage among HIV-infected mothers. The potentially negative effects of HIV on gestational outcomes may have been attenuated by improved maternal health due to high coverage of antiretroviral treatment in South Africa. Interventions are needed to reduce alcohol consumption among pregnant mothers and to support healthy growth and psychosocial development of infants.",

The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), non-(N)NRTI, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were found in 50.26, 63.12, and 1.30% of subjects, respectively. Thymidine analogue mutations, NNRTI and even multidrug resistance complex were quite common in this patient cohort.Multiple and complex patterns of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations were identified among individuals who experienced virological failure to first-line ART in Henan, China during 2010-2011. Therefore, timely virological monitoring, therapy adjustments, and more varieties of drugs and individualized treatment should be immediately considered in this patient population.",

Voriconazole trough concentrations (C0) were within target range while the patient was under esomeprazole, a CYP2C19 inhibitor. Phenotyping showed decreased CYP2C19 activity, whereas genotyping showed a variant allele associated with increased enzyme activity. The patient was switched to ranitidine because of the introduction of atazanavir. CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir combined with uninhibited CYP2C19 activity resulted in subtherapeutic voriconazole C0. The reintroduction of esomeprazole allowed restoring voriconazole C0 back to target range. The integration of drug-drug interactions and pharmacogenetics data is crucial to interpret drug concentrations correctly, thus preventing suboptimal exposure to voriconazole.",

The age-related differences in treatment duration and characteristics of first cART modifications remain underinvestigated. With increasing proportion of older patients in HIV population it is important to better understand age-related treatment effects. Patients were included into this analysis, if being cART naïve at the first visit at the clinic. Follow-up time was measured from the first visit date until first cART modification or 28 February 2013. First cART modification was defined as any change in the third drug component i.e. protease inhibitor (PI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), integrase inhibitor or fusion inhibitor. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify factors related to first cART modification in three age groups: <30, 30–50 and >50. In total 2027 patients with 14,965 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) were included. The oldest group included 136 patients with 1901, middle group 1202 with 8416 PYFU and youngest group consisted of 689 patients with 4648 PYFU. Median follow-up time was 5.8 (IQR 3.4–9.4) years, median time on first cART was 4.4 (IQR 2.1–8.5) years. 72.4 % of patients started PI-based and 26.1 % NNRTI-based regimen. In total 1268 (62.5 %) patients had cART modification (non-adherence 30.8 %, toxicity 29.6 %). Durability of first cART was the best in patients over 50 y.o. (log-rank test, p = 0.001). Factors associated with discontinuation in this group were late presentation (HR 0.45, [95 % CI 0.23–0.90], p = 0.02) and PI use (HR 2.17, [95 % CI 1.18–4.0], p = 0.01).

However, some PLWH experience virologic rebound after a period of viral suppression, usually followed by selection of drug resistant virus. Determining factors associated with drug resistance can inform patient management and healthcare policies, particularly in resource-limited settings where drug resistance testing is not routine. Methods A case–control study was conducted using data captured from an electronic medical record in a large treatment program in Nigeria. Cases PLWH receiving cART who developed acquired drug resistance (ADR) and controls were those without ADR between 2004 and 2011. Each case was matched to up to 2 controls by sex, age, and education. Logistic regression was used estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with ADR. Results We evaluated 159 cases with ADR and 299 controls without ADR. In a multivariate model, factors associated with ADR included older age (OR = 2.35 [age 30–40 years 95% CI 1.29, 4.27], age 41 + years OR = 2.31 [95% CI 1.11, 4.84], compared to age 17–30), higher education level (secondary OR 2.14 [95% CI 1.1.11–4.13]), compared to primary and tertiary), non-adherence to care (OR = 2.48 [95% CI 1.50–4.00]), longer treatment duration (OR = 1.80 [95% CI 1.37–2.35]), lower CD4 count((OR = 0.95 [95% CI 0.95–0.97]) and higher viral load (OR = 1.97 [95% CI 1.44–2.54]).

We investigated whether a daily text messaging intervention improves ART adherence and retention in early HIV care in PHIV in a south Florida hospital-based clinic. Methods ART-naïve PHIV receiving care through the clinic’s Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program were enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups with a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group received a 1-way text message daily and the control group received standard care without receiving text message reminders for 6 months. HIV RNA and CD4 cell count were measured at baseline and post-intervention. Adherence to ART was defined as a visual analog scale of ≥ 90%. Retention in care was defined as continued engagement at study end. Results 94 ART-naïve patients were randomized and 83 (85.6%) completed the study, of which 44 were in the intervention group and 39 were in the control group. At the end of the 6-month study period, adherence to ART was 84.4% in the intervention group versus 73.5% in the control group (OR, 1.9; 95% CI 0.7–5.0; p = 0.194).

A significant increase in CD4 cell count and a decrease in HIV RNA were found at study end, with no differences between the two groups. Conclusions In this pilot study, a one-way daily text messaging intervention did not improve ART adherence over a 6-month study period, but significantly enhanced patient retention in early HIV care.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence, diagnostic methods, and associated factors of prediabetes among HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-infected adults without a history of diabetes who were receiving ART. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were assessed. Results A total of 397 patients with a mean age of 47.0 ± 9.8 years and 55.7% male, were studied. All received ART with undetectable plasma viral load. The mean duration of ART was 9.6 ± 5.2 years, and the mean CD4 cell count was 554 ± 235 cells/mm 3 . Among the patients, 28 (7.1%) had first-diagnosed diabetes, and 133 (33.5%) patients had prediabetes. Glycemia estimation by FPG, 2-h PG, and HbA1c showed a prediabetes prevalence of 17.4%, 14.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. The kappa statistics for the agreement of FPG and 2-h PG, HbA1c and 2-h PG, and HbA1c and FPG were 0.317, 0.429, and 0.396, respectively. In multivariate analysis, hypertension [odds ratio (OR) 3.38; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-9.91; p = 0.026), and triglycerides &gt; 150 mg/dL (OR 2.11; 95% CI, 1.01-4.44; p = 0.047) were factors significantly associated with prediabetes. Conclusions Prediabetes among HIV-infected individuals receiving ART is common. The agreements of glycemia estimation methods are minimal to weak. HbA1c may underestimate prediabetes prevalence. Using FPG together with HbA1c increases the detection rate to approximately three-quarters of prediabetes patients. HIV-infected individuals who had hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia should be regularly assessed for prediabetes. Trial registration ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03545217.

Methods Two online surveys for PLHIV and HHP assessed awareness and acceptability of ATI, and understanding of the prospect for HIV cure in the future. Responses were collected from July 2017–January 2018. A descriptive analysis was performed and similar questions across the two surveys were compared using χ squared test. Results 442 PLHIV and 144 HHP completed the survey. 105/400 (26%) PLHIV had ever interrupted ART, 8% of which were in a clinical trial. Altruistic motivations were drivers of participation of PLHIV in cure related research. 81/135 (60%) HHP would support their patients wishing to enrol in an HIV cure-focused trial, but fewer would promote and allow such participation (25% and 31% respectively). Compared to HHP, PLHIV were more likely to believe that an HIV cure would be achievable within 10 years (55% vs. 19%, p &lt; 0.001), had less awareness of ATI (46% vs. 62%, p &lt; 0.001) and were less likely to have had experience of either participation or enrolment in an ATI study (5% vs. 18%, p &lt; 0.001) Conclusion PLHIV were more optimistic about the potential for HIV cure.

However, reaching PLHIV is especially difficult in resource-limited settings such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where reliable prevalence data is lacking. This study evaluated the prevalence of HIV in patients in the urban Kinshasa area. Methods Individuals seeking healthcare were tested for HIV between February 2017 and July 2018 at existing Kinshasa urban clinics. The study was conducted in two phases. Case finding was optimized in a pilot study phase using a modified cell phone-based Open\\Data Kit (ODK) collection system. HIV prevalence was then determined from data obtained between March–July of 2018 from 8320 individuals over the age of 18 years receiving care at one of 47 clinics in Kinshasa. Results The prevalence of HIV in our study was 11.0% (95% CI 10.3–11.6%) overall and 8.14% in the subset of N = 1240 participants who were healthy mothers seeking prenatal care. These results are in sharp contrast to President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) estimates of 2.86%, but are consistent with data from surrounding countries. Conclusion While this data is sub-national and reflects an urban healthcare setting, given the large population of Kinshasa and rapidly changing age demographics, the results suggest that HIV prevalence in the DRC is substantially higher than previously reported.",

The odds of older age (30-39 years: AOR = 0.49, CI 0.32-0.76; more than 40 years: AOR = 0.07, CI 0.04-0.14, compared to 18-29 years), bisexual (AOR = 0.49, CI 0.29-0.84) were lower among HIVST users,and were higher among MSM who were higher education level (high school: AOR = 2.82, CI 1.70-4.69, compared to middle school or less), gay apps use (AOR = 1.86, CI 1.13-3.05), multiple male sex partners (AOR = 1.90, CI 1.29-2.80), frequency of male-male sexual contact ≥ 1 times per week (AOR = 1.86, CI 1.30-2.66), syphilis infection (AOR = 5.48, CI 2.53-11.88).Further HIVST education should be strengthened for school-aged children and teenagers, and free HIVST kits may be provided to high-risk MSM through gay apps and CBO to achieve the increased HIV testing frequency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Introduction of tenofovir (TDF) plus lamivudine (3TC) and dolutegravir (DTG) in first- and second-line HIV treatment regimens in South Africa warrants characterization of acquired HIV-1 drug resistance (ADR) mutations that could impact DTG-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). In this study, we sought to determine prevalence of ADR mutations and their potential impact on susceptibility to drugs used in combination with DTG among HIV-positive adults (≥ 18 years) accessing routine care at a selected ART facility in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods We enrolled adult participants in a cross-sectional study between May and September 2019. Eligible participants had a most recent documented viral load (VL) ≥ 1000 copies/mL after at least 6 months on ART. We genotyped HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease genes by Sanger sequencing and assessed ADR. We characterized the effect of ADR mutations on the predicted susceptibility to drugs used in combination with DTG. Results From 143 participants enrolled, we obtained sequence data for 115 (80%), and 92.2% (95% CI 85.7–96.4) had ADR. The proportion with ADR was similar for participants on first-line ART (65/70, 92.9%, 95% CI 84.1–97.6) and those on second-line ART (40/44, 90.9%, 95% CI 78.3–97.5), and was present for the single participant on third-line ART. Approximately 89% (62/70) of those on first-line ART had dual class NRTI and NNRTI resistance and only six (13.6%) of those on second-line ART had major PI mutations. Most participants (82%) with first-line viraemia maintained susceptibility to Zidovudine (AZT), and the majority of them had lost susceptibility to TDF (71%) and 3TC (84%). Approximately two in every five TDF-treated individuals had thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs). Conclusions Susceptibility to AZT among most participants with first-line viraemia suggests that a new second-line regimen of AZT + 3TC + DTG could be effective. However, atypical occurrence of TAMs in TDF-treated individuals suggests a less effective AZT + 3TC + DTG regimen in a subpopulation of patients. As most patients with first-line viraemia had at least low-level resistance to TDF and 3TC, identifying viraemia before switch to TDF + 3TC + DTG is important to avoid DTG functional monotherapy. These findings highlight a need for close monitoring of outcomes on new standardized treatment regimens.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Ethiopia, being in the Sub Saharan region of Africa, is one of the countries with a substantial burden of HIV infection. Because of the high burden of HIV and poor health care settings, HAND is prevalent as demonstrated in various cross-sectional studies. However, no review has been conducted to report the consolidated magnitude of HAND among people with HIV in Ethiopia. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of HAND in Ethiopia. Methods Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed studies that investigated the prevalence of HAND in Ethiopia from PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, HINARI, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. We also looked at the reference lists of the included studies to include other relevant studies. Subgroup analysis was performed based on publication year, study location, and sample size. Heterogeneity across studies was evaluated using the I2 test. Potential publication bias was assessed using Egger’s test and visual inspection of symmetry in the funnel plots. Results In the present meta-analysis, 627 articles were initially identified and evaluated. Of these, 8 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of HAND in people with HIV in Ethiopia was 39.15% (95% CI 29.36, 48.94). The highest prevalence observed in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR) with 53.20% (95% CI 25.96, 80.44) followed by others 34.87% (Tigray, Addis Ababa, and Oromia) (95% CI 33.49, 36.24) and Amhara 34.07% (95% CI 25.39, 42.74).The funnel plot was asymmetrical. However, Egger’s regression tests provided no evidence of publication bias in the prevalence of HAND. Conclusion In this meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of HAND, in Ethiopia, was high. Older age, substance use, advanced stages of the disease, and lack of education were the main determinants of HAND in Ethiopia. Health education, early screening of people with HIV, and training of health professionals working in hospitals on HAND are highly recommended.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Good adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retention in care are essential for the effectiveness of an HIV care program. With the current increase in numbers of people living with HIV taking second-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a need to establish their treatment outcomes and the rate of loss to follow up. In this study, we determined the incidence and predictors of loss to follow up among patients taking second-line ART at an experienced HIV treatment center in southwestern Uganda. Methods This was a retrospective review of an electronic database at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital HIV clinic in southwestern Uganda. Second-line ART included at least two of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a boosted protease inhibitor. Loss to follow-up was defined as failure to return to the health facility for care or treatment refill for 180 days or more from the previous visit. After excluding children less than 15 years, we pooled data that included socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data for patients who started second-line ART between 2002 and 2017. Multiple imputation was done for variables with missing data. Variables that had a p &lt; 0.05 in unadjusted bivariate analyses were included in a multivariate binomial regression model using a stepwise backward selection procedure to describe the factors that independently predicted loss to follow-up. Results Between 2002 and 2017, 1121 patients had been initiated on second-line ART. We included data from 924 participants and of these, 518 (56.1%) were female, the mean age (SD) was 38.4 (± 10.5) years, and 433 (52.4%) had a CD4 count less than 100 cells/µl at the start of second-line ART. The incidence of loss to follow-up was 26.7 per 100 person-years. Male gender (Adjusted risk ratio (ARR) = 1.8, 95% CI 1.5–2.0) p &lt; 0.001 and anemia ARR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.6) p &lt; 0.001 were strongly associated with loss to follow up. Conclusions There is a high incidence of loss to follow up among patients taking protease-inhibitor based second-line ART at a tertiary HIV center in southwestern Uganda. There is a need to routinely measure hemoglobin during clinic reviews, and establish mechanisms to retain males initiated on second-line ART in care. The association of anemia and loss to follow up needs to be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Failure on second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) with protease inhibitor (PI) mutations (VF-M) is on the rise. However, there is a paucity of information on the factors associated with this observation in low-income countries. Knowledge of underlying factors is critical if we are to minimize the number of PLHIV switched to costly third-line ART. Our study investigated the factors associated with VF-M. Methods We conducted a matched case–control analysis of patients' records kept at the Joint Clinical Research Center, starting from January 2008 to May 2018. We matched records of patients who failed the second-line ART with major PI mutations (cases) with records of patients who were virologically suppressed (controls) by a ratio of 1:3. Data analysis was conducted using STATA Version 14. Categorical variables were compared with the outcomes failure on second-line ART with PI mutations using the Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests where appropriate. Conditional logistic regression for paired data was used to assess the association between the outcome and exposure variables, employing the backward model building procedure. Results Of the 340 reviewed patients' records, 53% were women, and 6.2% had previous tuberculosis treatment. Males (aOR = 2.58, [CI 1.42–4.69]), and patients concurrently on tuberculosis treatment while on second-line ART (aOR = 5.65, [CI 1.76–18.09]) had higher odds of VF-M. ART initiation between 2001 and 2015 had lower odds of VF-M relative to initiation before the year 2001. Conclusion Males and patients concomitantly on tuberculosis treatment while on second-line ART are at a higher risk of VF-M. HIV/AIDS response programs should give special attention to this group of people if we are to minimize the need for expensive third-line ART. We recommend more extensive, explorative studies to ascertain underlying factors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Depression is common among HIV-infected individuals and may contribute to suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and subsequent inability to attain viral load (VL) suppression. We evaluated associations between depression, self-reported adherence, and longitudinal HIV treatment outcomes in US Military HIV Natural History Study (NHS) participants with and without depression. Methods Male NHS participants with available ICD-9 data for mental health diagnoses, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) measures, and self-reported adherence (SRA) were included. ART use was defined as ART initiation between 2006 and 2010, with follow-up through 2015. SRA was defined as taking 95% of ART doses and continuous ART was defined as longitudinal ART use with gaps &lt; 30 days. Continuous VL suppression was defined as maintaining VLs &lt; 200 c/mL on ART. To analyse the association between depression and HIV treatment outcomes, latent class analysis was used to create classes of depression trajectories: low depression (LD), recent onset depression (ROD) and high Depression (HD). Results Participants had a mean age of 32 (± 8.3) years at HIV diagnosis, and similar proportions were Caucasian (44.3%) or African American (40.8%). Overall, older participants at HIV diagnosis had greater odds of having 95% self-reported adherence (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.12), and African Americans had lower odds (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22–0.76) compared to Caucasians (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.52–4.28). However, there was no difference in SRA by depression trajectory. Participants with HD had an increased odds of taking ART continuously (OR 1.75, 95% CI 0.99–3.09), and those with ROD had significantly higher odds of virologic failure (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38–0.91). Conclusions Although there was no observed association between depression and SRA, participants with ROD had lower odds of attaining the HIV treatment goal of VL suppression. Continued efforts to identify and aggressively manage mental health disorders is important to success along the HIV care continuum.",

Methods We conducted a randomized control trial among adolescents and young adults on ART with VF to assess the effectiveness of a community-based peer support intervention aimed at improving VF. Viral load (VL) levels were obtained at 12, 24 and 36 weeks. A subset of the participants had baseline HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) genotyped using Sanger sequencing. Results The participants’ median (interquartile range (IQR)) age was 18.1 (IQR: 15.1–20.0) years and half (50.5%, n = 107) were male. At week 24, the proportion of subjects with a detectable viremia was significantly lower in the intervention arm than in the standard of care (SOC) arm (76.0% (n = 79) vs. 89.0% (n = 96), p = 0.013). At Week 36, there remained a difference in the proportion of subjects with a detectable VL between the intervention arm (68.3%, n = 71) and SOC arm (79.6%, n = 86), which was trending towards statistical significance (p = 0.059). There was no difference in the probability of having a detectable VL over time between the intervention and SOC groups (adjusted odds ratio: 1.14, p = 0.439). Baseline HIVDR was observed in 44.0% of the participants in the intervention and 56.0% in the SOC group (p = 0.146).

    "abstract": "HIV/AIDS is still one of the major public health concerns globally. It is one of the major contributory causes of deaths among women in the reproductive age (15-49 years) and has resulted in about 14 million orphaned children globally. Knowledge of Mother-to Child transmission is one of the strategies to fight against HIV. This study, therefore, sought to assess the knowledge and determinants of women's knowledge on vertical transmission of HIV and AIDS in their reproductive age in South Africa.Data were obtained from the South Africa Demographic and Health Survey (SADHS) 2016. Both descriptive (frequencies and percentages) and inferential analysis (multilevel mixed-effects complementary log-log regression model) were conducted and the statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.The prevalence of knowledge of mother to child transmission of HIV and AIDS during pregnancy, delivery, breastfeeding and at least knowledge of one source are 87.0%, 81.1%, 80.3% and 91.4% respectively. At the individual level, those with secondary [AOR = 1.28, CI = 1.04,1.57] and higher [AOR = 1.55, CI = 1.21,1.99], those who read newspaper less than once a week [AOR = 1.16, CI = [1.05,1.28], at least once a week [AOR = 1.14, CI = 1.04,1.25], and those who listen to the radio less than once a week [AOR = 1.22, CI = 1.03,1.43] had higher odds of knowledge on MTCT of HIV and AIDS. However, those with parity 0 [AOR = 0.73, CI = [0.63,0.85] had lower odds of knowledge of MTCT of HIV and AIDS compared with those with parity 4 or more. At the contextual level, those in the poorest wealth quintile [AOR = 0.82,CI = 0.69,0.97] had lower odds of having knowledge of MTCT of HIV and AIDS. Those in the urban areas [AOR = 1.17, CI = [1.04,1.31], those in Limpopo [AOR = 1.35, CI = [1.12,1.64], Gauteng [AOR = 1.35, CI = [1.12,1.62] and North west[AOR = 1.49, CI = [1.22,1.81] had higher odds of knowledge of mother to child transmission of HIV and AIDS.The study has demonstrated that there is relatively high knowledge of mother to child transmission of HIV and AIDS in South Africa. The factors associated with the knowledge are educational level, exposure to mass media, parity, wealth status, place of residence and the region of residence. To further increase the knowledge, it is imperative to adopt various messages and target respondents in different part of SSA through the mass media channels. This should be done taking cognizant of the rural-urban variations and socio-economic status.",

This scoping review aims to synthesize existing methods for population size estimation among key populations, and provide recommendations for future application of the existing methods. Methods Relevant studies published from 1st January 2000 to 4th August 2020 and related to key population size estimation were retrieved and 120 of 688 studies were assessed. After reading the full texts, 81 studies were further excluded. Therefore, 39 studies were included in this scoping review. Estimation methods included five digital methods, one in-person method, and four hybrid methods. Finding We summarized and organized the methods for population size estimateion into the following five categories: methods based on independent samples (including capture-recapture method and multiplier method), methods based on population counting (including Delphi method and mapping method), methods based on the official report (including workbook method), methods based on social network (including respondent-driven sampling method and network scale-up method) and methods based on data-driven technologies (Bayesian estimation method, Stochastic simulation method, and Laska, Meisner, and Siegel estimation method). Thirty-six (92%) articles were published after 2010 and 23 (59%) used multiple methods. Among the articles published after 2010, 11 in high-income countries and 28 in low-income countries. A total of 10 estimated the size of commercial sex workers, 14 focused on men who have sex with men, and 10 focused on people who inject drugs. Conclusions There was no gold standard for population size estimation. Among 120 studies that were related to population size estimation of key populations, the most commonly used population estimation method is the multiplier method (26/120 studies). Every method has its strengths and biases. In recent years, novel methods based on data-driven technologies such as Bayesian estimation have been developed and applied in many surveys.",

However, healthy behaviors including lifestyle changes can lower high cholesterol (CHOL) or high triglycerides (TG), thereby reducing individual risk for cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with high CHOL or TG among PWH in Texas. Methods Cross-sectional data of 981 PWH from the 2015–2017 Texas and Houston Medical Monitoring Projects were examined. High CHOL or TG was identified by medical chart diagnosis, CHOL or TG medication use, or most recent fasting lab ≥ 200 mg/dl (total CHOL) or ≥ 150 mg/dl (TG). High CHOL or TG associations with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were assessed using Rao-Scott chi-square tests. Prevalence of high CHOL or TG development was calculated using multivariable logistic regression model. Results High CHOL or TG prevalence was 41% with participants being mostly male (73%), ≥ 40 years (68%), with overweight (31%) or obesity (28%), and virally suppressed (62%). Compared with PWH &lt; 40 years of age, PWH in their 40s, 50s, and ≥ 60s were 57%, 64%, and 62% more likely to have high CHOL or TG, respectively. Participants with overweight and obesity were 41% and 30% more likely to have high CHOL or TG than those with normal weight (BMI: 18.5– &lt; 25), respectively. Conclusion Since high CHOL and TG are modifiable CVD risk factors, increased education and lifestyle modification interventions are warranted to prevent the development of high CHOL or TG among PWH.",

Methods We used data from a cross-sectional online survey among adult gay, bisexual, other men who have sex with men in Ontario and British Columbia, Canada. Participants were recruited 2019–2020 in-person from sexual health clinics and outreach programs, and online through dating mobile applications and websites. We used logistic regression models to explore the relationship between PrEP-related stigma and: 1-being a ‘never’ versus ‘current’ PrEP user, and 2-being a ‘former’ versus ‘current’ user. Results The median age of the sample was 32 (Q1-Q3 = 27–40), most were white born in Canada (48%), 45% had never used PrEP, 16% were former PrEP users and 39% were current PrEP users. Of 1527 individuals who started the survey, 1190 participants answered questions about PrEP-related stigma: 254 (21.3%) were classified as having low level of PrEP-related stigma, 776 (65.2%) intermediate, and 160 (13.5%) high. No significant association was found when never PrEP users and current PrEP users were compared: adjusted OR = 1.44 (95%-CI: 0.8–2.5).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Consistent and complete adherence is considered an essential requirement for patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of ART duration on ART adherence, identify the trend of complete adherence, and compare the factors associated with ART adherence between short-term and long-term ART group among men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV in Jinan of China. Methods MSM living with HIV aged 18 or above and currently on ART were recruited from October to December 2020 using convenience sampling. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used to evaluate the impact of ART duration on adherence and compare factors associated with ART adherence between subgroups. The Mann–Kendall test was used to identify the trend of complete adherence. Results A total of 585 participants were included in analysis, consisting of 352 on short-term ART (ART initiation ≤ 3 years) and 233 on long-term ART (ART initiation &gt; 3 years). Significant difference of complete ART adherence between short-term and long-term ART group was detected (79.8% vs. 69.1%, P = 0.003). Multivariable analysis showed that men with longer ART duration were less likely to report complete ART adherence (AOR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.81–0.95). A descending trend of complete adherence was identified (Z = 1.787, P = 0.037). Alcohol use and lack of medication reminders were barriers to complete adherence for both of the subgroups. Conclusions Sustained efforts to encourage maintaining adherence for a lifetime are necessary, especially for those on long-term ART. Future interventions should be tailored to subgroups with different ART duration and individuals with specific characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Psychological distress as measured by mental disorders like depression and anxiety is more prevalent in people living with HIV (PLHIV) than in the general population. However, the relationship between mental disorders and HIV is complex and bidirectional. Improved understanding of the relationship between mental disorders and HIV is important for designing interventions for this group. This paper explores the interrelationships of psychological distress with HIV and associated socio-demographic and health-related factors. Methods This secondary data analysis used the 2012 South African population-based household survey on HIV collected using a cross-sectional multi-stage stratified cluster sampling design. Generalized structural equation modelling (G-SEM) path analysis was used to explore the direct and indirect relationships of socio-demographic, health and HIV-related factors with psychological distress as measured by Kessler 10 scale using HIV status as a moderator variable. Results A total of 20,083 participants were included in the study, 21.7% reported psychological distress, of whom (32.6%) were HIV positive. In the final path model with HIV status as a moderator, psychological distress was significantly more likely among age group 25–49 years (AOR: 1.4 [95% CI 1.3–1.6]), age 50 years and older, (AOR: 1.4 [95% CI 1.2–1.6]), females (AOR: 1.6 [95% CI 1.4–1.8]), high risk drinkers (AOR: 1.9 [1.6–2.2]) hazardous drinkers (AOR: 4.4 [95% CI 3.1–6.3]), ever tested for HIV (AOR: 1.2 [95% CI 1.1–1.3]). Psychological distress was significantly less likely among the married [AOR: 0.8 (0.7–0.9)], other race groups [AOR: 0.5 (0.5–0.6)], those with secondary level education (AOR: 0.9 [95% CI 0.8–0.9]), and tertiary level education (AOR: 0.7 [95% CI 0.6–0.9]), those from rural informal [AOR: 0.8 (0.7–0.9)], and rural formal [AOR: 0.8 (0.7–0.9)] areas and those who rated their health as excellent/good [AOR: 0.4 (0.4–0.5)]. Conclusion The findings highlight the importance of designing tailored interventions targeted at psychological distress among PLHIV especially the elderly, females, those with no education and / or low education attainment and those residing in informal urban areas.",

    "abstract": "Doravirine has a unique resistance profile but how this profile might increase its usefulness beyond first-line therapy in persons with susceptible viruses has not been well studied. We sought to determine scenarios in which doravirine would retain activity against isolates from ART-naïve persons with transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and to identify gaps in available doravirine susceptibility data.We analyzed published in vitro doravirine susceptibility data and applied the results to 42,535 RT sequences from ART-naïve persons published between 2017 and 2021. NNRTI drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were defined as those with a Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database doravirine penalty score either alone or in combination with other mutations.V106A, Y188L, F227C/L, M230L, and Y318F were associated with the greatest reductions in doravirine susceptibility. However, several NNRTI DRMs and DRM combinations lacking these canonical resistance mutations had > tenfold reduced susceptibility including G190E, one isolate with G190S, three isolates with L100I + K103N, one isolate with K103N + P225H, and isolates with L100I + K103N + V108I and K101E + Y181C + G190A. Of the 42,535 ART-naïve sequences, 3,374 (7.9%) contained a NNRTI DRM of which 2,788 (82.6%) contained 1 DRM (n = 33 distinct mutations), 426 (12.6%) contained 2 DRMs (79 distinct pairs of mutations), and 143 (4.2%) contained ≥ 3 DRMs (86 distinct mutation patterns). Among the 2,788 sequences with one DRM, 112 (4.0%) were associated with ≥ 3.0-fold reduced doravirine susceptibility while 2,625 (94.2%) were associated with < 3.0-fold reduced susceptibility. Data were not available for individual NNRTI DRMs in 51 sequences (1.8%). Among the 426 sequences with two NNRTI DRMs, 180 (42.3%) were associated with ≥ 3.0 fold reduced doravirine susceptibility while just 32 (7.5%) had < 3.0 fold reduced susceptibility. Data were not available for 214 (50.2%) sequences containing two NNRTI DRMs.First-line therapy containing doravirine plus two NRTIs is expected to be effective in treating most persons with TDR as more than 80% of TDR sequences had a single NNRTI DRM and as more than 90% with a single DRM were expected to be susceptible to doravirine. However, caution is required for the use of doravirine in persons with more than one NNRTI DRM even if none of the DRMs are canonical doravirine-resistance mutations.",

This microbial translocation contributes to systemic inflammation and risk of non-AIDS comorbidities in people living with HIV, including those receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assessed whether markers of gut damage and microbial translocation were associated with cognition in ART-treated PLWH. Methods Eighty ART-treated men living with HIV from the Positive Brain Health Now Canadian cohort were included. Brief cognitive ability measure (B-CAM) and 20-item patient deficit questionnaire (PDQ) were administered to all participants. Three groups were selected based on their B-CAM levels. We excluded participants who received proton pump inhibitors or antiacids in the past 3 months. Cannabis users were also excluded. Plasma levels of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), regenerating islet-derived protein 3 α (REG3α), and lipopolysaccharides (LPS = were quantified by ELISA, while 1–3-β-D-glucan BDG) levels were assessed using the Fungitell assay. Univariable, multivariable, and splines analyses were performed. Results Plasma levels of I-FABP, REG3α, LPS and BDG were not different between groups of low, intermediate and high B-CAM levels. However, LPS and REG3α levels were higher in participants with PDQ higher than the median. Multivariable analyses showed that LPS association with PDQ, but not B-CAM, was independent of age and level of education. I-FABP, REG3α, and BDG levels were not associated with B-CAM nor PDQ levels in multivariable analyses. Conclusion In this well characterized cohort of ART-treated men living with HIV, bacterial but not fungal translocation was associated with presence of cognitive difficulties. These results need replication in larger samples.",

Considering that, the HL levels among PLWHIV needs to be further investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the levels of HL and patient involvement among PLWHIV in an outpatient clinic in Denmark. A second objective was to examine differences in HL levels across socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: In 2019, a population of 682 PLWHIV from a Danish outpatient hospital clinic were enrolled in cross-sectional study. Patients who had a digital postbox received an electronic questionnaire including following domains; health literacy, patient involvement, and socio-demographic status. Health literacy was measured using the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) through scores on three subscales: social support for health (HLQ4), engaging with healthcare providers (HLQ6), and understanding health information (HLQ9). An unpaired t-test was used to investigate mean differences in the HLQ scores across socio-demographic variables. Results: A total of 338 (55%) patients responded to the questionnaire. The included participants demonstrated high levels of HLQ4 (mean = 4.2) and HLQ6 (mean = 4.2), but lower for HLQ9 (mean = 2.9). In total 70–80% reported being involved in decisions about their health. We found a positive association between high level of HL (HLQ9) and living with a partner and higher levels of HL (HLQ4, HLQ6, and HLQ9) and employment. Conclusion: PLWHIV in a Danish out-patient care population were found to have high levels of HL despite differences in demographic characteristics. Further research is needed to examine the levels of HL among non-responders to develop HL approaches and strategies to meet the needs of individuals with different HL skills.",

However, no study has sufficiently analyzed the mediating or moderating variables of the relationship between depression and suicidal ideation in Rwanda. Objectives This study aimed to examine how complicated grief mediates and substance abuse moderates the effects of depression symptoms on suicidal ideation. Methods Data were collected from a convenient sample of 140 participants (M-age = 38.79 years, SD = 10.218) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at Remera Health Center in a cross-sectional study. Multiple linear regression and Sobel test were used to examine the relationships between depression symptoms, complicated grief, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. Results The results indicated that 29% of the sample had clinically significant symptoms of depression and 18% had suicidal ideation. The interaction between substance abuse and depression symptoms (β = .468, t = 8.02, p = 0.000) was a significant predictor, explaining the 55.7% of variance in suicidal ideation. Furthermore, the Sobel test demonstrated that complicated grief mediated the effects of depression symptoms (t = 4.67, SE = 0.0101, p ≤ 0.001) on suicidal ideation. Conclusion The results suggest that depression symptoms are associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation, and this risk significantly amplified in the presence of complicated grief and substance abuse. These findings highlight the importance of integrating mental health services, particularly those addressing depression, complicated grief, and substance abuse, into HIV care programs to mitigate the risk of suicidal ideation among PWHA.",

Methods The cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2020 to December 2021 in 16 colleges that were located in Sichuan Province, one of the high-risk areas in China. Overall 1640 male college students who reported sexually experienced were analyzed in this study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to determine factors associated with early sexual debut, multiple sexual partnership and condomless sex. Results The average age of included male students was 19.95 ± 1.56. Of them, 27.74% initiated sexual behavior early, 48.60% reported multiple sexual partnership, and 16.52% did not use condoms at the latest sexual intercourse. Students who were younger (age ≤ 19, AOR = 7.60, 95%CI: 4.84–11.93; age20-21, AOR = 3.26, 95%CI: 2.04–5.21) and self-identified as sexual minorities (AOR = 2.38, 95%CI: 1.69–3.36) were more likely to have early sexual debut. The odds of having multiple sexual partners were higher among those who were ethnic minorities (AOR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.33–2.41) and accepted extramarital sex (AOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.03–1.71). The likelihood of engaging in condomless sex at the latest sexual intercourse was lower among those who had sufficient knowledgeable about HIV (AOR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.44–0.89), were very confident in condom use efficacy (AOR = 0.26, 95%CI: 0.16–0.43) and confident (AOR = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.34–0.69). Early sexual debut was positively associated with multiple sexual partnership (AOR = 3.64, 95%CI: 2.82–4.71) and condomless sex at the latest intercourse (AOR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.07–2.20), respectively. Conclusion Early sexual debut, multiple sexual partnership and condomless sex were of considerable concern among male college students. Comprehensive sex education curricula were advised by developing customized information on HIV prevention, sexuality and empowering students with assertiveness and negotiation skills with regard to condom use during and before college.",

The incidences of total AEs between the AmB, L-AmB and ABCD group had no significant differences. The ABCD group had significantly higher incidences of hepatotoxicity and hematological toxicity than the AmB and L-AmB groups. The incidence of grade 3-4 hematological toxicity in the ABCD group was significantly higher than that in the AmB and L-AmB groups. Multinomial logistic regression models showed that compared with AmB, ABCD had a higher risk for the occurrence of grade 3-4 hematological toxicity (aOR = 43.924, 95%CI 6.296-306.418; p < 0.001). We demonstrated that ABCD was more prone to hepatotoxicity and hematological toxicity than AmB and L-AmB among AIDS patients, which is worth noting.",

    "abstract": "Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe and fatal disease if left untreated. In people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA), VL is considered an emerging opportunistic infection. The aim of this manuscript was to report a first case in Tunisia of a concomitant presentation of visceral and oral leishmaniasis in a patient LHA. A systematic review of the literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines, as well. The patient, a 43-year-old heterosexual man, treated for HIV/AIDS was referred for macrocheilitis of the upper and lower lips. A noticeable nodular and painless swelling extending to the cheeks' mucosa was noted. The patient's poor oral hygiene was evident due to the presence of multiple dental caries. Histological analysis of the biopsied lower lip sample revealed the presence of numerous Leishmania amastigotes. The diagnosis of VL was clinically confirmed by the presence of a mild splenomegaly and pancytopenia and biologically by the identification of the parasite using PCR Lei and the species L. infantum involved using RFLP-PCR and culture. The treatment consisted of an intravenous administration of liposomal Amphotericin B (Ambisome®, 40 mg/kg/weight) for a period of 6 weeks. A favorable outcome was noted after one year with the resolution of clinical symptoms and a negative Leishmania blood PCR test. After 2 years, the patient remained asymptomatic but showed a positive Leishmania blood PCR test. Dolutegravir® was introduced in the patient's ART regimen. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in Tunisia of atypical VL diagnosed through an uncommon oral location in an HIV/AIDS co-infected patient . Since VL is a severe and potentially fatal disease, it is essential for dentists to perform a thorough clinical examination and adopt a multidisciplinary approach in order to ensure an early diagnosis and an effective treatment outcome.",

    "abstract": "The impact of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) on neurocognition in Africa is a pressing public health issue, with profound implications for both individual well-being and healthcare systems across the continent. This narrative review aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between HIV infection and neurocognitive function, particularly focusing on HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and neuropathological changes. Evidence from Africa emphasizes the variability in the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment among people living with HIV. For instance, a meta-analysis showed that Central and South Africa had the highest pooled prevalence of neurocognitive impairment (NCI) (49.33%), followed by East Africa (45.04%) and West Africa (42.40%). These differences may reflect varying ART coverage, healthcare infrastructure, and the prevalence of co-infections like tuberculosis highlighting the importance of region-specific interventions and support services tailored to local contexts. Furthermore, challenges such as late diagnosis, methodological variations, treatment non-adherence, and limited access to specialized care exacerbate the burden of neurocognitive impairment in this setting. Addressing the complex intersection of HIV and neurocognition in Africa requires a multifaceted approach involving various stakeholders, including healthcare providers, policymakers, researchers, and community organizations. Enhancing awareness, education, and capacity- building initiatives can improve early detection and management of neurocognitive disorders among individuals living with HIV. Moreover, investment in infrastructure and resources for neurocognitive care, including diagnostic tools and rehabilitation services, is essential to meet the growing needs of this population. Additionally, promoting research collaboration and knowledge exchange is important for advancing our understanding of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment and developing evidence-based interventions. By fostering partnerships between academia, healthcare institutions, and governmental agencies, we can facilitate the translation of research findings into policy and practice, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals affected by HAND in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress (OS) is the imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant molecules, in favour of oxidants, that has been associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in ART-treated people living with HIV (PLWH). We aimed to assess factors associated with OS in virologically suppressed PLWH on long-term modern ART. In this cross-sectional study we evaluated OS by measuring both the levels of derivatives-reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) and the biological antioxidant potential (BAP). We also calculated the BAP/d-ROMs ratio, (OS index, OSi); a cut-off value < 7.3 indicated OS. Factors associated with OS markers were explored by linear regression model. We enrolled 299 experienced PLWH with virological suppression (HIV-RNA < 50cps/mL). The mean of the d-ROMs levels was 409 UCARR (95%CI 394–422), whereas the mean of the BAP levels was 1.809 µmol/L (95%CI 1706–1851). The OSi mean value was 4.84, and 91.6% of the participants were below the cut-off value. By regression analysis, higher production of oxidants was associated with female sex (p < 0.001), current exposition to PIs (p = 0.030) and HCV co-infection (p = 0.006). Higher antioxidant capacity was correlated with higher HDL levels (p = 0.001). A lower OSi was associated with female sex (p = 0.003) and the current use of triple vs. dual regimen (p = 0.036). The OSi correlated negatively with cholesterol levels (p = 0.002) and positively with HDL (p < 0.001). Virologically suppressed PLWH on long-term ART showed a marked OS. Female sex, the exposure to PIs, and HCV co-infection were associated with higher oxidants, while higher HDL levels were linked to better antioxidant capacity. Interestingly, dual therapy, especially INSTI-based regimens, was associated with lower oxidative stress compared to triple therapy.",

    "abstract": "In the HAART era, the incidence of HIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is decreasing. We describe cases of NHL among patients with multi-class antiretroviral resistance diagnosed rapidly after initiating newer-class antiretrovirals, and examine the immunologic and virologic factors associated with potential IRIS-mediated NHL. During December 2006 to January 2008, eligible HIV-infected patients from two affiliated clinics accessed Expanded Access Program antiretrovirals of raltegravir, etravirine, and/or maraviroc with optimized background. A NHL case was defined as a pathologically-confirmed tissue diagnosis in a patient without prior NHL developing symptoms after starting newer-class antiretrovirals. Mean change in CD4 and log10 VL in NHL cases compared to controls was analyzed at week 12, a time point at which values were collected among all cases. Five cases occurred among 78 patients (mean incidence = 64.1/1000 patient-years). All cases received raltegravir and one received etravirine. Median symptom onset from newer-class antiretroviral initiation was 5 weeks. At baseline, the median CD4 and VL for NHL cases (n = 5) versus controls (n = 73) were 44 vs.117 cells/mm3 (p = 0.09) and 5.2 vs. 4.2 log10 (p = 0.06), respectively. The mean increase in CD4 at week 12 in NHL cases compared to controls was 13 (n = 5) vs. 74 (n = 50)(p = 0.284). Mean VL log10 reduction in NHL cases versus controls at week 12 was 2.79 (n = 5) vs. 1.94 (n = 50)(p = 0.045). An unexpectedly high rate of NHL was detected among treatment-experienced patients achieving a high level of virologic response with newer-class antiretrovirals. We observed trends toward lower baseline CD4 and higher baseline VL in NHL cases, with a significantly greater decline in VL among cases by 12 weeks. HIV-related NHL can occur in the setting of immune reconstitution. Potential immunologic, virologic, and newer-class antiretroviral-specific factors associated with rapid development of NHL warrants further investigation.",

This combination did not have any effect on non-infected cells. Thus it appears that cell death is promoted only in the infected cells. It is our view that the results described in this work suggest a novel approach to specifically promote death of HIV-1 infected cells and thus may eventually be developed into a new and general anti-viral therapy.",

However, since the use of HAART, immune restoration disease (IRD) has been described in association with many OIs. Our objective was to determine the proportion of IRD, changes in CD4+ T-cell count and possible risk factors of IRD in HIV-infected patients.A retrospective study of all HIV- infected patients starting HAART between September 1, 2005 and August 31, 2006 at Zewditu memorial hospital HIV clinic, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was conducted. All laboratory and clinical data were extracted from computerized clinic records and patient charts.A total of 1166 HIV- infected patients with mean ± SD age of 36 ± 9.3 years were on HAART. IRD was identified in 170 (14.6%) patients. OIs diagnosed in the IRD patients were tuberculosis (66.5%, 113/170), toxoplasmosis (12.9%, 22/170), herpes zoster rash (12.9%, 22/170), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (4.1%, 7/170), and cryptococcosis (3.5%, 6/170). Of the 170 patients with IRD, 124 (72.9%) patients developed IRD within the first 3 months of HAART initiation. Low baseline CD4+ T-cell count (odds ratio [OR], 3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.19-4.58) and baseline extra pulmonary tuberculosis (OR, 7.7, 95% CI, 3.36-17.65) were associated with development of IRD. Twenty nine (17.1%) of the IRD patients needed to use systemic anti-inflammatory treatment where as 19(11.2%) patients required hospitalization associated to the IRD occurrence. There was a total of 8 (4.7%) deaths attributable to IRD.The proportion and risk factors of IRD and the pattern of OIs mirrored reports from other countries. Close monitoring of patients during the first three months of HAART initiation is important to minimize clinical deterioration related to IRD.",

    "abstract": "High dosage of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been observed as a possible activator of HIV gene expression in latently infected resting CD4+ T-cells, leading to a substantial decrease in both the reservoir and the residual plasma viremia when added to effective ART. IVIG treatment has also been reported to expand T regulatory cells (Tregs). The aim of this study was to evaluate possible long-term effect of IVIG treatment on residual viremia and T-lymphocyte activation.Nine HIV-infected subjects on effective ART included in a previously reported study on IVIG treatment were evaluated 48-104 weeks after therapy. In addition, 14 HIV-infected controls on suppressive ART were included. HIV-1 RNA was analyzed in cell-free plasma by using an ultrasensitive PCR-method with a detection limit of 2 copies/mL. T-lymphocyte activation markers and serum interleukins were measured.Plasma residual viremia rebounded to pre-treatment levels, 48-104 weeks after the initial decrease that was observed following treatment with high-dosage IVIG. No long-term effect was observed regarding T-lymphocyte activation markers, T-regulatory cells or serum interleukins. In a post-hoc analysis, a correlation between plasma HIV-1-RNA and CD4+ T-cell count was found in both IVIG-treated patients and controls.These results indicate that the decrease in the latent HIV-1 pool observed during IVIG treatment is transient. Although not our primary objective, we found a correlation between HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ T-cell count suggesting the possibility that patients with a higher CD4+ T-cell count might harbor a larger residual pool of latently infected CD4+ T-cells.",

    "abstract": "HIV protease (PR) is a virus-encoded aspartic protease that is essential for viral replication and infectivity. The fully active and mature dimeric protease is released from the Gag-Pol polyprotein as a result of precursor autoprocessing.We here describe a simple model system to directly examine HIV protease autoprocessing in transfected mammalian cells. A fusion precursor was engineered encoding GST fused to a well-characterized miniprecursor, consisting of the mature protease along with its upstream transframe region (TFR), and small peptide epitopes to facilitate detection of the precursor substrate and autoprocessing products. In HEK 293T cells, the resulting chimeric precursor undergoes effective autoprocessing, producing mature protease that is rapidly degraded likely via autoproteolysis. The known protease inhibitors Darunavir and Indinavir suppressed both precursor autoprocessing and autoproteolysis in a dose-dependent manner. Protease mutations that inhibit Gag processing as characterized using proviruses also reduced autoprocessing efficiency when they were introduced to the fusion precursor. Interestingly, autoprocessing of the fusion precursor requires neither the full proteolytic activity nor the majority of the N-terminal TFR region.We suggest that the fusion precursors provide a useful system to study protease autoprocessing in mammalian cells, and may be further developed for screening of new drugs targeting HIV protease autoprocessing.",

We assessed the virologic response to protease inhibitor-based ART after failing first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted at 8 Thai sites of children who switched to PI –based regimens due to failure of NNRTI –based regimens. Primary endpoints were HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml and CD4 change over 48 weeks. Results Data from 241 children with median baseline values before starting PI-based regimens of 9.1 years for age, 10% for CD4%, and 4.8 log 10 copies/ml for HIV RNA were included; 104 (41%) received a single ritonavir-boosted PI (sbPI) with 2 NRTIs and 137 (59%) received double-boosted PI (dbPI) with/without NRTIs based on physician discretion. SbPI children had higher baseline CD4 (17% vs. 6%, p &lt; 0.001), lower HIV RNA (4.5 vs. 4.9 log 10 copies/ml, p &lt; 0.001), and less frequent high grade multi-NRTI resistance (12.4% vs 60.5%, p &lt; 0.001) than the dbPI children. At week 48, 81% had HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml (sbPI 83.1% vs. dbPI 79.8%, p = 0.61) with a median CD4 rise of 9% (+7%vs. + 10%, p &lt; 0.005). However, only 63% had HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml, with better viral suppression seen in sbPI (76.6% vs. 51.4%, p 0.002). Conclusion Second-line PI therapy was effective for children failing first line NNRTI in a resource-limited setting. DbPI were used in patients with extensive drug resistance due to limited treatment options. Better access to antiretroviral drugs is needed.",

    "abstract": "HIV spread continues at high rates from infected persons to their sexual partners. In 2009, an estimated 2.6 million new infections occurred globally. People living with HIV (PLHIV) receiving treatment are in contact with health workers and therefore exposed to prevention messages. By contrast, PLHIV not receiving ART often fall outside the ambit of prevention programs. There is little information on their sexual risk behaviors. This study in Mombasa Kenya therefore explored sexual behaviors of PLHIV not receiving any HIV treatment.Using modified targeted snowball sampling, 698 PLHIV were recruited through community health workers and HIV-positive peer counsellors. Of the 59.2% sexually-active PLHIV, 24.5% reported multiple sexual partners. Of all sexual partners, 10.2% were HIV negative, while 74.5% were of unknown HIV status. Overall, unprotected sex occurred in 52% of sexual partnerships; notably with 32% of HIV-negative partners and 54% of partners of unknown HIV status in the last 6 months. Multivariate analysis, controlling for intra-client clustering, showed non-disclosure of HIV status (AOR: 2.38, 95%CI: 1.47-3.84, p < 0.001); experiencing moderate levels of perceived stigma (AOR: 2.94, 95%CI: 1.50-5.75, p = 0.002); and believing condoms reduce sexual pleasure (AOR: 2.81, 95%CI: 1.60-4.91, p < 0.001) were independently associated with unsafe sex. Unsafe sex was also higher in those using contraceptive methods other than condoms (AOR: 5.47, 95%CI: 2.57-11.65, p < 0.001); or no method (AOR: 3.99, 95%CI: 2.06-7.75, p < 0.001), compared to condom users.High-risk sexual behaviors are common among PLHIV not accessing treatment services, raising the risk of HIV transmission to discordant partners. This population can be identified and reached in the community. Prevention programs need to urgently bring this population into the ambit of prevention and care services. Moreover, beginning HIV treatment earlier might assist in bringing this group into contact with providers and HIV prevention services, and in reducing risk behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The prevention of intimate partner transmission of HIV remains an important component of comprehensive HIV prevention strategies. In this paper we examine the sexual practices of people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Papua New Guinea (PNG).In 2008, a total of 374 HIV-positive people over the age of 16 and on ART for more than two weeks were recruited using a non-probability, convenience sampling methodology. This accounted for around 18% of adults on ART at the time. A further 36 people participated in semi-structured interviews. All interviews were thematically analysed using NVivo qualitative data analysis software.Less than forty per cent (38%) of participants reported having had sexual intercourse in the six months prior to the survey. Marital status was by far the most important factor in determining sexual activity, but consistent condom use during vaginal intercourse with a regular partner was low. Only 46% reported consistent condom use during vaginal intercourse with a regular partner in the last six months, despite 77% of all participants reporting that consistent condom use can prevent HIV transmission. Consistent condom use was lowest amongst married couples and those in seroconcordant relationships. The vast majority (91.8%) of all participants with a regular heterosexual partner had disclosed their status to their partner. Qualitative data reinforced low rates of sexual activity and provided important insights into sexual abstinence and condom use.Considering the importance of intimate partner transmission of HIV, these results on the sexual practices of people with HIV on ART in PNG suggest that one-dimensional HIV prevention messages focussing solely on condom use fail to account for the current practices and needs of HIV-positive people, especially those who are married and know their partners' HIV status.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Chemokines can block viral entry by interfering with HIV co-receptors and are recognised mediators of atherosclerosis development. A number of experimental drugs that inhibit HIV entry arrest the development of atherosclerosis in animal models. We hypothesised that the expression of chemokine receptors in circulating leukocytes is associated with the rate of atherosclerosis progression in HIV-infected patients. Methods The increase in intima-media thickness during a 2-year follow-up was used to classify HIV-infected patients (n = 178) as progressors (n = 142) or non-progressors (n = 36) with respect to atherosclerosis. Logistic regression was used to assess variables associated with atherosclerosis progression. Mutations in the CCR5Δ32, CCR2 64I, and CX3CR1 (T280M and V249I) co-receptors as well as the levels of CCR5, CXCR4, CX3CR1, and CCR2 mRNA expression in circulating leukocytes were analysed as independent variables. Results Among the baseline variables, only genetic variants explained the dichotomous outcome. The expression of CCR2 and CXCR4 did not discriminate between progressors and non-progressors. Conversely, CCR5 and CX3CR1 expression was higher in not only progressors but also patients with detectable viral load. The logistic regression, however, demonstrated a significant role for CCR5 expression as a predictor of atherosclerosis progression (B = 2.1, OR = 8.1, p = 0.04) and a negligible effect for CXC3R1 and CCR2 expression. Conclusions Available CCR5 antagonists should be investigated for their potential to delay the course of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients.",

The children had CD4% and absolute CD4 counts every 12 weeks and HIV-RNA every 24 weeks until 144 weeks. ART was started when CD4% declined to < 15% or AIDS-related events developed.APOBEC3G genetic variants were performed by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Random-effect linear regression analysis was performed to correlate APOBEC3G genotypes and disease progression.147 children, 35% male, with a median (IQR) age of 6.5 (4.3-8.8) years were enrolled.

HIV-1 codon usage has been previously shown to be different from that of other viruses and man. It is evident that the antiretroviral drugs used to restrict HIV-1 replication also select for resistance variants. We wanted to test whether codon frequencies in HIV-1 sequences from treatment-experienced patients differ from those of treatment-naive individuals due to drug pressure affecting codon usage bias. We developed a JavaScript to determine the codon frequencies of aligned nucleotide sequences. Irrespective of subtypes, using HIV-1 pol sequences from 532 treatment-naive and 52 treatment-experienced individuals, we found that pol sequences from treatment-experienced patients had significantly increased AGA (arginine; p = 0.0002***) and GGU (glycine; p = 0.0001***), and decreased AGG (arginine; p = 0.0001***) codon frequencies. The same pattern was not observed when subtypes B and C sequences were analyzed separately. Additionally, irrespective of subtypes, using HIV-1 gag sequences from 524 treatment-naive and 54 treatment-experienced individuals, gag sequences from treatment-experienced patients had significantly increased CUA (leucine; p < 0.0001***), CAG (glutamine; p = 0.0006***), AUC (isoleucine; p < 0.0001***) and UCU (serine; p = 0.0005***), and decreased AUA (isoleucine; p = 0.0003***) and CAA (glutamine; p = 0.0006***) codon frequencies. Using pol and gag genes derived from the same HIV-1 genome, we show that antiretroviral therapy changed certain HIV-1 codon frequencies in a subtype specific way.",

    "abstract": "Progression rates from initial HIV-1 infection to advanced AIDS vary significantly among infected individuals. A distinct subgroup of HIV-1-infected individuals-termed viremic non-progressors (VNP) or controllers-do not seem to progress to AIDS, maintaining high CD4+ T cell counts despite high levels of viremia for many years. Several studies have evaluated multiple host factors, including immune activation, trying to elucidate the atypical HIV-1 disease progression in these patients; however, limited work has been done to characterize viral factors in viremic controllers.We analyzed HIV-1 isolates from three VNP individuals and compared the replicative fitness, near full-length HIV-1 genomes and intra-patient HIV-1 genetic diversity with viruses from three typical (TP) and one rapid (RP) progressor individuals.Viremic non-progressors and typical patients were infected for >10 years (range 10-17 years), with a mean CD4+ T-cell count of 472 cells/mm3 (442-529) and 400 cells/mm3 (126-789), respectively. VNP individuals had a less marked decline in CD4+ cells (mean -0.56, range -0.4 to -0.7 CD4+/month) than TP patients (mean -10.3, -8.2 to -13.1 CD4+/month). Interestingly, VNP individuals carried viruses with impaired replicative fitness, compared to HIV-1 isolates from the TP and RP patients (p < 0.05, 95% CI). Although analyses of the near full-length HIV-1 genomes showed no clear patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that could explain the decrease in replicative fitness, both the number of SNPs and HIV-1 population diversity correlated inversely with the replication capacity of the viruses (r = -0.956 and r = -0.878, p < 0.01, respectively).It is likely that complex multifactorial parameters govern HIV-1 disease progression in each individual, starting with the infecting virus (phenotype, load, and quasispecies diversity) and the intrinsic ability of the host to respond to the infection. Here we analyzed a subset of viremic controller patients and demonstrated that similar to the phenomenon observed in patients with a discordant response to antiretroviral therapy (i.e., high CD4+ cell counts with detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA load), reduced viral replicative fitness seems to be linked to slow disease progression in these antiretroviral-naïve individuals.",

Determining predictors of poor outcomes among HIV-infected inpatients presenting with WHO danger signs could result in improved treatment and diagnostic algorithms. We conducted a prospective cohort study of inpatients presenting with any duration of cough and WHO danger signs to two regional hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality up to 56 days post-discharge, and the secondary outcome a composite of any one of: hospital admission for > 7 days, died in hospital, transfer to a tertiary level or tuberculosis hospital. We first assessed the WHO danger signs as predictors of poor outcomes, then assessed the added value of other variables selected a priori for their ability to predict mortality in common respiratory opportunistic infections (CD4 count, body mass index (BMI), being on antiretroviral therapy (ART), hypotension, and confusion) by comparing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of the two multivariate models. 484 participants were enrolled, median age 36, 66% women, 53% had tuberculosis confirmed on culture. The 56-day mortality was 13.2%. Inability to walk unaided, low BMI, low CD4 count, and being on ART were independently associated with poor outcomes. The multivariate model of the WHO danger signs showed a ROC AUC of 0.649 (95% CI 0.582–0.717) for predicting 56-day mortality, which improved to ROC AUC of 0.740 (95% CI 0.681–0.800; p = 0.004 for comparison between the two ROC AUCs) with the multivariate model including the a priori selected variables. Findings were similar in sub-analyses of participants with culture-positive tuberculosis and with cough duration ≥ 14 days. The study design prevented a rigorous evaluation of the prognostic value of the WHO danger signs. Our prognostic model could result in improved algorithms, but needs to be validated.",

    "abstract": "Non-AIDS defining cancers (NADCs) have been an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV. There is no data on the spectrum of NADCs in Mexico. We describe the type of neoplasms, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of HIV-infected patients with NADCs.We conducted a retrospective study of all patients with confirmed diagnosis of NADC attending the HIV/AIDS clinic at the National Cancer Institute in Mexico City (a tertiary-care center for adult patients with cancer) from January 1990 to December 2016.From 1126 HIV-positive individuals seen at the institute since 1990, 127 (11.3%) were diagnosed with NADCs; seven patients developed two NADCs during their follow-up. At diagnosis of NADC median age was 43.7 ± 10.9 years; 101 (79.5%) were male; median CD4 was 273 cells/mm3, 70 patients had a CD4 count of > 200 cells/mm3, 73 had undetectable HIV viral load and 82 had taken combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) for more than 1 year. The most frequent NADCs were in men, Hodgkin lymphoma (34.3%) followed by anal cancer (15.7%), whereas in women, were vulvo-vaginal cancers associated to human papilloma virus (HPV) (51.8%), followed by breast cancer (25.9%). The main risk factor associated with death was cancer progression or relapse (OR, 28.2, 2.5-317.1; p = 0.007).HL- and HPV-related neoplasms are the commonest NADC in a cancer referral hospital from a middle-income country with universal access to cART since year 2005. Screening for early anogenital lesions should be emphasized in patients with HIV. It is essential to establish multidisciplinary groups involving Hemato-oncologists, Oncologists, Gynecologists, and HIV Specialists in the treatment of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Practical screening strategies are necessary to detect neurocognitive impairment of all severities in HIV populations, which remains prevalent despite highly active antiretroviral therapy and requires full neuropsychological testing for diagnosis. We aimed to develop a brief and clinically feasible battery to screen for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in resource-limited settings even where English is not the native language. A total of 53 outpatients were recruited from a multi-ethnic Southeast Asian HIV-positive cohort. Performance on a neuropsychological protocol was used to define cognitive impairment, of which 28 patients (52.8%) were identified with HAND. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the best combinations of cognitive tests for the screening battery. 3 different combinations of cognitive tests that required minimal literacy, time to administer, and administrator training were found to classify HAND with fair accuracy. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in combination with tests of psychomotor coordination, verbal learning and speed processing, yielded area under curve scores of above 0.75, the primary outcome of receiver operating characteristic analysis. The 3-test combinations presented in this study appear to be promising screening options for HAND in HIV-infected patients. The addition of 2 tests to MoCA improves the overall accuracy while retaining its convenience, giving more potential for the inclusion of cognitive screening in routine clinical care. Further validation of the batteries in specific settings is warranted to determine specific screening cut-offs to a global cognitive score.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Central nervous system involvement in AIDS patients can present at any stage of the disease. Brain lesions detected in imaging studies are usually treated empirically. A brain biopsy is indicated in the absence of clinical and radiologic improvement. In the present study, 16 AIDS patients underwent brain biopsy. We evaluated the diagnostic yield of the brain biopsy and the changes in the disease course. Materials and methods Sixteen consecutive AIDS patients (12 men, 4 women; mean age 40.8 years) underwent a brain biopsy at Sheba Medical Center between 1997 and 2009. A retrospective analysis was performed and the clinical outcome was recorded. Results Median CD4 count before biopsy was 62.6. Magnetic resonance images revealed multiple lesions in 12 patients and enhancing lesions in 12 patients. A total of 19 biopsies were performed in 16 patients. In the present series, the initial procedures provided a diagnostic yield of 81.25% (13 diagnostic cases from 16 procedures in 16 patients). Two of these patients underwent repeated biopsies that were eventually diagnostic . If repeated biopsies were taken into consideration, the diagnostic yield was 93.75% (15 diagnostic cases in 16 patients). The rate of hemorrhagic complications was 10.5% (2 hemorrhages in 19 procedures). Pathologic examination revealed parasitic and fungal infections in 6 patients (6/16; 38%), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in 4 patients (4/16; 25%), AIDS encephalopathy in 4 patients (4/16; 25%), and lymphoma in 1 patient (1/16; 6%). One patient had a nonspecific inflammatory process (6%). The treatment modality was modified in 12 patients and led to clinical and radiologic improvement in 8 patients. Conclusions Brain biopsy should be considered when empiric treatment of central nervous system lesions in AIDS patients fails. Biopsy is diagnostic in the majority of patients. The diagnosis allows for treatment modifications, which lead to clinical and radiologic improvement in some patients.",

    "abstract": "Codes of confidentiality play an essential role in the intimate discourses in many learned professions. Codes with various prescriptions exist. The Hippocratic Oath for example, prescribes rewards to the secret keeper, for keeping secret what ought to be kept secret, and punishments for failing. In public health practice, partner notification, arguably is one endeavor that tests the durability of this secret keeping doctrine of the health professional. We present an interest-analysis of partner notification in the context of HIV service rendition. Using principles-based analysis, the interests of the individual, the state/public health, and the bioethicist's are discussed. The public health interests in partner notification, which are usually backed by state statutes and evidence, are premised on the theory that partners are entitled to knowledge. This theory posits that knowledge empowers individuals to avoid continuing risks; knowledge of infection allows for early treatment; and that knowledgeable partners can adapt their behavior to prevent further transmission of infection to others. However, persons infected with HIV often have counter interests. For instance, an infected person may desire to maintain the privacy of their health status from unnecessary disclosure because of the negative impacts of disclosure, or because notification without a matching access to HIV prevention and treatment services is detrimental. The interest of the bioethicist in this matter is to facilitate a resolution of these conflicted interests. Our analysis concludes that governmental interests are not absolute in comparison with the interests of the individual. We reiterate that any effort to morally balance the benefits of partner notification with its burdens ought to first recognize the multivalent nature of the interests at play.",

College campuses represent a potential setting to engage young adults and institute prevention interventions including HIV testing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate testing practices for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) on college campuses. Methods Medical directors at four-year residential baccalaureate college health centers in New England were surveyed from June, 2011 to September, 2011. Thirty-one interviews were completed regarding experiences with HIV testing, acute HIV infection, other STI testing, and outreach efforts targeting specific at-risk groups such as MSM. Results Among schools that responded to the survey, less than five percent of students were tested for HIV at their local college health center in the past academic year (2010–2011). Significant barriers to HIV testing included cost and availability of rapid antibody testing. One-third of college health medical directors reported that their practitioners may not feel comfortable recognizing acute HIV infection. Conclusions Improved HIV testing practices are needed on college campuses. Programs should focus on outreach efforts targeting MSM and other at-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "Since the first HIV-1 case in 1989, Hebei province has presented a clearly rising trend of HIV-1 prevalence, and HIV-1 genetic diversity has become the vital barrier to HIV prevention and control in this area. To obtain detailed information of HIV-1 spread in different populations and in different areas of Hebei, a cross-sectional HIV-1 molecular epidemiological investigation was performed across the province. Blood samples of 154 newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals were collected from ten prefectures in Hebei using stratified sampling. Partial gag and env genes were amplified and sequenced. HIV-1 genotypes were identified by phylogenetic tree analyses. Among the 139 subjects genotyped, six HIV-1 subtypes were identified successfully, including subtype B (41.0 %), CRF01_AE (40.3 %), CRF07_BC (11.5 %), CRF08_BC (4.3 %), unique recombinant forms (URFs) (1.4 %) and subtype C (1.4 %). Subtype B was identified as the most frequent subtype. Two URF recombination patterns were the same as CRF01_AE/B. HIV-1 genotype distribution showed a significant statistical difference in different demographic characteristics, such as source (P < 0.05), occupation (P < 0.05) and ethnicity (P < 0.05). The distributions of subtype B (P < 0.05), CRF01_AE (P < 0.05), CRF07_BC (P < 0.05) and subtype C (P < 0.05) showed significant differences in all ten prefectures, and the distributions of all six subtypes were significantly different in Shijiazhuang (P < 0.05) and Xingtai (P < 0.05), but not in other prefectures (P > 0.05). The differences in HIV-1 genotype distribution were closely associated with transmission routes. Particularly, all six subtype strains were found in heterosexuals, showing that HIV-1 has spread from the high-risk populations to the general populations in Hebei, China. In addition, CRF01_AE instead of subtype B has become the major strain of HIV-1 infection among homosexuals. Our study revealed HIV-1 evolution and genotype distribution by investigating newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals in Hebei, China. This study provides important information to enhance the strategic plan for HIV prevention and control in China.",

    "abstract": "Preparing adolescents for transition into adult care and supporting their acquisition of self-health care management skills is a critical determinant of their post-transition HIV care outcomes. However, there is a scarcity of research on effective transition strategies. This study explores factors associated with adolescent preparedness for transition into adult care in Cambodia.In August 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 223 adolescents living with HIV aged 15-17, randomly selected from 11 antiretroviral therapy clinics, utilizing a structured questionnaire. The level of preparedness was determined using a pre-existing scale, and adolescents were categorized as having a high- or low level of preparedness for transition. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted.Of 223 adolescents, 55.2% were male, and their mean age was 15.8 years. Overall, 53.3% had a high level of preparedness for transition. As part of the transition protocol, 2.7% had completed a transfer form, 24.7% had a transition case manager, 29.6% had been counselled about the transition, and 19.7% had visited an adult ART clinic. In multivariate analysis, a higher level of preparedness for transition was independently associated with older age (AOR 2.44, 95% CI 1.34-4.46; p = 0.004), family having received social support for their health (AOR 5.32, 95% CI 1.97-14.36; p = 0.001), knowing the kind of treatment they received (ART) (AOR 12.67, 95% CI 2.91-15.19; p = 0.001), trust in friends or family for HIV treatment (AOR 7.82, 95% CI 1.13-8.89; p = 0.008), receiving counseling on transition (AOR 3.17, 95% CI 1.15-8.76; p = 0.03), having a 'Case Manager' identified to support them during the preparation process for transition (AOR 3.89, 95% CI 1.08-13.96; p = 0.04), and satisfaction with preparation process for transition in general (AOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.03-0.87; p = 0.01).A range of individual, social and health system and services factors may determine successful transition preparedness among adolescents in Cambodia. Strengthening implementation of age-appropriate and individualized case management transition at all sites, while creating supportive family, peer, and healthcare environments for adolescent transition is required.",

After several disappointing attempts, results of the Phase-III RV144 trial in Thailand were a beacon of hope for the field demonstrating correlation between protection and immunological markers. In order to optimize vaccine response, we underline results from yellow fever and hepatitis B vaccines, where protective responses were predicted by the pre-vaccination level of immune activation in healthy individuals. Such findings support the assessment and reduction of pre-vaccine immune activation in order to optimize vaccine response. Immune activation in healthy individuals can be influenced by age, presence of CMV infection, gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation. We speculate that the level of immune activation should therefore be assessed to better select participants in vaccine trials, and interventions to reduce inflammation should be used to increase protective HIV vaccine response.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of HIV-1 and antiretroviral treatment (ART) is strongly biased towards subtype B, the predominant subtype in North America and western Europe. Efforts to characterize the response to first-line treatments in other HIV-1 subtypes have been hindered by the availability of large study cohorts in resource-limited settings. To maximize our statistical power, we combined HIV-1 sequence and clinical data from every available study population associated with the Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) in Uganda. These records were combined with contemporaneous ART-naive records from Uganda in the Stanford HIVdb database. Treatment failures were defined by the presence of HIV genotype records with sample collection dates after the ART start dates in the JCRC database. Drug resistances were predicted by the Stanford HIVdb algorithm, and HIV subtype classification and recombination detection was performed with SCUEAL. We used Bayesian network analysis to evaluate associations between drug exposures and subtypes, and binomial regression for associations with recombination. This is the largest database of first-line treatment failures ( $$n=1724$$ ) in Uganda to date, with a predicted statistical power of 80% to detect subtype associations at an odds ratio of $$\\ge 1.2$$ . In the subset where drug regimen data were available, we observed that use of 3TC was associated with a higher rate of first line treatment failure, whereas regimens containing AZT and TDF were associated with reduced rates of failure. In the complete database, we found limited evidence of associations between HIV-1 subtypes and treatment failure, with the exception of a significantly lower frequency of failures among A/D recombinants that comprised about 7% of the population. First-line treatment failure was significantly associated with reduced numbers of recombination breakpoints across subtypes. Expanding access to first-line ART should confer the anticipated public health benefits in Uganda, despite known differences in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 subtypes. Furthermore, the impact of ART may actually be enhanced by frequent inter-subtype recombination in this region.",

    "abstract": "Owing to similar clinical presentations, as of cutaneous disease of different etiologies, and extreme rarity in the global incidence; primary cutaneous actinomycosis often remains as diagnostic challenges. Herein, we describe a case of primary cutaneous actinomycosis, erroneously treated as cutaneous tuberculosis, in a patient living with AIDS. On clinical examination, the characteristic lesion, resembling cutaneous tuberculosis, observed on the dorsum of a left leg. No other lesion elsewhere on the body was observed, however. Cytological examinations of the stabbed biopsy were negative for malignant cells; although hyper-keratosis and mild-acanthosis of epidermis, acute inflammatory infiltrates comprising plasma cell, macrophages and neutrophils were observed in the upper and mid dermis. The pus aspirated from lesion grew a molar tooth, adherent colonies in microaerophilic condition. Further, identifications and susceptibility pattern against recommended antibiotics were assessed as per the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute) guidelines. Subsequently, the case was then, diagnosed as primary cutaneous actinomycosis. Radiographic imaging of abdomen and lungs were normal; no feature of disseminated actinomycosis seen. Penicillin G followed by Penicillin V, was prescribed for 12 months. The patient underwent progressive changes and no relapse noted on periodic follow-up. The case underscores cutaneous actinomycosis requires a diagnosis consideration, especially in People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA), where myriad of opportunistic cutaneous infections are common.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The pressing need to expand the biomedical HIV prevention evidence base during pregnancy is now increasingly recognized. Women’s views regarding participation in such trials and initiating PrEP while pregnant are critical to inform evolving policy and best practices aimed at responsibly expanding evidence-based access for this population. Methods We conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with reproductive-aged women in Malawi in the local language, Chichewa. Participants were HIV-negative and purposively sampled to capture a range of experience with research during pregnancy. Women’s perspectives on enrolling in three hypothetical HIV prevention trial vignettes while pregnant were explored, testing: (1) oral PrEP (Truvada) (2) a vaginal ring (dapivirine), and (3) a randomized trial comparing the two. The vignettes were read aloud to participants and a simple visual was provided. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated, and coded using NVivo 11. Thematic analysis informed the analytic approach. Results A majority of women accepted participation in all trials. Women’s views on research participation varied largely based on their assessment of whether participation or nonparticipation would best protect their own health and that of their offspring. Women interested in participating described power dynamics with their partner as fueling their HIV exposure concerns and highlighted health benefits of participation—principally, HIV protection and access to testing/treatment and ancillary care, and perceived potential risks of the vignettes as low. Women who were uninterested in participating highlighted potential maternal and fetal health risks of the trial, challenges of justifying prevention use to their partner, and raised some modality-specific concerns. Women also described ways their social networks, sense of altruism and adherence requirements would influence participation decisions. Conclusions The majority of participants conveyed strong interest in participating in biomedical HIV prevention research during pregnancy, largely motivated by a desire to protect themselves and their offspring. Our results are consistent with other studies that found high acceptance of HIV prevention products during pregnancy, and support the current direction of HIV research policies and practices that are increasingly aimed at protecting the health of pregnant women and their offspring through responsible research, rather than defaulting to their exclusion.",

The HIV Care Continuum and HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) among FSW has not been well studied in most countries in West Africa. In the current study we describe the HIV Care continuum and prevalence of HIVDR among FSW in Guinea-Bissau. Methods A venue-based recruitment and peer-referral of FSW was used in seven cities in Guinea-Bissau from October 2014 to September 2017. We administered a questionnaire, performed discriminatory HIV-testing and collected blood specimens for CD4 count, viral load and HIVDR genotyping. Results The survey included 440 FSW. The overall HIV-prevalence among FSW was 26.8%. Of the HIV-1 (HIV-1 single- or dually HIV-1/HIV-2) infected FSW (N = 104), 58.7% were previously diagnosed with HIV-1 at enrolment and 41.4% reported taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to 28.6% of the HIV-2 single-infected FSW (N = 14). Among HIV-1 infected FSW on ART (N = 43), 55.8% were virally suppressed (&lt; 1000 copies/ml) and of all HIV-1 infected FSW, 29.8% were virally suppressed. Among ART experienced FSW (N = 22), 50.0% had HIVDR. HIVDR was also found in 9.4% of treatment naïve FSW (N = 53). Conclusion The majority of FSW who knew their HIV status received ART, however a large proportion of FSW were not aware of their HIV positive status. This translated into a great majority of the HIV-infected FSW not being virally suppressed. Amongst treatment naïve FSW nearly a tenth had HIVDR, suggesting that sexual transmission of HIVDR is occurring in this at-risk-population.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Current German and European HIV guidelines recommend early evaluation of HCV treatment in all HIV/HCV co-infected patients. However, there are still considerable barriers to initiate HCV therapy in everyday clinical practice. This study evaluates baseline characteristics, “intention-to-treat” pattern and outcome of therapy of HCV/HIV co-infected patients in direct comparison to HCV mono-infected patients in a “real-life” setting. Methods A large, single-center cohort of 172 unselected HCV patients seen at the Infectious Diseases Unit at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf from 2000–2011, 88 of whom HCV/HIV co-infected, was retrospectively analyzed by chart review with special focus on demographic, clinical and virologic aspects as well as treatment outcome. Results Antiviral HCV combination therapy with PEG-interferon plus weight-adapted ribavirin was initiated in 88/172 (52%) patients of the entire cohort and in n = 36 (40%) of all HCV/HIV co-infected patients (group A) compared to n = 52 (61%) of the HCV mono-infected group (group B) (p = 0.006). There were no significant differences of the demographics or severity of the liver disease between the two groups with the exception of slightly higher baseline viral loads in group A. A sustained virologic response (SVR) was observed in 50% (n = 18) of all treated HIV/HCV co-infected patients versus 52% (n = 27) of all treated HCV mono-infected patients (p = 0.859). Genotype 1 was the most frequent genotype in both groups (group A: n = 37, group B: n = 49) and the SVR rates for these patients were only slightly lower in the group of co-infected patients (group A: n = 33%, group B: 40% p = 0.626). During the course of treatment HCV/HIV co-infected patients received less ribavirin than mono-infected patients. Conclusion Overall, treatment was only initiated in half of the patients of the entire cohort and in an even smaller proportion of HCV/HIV co-infected patients despite comparable outcome (SVR) and similar baseline characteristics. In the light of newer treatment options, greater efforts to remove the barriers to treatment that still exist for a great proportion of patients especially with HIV/HCV co-infection have to be undertaken.",

    "abstract": "Data on the effectiveness of second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited countries of Eastern Europe is limited. Objective of this study was to evaluate virological outcomes of second-line ART in Georgia.We conducted retrospective analysis using routinely available program data. Study included adult HIV-infected patients with confirmed HIV drug resistance, who were switched to second-line ART from August 2005 to December 2010. Patients were followed until July 1, 2011. Primary outcome was achievement of viral suppression. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and adherence data were abstracted from medical and program records. Adherence was expressed as percentage based on medication refill data, and was calculated as days supply of medications dispensed divided by days between prescription fills. Predictors of primary outcome were assessed in modified Poisson regression analysis.A total of 84 patients were included in the study. Among them 71.4% were men and 62% had history of IDU. All patients were receiving non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase based regimen as initial ART. The mean 6-month adherence prior to virologic failure was 75%, with 31% of patients showing 100% adherence. All patients were switched to protease inhibitor based regimens. Patients were followed for median 27 months. Over this period 9 (10.7%) patients died. Among 80 patients remaining alive at least 6 month after ART regimen switch, 72 (90%) patients ever reached undetectable viral load. The mean first 6-month adherence on second-line treatment was 81%, with 47.5% of patients showing 100% adherence. The proportion of patients achieving viral suppression after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of second-line ART did not vary significantly ranging from 79 to 83%. Percentage of IDUs achieving viral suppression ranged from 75% and 83%. Factors associated with failure to achieve viral suppression at 6-months of second-line ART were: adherence <80% (Risk ratio [RR] 5.09, 95% CI: 1.89-13.70) and viral load >100,000 at the time of treatment failure (RR 3.39, 95% CI: 1.46-7.89).The study demonstrated favourable virological outcomes of the second-line ART in Georgia. Majority of patients, including IDUs, achieved sustained virological response over 36 month period. The findings highlight the need of improving adherence.",

The World Health Organization recommends that adherence support interventions be provided to people on ART, but implementation is suboptimal. We evaluated linkage to intensive adherence counselling (IAC) for persons on ART with detectable viral load (VL). Methods Between January and December 2017, we conducted a retrospective chart review of HIV-positive persons on ART with detectable VL (&gt; 1000 copies/ml), in Gomba district, rural Uganda. We abstracted records from eight HIV clinics; seven health center III’s (facilities which provide basic preventive and curative care and are headed by clinical officers) and a health center IV (mini-hospital headed by a medical doctor). Linkage to IAC was defined as provision of IAC to ART clients with detectable VL within three months of receipt of results at the health facility. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate factors associated with linkage to IAC. Results Of 4,100 HIV-positive persons on ART for at least 6 months, 411 (10%) had detectable VL. The median age was 32 years (interquartile range [IQR] 13–43) and 52% were female. The median duration on ART was 3.2 years (IQR 1.8–4.8). A total of 311 ART clients (81%) were linked to IAC. Receipt of ART at a Health Center level IV was associated with a two-fold higher odds of IAC linkage compared with Health Center level III (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.78; 95% CI 1.00–3.16; p = 0.01). Age, gender, marital status and ART duration were not related to IAC linkage. Conclusions Linkage to IAC was high among persons with detectable VL in rural Uganda , with greater odds of linkage at a higher-level health facility. Strategies to optimize IAC linkage at lower-level health facilities for persons with suboptimal ART adherence are needed .",

However, perceived and experienced barriers to care, including dissatisfaction with services, may impact adherence and viral suppression. We examined the associations between satisfaction with HIV care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and viral load suppression. Methods The African Cohort Study (AFRICOS) is a prospective observational study conducted at PEPFAR-supported clinics in four African countries. At enrollment and twice-yearly study visits, participants received a clinical assessment and a socio-behavioral questionnaire was administered. Participants were classified as dissatisfied with care if they reported dissatisfaction with any of the following: waiting time, health care worker skills, health care worker attitudes, quality of clinic building, or overall quality of care received. Robust Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between satisfaction with care and ART adherence and between satisfaction with care and viral suppression (viral load &lt; 1000 copies/mL). Results As of 1 March 2020, 2928 PLWH were enrolled and 2311 had a year of follow-up visits. At the first annual follow-up visit, 2309 participants responded to questions regarding satisfaction with quality of care, and 2069 (89.6%) reported satisfaction with care. Dissatisfaction with waiting time was reported by 177 (7.6%), building quality by 59 (2.6%), overall quality of care by 18 (0.8%), health care worker attitudes by 16 (0.7%), and health care worker skills by 15 (0.7%). After adjusting for age and site, there was no significant difference in viral suppression between those who were satisfied with care and those who were dissatisfied (aPR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.97–1.09). Satisfaction with HIV care was moderately associated with ART adherence among AFRICOS participants (aPR: 1.09; 95% CI 1.00–1.16). Conclusions While patient satisfaction in AFRICOS was high and the association between perceived quality of care and adherence to ART was marginal, we did identify potential target areas for HIV care improvement, including reducing clinic waiting times.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) tend to suffer from several central nervous system (CNS) infections due to hypoimmunity. However, CNS aspergillosis (CNSAG) is extremely rare and difficult to diagnose. Thus, it is easily misdiagnosed. Case presentation We reported a 47-year-old male AIDS patient with ghosting vision and anhidrosis on the left head and face. He was accordingly diagnosed with Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis (TE) at other hospitals, for which he received regular anti-Toxoplasma gondii and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) treatment. Then, the patient was transferred to our hospital due to a lack of any improvement with the prescribed treatment. The patient's neurological examination revealed no abnormalities at admission, only a slight change in the cerebrospinal fluid. His cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple abnormal signals in the brain parenchyma, and his blood was positive for Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibody. The initial diagnosis at our hospital was also TE. Considering the poor efficacy of anti-TE treatment, cerebrospinal fluid metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was performed, but no pathogenic bacteria were detected. However, Aspergillus fumigatus was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid via targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) and bronchoalveolar alveolar lavage fluid via mNGS. The diagnosis was accordingly revised to CNSAG combined with his other clinical manifestations. After administering voriconazole antifungal therapy, the patient’s symptoms were relieved, with improved absorption of the intracranial lesions. Conclusions The present case experience indicates the need for clinicians to strengthen their understanding of CNSAG. Moreover, for patients with diagnostic difficulties, early mNGS and tNGS (using biological samples with only a few pathogens) are helpful for early diagnosis and treatment, potentially allowing patients to achieve favorable outcomes.",

Its effect in PWH on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) is less clear. Methods PWH on suppressive ART (plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50copies/mL) followed at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, China were regularly screened for syphilis. Their plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell, and total lymphocyte levels before syphilis, during syphilis, and after successful treatment were compared. Results Between 2005 and 2020, 288 syphilis episodes from 180 individuals were identified; 287 episodes were related to male, with a median age of 41 at diagnosis; 221 (77%) were syphilis re-infection. The rates of plasma HIV-1 suppression were statistically unchanged across the time-points (97% pre-syphilis, 98% during syphilis, and 99% post-treatment). Total lymphocyte, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell levels decreased during incident syphilis (p&lt;0.01), and rebounded post-treatment (p&lt;0.01).

In the multivariable analysis, only pre-syphilis CD4/CD8 ratio was independently associated with increases in CD8+ T-cell (p=0.014) and total lymphocyte levels (p=0.039) during syphilis. Conclusions Among virally-suppressed PWH, total lymphocyte, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell levels declined during incident syphilis but rebounded post-treatment.

Methods Leveraging EHRs from a large clinical research network in the Southern US - OneFlorida + linked with Medicaid (updated to 08/2022) - we identified a cohort of PWH who have been prescribed at least one dose of LAI ART since January 2021 and characterized their demographics, clinical characteristics, and HIV care outcomes. Results A total of 233 LAI ART recipients were identified: 56.7% female, 45.1% aged 30 to 44, 51.3% non-Hispanic Black, 78.1% on Medicaid and 4.7% on private insurance. Approximately three-quarters of injections (71.2%) were received within 37 days of the previous dose, and 84.4% were received within 67 days. About 8% of LAI ART recipients did not have optimal care engagement the year before LAI ART initiation; one in five recipients had a diagnosis of alcohol or substance use disorder in lifetime. All achieved viral suppression (&lt; 50 copies/mL) before starting LAI ART. Of a subset of patients with HIV viral load test records, only 1 record of virologic failure (viral load &gt; 200 copies/ml) was observed after the initiation of LAI ART. Discussion There has been an increasing trend of LAI ART initiation since approval. People with suboptimal care engagement and with substance use disorder in lifetime were not excluded from LAI ART treatment.",

    "abstract": "Globally HIV remains a major public health problem. In sub-Saharan Africa most new HIV infections occur in adolescent girls and young women. Previously tested antiretroviral drugs as different pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) formulations have shown inconsistent levels of protection against HIV in African women. Besides adherence, biological factors such as drug transporter proteins are increasingly recognized as key modulators of PrEP levels. Drug transporter mRNA expression levels has been significantly correlated to altered PrEP levels in-vitro in different tissues, with inflammation identified as a further modifier of drug transporters mRNA expression and thus PrEP levels. We therefore, aimed to determine possible concordance between drug transporter mRNA expression in the female genital tract (FGT) and blood of N = 45 South African women taking oral PrEP-Truvada® [TDF/FTC)] over 6 months for HIV prevention. Additionally, we determined associations between drug transporter mRNA expression, genital inflammation, and blood-tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP). mRNA-expression of four efflux P-gp; MATE-1; MRP-2; MRP-4 and two influx OAT-1 and OAT-3 drug transporters were determined by qRT-PCR. Multiplexed technology was used to measure 27 cytokines to define genital inflammation. Significant positive correlations of mRNA expression for P-gp, MATE-1, MRP-2, and MRP-4 were observed between the FGT and blood at 3- and 6-months post-PrEP initiation (p < 0.05). For OAT-1 however, significant positive correlations were observed pre- and post-PrEP exposure (p < 0.05). Linear-mixed models showed moderate associations between FGT cytokines and drug transporter mRNA expression, with a direct relationship observed between MIP-1β concentration and MATE-1 mRNA expression. Similarly, PLS-DA showed that in women with genital inflammation, consistently higher mRNA expression of MATE-1 was observed compared to women without genital inflammation. No significant associations were observed between drug transporter mRNA expression and blood TFV-DP. Our results suggest that drug transporters may be similarly expressed in the FGT and blood. Furthermore, genital inflammation may modify PrEP levels by altering drug transporter mRNA expression. Collectively, our data may be used to better understand biological factors that may affect PrEP efficacy in African women who remain vulnerable to HIV.",

    "abstract": "Advanced HIV disease (AHD) is still a significant problem in Uganda despite the test-and-treat strategy and the increased access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Meningitis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with AHD. HIV counselling is essential and plays an important role in managing persons with AHD-related meningitis. We sought to describe the experiences and challenges we faced during counselling of these individuals, highlighting the strategies, gaps and how we can fill them. First, we describe our experience and major challenges in counselling people with AHD-related meningitis. Second, we describe the strategies we used to overcome each of these challenges. Third, we highlight the health system gaps and recommend solutions. Major challenges include the presence of altered mental status, unknown HIV status at admission, non-disclosure of HIV status to family, insufficient ART history, caretakers-related challenges, pill burden, multiple drug side effects, invasive clinical procedures, myths about medical procedures, poverty, lack of privacy during counselling in the wards, patients/caretakers seeking alternative non-medical interventions including religious, traditional, and herbal therapies before and after initiating meningitis treatment. Persons with AHD-related meningitis need daily and special consideration during counselling as part of the package of care to improve treatment outcomes.

This study compared laboratory and neuropsychiatric measures across the periods of HCV seroconversion and direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy with sustained virologic response (SVR) among PWH who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute HIV infection (AHI) and acquired HCV after 24 weeks of ART. Participants from the RV254 AHI cohort underwent paired laboratory and neuropsychiatric assessments during follow-up visits. The former included measurements of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell counts, HIV RNA, liver enzymes, and lipid profiles. The latter included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Distress Thermometer (DT), and a 4-test cognitive battery that evaluated psychomotor speed, executive function, fine motor speed, and dexterity. The raw scores in the battery were standardized and averaged to create an aggregate performance (NPZ-4) score. Parameters of HCV-coinfected participants were compared across the periods of HCV seroconversion and DAA treatment. Between 2009 and 2022, 79 of 703 RV254 participants acquired HCV after ≥ 24 weeks of ART; 53 received DAA, and 50 (94%) achieved SVR. All participants were Thai males (median age: 30 years); 34 (68%) denied past intravenous drug use, and 41 (82%) had a history of other sexually transmitted infections during follow-up. Following SVR, aspartate transferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) decreased (p < 0.001), while total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides increased (p < 0.01). The median CD4 + /CD8 + ratio increased from 0.91 to 0.97 (p = 0.012). NPZ-4 improved from 0.75 to 0.91 (p = 0.004). The median DT score increased from 1.7 to 2.7 (p = 0.045), but the PHQ-9 score remained unchanged. HCV coinfection is common in this group of high-risk PWH, highlighting the need for regular screening, early diagnosis, and treatment. The study participants exhibited a modest improvement in the CD4 + /CD8 + T-cell ratio and cognitive performance following DAA therapy and SVR. Future studies should examine potential neuropsychiatric impacts during early HCV infection as well as the longer-term neuropsychiatric outcomes after DAA treatment with SVR.",

    "abstract": "The burden of HIV remains disproportionally high among the adolescent girls and young women. This is often coupled with nondisclosure of HIV status partly due to delayed knowledge of HIV status which affects entry into HIV prevention interventions. HIV self-testing which provides instant knowledge of HIV status is being promoted to enable early disclosure. However, previous studies about the association between HIV self-testing (HIVST) and HIV disclosure are scarce. We, therefore, set out to determine the prevalence of HIVST, nondisclosure of HIV status to male partners, and the predictors among adolescent girls and young women living with HIV (AGYWLHIV) in Uganda. In a cross-sectional study design, a stratified random sample of AGYWLHIV were recruited from ART clinics in semi-rural northern Uganda between November 2022 and April 2023. The participants received an interviewer-administered questionnaire. HIV self-testing was defined as the use of the HIVST method by the AGYWLHIV to discover their HIV status. Similarly, HIV nondisclosure was defined as the AGYWLHIV's failure to disclose her initial HIV status to her current male sexual partner before their first sexual intercourse regardless of the use of condoms. A total of 423 participants with a mean age of 21.6 ± 2.5 years participated in the study. The study found that only 3.8% of the AGYWLHIV discovered their HIV status through HIVST. Furthermore, 26.7% of the AGYWLHIV did not disclose their status to their current male partners, 35.5% experienced non-disclosure from their current male partners, and 16.5% experienced bidirectional non-disclosure. The predictors for non-disclosure of initial HIV status were found to include the AGYWLHIV's knowledge of their initial negative HIV status [APR 0.3 (0.2–0.5), p 0.001], the AGYWLHIV's knowledge of their initial positive HIV status [APR 0.5 (0.3–0.7), p 0.002], the AGYWLHIV's prior knowledge of the positive initial HIV status of the male partner [APR 0.4 (0.2–0.8), p 0.010] and the male partner's nondisclosure of their initial HIV status to the AGYWLHIV [APR 2.0 (1.2–3.5), p 0.008]. The prevalence of HIVST and HIV nondisclosure to male sexual partners among the AGYWLHIV in semi-rural Uganda stood at 38 in 1000 and 267 in 1000 respectively. The HIVST wasn't associated with HIV nondisclosure but the women's initial negative or positive HIV status, the male partner's initial positive HIV status and the male partners' nondisclosure of their initial HIV status to the AGYWLHIV were found to be independent predictors. These findings point to the need for health workers to target the distribution of HIVST kits at the AGYWLHIV attending ART clinics to give them to men in their sexual and social networks to expand access to HIV testing, improve chances of two-way HIV disclosure and entry into the HIV prevention, treatment, and care services.",

This study described temporal trends from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation from 2013 to 2023 and its associated factors. Adults (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with HIV after 2013 in a regional observational cohort were included. Fine and Gray competing risk regression examined predictors of ART initiation (≥ 3 antiretroviral medications), accounting for those lost to follow-up or deceased before treatment considered as competing risks. Among 14,968 participants, most were male (70.1%), with a median age of 36 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 28-44). At HIV diagnosis, median CD4 count was 208 cells/µL (IQR: 69-395), and median viral load was 86,296 copies/mL (IQR: 13,186-392,000). Over 85% of participants had initiated ART during the study period. Median time from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation differed across years of HIV diagnosis: 51 days (2013-2015), 28 days (2016-2019), and 26 days (≥ 2020). Factors associated with shorter time to ART initiation were higher country income-level (upper-middle: sub-distribution hazard ratio [SHR] = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.40; high: SHR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.43; vs. lower-middle); HIV transmission via male-to-male contact (SHR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.11) or injection drug use (SHR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.38; vs. heterosexual contact); and later years of HIV diagnosis (2016-2019: SHR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.38; ≥ 2020: SHR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.48; vs. 2013-2015). Those with higher CD4 counts had longer time to ART start (350-499 cells/µL: SHR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.86; > 500 cells/µL: SHR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.61; vs. CD4 < 200 cells/µL). Time to ART initiation from HIV diagnosis decreased after 2016, aligning with evolving WHO guidelines, and did not appear to be impacted by COVID-19. Optimizing treatment initiation during the treat-all era is crucial, especially among those with higher CD4 counts.",

Analyses so far have not accounted for the sampling design of the enrolled cohort. We performed a sample-weighted re-analysis of the primary outcome of the PopART trial to derive a population-based estimate of the intervention effect. Methods Enrollment used a two-stage sampling design: household and adult participant within each household. We constructed post-stratification weights to match the age and sex distribution of the target population in these communities. Weighted Poisson regression was used to estimate community-level HIV incidence. The PopART intervention effect was estimated using log-transformed community-level incidence estimates in an ANCOVA model. Results The analysis based on community-level incidence shows a 25% reduction in incidence for Arm B communities compared to standard of care (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.56–1.02, p = 0.06) while Arm A communities show no difference in HIV incidence compared to standard of care (RR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.81–1.46, p = 0.56). Conclusions Our re-analysis shows 25% reduction in HIV incidence comparing Arm B to Arm C communities. No effect was observed comparing Arm A communities to Arm C communities. These results align with the primary results of the PopART trial. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01900977, HPTN 071 [PopArt].",

This study examined the impact of this new service delivery approach on adherence among patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Imo state, Nigeria. This was a cross sectional study carried at one tertiary and three secondary care hospitals selected across the state using a questionnaire. The study examined patients in three differentiated care models, and the usual care group. Collated data were analysed using the statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) version 24, at p ≤ 0.05 and 95% confidence level. A total of 542 questionnaires were successfully retrieved from the respondents. The female gender was predominant in all the groups, accounting for total average of 70.8%. The percentage of respondents with optimum adherence score (≥ 96.6%) for multi-months scripting, fast track, support group, and usual care groups were 70.6,69, 97.4, 59.1 respectively. Of all the groups, the support group had the highest adherence to ART. Forgetfulness, traveling, avoidance of side effects, and feeling sick topped the reasons adduced for missing drugs. Age, place of residence, occupation and engagement of voluntary activities were socio-demographics influencing adherence. Adherence had significant association with the viral load suppression (Odds ratio = 3.147, p < 0.05, 95% C.I 2.025–4.891). The study demonstrated that the adoption of differentiated care has enhanced patients' adherence to ART which differed across the models. There is need for continual counseling and support to the patients by healthcare providers so as to further improve adherence.",

    "abstract": "Adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) aged 10-19 years endure sub-optimal viral load suppression (VLS) and retention in care in many settings. We implemented operation triple zero (OTZ) in The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) Soroti and Mbale Centers of Excellence (COEs) to improve VLS and retention. Thus, this study evaluated the contribution of OTZ to improving both treatment outcomes among the ALHIV in the two COEs at one year. This before and after study used Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to guide secondary data collection from the cohort of ALHIV active in care in the April-June 2022 quarter. Effectiveness was determined by computing the overall VLS rates basing on plasma RNA copies below 1000/ml while retention was based on being active in care at the end of June 2024. A self-report was used to gather fidelity data. Univariates were summarized as frequencies and proportions, Generalized Equation Estimate (GEE) to compute the effect of the model and associated factors at 95% confidence interval and P < 0.05 level of significance. Odds ratio was used to report levels of predictability. Out of the original 533 ALHIV, 510 were considered for the post-intervention analysis, 53.1% females, mean age of 15.27 (Standard deviation = 2.15). Overall, retention at 12 months improved from 95.9 to 97.3% while VLS from 84 to 92.7% [adjusted OR 1.26 95%CI (0.61-2.61) P = 0.036]. Importantly, there was zero death in the one year of implementation. After adjusting for confounders, adolescents in the facility-based group (FBG) were more likely to be retained in care [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)7.36 95% CI (2.35-23.10) P = 0.001]. Also, multi-month dispensing [aOR 11.65 95%CI (2.93-46.34) P < 0.001] and being in FBG [aOR 9.87 95%CI (4.08-23.88) P < 0.001] and community-based models [aOR 21.96 95%CI (2.68-179.84) P = 0.004] were predictive of good VLS while poor adherence [aOR 0.02 95%CI (0.0037-0.11) P < 0.001] and being male [aOR 0.5 95%CI (0.27-0.91) p = 0.024] were predictors of poor VLS. Fidelity was good, at 80%. OTZ contributed to improved VLS in the setting possibly due to fidelity of enhanced implementation of adolescent friendly health services. We encourage OTZ adaptation in similar settings to strengthen improvements in VLS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The option B + prevention of mother to child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus is the lifelong provision of antiretroviral therapy for all human immunodeficiency virus positive pregnant and breastfeeding women regardless of immune status. In Ethiopia, the overall mother-to-child transmission rate of human immunodeficiency virus was 15.9%. This study assessed determinants of human immunodeficiency virus infection among infants born to human immunodeficiency virus positive women on option B + prevention of mother to child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus in Tigray, north Ethiopia. Methods Unmatched case-control study was conducted in Tigray region from October 2023 to April 2024. A total of 43 cases and 129 controls were selected using simple random sampling technique. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify the factors associated with mother to child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus at P &lt; 0.05. Multicolinearity was checked among predictor variables using Variance Inflation Factor and Tolerance test. Furthermore, the goodness of fit of the logistic model was tested using Hosmer-Lemshow test. Results This study showed that rural residence (Adjusted Odds ratio: 33.3, 95% CI: 1.02–87.05), World Health Organization disease stage III (Adjusted Odds ratio: 57.4, CI: 9.25– 297.54) and IV (Adjusted Odds ratio: 78.9, CI: 12.64–345.62) during initiation of antiretroviral therapy and a child with mouth ulcer during exclusive breastfeeding (Adjusted Odds ratio: 65, IC: 6.39–456.23) were the factors significantly associated with mother to child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. Besides, mothers’ educational status (Adjusted Odds ratio: 0.2, CI: 0.04, 0.35), late time of antiretroviral therapy initiation after human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis (Adjusted Odds ratio: 0.14, CI: 0.02–0.18) and absence of human immunodeficiency virus exposed infant follow up visit (Adjusted Odds ratio: 0.04, IC: 0.005–0.09) had significant association with the mother to child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. Conclusion The determinant factors significantly associated with mother to child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus were identified. Health care providers should strengthen option B + prevention mother to child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus services to reduce the mother to child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus.",

This study assessed the impact of DSD models on Quality of life, loss to follow-up (LTFU), and mortality among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) on Antiretroviral therapy (ART) over time at a large urban HIV clinic in Uganda. Records of 1,000 PLHIV enrolled in a 10-year cohort at the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) clinic in Kampala, Uganda were retrospectively analyzed. QoL was assessed using an adapted Medical Outcomes Study (MOS-HIV) tool. QoL scores, sustained annual viral suppression (< 200 copies/mL), all-cause mortality and LTFU (≥ 3 months of missed visits) were compared for PLHIV in three DSD models for ≥ 6 consecutive months-fast-track drug refill (FTDR), facility-based groups (FBG), and composite model combining these two-versus facility-based individual management (FBIM) or the standard of care (SOC). Inverse probability treatment weighting was applied for covariate comparability while robustness of results was checked using G-computation. Sustained viral suppression was compared using odds ratios; all-cause mortality and LTFU were compared using hazard ratios from the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Of the 1,000 PLHIV, 980 had ≥ 1 follow-up and were included in the analysis. Median age was 45 years (IQR: 40-51), 62% were female, and 95% had a suppressed viral load at baseline. Baseline QoL was 90.1% in any DSD model vs. 89.2% in SOC. After eight years of follow-up, weighted mean QoL was higher in participants enrolled in DSD models than the SOC (90.4% vs. 89.1%; weighted mean ratio 3.66, 95% CI 2.10-6.37, p-value < 0.001); there were no statistical differences across DSD models. Participants in DSD models were more likely to have sustained viral suppression (weighted odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.24-2.31), lower mortality (weighted hazard ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.03-0.20) and lower LTFU rates (weighted hazard ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.31). DSD models were associated with modestly higher quality of life, better viral suppression, and lower mortality and LTFU compared to the standard of care. These findings support the broader adoption of DSD models in delivering ART across HIV programs to enhance the QoL and clinical outcomes among PLHIV.",

HIV patients were propensity-matched to individuals from our non-HIV cohort (1:1 ratio) based on variables such as age (every 5 year), sex, ethnicity, race, and relevant comorbidities. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was utilized to assess the impact of variables on uveitis risk, reporting hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests were applied to estimate the cumulative incidence of uveitis. Statistical significance was set at a two-sided p-value < 0.05. We found that adult patients with HIV infection had a significantly increased risk of developing uveitis compared to non-HIV counterparts, with an overall HR of 3.02 (95% CI: 2.70 - 3.39). The risk remained elevated across designated follow-up intervals of 1 year (HR = 4.68 [3.69 - 5.92]), 2 years (HR = 4.44 [3.65 - 5.41]), and 3 years (HR = 4.06 [3.42 - 4.81]), with consistent increases noted when dividing into different uveitis types except for anterior uveitis. The risk was higher among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) compared to asymptomatic HIV (HR = 2.64 [1.30 - 5.35]). Furthermore, HIV patients receiving treatment within three months exhibited a notably increased risk (HR = 2.87 [2.33 - 3.54]). This study reveals that individuals with HIV face a significantly heightened risk of developing uveitis. Our findings indicate that this risk is most substantial for intermediate and posterior uveitis, challenging the long-held belief that anterior uveitis is the predominant form in this population.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, owing to the implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has become a manageable chronic disease. Consequently, the quality of life (QOL) of people living with HIV (PLWH) has warranted increasing attention. Although a substantial number of articles on QOL among PLWH have been published, statistical analysis of the data presented in these publications remains lacking. This study aimed to identify and analyze emerging trends and collaborative networks in research on the QOL of PLWH. Research publications on the QOL of PLWH from 1992 to 2025 were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection. After screening and deduplication, the following bibliometric data were extracted from each article: title, abstract, keywords, authors, affiliations, geographic origin (countries/regions), publication year, journal name, and references. Various scientometric mapping tools-including Microsoft Office Spreadsheet, VOSviewer, and the Bibliometrix R-package-were used to analyze basic bibliometric parameters, leading contributors, high-impact keywords, and research trends. A total of 6,163 publications met the inclusion criteria. Over the past 33 years, the annual number of publications has shown an overall upward trend. The United States had the highest number of publications (n = 2,432) and the highest total link strength (TLS = 1,798) in collaborative research. The University of California, San Francisco, served as the core institution, and PLOS ONE was the most prolific journal. Wu AW was identified as a core member of the industry collaboration network. By combining keyword co-occurrence and co-citation analyses, this study found that clinical concerns (e.g., antiretroviral therapy adherence, depression, anxiety) remained prominent, while stigma, healthcare access, and age-related impairments emerged as the latest hotspots with strong burst strength. This bibliometric analysis highlights the growing importance of QOL research in the field of PLWH, which can inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to prioritize areas for future investigation in order to develop comprehensive, patient-centered strategies. The findings advocate for appropriate resources for interventions that benefit HIV populations and a better understanding of the psychosocial needs of PLWH to improve their QOL.",

However, it is not yet available through the Thai National AIDS Program (NAP). This study assessed Thai YLHIV attitudes toward LA-CAB/RPV and identified the proportion of medically eligible YLHIV within the NAP. Two cross-sectional studies were conducted, the first study conducted in an HIV clinic in Bangkok involving YLHIV aged 13-24 years, assessing attitudes via questionnaires. The second study analyzed medical eligibility among 14,670 youth aged 12-24 years in the NAP, defined by current HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml, no prior treatment failure (HIV RNA < 1,000 copies/ml) and no suspected archived resistance to CAB/RPV. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with willingness and eligibility. From April to June 2024, 100 YLHIV (median age 20 years; IQR 19.0-21.7) were enrolled, 71% had non-perinatally acquired HIV (non-PHIV). Overall, 85% expressed willingness to use LA-CAB/RPV. Non-PHIV youth showed significantly higher interest (93.0% vs. 65.5%); OR 6.9 [95% CI: 2.1-22.8], despite a shorter median treatment duration (2.7 vs. 14.3 years). LA-CAB/RPV was considered more convenient than pills by 76%, although 42% anticipated injection-site reactions. Among YLHIV in the NAP (median age 22 years; IQR 20-23), 64% were medically eligible, non-PHIV youth also had a higher eligibility proportion (70% vs. 32%) with an aOR 2.0 [95% CI: 1.7-2.4]. The majority of Thai YLHIV showed positive attitudes towards LA-CAB/RPV, with two-thirds meeting medical eligibility criteria.

    "abstract": "The introduction of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits has revolutionized HIV prevention by offering a confidential and accessible option, particularly for vulnerable groups. Despite this, uptake varies widely due to multiple influencing factors. In Tanzania, where HIV prevalence among women remains high, the determinants of HIVST use are not well understood. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS), aiming to identify key predictors of HIVST uptake among women of reproductive age. This study conducted a cross-sectional analysis using 2022 TDHS data. Data management and analysis were performed using Stata 18. Given the survey's complex design, a multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of HIVST kit use, with results presented as adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The prevalence of HIVST kit usage among women of reproductive age in Tanzania was 3.2% (95% CI: 2.8-3.7%). Individual-level factors associated with a higher likelihood of HIVST kit use included age, 25-34 (AOR = 1.93, 95%CI: 1.43-2.60) and 35-49 (AOR = 1.60, 95%CI:1.43-2.26), secondary/higher education (AOR = 2.77, 95%CI: 1.57-4.85), belonging to the rich wealth quintile (AOR = 2.69, 95%CI: 1.52-4.77), internet use (AOR = 3.04, 95%CI: 2.04-4.52), awareness of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (AOR = 2.03, 95%CI: 1.21-3.42), and one or higher number of sexual partners. At the community level, geographical zone was associated with increased odds of use, while living in a high poverty level community (AOR = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.30-0.89) was associated with a lower likelihood of HIVST kit use. This study highlights a low uptake of HIVST kits among reproductive-aged women in Tanzania, driven by both individual and community factors. Higher education and STI awareness significantly increase HIVST use, indicating the need for education and targeted health communication. Additionally, community poverty underscores the importance of economic empowerment and resource support to improve access. Addressing these factors can help tailor interventions to boost HIVST uptake and reduce HIV transmission in Tanzania.",

    "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains at the epicentre of the global HIV epidemic and faces a decisive moment in its journey toward achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress toward these targets in SSA, identifying key challenges, barriers to viral load suppression, and potential strategies to improve treatment adherence and health outcomes. These goals—ensuring that 95% of people living with HIV know their status, 95% of those diagnosed are receiving treatment, and 95% of those receiving treatment achieve VLS—represent a bold vision to end HIV as a public health threat by 2030. However, across the region, progress is threatened by persistent structural barriers, entrenched stigma, health system weaknesses, and recent global funding disruptions, including the 2025 freeze on U.S. foreign aid. This review explores the multifaceted obstacles that continue to hinder the HIV response in SSA, from testing gaps to challenges in care retention and VLS, particularly among vulnerable populations. It further examines the potential consequences of funding cuts for health system resilience and epidemic control. Emphasising the need for equity-driven, locally adapted, and innovative strategies—such as community-based service delivery, digital health tools, long-acting therapies, and integrated care models—this article argues for renewed political commitment, sustainable financing, and stronger local and global partnerships. When setbacks loom large, this piece calls for urgent, coordinated action to protect progress, address persistent inequities, and secure a future where epidemic control is truly within reach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background While non-disclosure of HIV status may protect people living with HIV (PLWH) against stigma, discrimination, and violence, disclosure may facilitate access to social support and improve treatment adherence. This study examined factors associated with non-disclosure among recently-diagnosed PLWH at IeDEA study sites in Cameroon. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults ≥ 19 years newly enrolling in HIV care at three Cameroon hospitals from January 2016 to June 2023 with recent (&lt; 1 year) diagnoses and no evidence of prior HIV care. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with non-disclosure of HIV status at the time of enrolment. Results Among 2880 participants, the overall prevalence of HIV status non-disclosure at enrolment was 34.4%, ranging from 48.0% among those enrolling on the day of diagnosis to 18.7% among those enrolling &gt; 30 days after diagnosis. Men and single participants had higher odds of non-disclosure compared with women (aOR: 1.68; 95% CI 1.38, 2.04) and those who were married/living with a partner (aOR: 1.66; 95% CI 1.36, 2.02). Those with early-stage HIV disease (WHO Stage 1 or 2 or CD4 ≥ 200 cells/mm 3 ) also had higher odds of non-disclosure (aOR: 1.48; 95% CI 1.20, 1.83) compared with participants with advanced-stage disease. Conclusion Among those diagnosed with HIV within 1 year prior to enrolment, men, single/unmarried people, and those with early-stage HIV disease were less likely to disclose their status. Further research on barriers to status disclosure among these groups is needed to guide disclosure support and counselling interventions.",

Despite the effective roll-out of free life-prolonging antiretroviral therapy (ART) in public clinics of South Africa since 2004 and the proven efficacy of ART, some people living with HIV (PLHIV) become lost to follow-up (LTFU) from treatment for various reasons. This study aimed to explore and describe the follow-up care experiences of clients on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa. The researcher selected a qualitative research approach, used an exploratory and descriptive research design, collected data using in-depth unstructured interviews, and analysed data using thematic analysis. The ART clients were selected using purposive sampling, and data were collected from a sample of fifteen individuals at a primary healthcare facility to a point of data saturation. The study revealed two categories of findings, personal experiences and healthcare services experiences. On a personal level, ART clients experienced fear of disclosing HIV status, stigma, increased non-adherence to HIV treatment influenced by alcohol use, communication problems with healthcare providers, medication side effects, and challenges with transportation to access primary healthcare (PHC) facilities. The healthcare systems were negatively experienced due to factors such as prolonged waiting times, a shortage of healthcare providers, staff attitude, facility operating hours, and a lack of integration in clinical healthcare services. The study showed that ART clients choose alternative treatment sites where they receive better services, including non-biomedical settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The HIV epidemic in Africa is still a serious public health concern, particularly for children who are more vulnerable to its negative consequences. Various studies carried out in different African nations have shown associations between these variables and increased mortality risk in children receiving antiretroviral therapy. However, the magnitude and consistency of these effects across different settings in Africa remain unclear, with a few studies reporting nonsignificant effects of advanced disease stage and immunological factors on mortality. This review is the first to provide a thorough analysis of the determinants of HIV-related mortality in children. Methods This review followed the PRISMA guidelines, and relevant studies were obtained from the PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases. Study selection, data extraction, and quality evaluation were carried out separately by two reviewers. A heterogeneity-based meta-analysis was conducted using random effect models. A sub group analysis was done based on age group and country. Results A total of 36 studies involving 198,957 study participants were included in the review. Advanced disease stage (WHO III/IV) (HR 3.45; 95% CI 2.17–5.48), TB coinfection (HR 2.12; 95% CI 1.53–2.92), opportunistic infections (HR 2.04; 95% CI 1.59–2.62), immunosuppression (HR 2.50; 95% CI 2.01–3.11), and poor medication adherence (HR 3.36; 95% CI 2.10–5.38) and lack of cotrimoxazole use (HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.14–4.26) were significantly associated with a greater risk of HIV-related mortality. Conclusion This review revealed key clinical, immunological, and treatment-related predictors of HIV-related mortality in children in Africa, including advanced disease stage, TB co-infection, immunosuppression, poor adherence, and lack of cotrimoxazole use. To reduce HIV-related child mortality in Africa, health policies should strengthen pediatric HIV care through context-specific service delivery. This includes early identification of advanced disease, management of opportunistic infections, access to cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, and age-appropriate adherence support, especially in under-resourced settings.",

However, pediatric patients with primary immunodeficiency may develop severe and even fatal disease due to COVID-19. We report the case of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure in a 3.5-month-old infant with the diagnosis of vertical HIV transmission at disease presentation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mother had received antiretroviral therapy from the third trimester of pregnancy and the infant had received dual neonatal prophylaxis. The first two postnatal HIV-RNA screenings immediately after birth and at the age of seven weeks were negative in this infant and follow-up screening had been planned at the age of 4 months. With the description of the disease presentation and clinical course, we intend to underscore awareness regarding the possibility of delayed diagnosis of vertical HIV transmission after previous antiretroviral drug exposure. We also demonstrate the delay in prevention of vertical transmission due to COVID-19 related pandemic barriers, which underscores the need for continuation of preventive services under all circumstances. Furthermore, this is the first pediatric report describing severe COVID-19 associated morbidity during immunocompromise caused by HIV.",

    "abstract": "Albuminuria predicts end-organ dysfunction in the general population. Its detection in people living with HIV (PLWH) is understudied, despite their heightened risk for end-organ dysfunction. We assessed agreement between albumin‒creatinine ratio (ACR) and urine albumin (UA) tests for albuminuria in a cohort of PLWH in Botswana, where females are more affected by HIV than males. We used cross-sectional convenience sampling to enrol 1533 virally suppressed adults aged ≥ 21 years who were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Gaborone, Botswana. We measured urine creatinine levels using a colorimetric assay (Jaffe method) and UA levels using an immunoturbidimetric assay. The UA was used due to it being less costly and simpler, making it more feasible for routine use in resource-limited settings compared to the ACR. We defined albuminuria as 30mg/g versus 30 mg/Lusing ACR and UA levels respectively. Agreement between the two tests was assessed using Cohen's kappa for the entire cohort and then separately by sex groups. The optimal UA cut-off point that matched the sex-specific ACR was assessed using Youden's J index. The ACR detected similar proportion of participants with albuminuria as UA test (17.1% versus 17.6%). There was moderate agreement in the detection of albuminuria using the ACR versus UA test in the entire cohort, among males and females with Kappa statistics of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.76; P < 0.001), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.80; P < 0.001), and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.76; P < 0.001) respectively. Using Youden's J, the optimal cut points for UA levels were 17.9 mg/L (sensitivity = 88.9%, specificity = 87.3%, AUC = 0.94), 25.0 mg/L (sensitivity = 90.4%, specificity = 90.1%, AUC = 0.94) and 15.1 mg/L (sensitivity = 89.7%, specificity = 87.5%, AUC = 0.94) for the entire cohort, males only and females only, respectively. UA and ACR show moderate agreement overall. Optimal UA cutoffs differ slightly by sex, suggesting tailored thresholds may improve detection. Future studies should explore clinical indication(s) for using the ACR versus UA levels among PLWH.",

However, for potential study communities the meaning of HIV cure-related research needs to be fully understood. Methods We conducted qualitative research in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa investigating the knowledge and understanding of HIV cure. We used deliberative approaches to facilitate in-depth discussions. Five deliberative group discussions were conducted in IsiZulu (the local language) with five participants in each group. Data were audio-recorded and translated verbatim and transcribed into English in anonymised format. Data were later analysed thematically with three main themes identified: knowledge of HIV cure, HIV cure terminology and HIV cure trials. Results Our findings showed that participants had a limited understanding of HIV cure-related research, a lack of trust regarding HIV cure science and participating in future cure trials. There were no local language terms used to describe HIV cure terminology, although several suggestions were shared in the discussions. Conclusions Understanding the level of knowledge of rural populations regarding HIV cure-related research is essential for tailoring research and intervention strategies that meet their specific needs and circumstances. This can increase participation in the research and inform future HIV cure strategies.",

There were 17 (40%, 95% CI 26%-57%) mild AEs and 7 (17%, 95% CI 7%-31%) moderate AEs. There were no serious adverse events and no AEs judged probably or definitely related to product use. Genitourinary discomfort was reported by 2/30 (6.67%) participants in the low-risk cohort as compared to 4/12 (33.3%) women in the high-risk cohort (p = 0.03). Intermenstrual bleeding was reported in 2/30 (6.7%, 95% CI 1.0-22.1) women from the low risk cohort and 3/12 (25%, 95% CI 5.5-57.2) women from the high-risk cohort. One participant showed mild elevation of blood gamma glutamyl transferase and two showed mild elevations in total bilirubin. None of the participants showed detectable PRO 2000 in their blood after 14 days of product use.0.5% PRO 2000 Gel appeared to be safe when used twice-daily by sexually active HIV-uninfected women from Pune, India. Although genitourinary discomfort and metrorrhagia were more common in the high-risk cohort, ongoing Phase II/IIb trial would provide data for generalization of this finding.",

This is mainly due to the co-circulation of other genetic subtypes that potentially can recombine to generate recombinant/mosaic genomes. In this study, we report detail genetic characterization of HIV-1 envelope sequences from North India (Delhi and neighboring regions). Six of 13 were related to subtype C, one B and the rest six showed relatedness with CRF02_AG strain. The subtype C possessed the highly conserved GPGQ motif but subtype B possessed the GPGR motif in the V3 loop as observed earlier. While most of the sequences suggested CCR5 co-receptor usage, one subtype C sample clearly indicated CXCR4 usage. A successful mother to child transmission was established in two pairs. Thus, co-circulation of multiple subtypes (B and C) and the recombinant CRF02_AG strains in North India suggests a rapidly evolving scenario of HIV-1 epidemic in this region with impact on vaccine formulation. Since this is the first report of CRF02_AG envelope from India, it will be important to monitor the spread of this strain and its impact on HIV-1 transmission in India.",

There is hence an urgent need to map out cellular tropism of a country’s circulating HIV strains to guide the impending use of CCR5 antagonists. Objectives To determine HIV-1 coreceptor usage among patients attending a comprehensive care centre in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods Blood samples were obtained from HIV infected patients attending the comprehensive care centre, Kenyatta National Hospital in years 2008 and 2009. The samples were separated into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Proviral DNA was extracted from PBMCs and Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) done to amplify the HIV env fragment spanning the C2-V3 region. The resultant fragment was directly sequenced on an automated sequencer (ABI, 3100). Co-receptor prediction of the env sequences was done using Geno2pheno[co-receptor], and phylogenetic relationships determined using CLUSTALW and Neighbor Joining method. Results A total of 67 samples (46 treatment experienced and 21 treatment naive) were successfully amplified and sequenced. Forty nine (73%) sequences showed a prediction for R5 tropism while 18(27%) were X4 tropic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 46(69%) were subtype A, 11(16%) subtype C, and 10(15%) subtype D. No statistical significant associations were observed between cell tropism and CD4+ status, patient gender, age, or treatment option. There was a tendency for more X4 tropic strains being in the treatment experienced group than the naive group: Of 46 treatment experiencing participants, 14(30%) harboured X4, compared with 4(19%) of 21 of the treatment-naïve participants, the association is however not statistically significant (p = 0.31). However, a strong association was observed between subtype D and CXCR4 co- receptor usage (p = 0.015) with 6(60%) of the 10 subtype D being X4 tropic and 4(40%) R5 tropic. Conclusion HIV-1 R5 tropic strains were the most prevalent in the study population and HIV infected patients in Kenya may benefit from CCR5 antagonists. However, there is need for caution where subtype D infection is suspected or where antiretroviral salvage therapy is indicated.",

Between 1994 and 2009, PIH recommended exclusive formula feeding in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV program and provided support to implement this strategy. We conducted this study to assess HIV-free survival and prevalence of diarrhea and malnutrition among infants in our PMTCT program in rural Haiti where exclusive formula feeding was supported.We reviewed medical charts of PMTCT mother-infant pairs at PIH between November 2004 and August 2006 through a retrospective longitudinal study and cross-sectional survey. We performed household surveys for each pair and at control households matched by infant's age and gender.254 mother-infant pairs were included. 15.3% of infants were low birth weight; most births occurred at home (68.8%). 55.9% of households had no latrine; food insecurity was high (mean score of 18; scale 0-27, SD = 5.3). HIV-free survival at 18 months was 90.6%. Within the cohort, 9 children (3.5%) were HIV-infected and 17 (6.7%) died. Community controls were more likely to be breastfed (P = 0.003) and more likely to introduce food early (P = 0.003) than PMTCT-program households. There was no difference in moderate malnutrition (Z score ≤ 2 SD) between PMTCT and community groups after controlling for guardian's education, marital status, and food insecurity (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.64; P = 0.84). Diarrhea was 2.9 times more prevalent among community children than PMTCT infants (30.3% vs. 12.2%; P < 0.0001).In a PIH-supported program in rural Haiti that addressed socioeconomic barriers to ill-health, breast milk substitution was safe, acceptable and feasible for PMTCT for HIV-infected women choosing this option.",

The impact of such conditions on mortality in the post-HAART era has been also assessed in various modes in the literature. In this paper, we report on the death risks for DM, myocardial infarction, and chronic ischemic heart diseases that were investigated among 9662 Italian AIDS cases diagnosed between 1999 and 2005. Death certificates reporting DM, myocardial infarction, and chronic ischemic heart diseases were reviewed to identify the underlying cause of death, and to compare the observed numbers of deaths with the expected ones from the sex- and age-matched, general population of Italy. Person-years at risk of death were computed from date of AIDS diagnosis up to date of death or to December 31, 2006. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed. DM and cardiovascular diseases were the cause of death for 43 out of 3101 deceased AIDS cases (i.e., 1.4% of all deaths). In comparison with the general population, the risks of death were 6.4-fold higher for DM (95% CI:3.5-10.8), 2.3-fold higher for myocardial infarction (95% CI:1.4-3.7) and 3.0 for chronic ischemic heart diseases (95% CI: 1.5-5.2).",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the effects of HCV co-infection on virological effectiveness and on CD4+ T-cell recovery in patients with an early and sustained virological response after HAART.We performed a longitudinal analysis of 3,262 patients from the MASTER cohort, who started HAART from 2000 to 2008. Patients were stratified into 6 groups by HCV status and type of anchor class. The early virological outcome was the achievement of HIV RNA <500 copies/ml 4-8 months after HAART initiation. Time to virological response was also evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The main outcome measure of early immunological response was the achievement of CD4+ T-cell increase by ≥100/mm3 from baseline to month 4-8 in virological responder patients. Late immunological outcome was absolute variation of CD4+ T-cell count with respect to baseline up to month 24. Multivariable analysis (ANCOVA) investigated predictors for this outcome.The early virological response was higher in HCV Ab-negative than HCV Ab-positive patients prescribed PI/r (92.2% versus 88%; p = 0.01) or NNRTI (88.5% versus 84.7%; p = 0.06). HCV Ab-positive serostatus was a significant predictor of a delayed virological suppression independently from other variables, including types of anchor class. Reactivity for HCV antibodies was associated with a lower probability of obtaining ≥100/mm3 CD4+ increase within 8 months from HAART initiation in patients treated with PI/r (62.2% among HCV Ab-positive patients versus 70.9% among HCV Ab-negative patients; p = 0.003) and NNRTI (63.7% versus 74.7%; p < 0.001). Regarding late CD4+ increase, positive HCV Ab appeared to impair immune reconstitution in terms of absolute CD4+ T-cell count increase both in patients treated with PI/r (p = 0.013) and in those treated with NNRTI (p = 0.002). This was confirmed at a multivariable analysis up to 12 months of follow-up.In this large cohort, HCV Ab reactivity was associated with an inferior virological outcome and an independent association between HCV Ab-positivity and smaller CD4+ increase was evident up to 12 months of follow-up. Although the difference in CD4+ T-cell count was modest, a stricter follow-up and optimization of HAART strategy appear to be important in HIV patients co-infected by HCV. Moreover, our data support anti-HCV treatment leading to HCV eradication as a means to facilitate the achievement of the viro-immunological goals of HAART.",

We investigated the concordance between self-reported likelihood of HIV and actual results of HIV test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess whether selected respondents' characteristics affect the validity of self-reports.The HIV prevalence in the urban population was 3.8% (3.1% among males and 4.6% among females) and 3.5% in the rural areas (3.4% among males and 3.7% among females). Almost all the respondents who claimed they have high chances of being infected with HIV actually tested negative (91.6% in urban and 97.9% in rural areas).

    "abstract": "As part of efforts to improve the prevention of mother-to-child transmission in Northern Uganda, we explored reasons for poor viral suppression among 122 pregnant and lactating women who were in care, received viral load tests, but had not achieved viral suppression and had more than 1000 copies/mL. Understanding the patient factors associated with low viral suppression was of interest to the Ministry of Health to guide the development of tools and interventions to achieve viral suppression for pregnant and lactating women newly initiating on ART as well as those on ART with unsuppressed viral load. A facility-based cross-sectional and mixed methods study design was used, with retrospective medical record review. We assessed 122 HIV-positive mothers with known low viral suppression across 31 health facilities in Northern Uganda. Adjusted odds ratios were used to determine the covariates of adherence among HIV positive mothers using logistic regression. A study among health care providers shed further light on predictors of low viral suppression and a history of low early retention. This study was part of a larger national evaluation of the performance of integrated care services for mothers. Adherence defined as taking antiretroviral medications correctly everyday was low at 67.2%. The covariates of low adherence are: taking other medications in addition to ART, missed appointments in the past 6 months, experienced violence in the past 6 months, and faces obstacles to treatment. Mothers who were experiencing each of these covariates were less likely to adhere to treatment. These covariates were triangulated with perspectives of health providers as covariates of low adherence and included: long distances to health facility, missed appointments, running out of pills, sharing antiretroviral drugs, violence, and social lifestyles such as multiple sexual partners coupled with non-disclosure to partners. Inadequate counseling, stigma, and lack of client identity are the frontline factors accounting for the early loss of mothers from care. Adherence of 67% was low for reliable viral suppression and accounts for the low viral suppression among HIV-positive mothers studied, in absence of any other factors. This study provided insights into the covariates for low adherence to ART and low viral load suppression; these covariates included taking other medications in addition to ART, missed appointments in the past 6 months, feels like giving up, doesn't have someone with whom to share private concerns, experienced violence in the past 6 months, and faces obstacles to treatment and confirmed by health providers. To improve adherence, we recommend use of a screening tool to identify mothers with any of these covariates so that more intensive adherence support can be provided to these mothers.",

VMMC policies have achieved initial targets in adult men yet continue to fall short in reaching younger men and adolescents. We present the cost and scale-up implications of an education-based, VMMC intervention for adolescent street-connected males, for whom the street has become their home and/or source of livelihood. The intervention was piloted as part of the Engaging Street Youth in HIV Interventions Project in Eldoret, Kenya. We used a micro-costing approach to estimate the average cost of a VMMC intervention in 116 street-connected youth. Average cost was estimated per individual and per cohort by dividing total cost per intervention by number of clients accessing the intervention over a 30-day period. Total average costs included direct and support procedure costs, educational costs, and direct research costs. Cost-effectiveness was measured in cost per DALYs averted over a 5 and 10-year period. The total cost of the intervention was $12,526 over the 30-day period, with an average cost per individual of $108. The direct VMMC procedure cost was approximately $9 per individual. Personnel costs contributed the greatest percentage to the total intervention cost (38.2%), with mentors and social workers representing the highest wage earners. Retreat-related and education costs contributed 51% and 13% respectively to the total average cost, with surgical equipment costs contributing less than 1%. At a cost of $108 per individual, the intervention averted 60166 DALYs in 5 years resulting in a cost per DALY averted of $267. The VMMC intervention was highly cost-effective in Kenya, despite the additional costs incurred to reach SCY. Further scale-up may be warranted to effectively apply this intervention in comparable populations.",

We assessed the prevalence of PDR and treatment outcomes among adults living with HIV-1 in Lilongwe, Malawi. Methods We selected 200 participants at random from the Lighthouse Tenofovir Cohort Study (LighTen). Serum samples were drawn prior to treatment initiation in 2014 and 2015, frozen, and later analyzed for the presence of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations. Amplicons were sequenced and interpreted by Stanford HIVdb interpretation algorithm 8.4. We assessed treatment outcomes by evaluating clinical outcome and viral suppression at the end of the follow-up period in October 2019. Results PDR testing was successful in 197 of 200 samples. The overall NNRTI- PDR prevalence was 13.7% (27/197). The prevalence of intermediate or high level NNRTI- PDR was 11.2% (22/197). The most common mutation was K103N (5.6%, 11/197), followed by Y181C (3.6%, 7/197). In one case, we detected an NRTI resistance mutation (M184V), in combination with multiple NNRTI resistance mutations. All HIV-1 isolates analyzed were of subtype C. Of the 27 patients with NNRTI- PDR, 9 were still alive, on ART, and virally suppressed at the end of follow-up. Conclusion The prevalence of NNRTI- PDR was above the critical level of 10% suggested by the Global Action Plan on HIV Drug Resistance. The distribution of drug resistance mutations was similar to that seen in previous studies from the region, and further supports the introduction of integrase inhibitors in first-line treatment in Malawi. Furthermore, our findings underline the need for continued PDR surveillance and pharmacovigilance in Sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "To optimise care HIV patients need to be promptly initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and subsequently retained on treatment. In this study we report on the interval between enrolment and treatment initiation, and investigate subsequent attrition and mortality of patients on ART at a rural clinic in Malawi. HIV-positive individuals were recruited to a cohort study between January 2008 and August 2011 at Chilumba Rural Hospital (CRH). Outcomes were ascertained, up to 7 years after enrolment, through follow-up and by linkage to ART registers and the Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS). Kaplan–Meier methods and Cox regression were used to examine ART initiation after enrolment, mortality after ART initiation, and attrition after ART initiation. Of the 617 individuals recruited, 523 initiated ART between January 2008 and January 2015. Median time from HIV testing to commencement of ART was 59 days (IQR: 10–330). By a year after enrolment 74.2 % (95 % CI 70.6–77.7 %) had initiated ART. Baseline clinical data at ART initiation and data on attrition was only available for the 438 individuals who initiated ART during active follow-up, between January 2008 and August 2011. Of these individuals, 6 were missing Ministry of Health numbers, leaving 432 included in analyses of attrition and mortality. At 4 years after ART initiation 71.3 % (95 % CI 65.7–76.2 %) of these patients were retained on treatment at the CRH and 17.2 % (95 % CI 13.8–21.4 %) had died. Participants who had a lower CD4 count at enrolment (≤350 cells/μl), enrolled in 2008, or tested for HIV at the CRH rather than through serosurveys, initiated treatment faster. Once on treatment, mortality rates were higher in patients who were HIV tested at the CRH, male, older (≥35 years), missing a CD4 count, or underweight (BMI < 18.5) at ART initiation. Through linkage to the KHDSS and ART registers it was possible to continue follow-up beyond the end of the initial cohort study. Annual mortality after ART initiation remained considerable over a period of 4 years. Greater access to HIV and CD4 testing alongside initiation at higher CD4 counts, as planned in the test and treat strategy, could reduce this mortality.",

Histoplasmosis is prevalent in Latin America and Colombia, is difficult to diagnose and has a high mortality. Here we determined the clinical characteristics and risk factors of histoplasmosis in people living with HIV (PLWH) in Pereira, Colombia. Materials and methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional study (2014–2019) involving two tertiary medical centers in Pereira, Colombia. People hospitalized with HIV were included. Histoplasma antigen detection was performed in urine samples. Probable histoplasmosis was defined according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group criteria. Results 172 HIV-infected patients were analyzed. Histoplasmosis was confirmed in 29% (n = 50/172) of patients. The logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for histoplasmosis were pancytopenia (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.6–10.3, P = 0.002), &lt; 50 CD4 + cells/μL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3–7.3, P = 0.006) and Aspartate transaminase (AST) levels &gt; 46 IU/L (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3–8, P = 0.010). Conclusions Histoplasmosis is highly prevalent in hospitalized patients with HIV in Pereira, Colombia. The clinical findings are nonspecific, but there are some clinical abnormalities that can lead to suspicion of the disease, early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Urine antigen detection is useful for diagnosis, but is not widely available. An algorithmic approach is proposed for low-resource clinical settings.",

Therefore, we sought to investigate CVD risk associated with antiretroviral drug combinations. Methods Using an administrative health-plan dataset, risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) associated with current exposure to antiretroviral drug combinations was assessed among persons living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) across the U.S. from October 2009 through December 2014. To account for confounding-by-indication and for factors simultaneously acting as causal mediators and confounders, we applied inverse probability of treatment weighted marginal structural models to longitudinal data of patients. Results Over 114,417 person-years (n = 73,071 persons) of ART exposure, 602 cases of AMI occurred at an event rate of 5.26 (95% CI: 4.86, 5.70)/1000 person-years. Of the 14 antiretroviral drug combinations studied, persons taking abacavir-lamivudine-darunavir had the highest incidence rate (IR: 11/1000; 95% CI: 7.4–16.0) of AMI. Risk (HR; 95% CI) of AMI was elevated for current exposure to abacavir-lamivudine-darunavir (1.91; 1.27–2.88), abacavir-lamivudine-atazanavir (1.58; 1.08–2.31), and tenofovir-emtricitabine-raltegravir (1.35; 1.07–1.71). Tenofovir-emtricitabine-efavirenz was associated with reduced risk (0.65; 0.54–0.78). Abacavir-lamivudine-darunavir was associated with increased risk of AMI beyond that expected of abacavir alone, likely attributable to darunavir co-administration. We did not find an elevated risk of AMI when abacavir-lamivudine was combined with efavirenz or raltegravir. Conclusion The antiretroviral drug combinations abacavir-lamivudine-darunavir, abacavir-lamivudine-atazanavir and tenofovir-emtricitabine-raltegravir were found to be associated with elevated risk of AMI, while tenofovir-emtricitabine-efavirenz was associated with a lower risk. The AMI risk associated with abacavir-lamivudine-darunavir was greater than what was previously described for abacavir, which could suggest an added risk from darunavir. The results should be confirmed in additional studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background An increasing number of HIV cure trials involve combining multiple potentially curative interventions. Until now, considerations for designing and implementing complex combination HIV cure trials have not been thoroughly considered. Methods We used a purposive method to select key informants for our study. Informants included biomedical HIV cure researchers, regulators, policy makers, bioethicists, and community members. We used in-depth interviews to generate ethical and practical considerations to guide the design and implementation of combination HIV cure research. We analyzed the qualitative data using conventional content analysis focused on inductive reasoning. Results We interviewed 11 biomedical researchers, 4 community members, 2 regulators, 1 policy researcher, and 1 bioethicist. Informants generated considerations for designing and implementing combination interventions towards an HIV cure, focused on ethical aspects, as well as considerations to guide trial design, benefit/risk determinations, regulatory requirements, prioritization and sequencing and timing of interventions, among others. Informants also provided considerations related to combining specific HIV cure research modalities, such as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), cell and gene modification products, latency-reversing agents and immune-based interventions. Finally, informants provided suggestions to ensure meaningful therapeutic improvements over standard antiretroviral therapy, overcome challenges of designing combination approaches, and engage communities around combination HIV cure research. Conclusion The increasing number of combination HIV cure trials brings with them a host of ethical and practical challenges. We hope our paper will inform meaningful stakeholder dialogue around the use of combinatorial HIV cure research approaches. To protect the public trust in HIV cure research, considerations should be periodically revisited and updated with key stakeholder input as the science continues to advance.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies with BIT225 (N-carbamimidoyl-5-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-naphthamide) have demonstrated a unique antiviral activity that blocks the release of HIV-1 from monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Antagonising the ion channel formed by HIV-1 Vpu, BIT225 preferentially targets de novo intracellular virus produced in 'virus-containing compartments' of MDM. In primary infections, dendritic cells (DC) are one of the first cells infected by HIV-1 and can transfer virus to more permissive CD4(+) T cells, making these cells an important target for novel antiviral therapies. To extend previous findings with BIT225, we aimed to further characterise the antiviral activity of BIT225 on HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived DC (MDDC).The anti-HIV-1 activity of BIT225 was evaluated in vitro within MDDC alone and in co-cultures with activated CD4(+) T cells to examine the effect of the drug on HIV-1 transfer. Antiviral activity was determined by measuring HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity in the culture supernatant of BIT225 treated and DMSO control cultures. A single dose of BIT225 resulted in a mean (SE) peak inhibition of HIV-1 release from MDDC by 74.5 % (±0.6) following 14 days of culture and a 6-fold reduction of HIV-1 transfer to activated uninfected CD4(+) T cells in co-culture.HIV-1 release from MDDC was inhibited by BIT225. This data broadens the drug's antiviral activity profile within cells of the myeloid lineage. These findings suggest a potential role for BIT225 in reducing HIV-1 production and preventing viral dissemination in early and chronic infection and may assist in limiting virus spread with any ongoing viral replication during antiretroviral therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Monitoring of adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) is of utmost importance to prevent treatment failure. Several measures to monitor adherence have been applied in low-resource settings and they all have pros and cons. Our objective was to examine whether any of the following adherence measures is a better predictor of participants’ viral load suppression: (1) self-report, (2) pharmacy refill count, (3) Real Time Medication Monitoring (RTMM), (4) a combination of self-report and pharmacy refill count or (5) all three adherence assessment methods combined. Methodology This was a post-hoc analysis of data from our 48-week REMIND-HIV randomized controlled trial in which adherence to ART was measured using self-report, pharmacy refill counts and RTMM among ART-experienced adults living with HIV subjectively judged to be nonadherent to ART. For each adherence measure, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for predicting virological failure defined as a viral load (VL) of &gt; 20 copies/mL. To determine at which percentage of adherence the prediction was strongest, we evaluated adherence cut-offs of 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and 100% using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. VL data were obtained after 48 weeks of follow-up in the trial. Results A total of 233 people living with HIV (PLHIV) were included in this analysis. When comparing the ability of self-reported adherence with pharmacy refill count and RTMM adherence to predict viral load &gt; 20 copies/ml, self-reported adherence had the lowest sensitivity, ranging from 6 to 17%, but the highest specificity, ranging from 100 to 86%, depending on cut-off values from 80 to 100%. Area under the ROC curves (AUC) were 0.54 for RTMM, 0.56 for pharmacy refill count and 0.52 for self-report, indicating low discriminatory capacity for each of the adherence measures. When we combined the self-report and pharmacy refill count measures, sensitivity increased, ranging from 28 to 57% but specificity decreased, ranging from 83 to 53%. When all three measures were combined, we observed the highest value of sensitivity, ranging from 46 to 92%, and PPV, ranging from 32 to 36%, at high cut-offs ranging from 80 to 100%. Upon combination of three adherence measures, the AUC increased to 0.59. Conclusion Our results show that adherence assessed exclusively by self-report, pharmacy refill count or RTMM were insufficiently sensitive to predict virologic failure. Sensitivity markedly improved by combining all three measures, but the practical feasibility of such an approach would need to be studied.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Dolutegravir (DTG) is an Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor (INSTI) indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection. It is available in a number of pharmaceutical preparations including the fixed-dose combination (TLD) containing tenofovir (300 mg) + lamivudine (300 mg) + dolutegravir (50 mg). In 2018, Eswatini adopted TLD as the preferred first-line HIV treatment regimen for adults and adolescents as per WHO recommendations. From March 2019 to March 2020, the National Pharmacovigilance Center (NPC) in Eswatini received 8 reports of hyperglycaemia associated with the use of DTG. This study was conducted to investigate if Eswatini NPC database included cases suggestive of causality between dolutegravir and hyperglycaemia. Method A qualitative synthesis of information from the Eswatini national pharmacovigilance database from March 2019 to March 2020 was conducted to investigate a casual association between hyperglycaemia and dolutegravir. Results All reports with dolutegravir containing regimen and suspected Adverse Event of hyperglycaemia in the period of March 2019 to March 2020 were included in the study. Seven of the reports were serious (resulted in hospitalization and one case concerned optic neuritis, leading to blindness). Two patients had a medical history of diabetes while the rest of the patients had never experienced hyperglycaemia before starting dolutegravir. For all the reports, the time to onset of hyperglycaemia ranges from 2–5 months after the initiation of DTG. None of the patients discontinued the use of DTG. All the patients were treated with oral hypoglycaemic medication. In severe cases, patients were treated with intravenous normal saline and ringer lactate as well as rapid-acting insulins. All patients are currently stable on oral hypoglycaemic drugs. Conclusion Cases that support causality between dolutegravir containing regimen and hyperglycaemia were found. These cases were mainly serious. Based on these findings it is recommended that healthcare professionals (HCPs) actively screen all patients for risk factors of hyperglycaemia before DTG initiation. In addition, it is important that HCPs are aware of the possible association between DTG and hyperglycaemia.",

    "abstract": "Married women have a higher risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) than men. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS contributes significantly to describing the prevalence and consequences of such virus/disease. The study aimed to investigate the level of HIV/AIDS knowledge and the socio-demographic variables that influence HIV/AIDS knowledge among married women in Bangladesh. We used three waves of Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), which included 33,843, 20,727, and 29,724 married women from 2006, 2012, and 2019 MICS. A score was prepared through their interrogation to determine the level of knowledge and logistic regression models were used for analyzing the data. This study found that the prevalence of knowledge level of HIV/AIDS in different questions increased from 55.20% in 2006 to 58.69% in 2019. In our study, respondents having highest education had 4.03 (95% CI 3.50-4.64) times more chance to obtain \"High Score\" in 2019 MICS which is 5.30 times in 2012 MICS (95% CI 4.41-6.37) and 2.58 times in 2006 MICS (95% CI 2.28-2.93) compared to illiterate married women. Moreover, respondents from urban area were 1.13 times more likely to obtain \"High Score\" in 2019 MICS which is 1.14 times in 2012 MICS and 1.16 times in 2006 MICS, respectively than the rural married women. This study also found respondent's age, division, mass media access, and wealth status have played an important role in HIV/AIDS knowledge. Although a significant proportion of women had adequate knowledge of HIV/AIDS, more knowledge is still required to protect against such viruses/diseases. Thus, we advocate for the implementation of educational program in the curriculum, counselling, particularly in rural areas, and mass media access to ensure quality knowledge throughout the country.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background As use of dolutegravir (DTG) becomes more common in resource limited settings (RLS), the demand for integrase resistance testing is increasing. Affordable methods for genotyping all relevant HIV-1 pol genes (i.e., protease (PR ), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN)) are required to guide choice of future antiretroviral therapy (ART). We designed an in-house HIV-1 drug resistance (HIVDR) genotyping method that is affordable and suitable for use in RLS. Methods We obtained remnant plasma samples from CAPRISA 103 study and amplified HIV-1 PR, RT and IN genes, using an innovative PCR assay. We validated the assay using remnant plasma samples from an external quality assessment (EQA) programme. We genotyped samples by Sanger sequencing and assessed HIVDR mutations using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. We compared drug resistance mutations with previous genotypes and calculated method cost-estimates. Results From 96 samples processed, we obtained sequence data for 78 (81%), of which 75 (96%) had a least one HIVDR mutation, with no major-IN mutations observed. Only one sample had an E157Q INSTI-accessory mutation. When compared to previous genotypes, 18/78 (23%) had at least one discordant mutation, but only 2/78 (3%) resulted in different phenotypic predictions that could affect choice of subsequent regimen. All CAPRISA 103 study sequences were HIV-1C as confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Of the 7 EQA samples, 4 were HIV-1C, 2 were HIV-1D, and 1 was HIV-1A. Genotypic resistance data generated using the IDR method were 100% concordant with EQA panel results. Overall genotyping cost per sample was estimated at ~ US$43–$US49, with a processing time of ~ 2 working days. Conclusions We successfully designed an in-house HIVDR method that is suitable for genotyping HIV-1 PR, RT and IN genes, at an affordable cost and shorter turnaround time. This HIVDR genotyping method accommodates changes in ART regimens and will help to guide HIV-1 treatment decisions in RLS.",

High IIT among HIV adolescents has both individual and potential public health consequences including discontinuation of treatment, increased HIV transmission and risk of death. In this era of test and treat policy it is important to ensure that patients remain connected to HIV clinics to enable achieve UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets timely. This study aimed to assess risk factors for IIT among HIV-positive adolescence in Tanzania. Methods We conducted retrospective longitudinal cohort study using secondary data of adolescent patients enrolled in care and treatment clinics in Tanga from October 2018 to December 2020. We defined Interuption in Treatment as missing clinic visits for 90 consecutive days after the last scheduled appointment date on anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed to identify risk factors of the outcome variable. Results Among 2,084 adolescents of age between 15 and 19 years were followed for two years, whereby 546 (26.2%) had interrupted treatment. The median age of the participants was 14.6 years (interquartile range, IQR: 12.6–16.6 years), with age between 15 and 19 years, male sex, with advanced HIV disease and were not on Dolutegravir (DTG) related regimens were associated with interruption in treatment; (Hazard ratio (HR) 1.43, 95% CI: 1.23–1.66, p &lt; 0.0001, HR 2.47, 95% CI: 1.62–3.77, p &lt; 0.0001, HR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.91– 3.21, p &lt; 0.0001 and HR: 6.67, 95% CI: 3.36– 7.04, p &lt; 0.0001 respectively). Adolescents who were on ART for less or equal one year compared to those on ART for more than one year were protective toward interruption in treatment (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54–0.87, p = 0.002). Conclusions The risk of interruption in treatment was high among adolescents in HIV care and treatment facilities in Tanga. This might lead to poor clinical outcomes, and increased drug resistance among ART-initiated adolescents. Placing more adolescents with DTG based drug, strengthening access to care and treatment and rapid tracking of patients is recommended to improve patient outcomes.",

We computed multivariable prevalence ratios for barriers, facilitators and recent PrEP use, controlling for demographics. Results Findings suggest that psychosocial and structural barriers, including moderate/high alcohol use, stimulant use, and history of incarceration were all positively associated with recent PrEP use among urban transgender women. In addition, a psychosocial facilitator, gender affirmation, was positively associated with recent PrEP use, while, while collective self-esteem, a was negatively associated with it. Finally, common indications for PrEP have high sensitivity, but low specificity and predictive value for identifying those on PrEP. Conclusion We conclude that despite a large gap in PrEP use among those with indications, individuals experiencing psychosocial and structural barriers are more likely to use PrEP, and facilitators, such as psychological sense of affirmed gender may support its use.

We assessed the psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in a large cohort of people with HIV (PWH) in Washington DC and evaluated the association of various demographic and clinical characteristics with psychosocial impacts. Methods From October 2020 to December 2021, DC Cohort participants were invited to complete a survey capturing psychosocial outcomes influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some demographic variables were also collected in the survey, and survey results were matched to additional demographic data and laboratory data from the DC Cohort database. Data analyses included descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and psychosocial impacts, assessed individually and in overarching categories (financial/employment, mental health, decreased social connection, and substance use). Results Of 891 participants, the median age was 46 years old, 65% were male, and 76% were of non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity. The most commonly reported psychosocial impact categories were mental health (78% of sample) and financial/employment (56% of sample). In our sample, older age was protective against all adverse psychosocial impacts. Additionally, those who were more educated reported fewer financial impacts but more mental health impacts, decreased social connection, and increased substance use. Males reported increased substance use compared with females. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial psychosocial impacts on PWH, and resiliency may have helped shield older adults from some of these effects. As the pandemic continues, measures to aid groups vulnerable to these psychosocial impacts are critical to help ensure continued success towards healthy living with HIV.",

However, there is paucity of data on viral load suppression (VLS) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) with mental disorders. We conducted a parallel convergent mixed methods study to determine HIV VLS among people with a mental disorder and explored the socio-cultural determinants of VLS at Butabika hospital and Mulago (ISS) HIV Clinics in Uganda.We conducted a retrospective medical records review; seven key informant interviews (KII) among purposively selected healthcare providers and 12 in-depth interviews (IDI) among clinically stable PLHIV with a mental disorder. Data was collected on demographics, mental disorder, ART, viral load status, social support, stigma, and disclosure of HIV status. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics and modified Poisson regression, while Inductive thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data.Of the 240 PLHIV with a mental disorder who were enrolled, 161 (67.1%) were female with mean age 38.9 (± 11.2) years. Overall, 88.8% (95% Cl: 84.0 - 92.2%) achieved VLS. Age (aPR = 1.00, 95%Cl = 1.00-1.00), male gender (aPR = 0.90, 95%Cl = 0.82-0.98), divorced (aPR = 0.88, 95%Cl = 0.82-0.94), widowed (aPR = 0.84, 95%Cl = 0.83-0.86), baseline CD4 count < 200 (aPR = 0.89, 95%Cl = 0.85-0.94), psychotic mental disorders (aPR = 1.11; 95%CI = 1.08-1.13) and fair (85-94%) ART adherence level (aPR = 0.69, 95%Cl = 0.55-0.87) and TDF/3TC/DTG (aPR = 0.92; 95%CI = 0.91-0.94) were associated with HIV VLS. Social support from family members, knowledge of impact of negative thoughts on VLS, fear of breaking up with partners and compassionate healthcare providers positively influenced VLS. Stigma and discrimination from the community, self-perceived stigma hindering social relations, socio-economic challenges and psychiatric drug stock-outs negatively affected VLS.HIV VLS among PLHIV with mental disorders at institutions that provide integrated HIV and mental health care is still below the UNAIDS 95% target. Health promotion messaging focusing on benefits of VLS and countering stigma to create a safe environment; and active involvement of family members in care could improve HIV treatment outcomes for PLHIV with mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Russian Federation’s invasion in Ukraine has resulted social hardship, millions of internally displaced persons, the destruction of medical infrastructure, and limited access to HIV services. There is no available information regarding the impact of the war on the HIV treatment cascade among women who inject drugs (WWID) in Ukraine. In this study, we examine the barriers and facilitators of HIV detection, initiation of treatment, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among WWID. Methods During the in-depth interviews, participants were queried about their needs for HIV testing, treatment and related services, as well as barriers to HIV testing, initiation and retention on ART, including organizational barriers and changes in existing preventive and treatment programs. Thematic content analysis was used to employed to derive the results. Results From August to September 2022, we conducted in-depth interviews among 38 WWID in Kryvyi Rih, Kyiv, and in the Ivano-Frankivsk and Odesa regions of Ukraine. The most persistent personal facilitator for HIV detection, ART initiation, and retention in services was a combination of several factors, including strong ties with relatives and a sense of responsibility for loved ones, support from the family, willingness to cooperate with specialists, a higher level of education, and a relatively prosperous financial situation. Barriers such as war-related stress and disruptions to healthcare facilities are directly linked to the ongoing war. The influence of other barriers (fear of discovering the presence of the disease, potential social restrictions, and drug use) was universal and only indirectly related to the state of war. The majority of WWID provided positive assessments of the quality of work and the availability of preventive HIV services. Conclusion The ongoing war against Ukraine continues to have a detrimental impact on all aspects of the population’s life, particularly affecting WWID. Providers of HIV services must make every effort to sustain and optimize these services, taking into account the evolving context and new requirements. The changing life situation and shifting priorities of WWID necessitate a dynamic and comprehensive assessment of existing challenges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with an elevated incidence of cervical cancer, and accelerated disease progression, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between HIV infection and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cervical cancer. Methods Tissue samples from HIV-positive and negative patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer were analyzed for EMT-related proteins. Human cervical cancer SiHa cells were treated with HIV Tat and gp120 proteins to test their effects on EMT, migration, and invasion. Results HIV-positive patients had lower E-cadherin and cytokeratin, and higher N-cadherin and vimentin levels than HIV-negative patients. HIV Tat and gp120 proteins induced EMT, migration, and invasion in SiHa cells. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that, compared to the control group, the protein-treated group showed upregulation of 22 genes and downregulation of 77 genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed the involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway in EMT. Further analysis of gene expression related to this pathway revealed upregulation of DVL1, TCF7, KRT17, and VMAC, while GSK3β, SFRP2, and CDH1 were downregulated. Immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that HIVgp120 and Tat proteins treatment induced elevated β-catenin expression with nuclear accumulation in SiHa cells. Conclusions The treatment of SiHa cells with HIV Tat and gp120 proteins induces EMT and activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway may play a crucial role in promoting EMT progression in cervical lesion tissues of HIV-infected patients.",

This study estimated the prevalence and explored factors associated with depression among PLWH in two rural secondary health facilities providing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) services in Southwestern Nigeria between September and December 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to screen and identify PLWH aged 18 years or older with depression. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed with SPSS version 23. A total of 172 respondents were screened. The prevalence of depression was 16.3% (95% CI 11.1%, 22.7%). Mild, moderate, and moderately severe depression was identified in 17 (9.9%), 8(4.7%) and 3(1.7%) of the participants, respectively. One (0.6%) respondent had suicidal ideation. Of PLWH with any depression, 20/28(71.4%) were within the 40–59 years of age range. None of the participants was on antidepressants. The factor most associated with depression was hypertension, with adjusted odd ratios of 9.8(95% CI 3.5–27.3, p &lt; 0.0001). The study highlights the importance of screening for the severity of depression among PLWH in rural hospitals providing ART services in Africa. PLWH with comorbid hypertension were more likely to suffer from some form of depression.",

    "abstract": "Advanced HIV disease (AHD) is increasingly becoming a threat to the survival of people living with HIV. Many countries, including Malawi, have adopted and adapted World Health Organization AHD management guidelines to manage the country's HIV cohort better. However, literature regarding adherence to these guidelines and the treatment outcomes remains limited. Therefore, we describe AHD management and patient outcomes at two rural hospitals in Southern Malawi. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Neno District and Lisungwi Community Hospitals in Neno District, Malawi. We extracted data from inpatient files, patients' manual charts referred to as \"Mastercards\" for outpatients attending Integrated Chronic Care Clinic (IC3) and from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) between January 2022 and December 2022. IC3 is a specialized clinic for people with chronic diseases including HIV, AHD and Non-communicable diseases. We used counts and percentages for all categorical variables and median and Interquartile range (IQR) for all continuous variables. During the study period, 343 HIV patients were hospitalized, of which 9.8% (n = 34) were new HIV infections. Of these, 50.4% (n = 173) had AHD, and 64.2% (n = 111) were admitted primarily due to infectious diseases. Tuberculosis (58.6%, n = 65) was the leading cause of admission. Of 173 hospitalized and classified as AHD, 75% had CD4 ordered, but only 43% (n = 74) were done. The viral load test was ordered for 34% (n = 59),) and only 28.8% (n = 17) were done. TB LAM and CrAg tests were ordered for 64.2% (n = 111) and 59.5% (n = 103) of which 69.4% and 72.8% were done, respectively. Among 146 IC3 AHD clients, 46%, 47%, 42% and 40% had CD4, viral load, TB LAM and CrAg tests done, respectively. Overall, 17.9% (n = 31) of inpatients with AHD died compared to 2.4%(n = 4) among HIV patients without AHD. We found sub-optimal adherence to management guidelines for patients with AHD, with higher deaths reported compared to those without AHD. Therefore, strengthening adherence to AHD management guidelines through quality improvement initiatives and increased availability of diagnostic resources could potentially improve health outcomes for people living with HIV. Further studies should explore patients' perspectives on the quality of AHD clinics.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the direction and magnitude of weight change among WLWH pre-, during, and post-gestation based on DTG exposure history. Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated adult pregnant WLWH receiving antenatal care between 2016 and 2022 at two clinics in Nigeria and followed them over three 9-month periods (pregestational, antenatal, and postgestational). Patients were stratified into three DTG exposure groups for each follow-up period: non-DTG, DTG-switch, and DTG. Three mixed effects models with random intercepts and slopes were utilized to assess the association between DTG and weight. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using binomial DTG exposure with starting time. Results The study included 2386 women, 851 (35.7%) of whom used DTG at some point. Average maternal weight was 63.8 ± 12.7 kg, 67.0 ± 13.1 kg, and 64.5 ± 12.7 kg during the pregestational, antenatal, and postgestational period. The weight difference in kg for DTG and DTG-switch compared to other ARTs were 0.06 (-1.66, 1.79) and -2.11 (-5.33, 1.11) pregestational, -0.613 (-2.14, 0.92) and 1.21 (-0.80, 3.21) antepartum, and 2.64 (0.37, 4.91) and 0.89 (-1.40, 3.18) postgestational. The antenatal slope (β) for DTG exposure and initiation time was 0.01 (0.001, 0.02) kg/day. Conclusions DTG therapy is associated with more rapid weight gain during pregnancy without significantly affecting the total weight gained. Moreover, retained weight postgestation is higher in women on DTG. Therefore, they could face higher future metabolic and cardiovascular risks.",

    "abstract": "HIV/AIDS remains a public health threat globally. The disclosure rates of positive HIV status by young people living with HIV (YPLHIV) to their sexual partners vary and have been reported as low as 31%, despite the consequences of non-disclosure. Little is known about disclosure to sexual partners among YPLHIV in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. We assessed the prevalence, determinants, barriers and facilitators of HIV status disclosure to sexual partners among YPLHIV in care at an urban HIV clinic in Uganda. The study utilized a cross sectional design using a parallel-convergent mixed method approach. We conducted 281 structured interviews through random sampling and 16 purposively sampled in-depth interviews (IDIs) among YPLHIV (18 to 24 years). Descriptive analysis was done to obtain the frequency and percentage of HIV status disclosure to sexual partners of YPLHIV. Modified Poisson regression was used to determine associated factors at multivariate analysis and adjusted prevalence ratios, 95% CI and p values were obtained using STATA version 14. Verbatim transcription and thematic analysis using NVIVO version 12 was used to explore the barriers and facilitators of HIV status disclosure to sexual partners using the health belief model. The prevalence of HIV status disclosure to sexual partners was 45.2%. Having a known HIV free partner (aPR = 0.6, P < 0.001), being a partial or complete orphan (aPR = 1.4, P = 0.022), knowing one's HIV status for > 1 year (aPR = 0.7, P < 0.001), and having 2 rather than 3 sexual partners (aPR = 1.7, P = 0.013) were among the determinants of HIV status disclosure. Facilitators of disclosure included; health worker/peer support, nature of relationship, protecting partners against HIV, need for social/financial support. Barriers to disclosure included; lack of confidence to disclose, fear of sexual partners' reaction, awareness of undetectable HIV viral load equated to none HIV transmission, influence by parents among others. This study revealed a low HIV status disclosure prevalence to sexual partners among YPLHIV. Addressing potential barriers through comprehensive health education including the role of viral load in HIV transmission, and creating supportive environments to enhance their confidence, will improve disclosure rates among YPLHIV to their sexual partners.",

Poor and fair adherence [aOR = 0.044, 95% CI 0.010-0.196, P < 0.001)], [aOR = 0.010, 95% CI (0.002-0.039) P < 0.001] respectively had decreased odds for VLS while multi-month dispensing of drugs (aOR = 3.403, 95% CI 1.449-7.991, P = 0.005) had increased odds of VLS. For retention, being with a non-biological caregiver (aOR = 0.325, 95% CI 0.111-0.9482 P = 0.04) decreased the odds. Meanwhile key barriers included: individual ones such as internal stigma and treatment/drug fatigue; facility-level such as prolonged waiting time and lack of social activities; community level include stigma and discrimination, inadequate social support and food shortage. In terms of facilitators, individual level ones included good adherence and knowledge of one's HIV status; facility-level such as provision of adolescent friendly services and community-level like social support and decent nutrition. VLS rate was sub-optimal mainly due to poor adherence. HIV programs could utilize the barriers and facilitators identified to improve VLS. Conversely, retention rate at one year was good, likely due to provision of adolescent friendly health services. ALHIV and their caregivers need to be empowered to sustain retention and improve VLS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV status disclosure remains a major challenge among children living with perinatally acquired HIV with many taking treatment up to adolescence without knowing their serostatus. This non-disclosure is influenced by factors like fear of the negative consequences of disclosure. Since HIV status disclosure has been found to have good effects including improving treatment adherence and better mental health outcomes, there is a need to design interventions aimed at improving disclosure rates among children living with HIV. This study aims at adapting a clinic-based pediatric HIV status disclosure intervention and tasking shifting from healthcare workers to caregiver peer supporters in Eastern Uganda. Methods The adaptation process involved consultations with caregivers, healthcare workers involved in the care of children living with HIV, researchers in this field, intervention developers, and other experts and stakeholders. This was done through conducting FGDs with HCWs, caregivers, and peer supporters and consultations with researchers in the field of HIV. The original intervention manual was translated to Lusoga which is the commonly spoken dialect in this region. Collected qualitative data were analyzed using an inductive approach to develop themes and subthemes. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants before participation in the study. Results A total of 28 participants were involved in the FGDs, while two pediatricians and two HIV researchers/specialists were consulted. Six themes were generated in relation to all suggested changes to the original manual which were related to: (1) sociocultural beliefs/norms/perceptions (5 FGDs), (2) boosting caregiver’s confidence for disclosure (5FGDs), (3) disclosure mode, environment, and person (4 FGDs), (4) health facility/system related changes (3 FGDs), (5) reorganization/paraphrasing (3FGDs) and (6) age appropriateness (2FGDs). Conclusion This study emphasized that whereas some aspects of intervention can apply to various contexts, there is a need for cross-cultural adaptation of interventions before being implemented in settings where they were not developed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The HIV/AIDS pandemic remains a public health concern. Studies on host genetic polymorphisms that confer resistance to HIV-1 infection or delay HIV disease progression are scarce in African countries. Herein, we investigate the proportion of the mutated phenotype of the AIDS-related polymorphisms CCR5-Delta32, CCR2-64I, and SDF1-3’A in HIV-infected and uninfected individuals in Luanda, the capital of Angola, a sub-Saharan African country. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted with 284 individuals, of whom 159 were HIV-negative and 125 were HIV-positive. The CCR5-Delta32, CCR2-64I, and SDF1-3′A genotypes were detected by conventional PCR and visualised on 2% agarose gel. A Chi-square test determined the frequency of each genetic variant and was deemed significant when p &lt; 0.05. Results The frequency of CCR5-Delta32, CCR2-64I, and SDF1-3 A was 0% (0/272), 60.2% (154/256), and 42.5% (114/268), respectively. CCR2-64I and SDF1-3 A polymorphisms were statistically related to HIV infection ( p &lt; 0.001). Statistically significant was observed between ABO blood groups ( p = 0.006) and HIV-1 subtype ( p = 0.015) with CCR2-64I. Also, the age group ( p = 0.024) and RH blood group ( p = 0.018) were statistically related to the distribution of SDF1-3 A polymorphism. Conclusions We found no CCR5-Delta32 allele, while CCR2-64I and SDF1-3’A were found and presented a relationship with HIV infection, age, ABO/RH blood group, and HIV-1 subtypes. The observed associations of CCR2-64I and SDF1-3′A with HIV underscore the urgent need for further multidisciplinary research, with potential implications for targeted prevention and public health strategies. Therefore, studies investigating biological and non-biological factors related to susceptibility to HIV infection and AIDS progression or death should be conducted in Angola.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Weight gain has been associated with the use of antiretrovirals in people with HIV, especially with integrase inhibitors or tenofovir alafenamide, and among women. In 2018, doravirine became the latest non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor to be approved in the US. We assessed changes in weight over time among virologically suppressed individuals who switched to a regimen containing doravirine (DOR). Methods From the US-based OPERA cohort, treatment-experienced adults with HIV who switched to a DOR-containing regimen between 30AUG2018-30NOV2022 with a viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL were included (followed through 31MAY2023). The study population was characterized and a linear mixed model was used to estimate rates of weight change on DOR. Results were stratified by sex, by patterns of efavirenz (EFV) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) use before/after switch to DOR, and by integrase inhibitor (INSTI) &amp; tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) use combination (restricted to individuals who maintained the same combination before/after switch). Results Of 388 included individuals, 21% were women, 33% were Black, and 78% were obese or overweight at DOR switch. Overall, people who switched to DOR lost an average of 0.80 kg/year (95% CI: -1.32, -0.28). Both women and men experienced statistically significant weight loss; women (70% Black, 70% aged ≥ 40 years) lost weight at a rate of -1.67 kg/year (95% CI: -3.32, -0.02) and men at a rate of -0.60 kg/year (95% CI: -1.12, -0.08). When EFV and TDF were absent before and after switch to DOR, statistically significant weight loss was observed. Among those who had the same INSTI and TAF combination throughout and had any INSTI or TAF use, a statistically non-significant trend toward weight loss was observed. Conclusions In one of the first real-world analyses of weight changes among virologically suppressed individuals who switched to a DOR-containing regimen in the US, DOR was associated with statistically significant weight loss. Patterns of use of other antiretrovirals did not fully explain the observed weight loss. These findings are clinically meaningful given that most individuals included were overweight or obese at switch to DOR and that women were predominantly of perimenopausal or menopausal age.",

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in HIV prevention strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), uptake remains suboptimal in high-burden regions like Africa. Healthcare workers (HCWs) play a pivotal role in PrEP implementation. This study systematically reviews the scientific literature to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and willingness of healthcare workers in offering pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in Africa. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed PRISMA guidelines, synthesizing qualitative and quantitative studies from PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar (2010-2024). We included studies that assessed HCWs' PrEP-related knowledge, attitudes, and willingness in African settings. Pooled proportions for key outcomes were calculated using random-effects models, and barriers/facilitators were thematically analyzed. Of 293 screened records, 34 studies conducted in 12 countries were included. Meta-analysis revealed high PrEP awareness (85%, 95% CI: 75-91%) but poor knowledge (18%, 95% CI: 4-55%). Attitudes were moderately positive (46%, 95% CI: 25-68%), and willingness to prescribe PrEP was 58% (95% CI: 43-72%). Key barriers included stigma, inadequate training, workload, concerns about risk compensation, and health system constraints. Facilitators included provider training, experience, and integrated service delivery. While PrEP awareness is high among African HCWs, knowledge gaps and attitudinal barriers hinder optimal implementation. Targeted interventions-such as structured training, stigma reduction, and health system strengthening-are critical to enhancing PrEP adoption. Future research should explore context-specific strategies to improve HCW engagement in PrEP programs.",

    "abstract": "Syphilis poses a significant threat to global health, particularly in high-risk populations and resource-limited settings. Despite progress in HIV screening, syphilis testing often lags, exacerbating disparities in healthcare delivery. This study evaluated the clinical performance of the iStatis Syphilis Antibody (Ab) Test in South African point-of-care environments. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,500 enrolled participants across three urban South African sites. The clinical performance of the iStatis Syphilis Antibody (Ab) Test was evaluated using three sample types: capillary blood, EDTA venous whole blood, and plasma. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were assessed. The iStatis test demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance, with sensitivities of 96.40% (capillary blood), 98.80% (venous whole blood), and 99.00% (plasma), and a specificity of 100% across all sample types. A high prevalence of syphilis (33%) was identified. Notably, 90.51% of positive cases were female, and 75.7% of these women were pregnant, highlighting a vulnerable population. The study also revealed a high reinfection rate, suggesting that syphilis can recur relatively quickly post-treatment, underscoring the ongoing transmission challenge. The iStatis Syphilis Antibody Test is a highly accurate and versatile tool that detects syphilis at different stages using various sample types, making it ideal for use in settings without full laboratory access. The study highlights its potential to improve early diagnosis and control of syphilis, especially in light of high reinfection rates in South Africa. Further research is needed to assess its use in rural areas, long-term performance, and cost-effectiveness to support wider adoption.",

    "abstract": "Long-acting injectable (LAI)-PrEP provides better protection against HIV compared to oral PrEP, which requires taking a daily pill. Our study aimed to assess knowledge about oral and LAI-PrEP and identify factors associated with willingness to use LAI-PrEP among key populations (KPs) in Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional study at the Most at Risk Populations Initiative (MARPI) clinic between November and December 2021. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling and interviewed using a structured questionnaire by trained interviewers. Participants were categorised into three groups based on their oral PrEP use: those who had not yet initiated PrEP, those who had discontinued oral PrEP, and those currently on oral PrEP. Modified Poisson regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with the participants' willingness to use LAI-PrEP. Data was analysed using STATA 14 software. Of the 234 participants, 135 (57.7%) were female, 82.5% knew about LAI-PrEP, and 65.8% were willing to use it. The mean age was 28.7 years (standard deviation [SD] 5.8). Willingness to use LAI-PrEP was less likely among divorced, widowed, or separated individuals than singles (i.e., people with no prior marital experience and neither in a romantic relationship) (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43-0.98). Relative to current oral PrEP users, willingness to use LAI-PrEP was similar among those who discontinued oral PrEP (aPR 1.39, 95% CI: 0.92-2.11) and those who had not yet initiated PrEP but were at risk for HIV (aPR 1.26, 95% CI: 0.83-1.89). This cross-sectional analysis of diverse members of KPs in Uganda revealed that the willingness to use LAI-PrEP was lower among individuals who were divorced, separated, or widowed compared to those who were single. Future studies should investigate effective methods for promoting the uptake of long-acting PrEP formulations among populations at high risk of HIV acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Advances in HIV/AIDS treatment have transformed HIV into a manageable chronic condition. However, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other non-communicable diseases are increasingly emerging among people living with HIV (PLHIV), especially in developing countries. This study assessed the prevalence and determinants of CVD risk among PLHIV in Nigeria. A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2024 across ten Nigerian health facilities, involving 1,000 PLHIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, family history of CVD, and HIV-related clinical factors were collected through structured questionnaires and medical records. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted using SPSS v24, with significance set at p < 0.05. Participants had a median age of 48 years (IQR: 41-56), and 60.7% were female. Hypertension (26.2%), overweight (27.9%), high-risk waist-hip ratio (39.6%), and obesity (19.6%) were common. Overall, 61.1% were at risk for CVD. Significant predictors of higher CVD risk included urban residence (aOR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.13-1.94), smoking (aOR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.26-3.68), family history of hypertension (aOR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2-2.4), being on ART for ≥ 10 years (aOR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.01), and infrequent consumption of high-fat, sugar, and salt (HFSS) foods (aOR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.9). Conversely, being retired or a student was associated with lower risk. CVD risk is prevalent among PLHIV in Nigeria and is linked to demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Targeted, integrated interventions, and client-centered care strategies are required to reduce CVD burden among PLHIV.",

We estimated the prevalence and factors associated with MetS among ART naïve PLWH. A multi-centre cross-sectional study was conducted among adult ART naïve PLWH. MetS was defined as presence of any three sub-components; central obesity, raised blood pressure, impaired fasting glucose, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and raised triglycerides. Modified World Health Organization (WHO) Steps questionnaire was used to collect information on demographics, behavioral, and physical measurements. Fasting blood samples were taken for blood sugar, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and triglyceride measurements. MetS prevalence was estimated and logistic regression used to determine associated factors. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were reported. Of 347 ART naïve PLWH with median age 38 years (IQR:19–67), MetS prevalence was at 15.3% (95% CI: 11.7–19.5). Abnormal HDLc was the most prevalent MetS sub-component 64.8% (95% CI: 59.6–69.9). Each year increase in age of participants increased odds of Mets by 4% (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07). Being overweight/obese increased the odds of having MetS by 3.2 times compared to being of healthy weight (aOR = 3.2, 95% CI: 1.6–6.3). We found that about one in seven ART Naïve PLWH in Accra, Ghana, met the diagnostic criteria for MetS. The contributory factors were consistent with known risk factors for cardiometabolic illnesses. We recommend routine screening of PLWH for MetS sub-components.",

    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces morbidity and mortality due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In 2019, Tanzania adopted Dolutegravir (DTG) as a first-, second-line, and third-line treatment for children and adolescents living with HIV (CALHIV). Viral load suppression (VLS) is desirable in the prevention of HIV transmission thus achieving the third '95' target. DTG treatment has highly potent antiviral activity, a high genetic barrier to resistance, and a high safety profile. We aimed to determine VLS and associated factors among CALHIV on DTG-based ART in Tanzania. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis among CALHIV who were on a DTG-based regimen in Tanzania between 2019 and 2021. We extracted demographic and clinical characteristics from the care and treatment clinic database. A multilevel mixed effects Poisson regression model was used to determine factors associated with VLS at < 1000 copies/ml among CALHIV on a DTG-based regimen. A total of 63,453 CALHIV on a DTG-based regimen were analysed. The proportion of viral suppression was 91.64%. Overall, 66.19% of previously unsuppressed individuals became suppressed, and 88.45% of previously suppressed remained suppressed. Factors leading to higher chances of viral suppression were aged 15–19 years (aRR: 1.02; 95%CI: 1.017–1.03), those in WHO stage I (aRR: 1.03; 95%CI: 1.01–1.04), those in WHO stage II (aRR: 1.02; 95%CI: 1.00-1.04), and those who ever received a multi-month prescription on ART (aRR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.23–1.28), while those aged 10–14 years (aRR: 0.98; 95%CI: 0.97–0.99), previously unsuppressed prior to starting DTG (aRR: 0.92; 95%CI: 0.91–0.93), duration on ART more than 24 months (aRR: 0.96; 95%CI: 0.94–0.97), not retained in care (aRR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77–0.89), severe malnutrition (aRR:0.77; 95%CI: 0.69–0.94) and coastal zone (aRR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96–0.99) were less likely to achieve VLS. This study showed DTG-based regimens have a good response for both naïve, previously unsuppressed, and suppressed Children and Adolescents Living with HIV (CALHIV) with significant improvement in viral suppression. Improving retention in care and malnutrition might improve VLS and achieve the third '95'.",

Despite the widespread use of the antiretroviral therapy (ART) for women of reproductive age, its impact on abortion prevalence remains unclear. We set out to determine the prevalence of abortion among the YWLHIV receiving TLD-based ART regimen in northern Uganda and its association with the ART regimen and duration alongside other key socio-demographic, reproductive health, lifestyle and facility access- related factors. A cross-sectional study of YWLHIV who reported at least one pregnancy in northern Uganda. Using an interviewer-administered questionnaire, participants were asked about their abortion history, ART regimen and duration, contraceptive use, parity, male partner's HIV status, and access to community-based family planning resources. Descriptive statistics for abortion prevalence, Chi-square test, Fisher's Exact test, bivariate and multivariate Poisson regression analyses for the associations between these variables and the occurrence of abortion were used. The 5% significance level and 95% confidence intervals were considered. We analyzed data of 268 YWLHIV who reported conceiving at least one pregnancy. The abortion prevalence was 20.9% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 16.2% - 26.1%). No significant association was found between the abortion experience and ART regimens nor duration. The significant predictors for abortion included awareness of public health facilities that provide family planning services, parity, sero-concordant HIV-positive partnerships, and modern contraceptive use. This study found a substantial abortion prevalence of 20.9% among the YWLHIV in northern Uganda. There was no significant association between the occurrence of abortion and ART regimens nor duration. Key predictors of abortion included awareness of public health facilities that provide family planning services, parity, use of contraceptive methods and the male partner's HIV positive status. To reduce abortion, creation of awareness of public health facilities that provide family planning services, contraceptive use, and couple-focused HIV testing and status disclosure are recommended.",

    "abstract": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus and malaria are significant public health challenges in sub-Saharan Africa, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality in the region. The trajectory of HIV and malaria mono- and coinfections may be different with presentations of drug-drug and disease-disease interactions. Current medications of artemether-lumefantrine and dolutegravir (DTG) -based anti-retroviral therapy which are the preferred drugs are metabolised by CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5 and UGTs which are polymorphic and may contribute to drug disposition and clinical outcomes. This study investigated the pharmacogenetic effects of co-administration of arthemeter-lumfantrine and DTG in HIV-malaria mono and coinfection. Malaria and HIV mono- and coinfected participants were recruited from health facilities in the Central region of Ghana. Blood samples were taken at pre-defined time points during malaria and HIV mono- and coinfection. Plasma drug concentrations of artemether-lumefantrine and dolutegravir and their metabolites of dihydroartemisinin and desbutyl-lumefantrine were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS). Genotyping for CYP2B6, UGT1A, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 was undertaken using PCR-RFLP, TaqMan assays and Iplex GOLD SNP genotyping protocol. Two hundred and sixty-one participants were involved in this study, with a male to female ratio of 1:2. Median parasitaemia for malaria monoinfection and HIV-malaria coinfection was 947.34 parasites/µL of whole blood and 5287.36 parasites/µL of whole blood respectively on day 1. By days 3 and 7, the parasitaemia had decreased to 0 for both malaria monoinfection and HIV-malaria coinfections. Plasma median Cday 7 for lumefantrine was 741.5 (496.0, 1276.0) ng/mL for malaria monoinfection and 426.0 (254.5, 803) ng/mL for malaria and HIV coinfection (MHC) showing a decreased plasma concentration during coadministration with DTG. There was a decrease in the plasma concentration of DTG in MHC cases compared to HIV monoinfection. This trend is observed in CYP3A5 rs776746, CYP3A rs10264272, CYP3A4 rs2740574, UGT1A1 rs4148323 and CYP2B6 rs28399499 genetic variations. There is an observed decrease in plasma drug concentrations during the co-administration of artemether-lumefantrine and dolutegravir. Possible long-term effects from non-adherence may include sub-optimal levels that could result in clinical differences and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Many people with HIV experience considerable barriers to accessing HIV clinic services. Options that would permit blood sampling that preclude the need for in-clinic visits and increase privacy would aid in overcoming many of the obstacles that hinder receiving adequate HIV care. Methods In Project Home-MaDE, 57 participants were evaluated for their ability to collect fingerstick blood (minimum 250 µL) in Microtainer tubes (MCT), then package and overnight mail specimens following kit instructions without assistance. Specimens were required to arrive at the laboratory within four days of collection. Plasma viral loads obtained from mailed blood were compared to matched venipuncture samples collected on the same day. For fingerstick-derived plasma, the limit of quantitation was 210 copies/mL, a benchmark relevant for Undetectable = Untransmissible prevention. A non-reactive or below-quantifiable result reflected viral suppression. Self-collected dried blood spots which have historically been used for remote blood sampling were likewise evaluated. Results Forty-seven (82%) participants had acceptable MCT samples for testing. Ten specimens were rejected either for excessive time and temperature ( n = 1) or insufficient sample volume ( n = 9). Of the 34 participants who initially experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient sample 29 elected to retry and 24 were successful. All 46 acceptable MCT plasmas tested provided accurate results as compared to the suppression levels in their matched conventional venipuncture viral loads. Conclusion Under a rigorous protocol, plasma from mailed, self-collected fingersticks by untrained individuals were suitable for remote viral suppression monitoring. This evaluation, however, was limited to temperatures and courier service in the U.S. Approved testing options for self-collected samples may support HIV telemedicine and empower persons to overcome barriers to care services.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Hypoalbuminemia is linked to an earlier onset of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and increased mortality in patients living with HIV infection. Serum albumin is therefore an independent factor for the prediction of disease progression and mortality in People Living With HIV. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted at Lira Regional Referral Hospital in northern Uganda that targeted HIV-positive outpatients attending the ART clinic with a sample size of 373 patients. Data were collected through structured interviews and laboratory tests in which the serum albumin concentration, viral load, and CD4 count were measured. Results The prevalence of hypoalbuminemia was 19.6% (73/373). A moderate positive correlation was observed between the serum albumin concentration and the CD4 count (rs = 0.43, p &lt; 0.001). Patients with no formal education [AOR = 2.03, 95%CI = 1.69–2.07, P = 0.03] were 2.03 times more likely to have hypoalbuminemia than those who had a tertiary/university education level. The odds of having hypoalbuminemia [AOR = 2.17, CI = 1.80–3.06, P = 0.02] were 2.17 higher among HIV-infected patients who were naïve ART than among those who were on ART. Additionally, the odds of having hypoalbuminemia [AOR = 2.91, CI = 2.13–3.66, P = 0.01] were 2.91 higher among HIV-infected patients who were in stage four than among those who were in stage 1. Conclusion Hypoalbuminemia prevalence was high in PLWHIV, and a moderate positive correlation was found between the serum albumin level and the CD4 cell count. Lower education level, not being ART, and advanced HIV disease were independently associated with hypoalbuminemia.",

Despite progress toward UNAIDS 95–95–95 targets, challenges in long-term retention and treatment outcomes persist. This study aimed to evaluate 10-year antiretroviral therapy (ART) outcomes among PLWHIV initiated on treatment in 2013 within Tshwane District, South Africa. Retrospective cohort using Tier.Net data from 1,337 adults across 10 randomly selected facilities (clinics and community health centres [CHCs]). Outcomes were retention, loss to follow‑up (LTFU), mortality, viral suppression, and CD4 recovery. We used Kaplan–Meier methods and multivariable models (Cox for LTFU and mortality, logistic for viral suppression, linear for CD4 change). Mortality analyses were limited to participants with complete ascertainment (n = 640). At 10 years, 47.7% were retained, 30.4% LTFU, 20.1% transferred out, and 3.3% died. Attrition was steepest early and most pronounced among 18–24-year-olds. Advanced WHO stage strongly predicted death (Stage III/IV vs. I/II: aHR 3.06, 95% CI 1.26–7.44), and younger age was protective (≤ 34 vs. > 34 years: aHR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09–0.86). Care at CHCs was associated with lower mortality (aHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13–0.83) and greater CD4 gains (clinic care: −74.35 cells/µL vs. CHCs; p < 0.001). Female sex was associated with larger CD4 recovery (+ 90.06 cells/µL vs. males; p < 0.001). Only baseline CD4 > 200 cells/µL independently predicted viral suppression (aOR for being suppressed ≈ 1.89, derived from aOR 0.53 for non-suppression; p < 0.001). No baseline covariates were significant predictors of time to LTFU (clinic type borderline: HR 0.80, p = 0.086). A decade after initiation, fewer than half remained in care.

Programme priorities should include earlier diagnosis and ART start, youth-friendly retention strategies, and scaling CHC-style differentiated service delivery to improve long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Retention in medical care is essential for people with HIV (PWH) to successfully manage their illness and to reduce HIV transmissions in the United States (U.S.). A major factor that undermines retention in HIV care is co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD). Despite 11–48% of PWH in the U.S. having SUD, few evidence-based retention interventions for this population have been developed. Further, no studies sought guidance from previously out-of-care PWH and substance use histories about what might have helped or hindered their engagement in care when actively using substances. Broaching this topic among people with lived experience could provide novel insights into intervention approaches. Participants were recruited from an HIV primary care clinic in the Northeastern United States. This qualitative study conducted individual in-depth interviews with n = 8 PWH and substance use histories focused on their experiences of being out of care and advice they might have to improve retention for PWH and SUD. Thematic analysis revealed the significance of SUD-related stigma, both as a primary source of stigmatization fears, even when compared to HIV, as well as the enacted stigma associated with SUD in HIV treatment settings. SUD stigma undermined retention in HIV care. Participants highlighted that SUD must be addressed for HIV care engagement to improve. Findings indicate that novel pathways to address HIV and SUD must be developed. Approaches that reduce stigma risk, such as the \"status neutral\" approach to care, could support engagement in care for this population.",

This qualitative study examined the acceptability and usage of C4L-IVR, barriers and enablers of adherence and retention in care among youth living with HIV in rural Uganda. Methods Nested within a randomised intervention trial (NCT 04718974), this qualitative study examined youth 16–24 years old, through focus group discussions and indepth interviews at study end. Induction and deduction analysis was done with support of Nvivo software guided by the information motivation behavioral theory. Results Between 9th December 2021 and 28th Apr 2022, 68 participants were recruited, with 38 (56%) females. We conducted 14 interviews 7 focused group discussions (FGD) (02 female only FGD; 5 mixed); and 7 in-depth interviews (IDI) (4 males and 3 females IDI. Seven main themes were identified: information received from the system, motivation from system calls, behavioural skills, barriers to adherence and retention, acceptability of the tool, experiences, and suggestions for improvement. All youth accepted the tool, scoring it highly comfortable on a 5 Likert scale, where 5 was “very comfortable” and 1 “not at all comfortable'. Conclusion The high acceptability and usage of C4L system along with impact on behavioral skills, this system had more enablers than barriers to ART adherence and retention in care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background While Dolutegravir (DTG) containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) has become the preferred regimen for people living with HIV (PLHIV), the pace and equity of its adoption, especially among subgroups with tuberculosis (TB) symptoms and advanced HIV disease (AHD), remain understudied in high-burden settings like rural KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. This study describes the transition to DTG and examines the effect of TB and AHD (CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm 3 ) on the likelihood of transitioning to DTG in rural KZN, South Africa. Methods We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis using routine HIV program data from 69,916 PLHIV aged ≥ 15 years attending 19 HIV clinics in rural KZN, between 1st October 2019, and December 31st 2023. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated time to DTG transition, while a multivariate mixed-effect Cox proportional hazards model evaluated factors associated with transitioning to DTG. Results Of the 69,916 PLHIV included in the cohort, 49,365 (70.6%) were female, and the median age of the PLHIV was 40 years (IQR: 32–49). By the end of the follow-up period, 70.9% ( n = 49,598) of the PLHIV transitioned to DTG in 165,880 person-years. The median time to DTG transition was 14 months among PLHIV without TB symptoms, compared to 22 months among those with TB symptoms. Similarly, PLHIV with CD4 counts ≥ 350 cells/mm³ transitioned at a median of 14 months, while those with CD4 &lt; 200 cells/mm³ transitioned 14 months later. The likelihood of transitioning to DTG was 22% lower among PLHIV with TB symptoms (aHR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.82) compared to their counterparts without TB symptoms, and 43% lower among PLHIV with AHD (aHR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.54,1.59) compared to their counterparts without AHD. Conclusion Our analysis showed that over a quarter of the PLHIV in rural KZN remained on non-DTG-containing regimens by 31st December 2023. PLHIV coinfected with TB and having AHD transitioned at a slower pace than their counterparts.",

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CXCL10 differences between people living with HIV (PLWH) with and without HAND and to assess the odds of HAND in relation to high versus low CSF CXCL10 levels. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched. Observational studies reporting CSF CXCL10 levels in adult PLWH with and without HAND were included. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and odds ratio (OR) were pooled using random-effects models accounting for the potential influence of heterogeneity. Eleven studies involving 1,536 PLWH were included. Compared to those without HAND, PLWH with HAND had significantly higher CSF CXCL10 levels (SMD: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.17–0.96; p < 0.001), with high heterogeneity (I² = 86% and τ² = 0.31). The 95% prediction interval (PI: − 0.78 to 1.91) indicated substantial between-study variability. Subgroup analyses showed significantly greater CXCL10 elevation in studies with ≤ 50% ART coverage (SMD: 0.90 vs. 0.17; p = 0.04) and in those evaluating HIV-associated dementia (SMD: 1.45 vs. 0.37; p < 0.001). Meta-regression did not identify any statistically significant moderators, although ART proportion and CD4 + count explained 29.2% and 25.6% of the variance, respectively. No significant association was found between high CSF CXCL10 and HAND (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 0.90–2.22; p = 0.13). Elevated CSF CXCL10 may be associated with HAND in PLWH, particularly among ART-naïve individuals and in more severe cognitive impairment. However, substantial heterogeneity and a wide PI suggest that the strength of this association varies across populations. CSF CXCL10 remains a promising but not definitive biomarker for HAND risk stratification.",

However, the impact of COVID-19 among PLWHA in Brazil remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 mortality in the Brazilian population. A multilevel study was conducted using data from the Brazilian Mortality Information System. We examined COVID-19 mortality among individuals with and without mention of HIV on their death certificates from 2020 to 2022. Mixed generalized linear regression models were used, considering the COVID-19 dominant Variant of Concern (VOC) and the vaccine rollout period, adjusted for age group and sex, interaction between HIV and age group, and random effects for federative units. A total of 4,773,337 deaths were analyzed, including 39,011 among PLWHA. Younger (18–39) and older (80+) PLWHA had higher odds of COVID-19 death, particularly during Delta and Omicron periods. Mortality odds among PLWHA were lower during the vaccination expansion phase but increased during the consolidated phase. Regional disparities were observed, with higher mortality odds in Northern and Northeastern Brazil. HIV infection was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality in Brazil, particularly in specific age groups and regions. Older adults with HIV had an elevated risk of COVID-19 death across all periods. The vaccine rollout reduced COVID-19 mortality among PLWHA, but the results did not hold over time, as evidenced by the increased odds of death in all age groups following vaccination coverage consolidation in the population.",

    "abstract": "RNA and DNA aptamers specific for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) can inhibit reverse transcription in vitro. RNA aptamers have been shown to potently block HIV-1 replication in culture. We previously reported mutants of HIV-1 RT with substitutions N255D or N265D that display resistance to the DNA aptamer RT1t49. Variant viruses bearing these mutations singly or in combination were compromised for replication. In order to address the wider applicability of such aptamers, HIV-1 RT variants containing the N255D, N265D or both (Dbl) were tested for the extent of their cross-resistance to other DNA/RNA aptamers as well as to other RT inhibitors. Both N265D and Dbl RTs were resistant to most aptamers tested. N255D mutant displayed mild resistance to two of the DNA aptamers, little change in sensitivity to three and hypersensitivity to one. Although all mutants displayed wild type-like ribonuclease H activity, their activity was compromised under conditions that prevent re-binding. This suggests that the processivity defect caused by these mutations can also affect RNase H function thus contributing further to the replication defect in mutant viruses. These results indicate that mutants conferring resistance to anti-RT aptamers significantly affect many HIV-1 RT enzymatic activities, which could contribute to preventing the development of resistance in vivo. If such mutations were to arise in vivo, our results suggest that variant viruses should remain susceptible to many existing anti-RT inhibitors. This result was tempered by the observation that NRTI-resistance mutations such as K65R can confer resistance to some anti-RT aptamers.",

    "abstract": "Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, causes significant gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, even at low doses. This ritonavir-induced nausea could be related to its oxidative stress in the gut. Alleviation of drug-induced nausea is important in effectively increasing patients' compliance and improving their quality of life. Conventional anti-emetic drugs can only partially abate the symptoms in these patients, and their cost has also been a concern. Rats respond to nausea-producing emetic stimuli by increasing consumption of non-nutritive substances like kaolin or clay, a phenomenon known as pica. In this study, we used this rat pica model to evaluate the effects of Scutellaria baicalensis, a commonly used oriental herbal medicine, on ritonavir-induced nausea.Rats treated with 20 mg/kg ritonavir significant caused increases of kaolin consumption at 24 to 48 hr (P < 0.01). Pretreatment with 0.3 and 3 mg/kg Scutellaria baicalensis extract significantly decreased ritonavir-induced kaolin intake in a dose-related manner (P < 0.01). Compared to vehicle treatment, the extract completely prevented ritonavir-induced kaolin consumption at dose 3 mg/kg. The area under the curves (AUC) for kaolin intake from time 0 to 120 hr for vehicle only, ritonavir only, SbE 0.3 mg/kg plus ritonavir, and SbE 3 mg/kg plus ritonavir were 27.3 g x hr, 146.7 g x hr, 123.2 g x hr, and 32.7 g x hr, respectively. The reduction in area under the curves of kaolin intake from time 0 to 120 hr between ritonavir only and SbE 0.3 mg/kg plus ritonavir, ritonavir only and SbE 3 mg/kg plus ritonavir were 16.0% and 77.7%, respectively.Scutellaria baicalensis significantly attenuated ritonavir-induced pica, and demonstrated a potential in treating ritonavir-induced nausea.",

In the past, rates of OIs in the United States have been calculated in observational cohorts, which may have limited representativeness. We used data from a 1998 population-based survey of persons in care for HIV infection to demonstrate the utility of population-based survey data for the calculation of OI rates, with inference to populations in care for HIV infection in three geographic areas: King County Washington, selected health districts in Louisiana, and the state of Michigan. The overall OI rate was 13.8 per 100 persons with HIV infection in care during 1998 (95% CI, 10.2–17.3). In 1998, an estimated 11.3% of all persons with HIV in care in these areas had at least one OI diagnosis (CI, 8.8–13.9). The most commonly diagnosed OIs were Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) (annual incidence 2.4 per 100 persons, CI 1.0–3.8) and cytomegalovirus retinitis (annual incidence 2.4 per 100 persons, CI 1.0–3.7). OI diagnosis rates were higher in Michigan than in the other two geographic areas, and were different among patients who were white, black and of other races, but were not different by sex or history of injection drug use. Data from population-based surveys – and, in the coming years, clinical outcomes surveillance systems in the United States – can be used to calculate OI rates with improved generalizability, and such rates should be used in the future as a meaningful indicator of clinical outcomes in persons with HIV infection in care.",

They are the primary source of sexual health information for potential users, in both the public and private health sectors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine perceptions of vaginal microbicides as a potential HIV prevention method among health care providers in Durban and Hlabisa, South Africa, using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.During 2004, semi structured interviews with 149 health care providers were conducted. Fifty seven percent of hospital managers, 40% of pharmacists and 35% of nurses possessed some basic knowledge of microbicides, such as the product being used intra-vaginally before sex to prevent HIV infection. The majority of them were positive about microbicides and were willing to counsel users regarding potential use. Providers from both public and private sectors felt that an effective microbicide should be available to all people, regardless of HIV status. Providers felt that the product should be accessed over-the-counter in pharmacies and in retail stores. They also felt a need for potential microbicides to be available free of charge, and packaged with clear instructions. The media was seen by health care providers as being an effective strategy for promoting microbicides.Overall, health care providers were very positive about the possible introduction of an effective microbicide for HIV prevention. The findings generated by this study illustrated the need for training health care providers prior to making the product accessible, as well as the importance of addressing the potential barriers to use of the product by women. These are important concerns in the health care community, and this study also served to educate them for the day when research becomes reality.",

We examined the admission case notes of all the adult admissions to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital where one of the discharge diagnosis was HIV infection during the April 2004 through March 2006. Data collected included patients' profile, including the date of diagnosis of HIV infection, outcome of the current admission in term of discharge or death and the final diagnosis at the time of discharge or death.Over the 24 months period there were 431 adult admissions to the medical wards of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital where one of the discharge diagnosis was HIV infection and this accounted for 5.9% of all medical admissions. 258(60%) admissions were in persons who were known to be HIV infected prior to the current admission, where as diagnosis of HIV infection was made for the first time during the current admission in case of remaining 76(47.5%) cases. Nearly half of those hospitalized, had a CD 4 cell counts of < 200/microL. Over all, opportunistic infection was the commonest (35%) discharge diagnosis, followed by serious bacterial infections, anemia and HIV nephropathy. The outcome of these admissions was death in 30 (14.2%) cases where as patient was discharged out in the remaining 181 (85.8%) cases. Of the medical admissions with HIV as one of the discharge diagnosis during the period April 04 through March 05, 43% were newly diagnosed HIV infection and the corresponding figure for the period April 05 through March 06 was 35% (P = 0.54). During the April 05 through March 04 significantly higher proportion of HIV infected adults had Anemia with a Hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL (P = 0.044), HIV related nephropathy (P = 0.0003), HAART toxicity (P = < 0.0001) and a Non-AIDS related conditions (P = 0.043) as one of the final discharge diagnosis.A significant proportion of patients admitted with HIV infection were the newly diagnosed and severely immuno-suppressed. An opportunistic infection continues to be the commonest discharge diagnosis, although there was a growing trend in the proportion of the discharge diagnosis being HAART toxicity and Non-AIDS related conditions. Over all hospitalization of HIV infected persons still carries a significant risk of mortality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The tablet formulation of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r; Kaletra ® ) has many advantages over the soft gel capsule (SGC) formulation, including lower pill count, no refrigeration requirement, and no dietary restrictions. These advantages may help improve patient compliance and therefore increase adherence to treatment. However, there are limited data regarding patient preferences and only recently was the comparative efficacy and tolerability data of LPV/r SGC versus tablet formulation presented at an international conference. To address this deficit, we conducted a market research survey to assess potential tolerability benefits, patient satisfaction, changes in adherence, and formulation preference in patients switching from SGCs to the tablet formulation. Data from 332 patients who switched from LPV/r SGCs twice-daily (BID) to tablets BID and 41 patients who switched from LPV/r SGCs BID or once daily (QD) to tablets QD were analyzed. Results Switching from SGCs to a tablet formulation of LPV/r was associated with increased patient satisfaction, tolerability and self-reported adherence to treatment; gastrointestinal side effects were reduced. In addition, respondents indicated that they preferred the tablet formulation to the SGC. Conclusion The LPV/r tablet formulation provides HIV-infected patients with multiple benefits over the SGC in terms of tolerability and convenience. Additional assessments to further define the tolerability profile of the LPV/r tablet, including studies using once-daily dosing, are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Protease inhibitors such as ritonavir can cause nausea and vomiting which is the most common reason for discontinuation. Rats react to nauseous and emetic stimuli by increasing their oral intake of non-nutritive substances like kaolin, known as pica behavior. In this study, we evaluated the effects of methylnaltrexone, a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that does not affect analgesia, on ritonavir-induced nausea and vomiting in a rat pica model.We observed that 24 to 48 hr after administration of oral ritonavir 20 mg/kg, kaolin consumption increased significantly in rats (P < 0.01). This increase was attenuated by pretreatment with an intraperitoneal injection of methylnaltrexone (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) in a dose dependent manner (P < 0.01) and also with naloxone (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) (P < 0.01). The areas under the curve for kaolin intake from time 0 to 120 hr were significantly reduced after administration of the opioid antagonists. Food intake was not significantly affected. Plasma naltrexone levels were measured after methylnaltrexone injection, and no detectable levels were found, indicating that methylnaltrexone was not demethylated in our experimental paradigm.These results suggest that methylnaltrexone may have potential clinical utility in reducing nausea and vomiting in HIV patients who take ritonavir.",

The outcome was complicated cryptococcal meningitis: prolonged (≥ 14 days) altered mental status, persistent (≥ 14 days) focal neurologic findings, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt placement or death. Predictor variable operating characteristics were estimated using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of the outcome. From 1990-2009, 82 patients with first episode of cryptococcal meningitis were identified. Of these, 14 (17%) met criteria for complicated forms of cryptococcal meningitis (prolonged altered mental status 6, persistent focal neurologic findings 7, CSF surgical shunt placement 8, and death 5). Patients with complicated cryptococcal meningitis had higher frequency of baseline focal neurological findings, head computed tomography (CT) abnormalities, mean CSF opening pressure, and cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) titers in serum and CSF. ROC area of log2 serum and CSF CRAG titers to predict complicated forms of cryptococcal meningitis were comparable, 0.78 (95%CI: 0.66 to 0.90) vs. 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.89), respectively (χ2, p = 0.95). The ROC areas to predict the outcomes were similar for CSF pressure and CSF CRAG titers. In a multiple logistic regression model, the following were significant predictors of the outcome: baseline focal neurologic findings, head CT abnormalities and log2 CSF CRAG titer. During initial clinical evaluation, a focal neurologic exam, abnormal head CT and large cryptococcal burden measured by CRAG titer are associated with the outcome of complicated cryptococcal meningitis following 2 weeks from antifungal therapy initiation.",

    "abstract": "Although being considered as a rarely observed HIV-1 protease mutation in clinical isolates, the L76V-prevalence increased 1998-2008 in some European countries most likely due to the approval of Lopinavir, Amprenavir and Darunavir which can select L76V. Beside an enhancement of resistance, L76V is also discussed to confer hypersusceptibility to the drugs Atazanavir and Saquinavir which might enable new treatment strategies by trying to take advantage of particular mutations.Based on a cohort of 47 L76V-positive patients, we examined if there might exist a clinical advantage for L76V-positive patients concerning long-term success of PI-containing regimens in patients with limited therapy options.Genotypic- and phenotypic HIV-resistance tests from 47 mostly multi-resistant, L76V-positive patients throughout Germany were accomplished retrospectively 1999-2009. Five genotype-based drug-susceptibility predictions received from online interpretation-tools for Atazanavir, Saquinavir, Amprenavir and Lopinavir, were compared to phenotype-based predictions that were determined by using a recombinant virus assay along with a Virtual Phenotype™(Virco). The clinical outcome of the L76V-adapted follow-up therapy was determined by monitoring viral load for 96 weeks.In this analysis, the mostly used interpretation systems overestimated the L76V-mutation concerning Atazanavir- and SQV resistance. In fact, a clear benefit in drug susceptibility for these drugs was observed in phenotype analysis after establishment of L76V. More importantly, long-term therapy success was significantly higher in patients receiving Atazanavir and/or Saquinavir plus one L76V-selecting drug compared to patients without L76V-selecting agents (p = 0.002).In case of L76V-occurrence ATV and/or SQV may represent encouraging options for patients in deep salvage situations.",

This analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with increased risk of post-HAART mortality.We evaluated baseline (prior to HAART initiation) clinical, demographic and laboratory factors (including CD4+ count and HIV RNA level) for associations with subsequent mortality in 1,600 patients who began HAART in a prospective observational cohort of HIV-infected U.S. military personnel.Cumulative mortality was 5%, 10% and 18% at 4, 8 and 12 years post-HAART. Mortality was highest (6.23 deaths/100 person-years [PY]) in those with ≤ 50 CD4+ cells/mm3 before HAART initiation, and became progressively lower as CD4+ counts increased (0.70/100 PY with ≥ 500 CD4+ cells/mm3). In multivariate analysis, factors significantly (p < 0.05) associated with post-HAART mortality included: increasing age among those ≥ 40 years (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32 per 5 year increase), clinical AIDS events before HAART (HR = 1.93), ≤ 50 CD4+ cells/mm3 (vs. CD4+ ≥ 500, HR = 2.97), greater HIV RNA level (HR = 1.36 per one log10 increase), hepatitis C antibody or chronic hepatitis B (HR = 1.96), and HIV diagnosis before 1996 (HR = 2.44).

    "abstract": "At present, there is no effective vaccine or other approved product for the prevention of sexually transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. It has been reported that women in resource-poor communities use vaginally applied citrus juices as topical microbicides. These easily accessible food products have historically been applied to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and cytotoxicity of these substances using an established topical microbicide testing algorithm. Freshly squeezed lemon and lime juice and household vinegar were tested in their original state or in pH neutralized form for efficacy and cytotoxicity in the CCR5-tropic cell-free entry and cell-associated transmission assays, CXCR4-tropic entry and fusion assays, and in a human PBMC-based anti-HIV-1 assay. These products were also tested for their effect on viability of cervico-vaginal cell lines, human cervical explant tissues, and beneficial Lactobacillus species. Natural lime and lemon juice and household vinegar demonstrated anti-HIV-1 activity and cytotoxicity in transformed cell lines. Neutralization of the products reduced both anti-HIV-1 activity and cytotoxicity, resulting in a low therapeutic window for both acidic and neutralized formulations. For the natural juices and vinegar, the IC50 was ≤ 3.5 (0.8-3.5)% and the TC50 ≤ 6.3 (1.0-6.3)%. All three liquid products inhibited viability of beneficial Lactobacillus species associated with vaginal health. Comparison of three different toxicity endpoints in the cervical HeLa cell line revealed that all three products affected membrane integrity, cytosolic enzyme release, and dehydrogenase enzyme activity in living cells. The juices and vinegar also exerted strong cytotoxicity in cervico-vaginal cell lines, mainly due to their acidic pH. In human cervical explant tissues, treatment with 5% lemon or lime juice or 6% vinegar induced toxicity similar to application of 100 μg/ml nonoxynol-9, and exposure to 10% lime juice caused tissue damage comparable to treatment with 5% Triton-X-100. Lemon and lime juice and household vinegar do not fulfill the safety criteria mandated for a topical microbicide. As a result of their unphysiological formulation for the vaginal tract, they exhibit cytotoxicity to human cell lines, human vaginal tissues, and beneficial vaginal Lactobacillus species.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of medication efficacy and safety is an essential guarantee to successful therapeutic outcome in public health practices. However, larger distribution chain supply in developing countries such as Cameroon is often challenged by counterfeit drugs, poor manufacturing, storage and degradation leading to health and patient adverse consequences. Yet, access to supply chain management in strengthening ARVs quality assurance and outcomes remains poorly documented. More than 53,000 patients have been enrolled on free ARVs medications, but little is documented on quality assurance and validity of safety for affected populations along the supply chain management since 2008.The cross sectional study was conducted in ARVs distribution units and centers in central, littoral and south west regions of Cameroon. ARVs drugs samples included Nevirapine, Efavirenz, and fixed dose combinations of Zidovudine + Lamivudine, Lamivudine + Stavudine and Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Nevirapine. Drugs packaging and labeling was assessed and galenic assays were performed at National Laboratory of quality Control of Medications and Expertise (LANACOME), Yaoundé, Cameroon.The study covered 16 structures located in eight different towns including the central ARVs store, two regional pharmaceutical procurement centers and thirteen HIV approved treatment centers and management units. A total of 35 ARVs products were collected. Only eight ARVs drugs containing Lamivudine and Stavudine presented with white stains on tablets, however these drugs were standard for all other tests performed. The others 28 ARVs products were standards to all assays performed.We concluded that ARVs drugs freely accessible and distributed to PLWHA are of good quality in Cameroon. However, with the increase number of patients under HAART since 2013, adoption of \"Test and Treat\" approach to reach the 90-90-90 goals and with the implementation of new national antiretroviral regimen guidelines and molecules such as boosted protease inhibitors, continuous quality control and assurance surveillance, monitoring and evaluation is recommended. Assessment of quality of formulations that are more susceptible to degradation such as pediatric formulations for averting the rising multidrug resistance trend is also desired.",

RNA-flow cytometric fluorescence in situ hybridisation (RNA Flow-FISH) is a powerful technique, which enables detection of mRNAs in conjunction with proteins at a single-cell level.

We discuss how CD4 T cell responses to HIV antigens, both following vaccination and HIV infection, can be characterized by measurement of cytokine mRNAs.

    "abstract": "Human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and has been associated with an increasing number of hematologic diseases such as primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) (both classic and extracavitary form), multicentric Castleman disease and the germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder. PEL is a rare B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects immunocompromised patients; aggressive chemotherapy and antiretroviral therapy (ART) with protease inhibitors have been used, with poor results. We present a case of extracavitary PEL in an HIV-infected patient, regressed after ART initiation.A 42-year-old male was admitted to the emergency room because of several months of malaise, fever and progressive deterioration of the general conditions. On physical examination soft non-painful subcutaneous masses were palpable at retronuchal, retroauricolar and thoracic regions. HIV serology resulted positive: HIV plasma viremia was 782,270 copies/mL, CD4 103 cells/mL. The excision of one of the masses, metabolically active at a positron emission tomography (PET-CT) scan, revealed an HHV8-related extracavitary PEL. HHV8 plasma viremia was 44,826 copies/mL. ART with tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine/dolutegravir was started together with ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus chorioretinitis. The progressive disappearance of the masses was seen after 6 weeks of ART, and a PET-CT scan resulted completely negative at 3 months. After 19 months of ART the patient was in remission of PEL, HIV viremia was undetectable (< 20 copies/mL), CD4 count was 766 cells/mL and HHV8 viremia was undetectable.In this clinical case, the complete regression of PEL has been achieved after the immune recovery, as a consequence of ART introduction, without chemotherapy. It cannot be excluded that ganciclovir, used for the treatment of CMV chorioretinitis, may have contributed to the control of HHV8 replication. Whether to try or not a conservative approach in HIV-infected PEL patients must be carefully evaluated, considering the patient's characteristics and the prognostic factors.",

The efficacy/safety of switching to D/C/F/TAF versus continuing boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) + emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (control) were demonstrated in a phase 3, randomized study (EMERALD) of treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed adults through week 48. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate EMERALD outcomes across subgroups of patients based on demographic characteristics, prior treatment experience, and baseline antiretroviral regimen.EMERALD patients were virologically suppressed (viral load [VL] < 50 copies/mL for ≥ 2 months at screening). Prior non-darunavir virologic failure (VF) was allowed. Primary endpoint was proportion of patients with virologic rebound (confirmed VL ≥ 50 copies/mL) cumulative through week 48. Virologic response was VL < 50 copies/mL (FDA snapshot). Safety was assessed by adverse events, renal proteinuria markers, and bone mineral density. Outcomes were examined for prespecified subgroups by age (≤/> 50 years), gender, race (black/non-black), prior number of antiretrovirals used (4/5/6/7/> 7), prior VF (0/≥ 1), baseline bPI (darunavir/atazanavir or lopinavir), and baseline boosting agent (ritonavir/cobicistat).Among 1141 patients in the D/C/F/TAF (n = 763) and control (n = 378) arms, virologic rebound rates (2.5% and 2.1%, respectively) were similar, and this was consistent across all subgroups.

Improvements in renal and bone parameters were observed with D/C/F/TAF across demographic subgroups.For treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed patients, switching to D/C/F/TAF was highly effective and safe, regardless of demographic characteristics, prior treatment experience, or pre-switch bPI.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Limited data are available regarding correlates of regular sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV screening among female sex workers (FSW) in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we aimed to assess the frequency of regular syphilis and HIV screening and the psychosocial correlates associated with screening among FSW in Uganda. Methods This cross-sectional correlational study was conducted among 441 FSW, aged 17–49 years. We enrolled FSW through peer referrals and ascertained self-reported data on number of serological tests for HIV, syphilis and other STIs in the prior 12 months using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. In addition, we assessed attitudes, norms, social influences and self-efficacy towards 3-monthly Syphilis and 6-monthly HIV testing. We estimated the correlates of regular STI and HIV testing using negative binomial regression. Results Of the respondents 420 (95.2%) reported to have ever taken an HIV test with 297 (67.4%) testing two or more times in the prior 12 months. Over half of the respondents (59%) reported ever taking a syphilis test with only 62 (14.1%) reporting testing three or more times in the prior 12 months. After adjusting for socio-demographics, attitude and norms, high perceived self-efficacy was associated with a 33% increase in the likelihood of repeated HIV testing [prevalence ratio (PR), 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15–1.53] while low perceived confidence was associated with a 25% decrease in the likelihood of repeated HIV testing (PR, 0.75, 95% CI 0.63–0.89). Similarly low attitudes and norms were associated with a decrease of 52.6% (PR, 0.47, 95% CI 0.37–0.61) and 47% (PR, 0.53, 95% CI 0.41–0.69) in the likelihood of repeated syphilis testing respectively. Conclusion Compared to HIV, uptake of repeated syphilis testing was very low. Correlates of HIV testing include; perceived self-efficacy amidst barriers and perceived confidence for HIV and low attitudes and accepting norms for syphilis. Health campaigns should emphasize overcoming barriers to HIV testing while promoting attitudes and norms including integration of serological syphilis testing and other STIs into HIV services.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background As antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs expand access, there is an increase in burden to a healthcare system. These results are reduced provider-patient contact time and poor programmatic and patient outcomes. Quality management offers providers a standardized approach for addressing the appropriateness of care to be applied in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to determine the trend of performance on HIV/AIDS quality management indicators of health facilities providing ART over a period of 5 years. Methods The annual performance scores of quality of care (QoC) indicators of 31 health facilities providing ART was extracted from a database covering a period of 5 years (from October 2008 to September 2012). The data are percentages that indicate scores of each health facility assessed based on compliance to National ART guidelines categorized into several indicator domains. A Chi square statistic for the trend, as well as test for departure from the trend line was determined. The p value associated with each indicator provides the significant level for testing an alternative hypothesis that the rate of change over the period considered for that indicator does not equal to zero. The slope of the regression line also gives the magnitude of the rate of change for each indicator by healthcare level across the review period. Results Generally, performance trends showed improvement across most indicator domains. The highest improvement occurred for “3 month loss to follow-up” and “1 year no-visit”, with scores declining from 37 to 3%, and 42% to 12% respectively. However, there was a sharp decline in performance between 2010 and 2012 in weight monitoring of patients (p &lt; 0.01), adherence assessment to ARVs (p &lt; 0.01) and hematocrit measurements (p = 0.01). The aggregate rate of change β, as obtained from the slope of the trend line is highly significant (p &lt; 0.01) for all the quality of care indicators considered, whether improving or declining. Conclusion Periodic assessment to determine HIV/AIDS quality of care can guide rapid scale-up of services to achieve universal coverage in resource-limited settings. Determining trends to understand patterns is very useful for improving programmatic and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is widely used in the management of HIV-infection, but has been associated with renal impairment in a small proportion of patients. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a novel prodrug of tenofovir, causes less renal impairment and can improve renal function in patients switched from TDF. The factors which predict improved renal function in patients switching from TDF to TAF have yet to be described. Aim To determine which patient factors are associated with an improvement in renal function following the switch from a TDF- to a TAF-based HIV antiretroviral regimen. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed of a cohort from a publicly funded sexual health clinic in Sydney, Australia. All HIV-positive clinic patients switched from a TDF- to TAF-containing regimen between January 2016 and August 2018 were eligible for inclusion. Laboratory results were obtained from patients’ electronic medical records. The statistical significance of differences between pre- and post-switch means was determined by paired t-tests, adjusted for baseline values, and associations between continuous variables by univariate linear regression. Results 79 patients met inclusion criteria. The majority were male (89%), with a median age of 44 years (IQR: 34.5 to 53). Patients had a mean pre-switch estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 95 ± 2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and there was no significant change post-switch (p = 0.062). Pre-switch eGFR was a significant predictor of the magnitude of eGFR change after the switch (p &lt; 0.001), but there was no significant association with age (p = 0.189), cumulative TDF exposure (p = 0.454) or baseline urinary protein to creatinine ratio (p = 0.814). Conclusion While there was no significant difference in mean eGFR, in patients switched from TDF to TAF, baseline eGFR was a significant predictor of the change in eGFR. This suggests that patients on TDF with poorer baseline renal function would benefit more from switching to TAF. Further study to explore this association is warranted.",

Sub-therapeutic drug levels were defined according to published reference cutoffs. The diagnostic validity of drug levels for virologic failure was assessed using plasma viral loads as a gold standard. Sub-therapeutic ART concentrations explained only 38.2% of virologic failure with a probability of experiencing virologic failure of 0.66 in a patient with low drug levels versus 0.25 for participants with measurements within or above the normal range. Approximately 90% of participants with ART concentrations above the lower clinical cut off did not have virologic failure. These results support prior indication for therapeutic drug monitoring in cases of suspected virologic failure.",

    "abstract": "In many preclinical AIDS research studies, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is administered to experimentally simian immunodeficiency (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques for reduction of viral load to undetectable levels. Prolonged treatment of macaques with a high dose of PMPA (9-[2-(r)-(phosphonomethoxy) propyl] adenine or tenofovir; 30 mg/kg of body weight subcutaneously once daily) can result in proximal renal tubular dysfunction, a Fanconi-like syndrome characterized by glucosuria, aminoaciduria, hypophosphatemia, and bone pathology. In contrast, chronic administration of a low dose of PMPA (10 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily) starting at birth does not seem to be associated with any adverse health effects within 3 years of treatment. In contrast to PMPA, limited information on systemic toxicity in rhesus monkeys is available for FTC (5-fluoro-1-(2R,5S)-[2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]cytosine; emtricitabine) and stavudine (d4T).In this study, the clinical and biochemical correlates of tubular nephrosis in SIV-infected rhesus macaques associated with systemic administration of high-dose ART consisting of the three nucleoside analog inhibitors PMPA, FTC, and d4T were investigated. It was found that acute renal failure was uncommon (7.1% of treated animals) and that morphologic evidence of nephropathy, which persisted for more than 300 days following discontinuation of the drug cocktail, was more frequent (52.4% of treated animals). While parameters from single time points lacked predictive value, biochemical alterations in Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and phosphorus were frequently identified longitudinally in the blood of ART-treated animals that developed evidence of nephropathy, and these longitudinal changes correlated with disease severity.Recommendations are proposed to limit the impact of drug-induced renal disease in future SIV macaque studies.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to CCR5 inhibitors, such as maraviroc and vicriviroc is characterized by reduction of maximal percent inhibition which indicates the use of an inhibitor-bound conformation of CCR5 for human immunodeficiency virus-1(HIV-1) entry. It is accompanied by substitutions in gp120 and gp41. Variable domain 3 (V3) plays the most important role, but substitutions outside V3 could also be involved in phenotype resistance. In this work, we investigated how mutations in variable regions of the viral envelope protein gp120 can contribute to CCR5 inhibitor resistance.Resistant isolates were selected by passaging CC1/85 and BaL viruses with sub-inhibitory MVC and VCV concentrations. Mutations in gp160 were identified and mutants containing V2 (V169M), V3 (L317W) and V4 (I408T) were constructed.MVC and VCV susceptibility and viral tropism were assessed by single cycle assay. Mutant I408T showed 4-fold change (FC) increase in the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) to MVC, followed by L317W (1.52-FC), V169M (1.23-FC), V169M/I408T (4-FC) L317W/I408T (3-FC), V169M/L317W (1.30-FC), and V169M/L317W/I408T (3.31-FC). MPI reduction was observed for mutants I408T (85%), L317W (95%), V169M/I408T (84%), L317W/I408T (85%) and V169M/L317W/I408T (83%). For VCV, I408T increased the IC50 by 2-FC and few mutants showed MPI reduction less than 95%: I408T (94%), L317W/I408T (94%) and V169M/L317W/I408T (94%). All mutants remained R5-tropic and presented decreased infectivity.These results suggest that mutations in the V4 loop of HIV-1 may contribute to MVC and VCV resistance alone or combined with mutations in V2 and V3 loops.",

The role of vaccination in these patients remains controversial and is based largely on limited and low quality data. We, therefore, conducted this study to determine immunogenicity and safety of 4 vs. 3 standard doses of HBV vaccination in HIV-infected adults with isolated anti-HBc antibody. Methods An open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted among HIV-infected patients visiting HIV clinic of the Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand between July and September 2017. Inclusion criteria included ≥ 18 years of age, currently on a stable antiretroviral regimen, CD4+ cell count ≥ 200 cells/mm 3 , plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 20 copies/mL, and isolated anti-HBc antibody. The participants were randomized to receive either 3 standard doses (20 µg at month 0, 1, 6) or 4 standard-doses (20 µg at month 0, 1, 2, 6) of IM HBV vaccination, and were evaluated for anamnestic response at week 4 and vaccine response at week 28. Results Of the 97 patients screened, 54 (32 male, mean age of 46 years) were enrolled and 27 were allocated to each of the vaccination groups. Anamnestic response occurred in 25.9% vs. 33.3% in 3-dose group vs. 4-dose group, respectively (p = 0.551). The vaccine response rates at week 28 were 85.2% in 3-dose group vs. 88.9% in 4-dose group (p = 1.000); geometric mean titer of anti-HBs antibody at week 28 was 63.8 and 209.8 mIU/mL in 3-dose group and 4-dose group, respectively (p = 0.030). No adverse events were reported. Conclusions An anamnestic response occurred in one-third of Thai HIV-infected patients with isolated anti-HBc antibody who received one dose of HBV vaccination; however, the majority were still unprotected. The use of either 3 or 4 standard-doses of vaccination was highly effective and should be recommended in all HIV-infected individuals with isolated anti-HBc antibody.

EID impacts epidemic control by confirming non-infected HIV-exposed infants (HEIs) and prompting timely initiation of ART in HIV-infected babies which improves treatment outcomes. Objectives We explored factors associated with EID outcomes among HEI in North-Central Nigeria. Method This is a cross-sectional study using EID data of PMTCT-enrollees matched with results of HEI’s dried blood samples (DBS), processed for DNA-PCR from January 2015 through July 2017. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS version 20.0 to generate frequencies and examine associations, including binomial logistic regression with p &lt; 0.05 being statistically significant. Results Of 14,448 HEI in this analysis, 51.8% were female and 95% (n = 12,801) were breastfed. The median age of the infants at sample collection was 8 weeks (IQR 6–20), compared to HEI tested after 20 weeks of age, those tested earlier had significantly greater odds of a negative HIV result (≤ 6 weeks: OR = 3.8; 6–8 weeks: OR = 2.1; 8–20 weeks: OR = 1.5) with evidence of a significant linear trend (p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, HEI whose mothers received combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) before (OR = 11.8) or during the index pregnancy (OR = 8.4) had significantly higher odds as compared to those whose mothers did not receive cART. In addition, HEI not breastfed had greater odds of negative HIV result as compared to those breastfed (OR = 1.9). Conclusions cART prior to and during pregnancy, earlier age of HEI at EID testing and alternative feeding other than breastfeeding were associated with an increased likelihood of being HIV-negative on EID. Therefore, strategies to scale-up PMTCT services are needed to mitigate the burden of HIV among children.",

While governments of FSU countries have taken commendable steps in recent years to address hurdles at each step of the HIV care continuum, to ensure 100% antiretroviral treatment (ART) accessibility to people living with HIV (PLHIV), testing for HIV needs to be enforced widely in FSU countries. Stigma against people who inject drugs (PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM), migrants, and PLHIV need to be addressed. Finally, to avoid breaks in ART supply, FSU countries need to gain independence in funding HIV care so that the provision of ART to PLHIV is made available without interruption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In resource-limited settings, multi-experienced HIV infected patients are often prescribed raltegravir for salvage therapy. Patients failing raltegravir-containing regimens require other drugs including other integrase inhibitors. In this context, real-life data about the resistance and cross-resistance pathways between integrase inhibitors is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate integrase resistance pathways in a cohort of Mexican multi-experienced patients failing of a raltegravir-containing salvage regimen. Methods Twenty-five plasma samples from subjects failing antiretroviral regimens which included raltegravir were obtained from various healthcare centres from 2009 to 2017 in Mexico. Antiretroviral history and demographics were collected. Samples were processed for integrase resistance genotyping testing by sequencing. The viral sequences were analysed with the Stanford HIV drug resistance database algorithm. Data was analysed with SPSS Statistics software. Results We found a mean viral load of 4.17 log 10 c/mL (SD 1.11) at the time of virologic failure. Forty-eight percent of the samples were raltegravir resistant. The Y143R/H/C substitutions were the most prevalent, followed by the N155H, and both Q148H/K and G140S/A in the same proportion. The Q148 + G140 combination was found in (12%) of the samples. Cross-resistance to elvitegravir was found in 83.3% and in 18.2% for both dolutegravir and bictegravir. Thirteen samples (52%) were susceptible to the four integrase strand-transfer inhibitors. Conclusions Our findings suggest a high occurrence of resistance and cross-resistance to other integrase inhibitors among multi-experienced subjects failing raltegravir. We found a modestly lower proportion of cross-resistance to dolutegravir than data from clinical trials. Likely this drug could be used for salvage therapy. Explanations for the absence of mutations in half of the samples, other than reduced adherence, should be further investigated. Close surveillance is needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The high rate of mortality among HIV-vertically infected adolescents might be favoured by HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) emergence, which calls for timeous actions in this underserved population. We thus sought to evaluate program quality indicators (PQIs) of HIVDR among HIV-vertically infected adolescents on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods A study was conducted in the Centre region of Cameroon among adolescents (10–19 years) receiving ART in two urban (The Mother–Child Centre of the Chantal BIYA Foundation, the National Social Welfare Hospital) and three rural (Mfou District Hospital, Mbalmayo District Hospital and Nkomo Medical Center) health facilities. Following an exhaustive sampling from ART registers, patient medical files and pharmacy records, data was abstracted for seven PQIs: on - time drug pick - up ; retention in care; pharmacy stock outs ; dispensing practices ; viral load coverage ; viral suppression and adequate switch to second - line . Performance in PQIs was interpreted following the WHO-recommended thresholds (desirable, fair and/or poor); with p &lt; 0.05 considered significant. Results Among 967 adolescents (888 urban versus 79 rural) registered in the study sites, validated data was available for 633 (554 in urban and 79 in rural). Performance in the urban vs. rural settings was respectively: on - time drug pick - up was significantly poorer in rural (79% vs. 46%, p = 0.00000006); retention in care was fair in urban (80% vs. 72%, p = 0.17); pharmacy stock outs was significantly higher in urban settings (92% vs. 50%, p = 0.004); dispensing practices was desirable (100% vs. 100%, p = 1.000); viral load coverage was desirable only in urban sites (84% vs. 37%, p &lt; 0.0001); viral suppression was poor (33% vs. 53%, p = 0.08); adequate switch to second - line varied (38.1% vs. 100%, p = 0.384). Conclusion Among adolescents on ART in Cameroon, dispensing practices are appropriate, while adherence to ART program and viral load coverage are better in urban settings. However, in both urban and rural settings, pharmacy stock outs, poor viral suppression and inadequate switch to second-line among adolescents require corrective public-health actions to limit HIVDR and to improve transition towards adult care in countries sharing similar programmatic features.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite initial high motivation, individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for several years may experience incomplete adherence over time, increasing their risk of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Habits, defined as automatic and regular practices, do not rely on conscious effort, and may therefore support high long-term ART adherence. Methods This qualitative study contributes to the evidence on how clients with adherence problems remember and form habits to take ART medications. Free-listing and unstructured interviewing were used among 42 clinic-enrolled adults in Kampala, Uganda who were receiving ART and participating in a randomized clinical trial for treatment adherence (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03494777). Data were coded and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results Findings indicated that clients’ most routine habits (eating, bathing, sleeping) did not always occur at the same time or place, making it difficult to reliably link to pill-taking times. Efforts to improve ART habits included having a relative to ask about pill-taking, re-packaging medications, leaving medications in view, using alarms, carrying water, or linking pill-taking to radio/prayer schedules. Reported challenges were adhering to ART schedules during changing employment hours, social activities, and travel. Conclusion While habit-forming interventions have the potential to improve ART adherence, targeting treatment-mature clients’ existing routines may be crucial in this population.",

    "abstract": "In Sub-Saharan Africa where HIV disproportionately affects women, heterosexual male sex workers (HMSW) and their female clients are at risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV and other STIs. However, few studies have described HIV and STI risk among HMSW. We aimed to assess and compare recent HIV and syphilis screening practices among HMSW and female sex workers (FSW) in Uganda.Between August and December 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional study among 100 HMSW and 240 female sex workers (FSW). Participants were enrolled through snowball sampling, and an interviewer-administered questionnaire used to collect data on HIV and syphilis testing in the prior 12 and 6 months respectively. Integrated change model constructs were used to assess intentions, attitudes, social influences, norms and self-efficacy of 3-monthly Syphilis and 6-monthly HIV testing. Predictors of HIV and syphilis recent testing behaviors were estimated using negative binomial regression.We enrolled 340 sex workers of whom 100 (29%) were HMSW. The median age was 27 years [interquartile range (IQR) 25-30] for HMSW and 26 years [IQR], (23-29) for FSW. The median duration of sex work was 36 and 30 months for HMSW and FSW, respectively. HMSW were significantly less likely than FSW to have tested for HIV in the prior 12 months (50% vs. 86%; p = 0.001). For MSW, non-testing for HIV was associated with higher education [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.50], poor intention to seek HIV testing (aPR 1.64; 95% CI 1.35-2.04), perception that 6-monthly HIV testing was not normative (aPR 1.33; 95% CI 1.09-1.67) and low self-efficacy (aPR 1.41; 95% CI 1.12-1.79). Not testing for syphilis was associated with low intention to seek testing (aPR 3.13; 95% CI 2.13-4.55), low self-efficacy (aPR 2.56; 95% CI 1.35-4.76), negative testing attitudes (aPR 2.33; 95% CI 1.64-3.33), and perception that regular testing was not normative (aPR 1.59; 95% CI 1.14-2.22).Non-testing for HIV and syphilis was common among HMSW relative to FSW. Future studies should evaluate strategies to increase testing uptake for this neglected sub-population of sex workers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV is instrumental in the prevention of HIV for HIV-uninfected persons, by drastically reducing the risk of acquisition in the case of high-risk exposures. Despite its demonstrated efficacy, it remained under-prescribed in France until 2018. The principal aim of this study was to understand the motivations of Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) who started using PrEP in Montpellier, France. Methods A phenomenological study was undertaken, using semi-structured interviews with twelve participants attending the University Hospital of Montpellier for PrEP. Interviews were analysed by means of triangulation up to the point of theoretical saturation, using a semio-pragmatic method. Results Fear of HIV infection, personalised regular follow-up, and the wish to take care of one’s health were the primary motivational factors. PrEP allows for a better sexual life restoring a sense of freedom despite the risks of STI, deemed manageable by PrEPers. PrEP does not modify long-term risk-taking behaviours but helps them better live their own sexuality and guides them towards a responsible approach to sexuality. Unclear information on PrEP, delivered by their family doctor, public campaigns or the media, leads to misrepresentations or negative social representation, including within the MSM community, which may delay its implementation. Conclusions Fear of HIV infection and the benefits of regular medical follow-up to take care of one’s health were motivational factors of importance for the use of PrEP by MSM in this study. PrEP transforms all existential dimensions of their lived experience, improving sexual identity and happiness. There is a need to improve professional awareness of the effectiveness of PrEP and to develop a patient centered approach, to disseminate information more widely to the general public and among MSM to reduce stigmatisation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Patients who default from HIV care are usually poorly adherent to antiretroviral treatment which results in suboptimal viral suppression. The study assessed the outcomes of retention in care and viral suppression by expansion of an intervention using two patient tracers to track patients lost to follow up at a large HIV clinic in Trinidad. Methods Two Social Workers were trained as patient tracers and hired for 15 months (April 2017–June 2018) to call patients who were lost to follow up for 30 days or more during the period July 2016–May 2018 at the HIV clinic Medical Research Foundation of Trinidad and Tobago. Results Over the 15-month period, of the of 2473 patients who missed their scheduled visits for 1 month or more, 261 (10.6%) patients were no longer in active care—89 patients dead, 65 migrated, 55 hospitalized, 33 transferred to another treatment clinic and 19 incarcerated. Of the remaining 2212 patients eligible for tracing, 1869 (84.5%) patients were returned to care, 1278 (68.6%) were virally unsuppressed (viral load &gt; 200 copies/ml) and 1727 (92.4%) were re-initiated on ART. Twelve months after their return, 1341 (71.7%) of 1869 patients were retained in care and 1154 (86.1%) of these were virally suppressed. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression showed that persons were more likely to be virally suppressed if they were employed (OR, 1.39; 95% CI 1.07–1.80), if they had baseline CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm 3 (OR, 1.71; 95% CI 1.26–2.32) and if they were retained in care at 12 months (OR, 2.48; 95% CI 1.90–3.24). Persons initiated on ART for 4–6 years (OR, 3.09; 95% CI 1.13–8.48,), 7–9 years (OR, 3.97; 95% CI 1.39–11.31), &gt; 10 years (OR, 5.99; 95% CI 1.74–20.64 were more likely to be retained in care. Conclusions Patient Tracing is a feasible intervention to identify and resolve the status of patients who are loss to follow up and targeted interventions such as differentiated care models may be important to improve retention in care.",

    "abstract": "Viral suppression prevents HIV transmission and disease progression, but socio-economic and clinical factors can hinder the goal of suppression. We evaluated factors associated with viral non suppression (VNS) and persistent viremia (PV) in people living with HIV (PLHIV) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Guatemala.We conducted a cross sectional analysis using data from an ongoing cohort of PLHIV attending the largest HIV clinic in Guatemala. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted between PLHIV with viral suppression and detectable viremia. VNS was defined as most recent HIV RNA ≥ 200 copies/ml and PV as two consecutive HIV RNA ≥ 200 copies/ml.Of 664 participants, 13.3% had VNS and 7.1% had PV. In univariable analysis disaggregated by gender, low income, poor education, perceived difficulty attending healthcare, and alcohol use were associated with VNS in men while low CD4 at diagnosis, multiple prior ART regimens and treatment interruptions were significant in both genders. Multiple prior ART regimens (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.82, [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59, 4.99], p < 0.01), treatment interruptions (aOR 4.51, [95% CI 2.13, 9.58], p < 0.01), excessive alcohol consumption (aOR 2.56, [95% CI 1.18, 5.54], p < 0.05) perceived difficulty attending healthcare (aOR 2.07, [ 95% CI 1.25, 3.42], p < 0.01) and low CD4 at diagnosis (aOR 2.34, 95% [CI 1.30, 4.20], p < 0.01) were independently associated with VNS on multivariable regression.We conclude that socio-economic and clinical factors influence viral suppression in our cohort and vary between men and women. Gender specific approaches are necessary to achieve the 90% suppression goal.",

No data exist in Africans where second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) often include PIs. We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the DSP frequency and metabolic risk factors in community-based South Africans taking ritonavir-boosted lopinavir as PI. Examination findings categorized subjects as having DSP (≥1 neuropathic sign) or symptomatic DSP [DSP with symptom(s)]. Fasting-state glucose and lipid profiles were assessed. We compared the ritonavir/lopinavir-group to a nested group on first-line ART [dideoxy-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (d-drugs)] selected from a dataset collected at the same time and matched for d-drug exposure. The ritonavir/lopinavir-group (n = 86) consisted predominantly of women (84 %) with a median age of 36 years (IQR 32–41). The median current CD4+ count was 489 cells/μL (IQR 291–665). The median exposure time to ritonavir/lopinavir was 18 months (IQR 10–26) and to d-drugs, 24 months (IQR 16–38). DSP was present in 78 % and symptomatic DSP in 48 %; symptoms were most frequently of moderate intensity. Only age independently associated with DSP and symptomatic DSP (p = 0.08 and p = 0.04, respectively). None of the metabolic syndrome components showed associations with DSP or symptomatic DSP despite a trend towards hypertriglyceridemia overall. The ritonavir/lopinavir-group had less DSP compared to the d-drug only group (p = 0.002) but the frequency of symptomatic DSP was similar (p = 0.49). Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir did not add additional risk to developing DSP in this community-based African cohort after a median of 18 months on second-line ART.",

We examined the contribution of the x4 and r5 components to replicative fitness of HIV-1 isolates.Dual tropic r5x4 viruses were predicted from average HIV-1 env sequences of two primary subtype C HIV-1 isolates (C19 and C27) and from two patient plasma samples (B12 and B19). Chimeric Env viruses with an NL4-3 backbone were constructed from the B12 and B19 env sequences. To determine replicative fitness, these primary and chimeric dual tropic HIV-1 were then competed against HIV-1 reference isolates in U87.CD4 cells expressing CXCR4 or CCR5 or in PBMCs ± entry inhibitors. Contribution of the x4 and r5 clones within the quasispecies of these chimeric or primary HIV-1 isolates were then compared to the frequency of x4, r5, and dual tropic clones within the quasispecies as predicted by phenotypic assays, clonal sequencing, and 454 deep sequencing.In the primary HIV-1 isolates (C19 and C27), subtype C dual tropic clones dominated over x4 clones while pure r5 clones were absent. In two subtype B chimeric viruses (B12 and B19), r5 clones were >100-fold more abundant than x4 or r5/x4 clones. The dual tropic C19 and C27 HIV-1 isolates outcompeted r5 primary HIV-1 isolates, B2 and C3 in PBMCs. When AMD3100 was added or when only U87.CD4.CCR5 cells were used, the B2 and C3 reference viruses now out-competed the r5 component of the dual tropic C19 and C27. In contrast, the same replicative fitness was observed with dualtropic B12 and B19 HIV-1 isolates relative to x4 HIV-1 A8 and E6 or the r5 B2 and C3 viruses, even when the r5 or x4 component was inhibited by maraviroc (or AMD3100) or in U87.CD4.CXCR4 (or CCR5) cells.In the dual tropic HIV-1 isolates, the x4 replicative fitness is higher than r5 clones but the x4 or x4/r5 clones are typically at low frequency in the intrapatient virus population. Ex vivo HIV propagation promotes outgrowth of the x4 clones and provides an over-estimate of x4 dominance in replicative fitness within dual tropic viruses.",

We determined the prevalence and risk factors for developing hyperlactatemia among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cameroonians on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study from January to April 2012 involving 91 HIV-infected patients receiving ART for at least 12 months and 30 HIV-infected patients who have never received ART (ART-naïve patients). Plasma lactate levels were determined after at least 12 hours of overnight fasting and hyperlactatemia defined as lactate concentrations ≥ 3 mmol/L. The prevalence of hyperlactatemia was determined and the risk factors were analyzed by a multivariate logistic regression model. Results The mean lactataemia was significantly higher in the group of HIV patients currently taking ART than in the ART-naïve one (2.3 ± 1.3 and 1.7 ± 0.7 mmol/L respectively, p = 0.002). Patients on first line ART regimens had significantly higher lactatemia than those on second line regimens (2.5 ± 1.5 and 1.9 ± 0.7 mmol/L respectively, p = 0.014). The prevalence of hyperlactatemia in HIV patients receiving ART and in ART-naïve HIV patients was respectively 18.7 and 6.7% (p = 0.095). ART-exposure (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 – 27.84; p = 0.042) and being on a first line regimen (aOR 16.22, 95% CI 1.57 – 167.91; p = 0.019) were independent strong predictors of hyperlactatemia. Conclusion Hyperlactatemia was not rare in our study population. Being on a first line regimen constitutes an important risk factor for developing hyperlactatemia. Measurement of plasma lactate may be useful in optimizing the management of HIV-positive persons on ART.",

    "abstract": "Lipohypertrophy does not appear to be an adverse ART reaction while lipoatrophy is clearly associated with the use of stavudine (d4T) and zidovudine (AZT). In low and middle income countries d4T has only recently been phased out and AZT is still widely being used. Several case definitions have been developed to diagnose lipodystrophy, but none of them are generalizable to sub-Saharan Africa where black women have less visceral adipose tissue and more subcutaneous adipose tissue than white women. We aimed to develop a simple, objective measure to define lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy by comparing patient report to anthropometric and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) -derived variables.DXA and anthropometric measures were obtained in a cross sectional sample of black HIV-infected South African men (n = 116) and women (n = 434) on ART. Self-reported information on fat gain or fat loss was collected using a standard questionnaire. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to describe the performance of anthropometric and DXA-derived variables using patient reported lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy as the reference standard.Lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy were more common in women (25% and 33% respectively) than in men (10% and 13% respectively). There were insufficient numbers of men with DXA scans for meaningful analysis. The best predictors of lipoatrophy in women were the anthropometric variables tricep (AUC = 0.725) and thigh skinfold (AUC =0.720) thicknesses; and the DXA-derived variables percentage lower limb fat (AUC = 0.705) and percentage lower limb fat/height (AUC = 0.713). The best predictors of lipohypertrophy in women were the anthropometric variable waist/hip ratio (AUC = 0.645) and the DXA-derived variable percentage trunk fat/percentage limb fat (AUC = 0.647).We were able to develop simple, anthropometric measures for defining lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy, using a sample of black HIV-infected South African women with DXA scans. This is of particular relevance in resource limited settings, where health professionals need simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing patients with lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy.",

Concurrency, viz. multiple sexual partnerships that overlap over time, has been studied as a possible risk factor for HIV transmission. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of perceived male partner concurrency among sexually active, HIV negative women. Socio-demographic and behavioural data from women enrolled in a biomedical HIV prevention clinical trial were assessed in relation to perceived male partner concurrency using the Chi squared test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the independent predictors of perceived male partner concurrency. Kaplan–Meier survival estimates were obtained for HIV and STI incidence in relation to male partner concurrency. A Cox Proportional Hazards model was used to assess the association between perceived male partner concurrency and HIV and STI incidence. The results revealed that 29 % of women reported their male partners to be in concurrent sexual relationships, 22 % reported partners that were not engaging in concurrency, whilst 49 % reported not knowing their partners concurrency status. Older women, having never married, experiencing economic abuse, and women reporting individual concurrency, were found to be significant predictors of perceived male partner concurrency in the studied population. Perceived male partner concurrency was not found to be a significantly associated with incident HIV and STI infections in this analysis. The study provides insight into predictors of perceived male partner concurrency among women at high risk for STI and HIV acquisition. These results may inform the design of behavioural and biomedical interventions, to address the role of multiple sexual partnerships in HIV prevention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is currently the preferred first-line treatment for persons living with HIV (PLHIV) including children and adolescents in many low- and middle-income countries including Uganda. However, there are concerns about excessive weight gain associated with DTG especially in adults. There remains paucity of current information on weight-related outcomes among adolescents on DTG. We determined the prevalence of excessive weight gain and associated factors among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) receiving DTG-based ART in Kampala, Uganda. Methods Cross-sectional study involving ALHIV aged 10–19 years on DTG-based ART for at least one year were recruited from public health facilities in Kampala between February and May 2022. Excessive weight gain was defined as becoming overweight or obese per body mass index (BMI) norms while on DTG-based ART for at least one year. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires and data extracted from medical records. At enrolment, blood pressure and anthropometry were measured and blood was drawn for blood glucose and lipid profile. Data was summarised using descriptive statistics and logistic regression was performed to determine the associated factors. Results We enrolled 165 ALHIV with a median age of 14 years (IQR 12–16). Eighty (48.5%) were female. The median duration on ART and DTG was 8 years (IQR 7–11) and 2 years (IQR 1–3) respectively. At DTG initiation, the majority of participants (152/165, 92.1%) were ART-experienced, and had normal BMI (160/165, 97%). Overall, 12/165 (7.3%) adolescents (95% CI: 4.2–12.4) had excessive weight gain. No factors were significantly associated with excessive weight gain after DTG start in ALHIV. However, all ALHIV with excessive weight gain were females. Conclusion Our study found a prevalence of 7.3% of overweight and obesity in ALHIV after initiating DTG. We did not find any factor significantly associated with excessive weight gain in ALHIV on DTG. Nonetheless, we recommend ongoing routine monitoring of anthropometry and metabolic markers in ALHIV as DTG use increases globally, to determine the exact magnitude of excessive weight gain and to identify those at risk of becoming overweight or obese while taking the medication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) reactions are the most common cause of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV-positive infants who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART). There is limited evidence regarding the incidence of BCG-IRIS; however, reports from outpatient cohorts have estimated that 6–9% of infants who initiated ART developed some form of BCG-IRIS within the first 6 months. Various treatment approaches for infants with BCG-IRIS have been reported, but there is currently no widely accepted standard-of-care. Case Presentation A 5-month-old male HIV-exposed infant BCG vaccinated at birth was admitted for refractory oral candidiasis, moderate anemia, and moderate acute malnutrition. He had a HIV DNA-PCR collected at one month of age, but the family never received the results. He was diagnosed with HIV during hospitalization with a point-of-care nucleic acid test and had severe immune suppression with a CD4 of 955 cells/µL (15%) with clinical stage III disease. During pre-ART counseling, the mother was educated on the signs and symptoms of BCG-IRIS and the importance of seeking follow-up care and remaining adherent to ART if symptoms arose. Three weeks after ART initiation, he was readmitted with intermittent subjective fevers, right axillary lymphadenopathy, and an ulcerated papule over the right deltoid region. He was subsequently discharged home with a diagnosis of local BCG-IRIS lymphadenitis. At six weeks post-ART initiation, he returned with suppurative lymphadenitis of the right axillary region that had completely eviscerated through the skin without signs of disseminated BCG disease. He was then started on an outpatient regimen of topical isoniazid, silver nitrate, and oral prednisolone. Throughout this time, the mother maintained good ART adherence despite this complication. After 2.5 months of ART and one month of specific treatment for the lymphadenitis, he had marked mass reduction, improved adenopathy, increased CD4 count, correction of anemia, and resolution of his acute malnutrition. He completely recovered and was symptom free two months after initial treatment without surgical intervention. Conclusions This case details the successful management of severe suppurative BCG-IRIS with a non-surgical approach and underlines the importance of pre-ART counseling on BCG-IRIS for caregivers, particularly for infants who initiate ART with advanced HIV.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH) recommends a first HIV DNA-PCR test at 4–6 weeks for early infant diagnosis (EID) of HIV-exposed infants (HEI) and immediate return of results. WHO recommends initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) ≤ 7 days from HIV diagnosis. In 2019, MOH introduced point-of-care (POC) whole-blood EID testing in 33 health facilities and scaled up to 130 facilities in 2020. We assessed results turnaround time and ART linkage pre-POC and during POC testing. Methods We evaluated EID register data for HEI at 10 health facilities with POC and EID testing volume of ≥ 12 infants/month from 2018 to 2021. We abstracted data for 12 months before and after POC testing rollout and compared time to sample collection, results receipt, and ART initiation between periods using medians, Wilcoxon, and log-rank tests. Results Data for 4.004 HEI were abstracted, of which 1.685 (42%) were from the pre-POC period and 2.319 (58%) were from the period during POC; 3.773 (94%) had a first EID test (pre-POC: 1.649 [44%]; during POC: 2.124 [56%]). Median age at sample collection was 44 (IQR 38–51) days pre-POC and 42 (IQR 33–50) days during POC (p &lt; 0.001). Among 3.773 HEI tested, 3.678 (97%) had test results. HIV-positive infants’ (n = 69) median age at sample collection was 94 (IQR 43–124) days pre-POC and 125 (IQR 74–206) days during POC (p = 0.04). HIV positivity rate was 1.6% (27/1.617) pre-POC and 2.0% (42/2.061) during POC (p = 0.43). For all infants, median days from sample collection to results receipt by infants’ caregivers was 28 (IQR 14–52) pre-POC and 1 (IQR 0–25) during POC (p &lt; 0.001); among HIV-positive infants, median days were 23 (IQR 7–30) pre-POC and 0 (0–3) during POC (p &lt; 0.001). Pre-POC, 4% (1/23) HIV-positive infants started ART on the sample collection day compared to 33% (12/37) during POC (p &lt; 0.001); ART linkage ≤ 7 days from HIV diagnosis was 74% (17/23) pre-POC and 95% (35/37) during POC (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion POC testing improved EID results turnaround time and ART initiation for HIV-positive infants. While POC testing expansion could further improve ART linkage and loss to follow-up, there is need to explore barriers around same-day ART initiation for infants receiving POC testing.",

Data on pharmacokinetics (PK) of antiretrovirals in patients on peritoneal dialysis are limited. Methods A single-participant study was performed on a 49-year-old gentleman with ESKD on PD and controlled HIV on once daily dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg + tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 25 mg / emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg. He underwent serial blood plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cell, and urine PK measurements over 24 h after an observed DTG + FTC/TAF dose. Results Plasma trough (Cmin) concentrations of TAF, tenofovir (TFV), FTC, and DTG were 0.05, 164, 1,006, and 718 ng/mL, respectively. Intracellular trough concentrations of TFV-DP and FTC-TP were 1142 and 11,201 fmol/million cells, respectively. Compared to published mean trough concentrations in PWH with normal kidney function, observed TFV and FTC trough concentrations were 15.5- and 20-fold higher, while intracellular trough concentrations of TFV-DP and FTC-TP were 2.2-fold and 5.4-fold higher, respectively. TFV and FTC urine levels were 20 times lower than in people with normal GFR. Conclusions In a single ESKD PWH on PD, daily TAF was associated with plasma TFV and intracellular TFV-DP trough concentrations 15-fold and 2-fold higher than those of people with uncompromised kidney function, potentially contributing to nephrotoxicity. This suggests that TFV accumulates on PD; thus, daily TAF in PD patients may require dose adjustment or regimen change to optimize treatment, minimize toxicity, and preserve residual kidney function.",

Quantitative evaluations of patient-reported measures for MLWH in such models are necessary to explore the viability of these recommendations. Methods Within a 96-week prospective cohort study at a multidisciplinary HIV clinic, participants received bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) for free and rapidly following care linkage. Eight patient-reported measures were administered at weeks 4, 24, and 48: (1) mMOS-SS to measure perceived social support; (2) IA-RSS to measure internalized stigma; (3) K6 to measure psychological distress; (4) PROMIS to measure self-efficacy with treatment taking; (5) G-MISS to measure perceived compliance with clinicians’ treatment plans; (6) HIVTSQ to measure treatment satisfaction; (7) CARE to measure perceived provider empathy; and (8) PRPCC to measure perceived clinician cultural competence. Linear mixed modelling with bootstrapping was conducted to identify significant differences by sociodemographics and time. Results Across weeks 4, 24, and 48, results suggest that MLWH enrolled in this study experienced moderate levels of social support; elevated levels of HIV-related stigma; moderate levels of distress; high self-efficacy with daily medication self-management; great compliance with clinicians’ treatment plans; high treatment satisfaction; high perceived empathy; and high perceived cultural competence. Experience of social support (i.e., mMOS-SS scores) differed significantly by birth region. Experience of HIV-related stigma (i.e., IA-RSS scores) differed significantly by birth region, age, and language. Experience of distress (i.e., K6 scores) differed significantly by sexual orientation. Experience of treatment satisfaction (i.e., HIVTSQ scores) differed significantly by birth region and age. No significant differences were identified by time for any measure. Conclusion Overall, participants expressed positive experiences around treatment and care, alongside comparably lower perceptions of social support, internalized stigma, and distress, potentially underscoring a need to embed targeted, well-funded, and accessible mental health support within HIV care models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite remarkable progress, HIV’s influence on global health remains firm, demanding continued attention. Understanding the effectiveness of third-line antiretroviral therapy in individuals who do not respond to second-line drugs is crucial for improving treatment strategies. The virological outcomes of third-line antiretroviral therapy vary from study to study, highlighting the need for robust global estimates. Methods A comprehensive search of databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, International Scientific Indexing, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, was conducted. STATA version 17 statistical software was used for analysis. A random-effects model was applied to compute the pooled estimates. Subgroup analysis, heterogeneity, publication bias, and sensitivity analysis were also performed. The prediction interval is computed to estimate the interval in which a future study will fall. The GRADE tool was also used to determine the quality of the evidence. Results In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 15 studies involving 1768 HIV patients receiving third-line antiretroviral therapy were included. The pooled viral suppression of third-line antiretroviral therapy was 76.6% (95% CI: 71.5- 81.7%). The viral suppression rates at 6 and 12 months were 75.5% and 78.6%, respectively. Furthermore, third-line therapy effectively suppressed viral RNA copy numbers to ≤ 50 copies/mL, ≤ 200 copies/mL, and ≤ 400 copies/mL with rates of 70.7%, 85.4%, and 85.7%, respectively. Conclusion More than three-fourths of patients on third-line antiretroviral therapy achieve viral suppression. Consequently, improving access to and timely initiation of third-line therapy may positively impact the quality of life for those with second-line treatment failure.",

This study investigates the incidence and characteristics of low bone mineral density (BMD) and the treatment effectiveness of low BMD participants among PLHIV in Kerman, Iran. A longitudinal study utilized dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to screen 94 PLHIV in Kerman, Iran, for low BMD. Participants were aged 30 or older and had received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 12 months. Those with low BMD were entered into a single-arm clinical trial and received the appropriate treatment. These people were checked to assess the treatment effectiveness 11 months after completion of the treatment. Those with normal BMD entered a cohort study and were checked to determine the cumulative incidence of low BMD. Data on demographics, medical history, and laboratory tests were collected. A chi-square test was used to assess the association between the categorical variables. A t-test (for normally distributed variables), or Mann-Whitney U (for non-normally distributed variables) was used to assess the differences of BMD between the two groups. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05, with analyses conducted in Stata 17. Among 94 PLHIV at baseline, 48 participants (51%) had low BMD. During the follow-up, 11 participants (11.7%) missed the follow-up visits. In the follow-up, 83 PLHIV (40 with low BMD and 43 with normal BMD at baseline) were available. Among 40 participants who received treatment, 5 had normal BMD (treatment effectiveness: 12.5%). However, among 43 PLHIV with normal BMD at baseline, 7 PLHIV had low BMD at the follow-up visit (cumulative Incidence 16.3%). Those with lower body mass index (BMI) had a higher prevalence of low BMD than those with normal BMI during the follow-up (p-value: 0.003). Lumbar spine BMD increased modestly (0.005 g/cm2), while femoral neck and total hip BMD declined in total participants (0.011, 0.007 g/cm2, respectively). Osteocalcin and β-isomerized C-terminal telopeptides (β-CTx) levels were higher in the low BMD group in the follow-up, indicating increased bone turnover. The study highlights the high cumulative incidence of 16.3% and treatment effectiveness of 12.5% of low BMD among PLHIV in Kerman, Iran, with implications for fracture risk. Despite a steady state in spine BMD decline, the risk of fracture remains elevated due to continued femoral neck and total hip BMD reduction. Gender-specific factors and BMI may influence susceptibility to low BMD.",

This retrospective cohort study evaluated the long-term virologic outcomes and safety of transitioning from an efavirenz-based regimen (tenofovir, lamivudine, efavirenz [TLE]) to a dolutegravir-based regimen (tenofovir, lamivudine, dolutegravir [TLD]) among adult HIV participants in Mbeya, Tanzania. Medical records of 250 adult HIV participants who transitioned from TLE to TLD at Mbeya Zonal Referral Hospital were reviewed from August 2022 to December 2022. The primary outcome was virologic failure, defined as HIV RNA > 1000 copies/mL. Secondary outcomes included viral suppression (< 50 copies/mL) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Using appropriate statistical tests, participant characteristics and outcomes were compared before and six months after transitioning. At baseline on TLE, 88% had viral suppression, and 3.6% had virologic failure. Six months after transitioning to TLD, viral suppression was 87.2% and virologic failure increased to 6.8%. Overall, 79.6% experienced ADRs with TLD, predominantly neurological effects and weight gain. No significant associations were found between viral load changes and participant characteristics like age, sex or treatment duration. Transitioning to dolutegravir maintained high rates of viral suppression comparable to efavirenz, albeit with a slight increase in virologic failure. Dolutegravir was well-tolerated overall despite a high ADR rate. Findings support the ongoing scale-up of dolutegravir in Tanzania and other resource-limited settings while highlighting the need for continued viral load monitoring and pharmacovigilance.",

    "abstract": "Episomal 2-long terminal repeat (LTR) HIV-1 cDNA, a by-product of HIV-1 infection, is used in clinical trials as a marker for ongoing viral replication. It would be useful to employ 2-LTR cDNA to monitor cryptic HIV-1 infection in the genital tract of men on antiretroviral therapy (ART) to predict the evolution of sexually transmissible drug-resistant HIV-1, but studies thus far have failed to detect this marker in semen. The objectives of this study were: 1) to use a technique that maximizes DNA recovery from HIV-1 infected white blood cells in semen to determine if episomal 2-LTR cDNA is detectable in semen of ART-naïve men with other evidence of genital tract HIV-1 infection, and 2) to compare levels of HIV-1 2-LTR cDNA, RNA, and proviral DNA in semen from HIV-1+ men on ART.Using a somatic cell DNA extraction technique, 2-LTR cDNA was detected by PCR/ELISA in 4 out of 8 semen samples from ART-naïve men selected for other signs of seminal HIV-1 infection (positive controls). Southern blot and DNA sequencing confirmed that the amplified sequences were HIV-1 2-LTR cDNA; copy numbers ranged from 55 to 504 copies/sample. Two semen samples from a cohort of 22 HIV-1-infected men on dual nucleoside therapy, one with and one without detectable seminal HIV-1 RNA, were 2-LTR cDNA positive (336 and 8,560 copies/sample). Following addition of indinavir to the therapy regimen, no semen samples from 21 men with controlled peripheral and seminal viral loads were 2-LTR cDNA positive at 1 and 6 month time points, despite the persistence of HIV-1 proviral DNA+ semen cells and seminal cytomegalovirus (CMV) shedding in some cases. However, one individual who failed indinavir therapy and later developed distinct protease inhibitor (PI) drug resistance mutations in semen, maintained elevated levels of HIV-1 RNA and 2-LTR cDNA in semen.2-LTR HIV-1 cDNA is detectable in semen of HIV-1-infected men. Two men on ART had 2-LTR HIV-1 cDNA in semen, suggesting that this marker may prove to be useful to monitor HIV-1 infection in the genital tract of men on ART to predict the evolution of drug resistance mutations in semen.",

The RT K103N mutation is selected by the NNRTI class of HIV drugs.

Due to availability of ART at low cost in developing countries, quest for reliable cost effective alternative methods for CD4+ T cell count estimation has gained importance. A simple capillary-based microflurometric assay (EasyCD4 System, Guava Technology) was compared with the conventional flow cytometric assay for estimation of CD4+ T cell counts in 79 HIV infected individuals. CD4+ T cell count estimation by both the assays showed strong correlation (r = 0.938, p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.96). The Bland Altman plot analysis showed that the limits of variation were within agreeable limits of +/- 2SD (-161 to 129 cells/mm3). The Easy CD4 assay showed 100% sensitivity for estimating the CD4+ T cell counts < 200 cells/mm3 and < 350 cells/mm3 and 97% sensitivity to estimate CD4+ T cell count < 500 cells/mm3. The specificity ranged from 82 to 100%. The Kappa factor ranged from 0.735 for the CD4+ T cell counts < 350 cells/mm3 to 0.771 for < 500 cells/mm3 CD4+ T cell counts. The system works with a simple protocol, is easy to maintain and has low running cost. The system is compact and generates minimum amount of waste. Hence the EasyCD4 System could be applied for estimation of CD4+ T cell counts in resource poor settings.",

    "abstract": "Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) with stavudine and lamivudine is widely used as the first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings. Lipodystrophy is common and options for switching ART regimen are limited; this situation can lead to patients' poor adherence and antiretroviral resistance. Treatment interruption (TI) in patients with high CD4 cell counts, lipodystrophy, and limited options may be an alternative in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to determine time to resume ART after TI and predictors for early resumption of ART in a resource-limited setting.A prospective study was conducted in January 2005 to December 2006 and enrolled HIV-infected patients with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL, CD4 > 350 cells/mm3, and willing to interrupt ART. CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA, lipid profile, and lipodystrophy were assessed at baseline and every 3 months. ART was resumed when CD4 declined to <250 cells/mm3 or developed HIV-related symptoms. Patients were grouped based on ART regimens [NNRTI or protease inhibitor (PI)] prior to TI.There were 99 patients, 85 in NNRTI group and 14 in PI group. Mean age was 40.6 years; 46% were males. Median duration of ART was 47 months. Median nadir CD4 and baseline CD4 were 151 and 535 cells/mm3, respectively. Median CD4 change at 3 months after TI were -259 (NNRTI) and -105 (PI) cells/mm3 (p = 0.038). At 13-month median follow-up, there was no AIDS-defining illness; 38% (NNRTI) and 29% (PI) of patients developed HIV-related symptoms. ART was resumed in 51% (NNRTI) and 36% (PI) of patients (p = 0.022). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, median time to resume ART was 5.5 (NNRTI) and 14.2 (PI) months (log rank test, p = 0.026). By Cox's regression analysis, NNRTI-based ART (HR 4.9; 95%CI, 1.5-16.3), nadir CD4 <100 cells/mm3 (HR 2.7; 95%CI 1.4-5.3) and baseline CD4 <500 cells/mm3 (HR 1.6; 95%CI, 1.2-3.1) were predictors for early ART resumption.TI of NNRTI-based ART leads to rapid CD4 decline and high probability of early ART resumption and should be avoided. It is necessary to scale-up the options for HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy in resource-limited settings.",

The relationship between baseline IMT or FMD and traditional vascular risk factors was studied using regression analysis. We analyzed the relationship between progression of IMT or FMD and risk factors using fixed-effects models. We adjusted for use of statin medication and CD4 count in both models.Baseline IMT was significantly associated with age (p < 0.001), male gender (p = 0.034), current smoking status (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001) and total:HDL cholesterol ratio (p = 0.004), but not statin use (p = 0.904) and CD4 count (p = 0.929). IMT progression was significantly associated with age (p < 0.001), male gender (p = 0.0051) and current smoking status (p = 0.011), but not statin use (p = 0.289) and CD4 count (p = 0.927). FMD progression was significantly associated with current statin use (p = 0.019), but not CD4 count (p = 0.84). Neither extent nor progression of FMD was significantly associated with any of the examined vascular risk factors.IMT correlates better than FMD with established cardiovascular risk factors in this cohort of HIV patients. Standardization of protocols for FMD and IMT will facilitate the comparison of results across studies.",

An exception to this scenario is represented by HIV-1 infected nonprogressors (NP) which maintain relatively high circulating CD4+ T cells without clinical symptoms for several years in the absence of ART. Several lines of evidence indicate an important role of the T-cell response in the modulation of HIV-1 infection during the acute and chronic phase of the disease. We analyzed the functional and the differentiation phenotype of Nef- and Tat-specific CD8+ T cells in a cohort of HIV-1 infected NP in comparison to progressors, ART-treated seropositive individuals and individuals undergoing a single cycle of ART interruption. We observed that a distinctive feature of NP is the presence of Nef-specific CD45RA+ CD8+ T cells secreting MIP-1beta but not IFN-gamma. This population was present in 7 out of 11 NP. CD45RA+ IFN-gammaneg MIP-1beta+ CD8+ T cells were not detected in HIV-1 infected individuals under ART or withdrawing from ART and experiencing a rebounding viral replication. In addition, we detected Nef-specific CD45RA+ IFN-gammaneg MIP-1beta+ CD8+ T cells in only 1 out of 10 HIV-1 infected individuals with untreated progressive disease. The novel antigen-specific CD45RA+ IFN-gammaneg MIP-1beta+ CD8+ T cell population represents a new candidate marker of long-term natural control of HIV-1 disease progression and a relevant functional T-cell subset in the evaluation of the immune responses induced by candidate HIV-1 vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The search for disease biomarkers within human peripheral fluids has become a favorable approach to preventative therapeutics throughout the past few years. The comparison of normal versus disease states can identify an overexpression or a suppression of critical proteins where illness has directly altered a patient's cellular homeostasis. In particular, the analysis of HIV-1 infected serum is an attractive medium with which to identify altered protein expression due to the ease and non-invasive methods of collecting samples as well as the corresponding insight into the in vivo interaction of the virus with infected cells/tissue. The utilization of proteomic techniques to globally identify differentially expressed serum proteins in response to HIV-1 infection is a significant undertaking that is complicated due to the innate protein profile of human serum. Results Here, the depletion of 12 of the most abundant serum proteins, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with identification of these proteins using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, has allowed for the identification of differentially expressed, low abundant serum proteins. We have analyzed and compared serum samples from HIV-1 infected subjects who are being treated using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to those who are latently infected but have not progressed to AIDS despite the absence of treatment, i.e. long term non-progressors (LTNPs). Here we have identified unique serum proteins that are differentially expressed in LTNP HIV-1 patients and may contribute to the ability of these patients to combat HIV-1 infection in the absence of HAART. We focused on the cdk4/6 cell cycle inhibitor p16 INK4A and found that the treatment of HIV-1 latently infected cell lines with p16 INK4A decreases viral production despite it not being expressed endogenously in these cells. Conclusions Identification of these unique proteins may serve as an indication of altered viral states in response to infection as well as a natural phenotypic variability in response to HIV-1 infection in a given population.",

A prospective study was conducted among HIV-infected patients who failed NNRTI-based antiretroviral therapy with M184V, TAMs, and NNRTI mutations, and were naïve to protease inhibitor. LPV/r at 400/100 mg and lamivudine 150 mg were given twice daily. CD4 and HIV-1 RNA were monitored at week 0, 12, 24, and 48. LPV Cmin was assayed for the first 14 patients using HPLC. There were 40 patients with a mean age of 37 years and 70% were male. Median (IQR) baseline CD4 was 123 (37-245) cells/mm3 and median (IQR) HIV-1 RNA was 55,800 (9,670-100,000) copies/mL. By intend-to-treat analysis, 30 (75%) and 24 (60%) patients achieved HIV-1 RNA at <400 and <50 copies/mL, respectively. In as-treated analysis, the corresponding rates were 29 (83%) and 23 (67%), respectively. Low-level viral rebound was found in 6 (15%) patients at week 48. Medians CD4 at week 12, 24, 36 and 48 were 249, 283, 307, and 351 cells/mm3 and significantly changed from baseline (all, P < 0.05).

There were increments of mean total cholesterol and triglyceride at 48 weeks from baseline (P < 0.05). LPV/r monotherapy with recycled lamivudine can maintain virological suppression in a substantial proportion of patients failing NNRTI-based regimen and provides adequate plasma concentrations of LPV although the incidence of low-level viremia is relatively high.",

The effects of HAART and HAART adherence on HZ incidence were evaluated by comparing HIV-infected women on HAART (HAART use group) with the HIV-infected women remaining HAART naïve (HAART naïve group) in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). A 1:1 matching with propensity score for predicting HAART initiation was conducted to balance background covariates at index visit, including HIV disease stage. Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the risk of HZ development between the matched pairs. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the effects of HAART and HAART adherence on HZ incidence. Through propensity score matching, 389 pairs of participants were identified and they contributed 3,909 person years after matching. The background covariates were similar between the matched pairs at the index visit. The participants had a mean age around 39 years old, and about 61% of them were Black and 22% were Latina. No significant difference in HZ risk was observed between the HAART use group and the HAART naïve group during the first year of follow-up in any analyses. In the univariate analysis, the HAART use group had marginally lower HZ risk (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.72; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.48-1.1) over the entire follow-up period. However, women with a HAART adherence level of ≥95% had significantly lower HZ risk (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.94) compared to the HAART naïve women. The association remained significant after adjusting for quality of life score and acyclovir use, but it attenuated and was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for an intermediate variable, either CD4+ T cell counts or HIV viral load. Among adult women, we observed a significant preventive effect of long-term HAART use on HZ incidence when a HAART adherence level of ≥95% was attained, and this effect was mediated through reduction of HIV viral load and improvement of CD4+ T cell counts.",

Data was collected from nine key informants from the three biggest NGOs involved in ART roll-out using in-depth semi-structured interviews. Transcribing and coding for emergent themes was done by two independent reviewers. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the UNISA research ethics committee of The Faculty of Health Sciences. Written consent was obtained from directors of the three NGOs involved and individual audio taped informed consent was obtained from all study participants prior to data collection. Findings revealed six broad areas of patient behaviour challenges. These were patient behaviour related to socio-economic situation of patient (skipping of medication due to lack of food, or due to lack of transport fees), belief systems (traditional and religious), stigma (non- disclosure), sexual practices (non-acceptability of condoms, teenage pregnancies), escapism (drug and alcohol abuse) and opportunism (skipping medication in order to access disability grant, teenage pregnancies in order to access child grant). New programmes need to address patient behaviour as a complex phenomenon requiring a multi-pronged approach that also addresses social norms and institutions. In the face of continued ART scale up, this is further evidence for the need for multi-sectoral collaboration to ensure successful and sustainable ART roll-out.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Little is known about HIV-1 subtype distribution in Morocco. Some data suggest an emergence of new HIV subtypes. We conducted phylogenetic analysis on a nationally representative sample of 60 HIV-1 viral specimens collected during 2004-2005 through the Morocco national HIV sentinel surveillance survey. Results While subtype B is still the most prevalent, 23.3% of samples represented non-B subtypes, the majority of which were classified as CRF02_AG (15%). Molecular clock analysis confirmed that the initial introduction of HIV-1B in Morocco probably came from Europe in the early 1980s. In contrast, the CRF02_AG strain appeared to be introduced from sub-Saharan Africa in two separate events in the 1990s. Conclusions Subtype CRF02_AG has been emerging in Morocco since the 1990s. More information about the factors introducing HIV subtype-specific transmission will inform the prevention strategy in the region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In the context of scaling the viral load in resource limited settings, following HIV infected patient’s adults and children with CD4+ T-lymphocyte count still very important in settings where the decentralization of treatment still has some challenges. Effective HIV monitoring in these resource-constrained settings needs affordable and reliable CD4+ T lymphocytes enumeration methods. We investigated the validity of a BD FACSPresto POC which is a dedicated system for enumeration that uses immunofluorescent technologies. In this study, we have assessed the sensitivity, specificity and correlation between most representative flow cytometry instruments present in Cameroon with more than 5000 CD4 T cells tests per year including FACSCalibur, FACSCount, and PIMA POC from Becton–Dickinson and ALERE respectively. Methods 268 patients aged from 1 to 72 years old were enrolled and included in the study after inform consent. The BD FACSPresto POC CD4+ T cell technology was placed at CIRCB and operated by technician staff. HIV infected patients were from Chantal BIYA international reference Center (CIRCB), Centre de Sante Catholique de NKOLODOM, Centre de Sante Catholique de BIKOP and CASS de Nkolndongo—Yaounde We compared the accuracy of the BD FACSPresto and three existing reference technologies with more than 5000 tests per year like FACSCalibur, FACSCount and PIMA according to the number of CD4 test done per year and their repartition in the country. Bland–Altman method and correlation analysis were used to estimate mean bias and 95% limits of agreement and to compare the methods, including analysis by subgroup of participant gestational age. In addition sensitivity and specificity were determined. Statistical significance was set at P-value &lt; 0.05. Results The BD FACSPresto POC system has excellent precision, accuracy and linearity for CD4+ T lymphocytes enumeration. Good correlations were obtained between the BD FACSPresto poc system and other single platform methods. Bland–Altman plots showed interchangeability between two machines mean bias BD-FACSPresto vs PIMA = − 126,522(− 161,221 to − 91,822) BD-FACSPresto vs FACSCount = − 38,708 (− 58,935 to − 18,482) and FACSPresto vs FACSCALIBUR = 0.791(− 11,908 to 13,491). Mean difference with Absolute CD4+ T-lymphocyte values obtained from the BD FACSPresto system correlated well with PIMA, FACSCount, and FACSCalibur method with R 2 equal to 0.88, 0.92 and 0.968 respectively with P &lt; 0.001 for all. The mean comparison between values obtained from BD FACSPresto with PIMA, FACSCount, and FACSCalibur using paired T test give P = 0.17, P = 0.5 and P = 0.6 respectively meaning that there is no significant differences between values obtained with BD FACSPresto and PIMA, FACSCount or FACSCalibur CD4 enumeration machines. Further analysis revealed close agreement between all the three instruments with no significant difference between the forth methods (P = 0.91). Conclusion This BD-FACSPresto POC system is a simple, robust and reliable system for enumeration of absolute and percentage of CD4+ T-lymphocytes especially suitable for remote areas with limited resources. Having one BD-FACSPresto POC system easy to use, should reduce the cost and thus increase and improved access to CD4 testing for HIV infected patients in resource-constrained countries. BD-FACSPresto POC CD4 will enable reduction in patient time and improve the overall quality of ART service count and may improve test access in remote areas. This technology can allow for greater decentralization and wider access to CD4 testing and ART.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Although HIV-related deaths have decreased dramatically following the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV infection itself causes increased morbidity and mortality for both non-AIDS-related events or chronic inflammation and immune activation. The use of certain antiretroviral drugs can contribute to this process. Methods We investigated 26 potential biomarkers in serum samples from HIV-1 infected patients virologically suppressed under ART. The main objective of our study was to evaluate if virological suppression achieved with a triple drug regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate co-formulated with emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) as backbone, could correlate with a better immunological and inflammatory profile in relation to the third class of antiretroviral drug administered. The eligible patients were then divided into 3 groups in relation to the third drug associated with TDF/FTC: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) (Group 1, n = 16), protease inhibitors (PI) (Group 2, n = 17) and integrase inhibitors (INI) (Group 3, n = 16). Results Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were more represented in Group 2 than in Group 3 (IL-1Ra, p = 0.013; IL-12p70 p = 0.039; TNF-α p = 0.041; IL-8, p = 0.027; MIP1 β, p = 0.033). Eotaxin showed lower levels in Group 1 compared to Group 2 ( p = 0.010), while IP-10 was significantly lower in Group 1 compared to both Group 2 and Group 3 ( p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively). Conclusions Our results seem to discourage the administration of PI as a third drug in a virologically effective antiretroviral regimen, as its use is linked to the detection of higher levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in comparison with INI and NNRTI.",

    "abstract": "In 2007-2012 the Mexican government launched the National HIV program and there was a major change in HIV policies implemented in 2013-2018, when efforts focused on prevention, increase in early diagnosis and timely treatment. Still, late HIV diagnosis is a major concern in Mexico due to its association with the development of AIDS development and mortality. Thus, the objectives of this study were to identify the determinants of late HIV diagnosis (i.e. CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3) in Mexico from 2008 to 2017 and to evaluate the impact of the 2013-2017 National HIV program.Using patient level data from the SALVAR database, which includes 64% of the population receiving HIV care in Mexico, an adjusted logistic model was conducted. Main study outcomes were HIV late diagnosis which was defined as CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 at diagnosis.The study included 106,830 individuals newly diagnosed with HIV and treated in Mexican public health facilities between 2008 and 2017 (mean age: 33 years old, 80% male). HIV late diagnosis decreased from 45 to 43% (P < 0.001) between 2008 and 2012 and 2013-2017 (i.e. before and after the implementation of the 2013-2017 policy). Multivariable logistic regressions indicated that being diagnosed between 2013 and 2017 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96 [95% Confidence interval [CI] [0.93, 0.98]) or in health facilities specialized in HIV care (OR = 0.64 [95% CI 0.60, 0.69]) was associated with early diagnosis. Being male, older than 29 years old, diagnosed in Central East, the South region of Mexico or in high-marginalized locality increased the odds of a late diagnosis.The results of this study indicate that the 2013-2017 National HIV program in Mexico has been marginally successful in decreasing the proportion of individuals with late HIV diagnosis in Mexico. We identified several predictors of late diagnosis which could help establishing health policies. The main determinants for late diagnosis were being male, older than 29 years old, and being diagnosed in a Hospital or National Institute.",

Many AGYW experience stigma and provider bias at health facilities, deterring their use of HIV prevention services. Privately-owned drug shops, ubiquitous in many communities, may be an effective and accessible channel to deliver HIV prevention products to AGYW, including oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and the dapivirine vaginal ring. Methods In July–August 2019, we enrolled 26 drug shops in Shinyanga, Tanzania in an ongoing study to create “girl-friendly” drug shops where AGYW can access HIV self-testing and contraception. At baseline, all shop dispensers were given basic information about oral PrEP and the dapivirine ring and were asked about their interest in stocking each. During the next 3–5 months, we surveyed AGYW (n = 56) customers about their interest in oral PrEP and the ring. Results Among dispensers, the median age was 42 years and 77% were female. Overall, 42% of dispensers had heard of a medication for HIV prevention. Almost all dispensers reported some interest in stocking oral PrEP (92%) and the dapivirine ring (96%). Most (85%) reported they would provide oral PrEP to AGYW who requested it. Among AGYW customers, the median age was 17 years; 29% of AGYW were married or had a steady partner and 18% had children. Only 20% of AGYW had heard of a medication to prevent HIV, yet 64% and 43% expressed some interest in using oral PrEP and the dapivirine ring, respectively, after receiving information about the products. PrEP interest was higher among AGYW who were partnered and had children. Conclusions Despite low prior awareness of PrEP among shop dispensers and AGYW, we found high levels of interest in oral PrEP and the dapivirine ring in both groups. Community-based drug shops represent a promising strategy to make HIV prevention more accessible to AGYW.",

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage has increased sharply. The purposes of this prospective cohort study were to investigate the ART-related experiences and whether they were associated with mental health problems among a sample of people living with HIV undergoing ART in China. Methods The participants were 400 people living with HIV who had started ART for the first time in Guangzhou city. They were followed-up 1-year after ART initiation. Probable depression and moderate/severe anxiety were measured at baseline and Month 12, while experiences related to ART (e.g., side effects and regained self-confidence) were measured at Month 6. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to explore the associations between baseline characteristics, ART-related experiences and mental health status. Results Among the 300 participants (75.0%) who completed all three surveys, a significant decline in prevalence of probable depression (23.0% at baseline vs. 14.0% at Month 12, P = 0.002) and moderate/severe anxiety (14.7% at baseline vs. 8.7% at Month 12, P = 0.023) was observed during the follow-up period. After adjustment for mental health status and potential confounders at baseline, a number of ART-related experiences at Month 6 were associated with probable depression and/or moderate/severe anxiety measured at Month 12. Improved physical health, relationships with sexual partners, and self-confidence were associated with decreased mental health issues, while the side effects of ART, AIDS-related symptoms, and inconvenience in daily life due to ART use were associated with increased mental health issues. Conclusions ART-related experiences were associated with mental health problems, tailored mental health promotion interventions targeting these experiences are needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV status disclosure facilitates access to HIV-related prevention and treatment services and increases opportunities for social support, HIV risk reduction with partners, and index testing for sexual partners or children. This study assessed the effect of a program model of community-based social welfare volunteers on HIV status disclosure among caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC). Methods This was a longitudinal study, which was based on OVC caregivers who were beneficiaries of the USAID Kizazi Kipya project in Tanzania. They were enrolled (baseline) by community social welfare volunteers during 2017–2018, received services, and reassessed at midline in 2019. Caregivers who reported having been HIV tested, were asked to voluntarily report the status in order for the volunteers to establish and provide needed services. Those who reported their HIV status as negative or positive were grouped as “disclosed”, and those who knew their status but did not report it were documented as “undisclosed”. McNemar’s tests compared disclosure rates at baseline and midline. Multivariable analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equation (GEE). Results The study analyzed 140,664 caregivers (72% female) from 81 district councils of Tanzania. Their mean age at enrollment was 47.4 years. Overall, 81.3% of the caregivers disclosed their HIV status to the project staff at baseline; this increased significantly to 96.1% at midline (p &lt; 0.001). Disclosure at baseline varied significantly by sociodemographic characteristic (p &lt; 0.05), with higher disclosure in females, among urban residents, and higher educated caregivers. However, the observed disclosure variations by sociodemographic characteristics at baseline disappeared at midline and disclosure reached around 96% across the characteristics (p &gt; 0.05). In the multivariable analysis, caregivers’ likelihood of HIV status disclosure was nearly 6 times higher at midline than at baseline, when baseline characteristics were adjusted for (OR = 5.76, 95% CI 5.59–5.94, p &lt; 0.001). There were 26,329 caregivers who did not disclose their HIV status at baseline (i.e., 0% diclosure rate at baseline), but 94.7% (n = 24,933) had disclosed by midline, and their disclosure trend was rapidly increasing as their duration of exposure to the project increased. Conclusions This study detected an increased caregivers’ HIV status disclosure to the USAID Kizazi Kipya project staff by 14.8%, from 81.3% at baseline to 96.1% at midline within an average project exposure period of 1.4 years. The observed loss of sociodemographic differences in HIV status disclosure rate at midline implies that community-based interventions may be well-positioned to successfully address and eliminate sociodemographic barriers to service uptake and consequently improve services coverage and health outcomes.",

There is a contradiction among studies and previous studies conducted in the study area used a cross-sectional study design. This study aimed to identify determinant factors for adherence to antiretroviral treatment among people living with HIV at Dessie Referral Hospital by using an unmatched case–control study design. Methods and materials an institution-based unmatched case–control study design was used on a total sample of 582 (146 controls and 436 cases). Each respondent was selected by consecutive random sampling. The collected data were entered and analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Science version 25.0. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables that were statistically significant determinants. Result The mean age of the respondents was 41.64 years. About 61.5% of the participants were females. Patients with baseline HIV stage I was more likely to be adherent to the prescribed HIV medicine (AOR: 2.194 95% CI: 1.116, 4.314) as compared with those with baseline WHO stage IV. Patients who did not take anti-tuberculosis medication collaterally with the prescribed HIV medicine were more likely to be adherent (AOR: 2.271 95% CI: 1.257, 4.102). Patients who took antiretroviral therapy for more than 24 months were more likely to be adherent (AOR: 3.665 95% CI: 1.321, 10.170). Conclusion Initiation of antiretroviral therapy at the later stage of the disease and taking anti-tuberculosis concomitantly were negatively associated with adherence. Being on antiretroviral therapy for a longer duration has a positive association. Health facilities and professionals should strictly apply strategies for the prevention of tuberculosis among HIV patients to avoid concomitant use of anti-tuberculosis medications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as physical distancing, closure of community services, postponement of health appointments, and loss of employment can lead to social isolation, financial uncertainty, and interruption of antiretroviral adherence, resulting in additional health-related challenges (disability) experienced among adults living with chronic illness such as HIV. ‘Living strategies’ is a concept derived from the perspectives of people living with HIV, defined as behaviors, attitudes and beliefs adopted by people living with HIV to help deal with disability associated with HIV and multi-morbidity. Our aim was to describe disability among adults living with HIV and self-care living strategies used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Adults living with HIV in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, including some with pre-pandemic HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ) data, completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between June–August 2020. The survey included the HDQ and questions about self-care living strategy use during the pandemic. We compared disability (HDQ) scores prior to versus during the pandemic using paired t -tests. We reported the proportion of participants who engaged in various living strategies at least ‘a few times a week’ or ‘everyday’ during the pandemic. Results Of the 63 respondents, 84% were men, median age 57 years, and 62% lived alone. During the pandemic the greatest disability severity was in the uncertainty [median 30; Interquartile range (IQR): 16, 43] and mental-emotional (25; IQR: 14, 41) domains. Among the 51 participants with pre-pandemic data, HDQ severity scores were significantly greater (worse) during the pandemic (vs prior) in all domains. Greatest change from prior to during the pandemic was in the mental-emotional domain for presence (17.7; p &lt; 0.001), severity (11.4; p &lt; 0.001), and episodic nature (9.3; p &lt; 0.05) of disability. Most participants (&gt; 60%) reported engaging a ‘few times a week’ or ‘everyday’ in self-care strategies associated with maintaining sense of control and adopting positive attitudes and beliefs. Conclusions People living with HIV reported high levels of uncertainty and mental-emotional health challenges during the pandemic. Disability increased across all HDQ dimensions, with the greatest worsening in the mental-emotional health domain. Results provide an understanding of disability and self-care strategy use during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We collected epidemiological, classical cardiovascular risk factors and variables associated with HIV infection status. The qualitative variables were compared using the χ2 test. NT-proBNP levels were taken as the dependent variable. The association between these levels and the quantitative variables were studied by analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the association with the qualitative variables, using Student's t test.Nt-pro BNP levels were determined in 146 HIV patients. We assess the 10-year cardiovascular risk calculated by the Framingham equation, 59 (41.5%) were classified as low risk, 46 (32.4%) as a moderate risk and 37 (26.1%) as a high risk. The higher levels of NT-pro BNP were found in women, and in those patient with lower filtration rate and high levels of triglycerides. An association was also observed between higher levels of NT-proBNP and the recent use of lamivudine and fosamprenavir. After a multivariate analysis we found an association between higher levels of NT-proBNP and the current use of fosamprenavir and a lower glomerular filtration rate.We found, with the limitations of a small serie, that higher levels of NTproBNP in HIV patients could be linked to the occurrence of cardiovascular events, this fact suggest that NTpro BNP could be used in patients at moderate or high vascular risk in order to optimise the primary prevention of vascular events.",

    "abstract": "MDD and HIV/AIDS have a high prevalence worldwide with severe consequences for patients. In both conditions, compliance with treatment is key to successfully treat these disorders. In the current study, we examine the effect of MDD on the compliance with ADs in patients diagnosed with co-morbid HIV/AIDS and how different classes of ADs influence compliance in this group of patients.A prospective, cohort study design was used to analyse nationally representative medicine claims data submitted to a privately-owned South African Pharmaceutical Benefit Management (PBM) company. Two groups were distinguished in the database, namely patients with only MDD and patients with both MDD and HIV/AIDS, over a six-year study period. The study population was determined by the following inclusion criteria: patients older than 18 years, MDD should be diagnosed by a psychiatrist supported by an appropriate ICD-10 code, and all patients have to be on combination antiretroviral treatment (cARV) treatment. The medicine possession ratio (MPR) was used as proxy to determine patient compliance with AD medication.127 patients (i.e. 0.24%) met the criteria of co-morbid MDD and HIV/AIDS. Females have a significantly higher prevalence of MDD and HIV/AIDS when compared to males. Patients diagnosed with both HIV/AIDS and MDD (74.43. ± 32.03, 95% Cl: 71.51-77.34) have a statistical significantly (p < 0.0001) lower compliance with AD treatment vs. MDD patients (80.94% ± 29.44, 95% Cl: 80.56-81.33), but the practical significance thereof, is low (Cohen's d = 0.2255). In this group only 26.83% of TCA had acceptable compliance compared to the 58.57% of SNRIs. Noteworthy observations were that 75% (p < 0.0217; Cramer's V = 0.0388) of venlafaxine and 28.6% (p < 0.0197; Cramer's V = -0.0705) of the paroxetine items were compliant in patients diagnosed with both HIV/AIDS and MDD.AD compliance is statistical significantly lower in depressed HIV/AIDS vs. depressed non-HIV/AIDS patients. However, these differences is of low practical or clinical significance, meaning that depressed HIV/AIDS patients would have missed approximately two AD doses (6.5% of a 30-day treatment period) more than the non-HIV/AIDS depressed patient over the same treatment period.",

The incidence of and mortality from cryptococcal meningitis have markedly decreased since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).

Although IRIS is occasionally difficult to distinguish from relapse or treatment failure, the distinction is important because IRIS requires a different treatment. Here, we present the case of a patient with AIDS who developed symptoms of cryptococcal IRIS 41 months after starting cART. To the best of our knowledge, the time between cART initiation and the onset of cryptococcal IRIS in this patient is the longest that has been reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the rate of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Zhejiang province and to identify specific factors associated with progression of this disease. This study utilized a retrospective cohort to identify the specific factors involved in the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to AIDS. We collected data of patients existing in care between 2008 and 2012 from the national surveillance system databases. We performed our analyses using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. This study included 9216 HIV-positive patients (75.6 % male), which yielded 12,452 person-years (py) of follow-up-data. The AIDS progression rates were 33.9 % (2008), 33.6 % (2009), 38.1 % (2010), 30.6 % (2011) and 25.9 % (2012). We observed a significant reduction in the rate of progression Of HIV to AIDS post-2010 (Pearson χ2 = 4341.9, P < 0.001). The cumulative AIDS progression incidence rates were 33.4, 35.4, 36.4, 37.0 and 37.04 per 100 py in 1 each of the 5 years of follow-up. This study found that age was an independent risk factor for the progression of HIV to AIDS. Compared with patients infected with HIV by homosexual transmission, patients infected with HIV by heterosexuals transmission or blood transfusion had a reduced hazard ratio (HR) for progression to AIDS (heterosexual transmission: HR = 0.695, 0.524, P = 0.007; blood transfusion: HR = 0.524, P = 0.015). Diagnosed with HIV from 2011 to 2012 and having a higher CD4+ cell count (350–500 cells/mm3; or >500 cells/mm3) at baseline were independently associated with lower rates of HIV progression to AIDS [HR = 0.382, 0.380, 0.187, P < 0.001]. Patients with a CD+ T-cell count of 200–350 cells/mm3 or greater than 350 cells/mm3 were less likely to develop AIDS following HIV diagnosis than were those patients without HAART treatment. This study found a high progression rate from HIV to AIDS in HIV patients residing within Zhejiang province from 2008 to 2010. This rate decreased after 2010, which coincided with the new criteria for HAART treatment, which likely contributed to the observed reduction in the rate of progression. Initiation of HAART with higher CD4+ T-cell count may reduce rate of AIDS progression. Based on our results, we conclude that efficient strategies for HIV screening, as well as early diagnosis and treatment are necessary to reduce the progression of HIV to AIDS.",

Information on treatment outcome in such areas is still very limited notably due to additional difficulties to manage ART in these areas.387 HIV-1 infected adults (≥18 years) were consecutively enrolled when attending healthcare services for their routine medical visit at 12 or 24 months on first-line ART in five HIV care centers (four semi-rural and one rural). Among them, 102 patients were on first-line ART for 12 ± 2 months (M12) and 285 for 24 ± 2 months (M24). Virological failure was observed in 70 (18.1 %) patients ranging from 13.9 to 31.6 % at M12 and from 8.1 to 22.4 % at M24 across the different sites. For 67/70 patients, sequencing was successful and drug resistance mutations were observed in 65 (97 %). The global prevalence of drug resistance in the study population was thus at least 16.8 % (65/387). Moreover, 32 (8.3 %) and 27 (6.9 %) patients were either on a completely ineffective ART regime or with only a single drug active. Several patients accumulated high numbers of mutations and developed also cross-resistance to abacavir, didanosine or the new NNRTI drugs like etravirine and rilpivirine.The observations on ART treatment outcome from ART clinics in semi-rural areas are close to previous observations in Lomé, the capital city suggesting that national ART-programme management plays a role in treatment outcome.",

A descriptive analysis generated from global and situational studies was used to interpret the reviewed research and to discuss critically the factors that drive migrants to engage in alcohol consumption and high-risk behaviour.This review found out that there is a significant and positive association between global and situational alcohol use and several outcomes of risky sexual behaviour among different types of migrant populations. This association was however mainly observed at high quantities and frequencies of alcohol use, mainly among male migrants, and was often tied to a specific situation or context, for instance the type of sexual partner, the level of mobility and to environmental factors such as living arrangements and entertainment venues.The study supports previous research that alcohol use is associated with risky sexual behaviour among different types of migrant populations. Therefore, future interventions should target mobile, male migrant heavy drinkers. Additional research is needed using more event-level and longitudinal methodologies that overcome prior methodological limitations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective This study investigated prevalence trends and identified the associated factors of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) among pregnant women in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), Southwest China. Methods Serial cross-sectional surveys were performed annually among pregnant women in Guangxi from 2009 to 2018. Blood specimens were collected to test the prevalence of HIV, syphilis and HCV. Cochran–Armitage analysis was used to assess the trends of HIV, syphilis and HCV prevalence, as well as the sociodemographic and behavioural data. In this study, we used zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models to identify factors associated with HIV, syphilis and HCV infection. Results A total of 23,879 pregnant women were included in the study. The prevalence of HIV, syphilis and HCV was 0.24%, 0.85% and 0.19%, respectively. There was a decrease in HIV prevalence from 0.54% to 0.10%, a decrease in HCV prevalence from 0.40% to 0.05% and a decrease in syphilis prevalence from 1.53% to 0.30%. The findings based on the ZINB model revealed that pregnant women who had a history of STI had significantly increased risks of HIV (OR 6.63; 95% CI 1.33–32.90) and syphilis (OR 9.06; 95% CI 3.85–21.30) infection, while pregnant women who were unmarried/widowed/divorced were more likely to have HIV (OR 2.81; 95% CI 1.20–6.54) and HCV (OR 58.12; 95% CI, 3.14–1076.99) infection. Furthermore, pregnant women whose husband had a history of STI (OR 5.62; 95% CI 1.24–25.38) or drug use (OR 7.36; 95% CI 1.25–43.43) showed an increased risk of HIV infection. Conclusions There was a relatively low prevalence of HIV, syphilis and HCV among pregnant women. Although decreasing trends in HIV, syphilis and HCV infections were observed, effort is needed to promote STI testing in both premarital medical check-ups and antenatal care, especially targeting couples with a history of STI or drug use.",

Community health workers (CHW) support HIV disclosure among adults living with HIV (ALHIV) in sexual relationships with disclosure difficulties. However, experiences and challenges of using CHW-led disclosure support mechanism were not documented. This study explored experiences and challenges involved in using CHW-led disclosure support mechanism among ALHIV in heterosexual relationships in the rural Uganda. Methods This was a phenomenological qualitative study involving in-depth interviews among CHWs and ALHIV with HIV disclosure difficulties to sexual partners in greater Luwero region, Uganda. We conducted 27 interviews among purposively selected CHWs and participants who had participated in the CHW-led disclosure support mechanism. Interviews were conducted until saturation was reached; and analysis was done using inductive and deductive content analysis in Atlas. Results All respondents viewed HIV disclosure as an important strategy in HIV management. Provision of adequate counseling and support to those intending to disclose was instrumental for successful disclosure. However, fear of the negative disclosure outcomes was viewed as a barrier to disclosure. The CHWs were viewed as having an added advantage in supporting disclosure as opposed to the routine disclosure counseling. However, HIV disclosure using CHW-led support mechanism would be limited by possible bleach of client’s confidentiality. Therefore, respondents thought that appropriate selection of CHWs would improve their trust in the community. Additionally, providing CHWs with adequate training and facilitation during the disclosure support mechanism was viewed to improve their work. Conclusion Community health workers were viewed as being more supportive in HIV disclosure among ALHIV with disclosure difficulties to sexual partners compared to routine facility based disclosure counseling. Therefore, near location CHW-led disclosure mechanism was acceptable and useful in supporting HIV disclosure among HIV-affected sexual partners in rural settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) associated with syphilis has rarely been described in HIV-infected patients. Diagnosis can be challenging because it is not always possible to discern it from a recent infection or a worsening of an undiagnosed one. Case presentation An HIV-positive 42-year-old man with a poor compliance history of antiretroviral therapy presented at our unit and complained of ocular symptoms. Ocular syphilis diagnosis was posed after initial misdiagnosing with cytomegalovirus infection, and antiretroviral therapy compliance improved after switching to a bictegravir-based regimen. Despite intravenous (IV) penicillin, we observed an initial worsening with the appearance of new skin lesions, and IRIS syphilis was suspected. In the literature, 14 cases of IRIS syphilis are described, all regarding male patients. Seven were HIV naïve to therapy, and 7 HIV-experienced with poor therapy compliance. Basal syphilis serology was negative in ten, with subsequent seroconversion after the development of IRIS. IRIS-syphilis development was observed after a median time of 28 days from ART initiation; 10 cases were considered \"unmasking-IRIS\" and 4 \"paradoxical-IRIS\". Skin and ocular involvement were the most often reported. In most cases, it was not necessary to use a systemic steroid. A good outcome was reported in 12. Conclusions Syphilis should be considered in differential diagnosis with other diseases associated with IRIS. A negative syphilis serology before beginning antiretroviral therapy could convey the impression that syphilis has been ruled out. Whereas a high index of suspicion should be maintained when symptoms suggestive of syphilis, such as ocular and skin manifestations, are noticed after therapy has begun.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Suboptimal antiretroviral (ART) adherence can lead to virologic failure with consequent HIV-1 resistance. Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in dried blood spots (DBS) is a powerful biomarker of cumulative adherence, predictive of future viremia. It has been associated with resistance in Persons With HIV (PWH) in South Africa and the US. We explored the relationship of TFV-DP concentrations with antiretroviral drug resistance at the time of treatment failure in SA. Methods Adult PWH from health clinics in Cape Town, South Africa on efavirenz-based first-line ART containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with an undetectable (&lt; 50 copies/mL) HIV-1 viral load (VL) were prospectively enrolled in an observational cohort for 12 months. Monthly study visits included blood collection for HIV-1 VL and DBS for TFV-DP. The first confirmed viral breakthrough (VB) &gt; 400 copies/mL triggered HIV-1 genotyping at the subsequent visit. An electronic adherence (EA) device monitored ART adherence in real-time, estimated as a percent for the 30-days prior to VB. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare median [IQR] TFV-DP by genotype outcome. Results Of 250 individuals, (n = 195, 78% women), 21 experienced VB, with a median of 5 [4;7] months on study, and a median EA of 33.3 [13.3;53.3]%. Demographic characteristics between those with and without VB were similar. Median VL at VB was 4.0 [3.2;4.5] log copies/mL. TFV-DP concentrations trended down towards the VB visit. Median TFV-DP concentrations were significantly higher in those HIV-1 genotype did not amplify due to being virally suppressed at the subsequent visit (n = 10; 380 [227–661] fmol/punch, p = 0.035; EA 45 [24.9; 59.2]%); than in those who were successfully genotyped with evidence of drug resistance (n = 5, 241 [150–247] fmol/punch, EA 20 [6.7;36.7]%) and in individuals who did not have resistance (n = 3, 39.9 [16.6; 93.9] fmol/punch; EA 33.3 [16–38]%). Three genotype collections were not done. Only non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated mutations were identified on resistance testing. (K103N, E138K, Y118H). Conclusion TFV-DP in DBS showed a step-wise inverse relationship with VB and drug resistance, with evidence of low cumulative ART adherence in PWH who developed antiretroviral resistance. Monitoring TFV-DP concentrations could be a valuable tool for predicting future VB and future resistance.",

Zanzibar has experienced several interruptions of HIV services in the areas of testing and counselling, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, key population, care and treatment services as well due to the hospital operating at a reduced capacity and the strict visit restrictions with health care allocations to COVID 19 pandemic. The community HIV initiatives, such as index testing and ARVs medicine refills, were used to mitigate the consequences of the epidemic and can be applied in future emergencies. This report tries to reveal COVID-19’s unnoticed consequences on HIV services in Zanzibar.",

We aimed to determine the efficacy of vitamins on the prevention of MTCT and preterm delivery by systematically reviewing the available randomized controlled trials [RCTs]. We conducted systematic searches of 7 electronic databases. We extracted data from the RCTs independently, in duplicate. Results We included 4 trials in our review. Of the three trials on Vitamin A, two suggested no difference in MTCT, while the third and largest trial ( n = 1078) suggested an increased risk of MTCT (Relative Risk 1.35, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.11–1.66, P = 0.009). Two of the vitamin A trials addressed the impact of supplementation on pre-term delivery; one suggested a benefit (RR 0.65, 95% CI, 0.44–0.94) and the other no difference. All three vitamin A trials found no significant effect on infant mortality at 1 year. Of the two trials that looked at multivitamin use, only one addressed the prevention of MTCT, and found a non-significant RR of 1.04 (95% CI, 0.82–1.32). Two of the multivitamin trials found no significant effects on pre-term delivery. The single multivitamin trial examining children's mortality at 1 year yielded a non-significant RR of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.17–1.17). Conclusion Randomized trials of vitamins to prevent MTCT have yielded conflicting results without strong evidence of benefit and have failed to exclude the possibility of harm.",

At week 4 unblinding was performed and patients on placebo were offered open-label MMF.Six patients were enrolled. At entry mean plasma HIV-1 RNA (VL) was 2.98 log10 copies/mL; mean CD4 count was 523. All subjects randomized to placebo elected to cross over to open label MMF. No significant adverse events were observed during MMF therapy. Three patients on MMF achieved VL < 50 copies/mL by week 4; a fourth had VL decline of > 0.5 log. Two patients on placebo had declines of VL. One of these had further decline on open label MMF. Cell surface markers of apoptosis, activation, and proliferation on CD4+ and CD8+ cells declined modestly or remained low. CD4 counts were stable at week 24. All but one subject had rebound of viremia by week 24, universally associated with missed doses of medication by pill count.MMF appears to be safe, and its administration lead to decreased T cell activation. During periods of adherence to therapy, the use of MMF was correlated with declines in viremia, but this small pilot study could not prove this association. Further study of MMF in patients with viremia should be considered for whom additional or alternative antiretrovirals are impractical.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Successful treatment of HIV-positive patients is fundamental to controlling the progression to AIDS. Causes of treatment failure are either related to drug resistance and/or insufficient drug levels in the blood. Severe side effects, coupled with the intense nature of many regimens, can lead to treatment fatigue and consequently to periodic or permanent non-adherence. Although non-adherence is a recognised problem in HIV treatment, it is still poorly detected in both clinical practice and research and often based on unreliable information such as self-reports, or in a research setting, Medication Events Monitoring System caps or prescription refill rates. To meet the need for having objective information on adherence, we propose a method using viral load and HIV genome sequence data to identify non-adherence amongst patients. Presentation of the hypothesis With non-adherence operationally defined as a sharp increase in viral load in the absence of mutation, it is hypothesised that periods of non-adherence can be identified retrospectively based on the observed relationship between changes in viral load and mutation. Testing the hypothesis Spikes in the viral load (VL) can be identified from time periods over which VL rises above the undetectable level to a point at which the VL decreases by a threshold amount. The presence of mutations can be established by comparing each sequence to a reference sequence and by comparing sequences in pairs taken sequentially in time, in order to identify changes within the sequences at or around 'treatment change events'. Observed spikes in VL measurements without mutation in the corresponding sequence data then serve as a proxy indicator of non-adherence. Implications of the hypothesis It is envisaged that the validation of the hypothesised approach will serve as a first step on the road to clinical practice. The information inferred from clinical data on adherence would be a crucially important feature of treatment prediction tools provided for practitioners to aid daily practice. In addition, distinct characteristics of biological markers routinely used to assess the state of the disease may be identified in the adherent and non-adherent groups. This latter approach would directly help clinicians to differentiate between non-responding and non-adherent patients.",

    "abstract": "Stavudine continues to be widely used in resource poor settings despite its toxicity. Our objective was to determine association between plasma stavudine concentrations and lipoatrophy, concentrations of glucose, lactate and triglycerides. Participants were enrolled in a cross-sectional study with lipoatrophy assessment, oral glucose tolerance test, fasting triglycerides, finger prick lactate, and stavudine concentrations. Individual predictions of the area under the concentration curve (AUC) were obtained using a population pharmacokinetic approach. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the association between stavudine geometric mean ratio > 1 and impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlactataemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and lipoatrophy. There were 47 study participants with a median age of 34 years and 83% were women. The median body mass index and waist:hip ratio was 24.5 kg/m2 and 0.85 respectively. The median duration on stavudine treatment was 14.5 months. The prevalence of lipoatrophy, impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlactataemia, and hypertriglyceridaemia were 34%, 19%, 4%, 32%, and 23% respectively. Estimated median (interquartile range) stavudine AUC was 2191 (1957 to 2712) ng*h/mL. Twenty two participants had stavudine geometric mean ratio >1. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed no association between stavudine geometric mean ratio >1 and impaired fasting glucose (odds ratio (OR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.19), impaired glucose tolerance (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 19.42), hyperlactataemia (OR 2.19, 95%CI 0.63 to 7.66), hypertriglyceridaemia (OR 1.75, 95%CI 0.44 to 7.04), and lipoatrophy (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.79). There was a high prevalence of metabolic complications of stavudine, but these were not associated with plasma stavudine concentrations. Until there is universal access to safer antiretroviral drugs, there is a need for further studies examining the pathogenesis of stavudine-associated toxicities.",

A total of 86 active money boy participants (Changchun, n = 49; Jilin City, n = 37) were surveyed concerning background and demographics, basic HIV transmission knowledge, and sexual practices. The survey indicated that while Jilin Province money boy behavior matches other studies concerning propensity to high risk behavior and significant bridging potential, the Jilin money boys, unlike previous studies, exhibited a high level of basic HIV/AIDS transmission knowledge. In spite of this level of knowledge, none of the participants reported always using a condom in their sexual activities. They also exhibited a high level of awareness of voluntary counseling and testing available in the province, yet relatively few had availed themselves of these services. These preliminary findings will be used as a baseline and springboard for continuing study in the Jilin Province money boy community. Even now, however, it is becoming clear that the dynamics of male commercial sex work may vary greatly depending upon local influences, and will necessitate that future interventions are highly tailored to area-specific circumstances.",

Methods to assess the persistence of antiviral activity of deoxynucleoside analogs, which require intracellular activation to the active metabolites that can persist in cells, will be important for designing dosages, combination regimens, and assessing treatment compliance. Using an HIV-IIIB/TZM-bl indicator cell culture system, we assessed the ability of an inhibitor to protect cells from infection and to delay viral rebound after removal of inhibitor from culture.The order of protection of cells from HIV-infection was 4'-Ed4T > LFD4C > DDI > D4T > 3TC > AZT > FTC > NVP. The fold-increase in EC50 to delay viral rebound was DDI < 4'-Ed4T < LFD4C < FTC < D4T < 3TC < NVP < AZT. The ranking of persistence of anti-HIV activity of the inhibitors based on the two-component assay was DDI > 4'-Ed4T > LFD4C > FTC = D4T > 3TC > NVP > AZT.The persistence ranking was derived from assays based on measures of single viral replication-cycle and cumulative inhibition at multiple time-points. Therefore, a better indicator of the pharmacodynamic property of an inhibitor.

Serum FGF-21 levels were determined by quantitative ELISA. Cellular mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed by COX (cytochrome c oxidase) histochemistry of lower limb skeletal muscle biopsy. Serum FGF-21 levels were elevated in 66% of subjects. Levels correlated significantly with current CD4 lymphocyte count (p = 0.042) and with total CD4 count gain since initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (p = 0.016), but not with the nature or duration of past or current anti-retroviral treatment. There was no correlation between serum FGF-21 levels and severity of the muscle mitochondrial (COX) defect.Serum FGF-21 levels are a poor predictor of muscle mitochondrial dysfunction in contemporary anti-retroviral treated patients. Serum FGF-21 levels are nevertheless commonly elevated, in association with the degree of immune recovery, suggesting a non-mitochondrial metabolic disturbance with potential implications for future comorbidity.",

Retrospective, non-consecutive medical record audit of patients attending a publicly funded HIV clinic in metropolitan Sydney analysed for predictors of adverse health outcomes. We developed a scoring system based on the validated Charlson score method for NACs, mental health and social issues and confounders were selected using directed acyclic graph theory under the principles of causal inference. 211 patient files were audited non-consecutively over 6 weeks. 89.5% were male; 41.8% culturally and linguistically diverse and 4.1% were of Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander origin. Half of patients had no general practitioner and 25% were ineligible for Medicare subsidised care. The most common NACs were: cardiovascular disease (25%), hepatic disease (21%), and endocrinopathies (20%). One-third of patients had clinical anxiety, one-third major depression and almost half of patients had a lifetime history of tobacco smoking. Five predictors of poor health outcomes were identified: (1) co-morbidity score was associated with hospitalisation (odds ratio, OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.01–2.46; p = 0.044); (2) mental health score was associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.22–2.62; p = 0.003) and poor adherence to ART (OR 2.34; 95% CI 1.52–3.59; p = 0.001); (3) social issues score was associated with genotypic resistance (OR 2.61; 95% CI 1.48–4.59; p = 0.001), co-morbidity score (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.24–2.3; p = 0.001) and hospitalisation (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.1–2.7; p = 0.018); (4) body mass index < 20 was associated with genotypic resistance (OR 6.25; 95% CI 1.49–26.24; p = 0.012); and (5) Medicare eligibility was associated with co-morbidity score (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.24–3.95; p = 0.007).

There has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of STIs, particularly syphilis, gonorrhoea, Mycoplasma genitalium and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-positive patients. The reasons for this are multifactorial, but contributing factors may include effective treatment for HIV, increased STI testing, use of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis and use of social media to meet sexual partners. The rate of syphilis–HIV co-infection is increasing, with a corresponding increase in its incidence in the wider community. HIV-positive patients infected with syphilis are more likely to have neurological invasion, causing syndromes of neurosyphilis and ocular syphilis. HIV infection accelerates HCV disease progression in co-infected patients, and liver disease is a leading cause of non-AIDS-related mortality among patients who are HIV-positive. Since several direct-acting antivirals have become subsidised in Australia, there has been an increase in treatment uptake and a decrease in HCV viraemia in HIV-positive patients. The incidence of other sexually transmitted bacterial infections such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium is increasing in HIV patients, causing urethritis, proctitis and other syndromes. Increasing antimicrobial resistance has also become a major concern, making treatment of these infections challenging. Increased appropriate testing and vigilant management of these STIs with data acquisition on antimicrobial sensitivities and antimicrobial stewardship are essential to prevent ongoing epidemics and emergence of resistance. Although efforts to prevent, treat and reduce epidemics of STIs in patients living with HIV are underway, further advances are needed to reduce the significant morbidity associated with co-infection in this patient setting.",

We determine the feasibility and yield of HIV screening among otherwise healthy adult trauma patients presenting to the first full-capacity Emergency Department in Tanzania.This was a prospective cohort study of consecutive adult trauma patients presenting to Emergency Medicine Department at Muhimbili National Hospital (EMD-MNH) in Dar es Salaam, from March 2017 to September 2017. Eligible patients provided informed consent, pre and post-test counseling was done. Structured case report forms were completed, documenting demographics, acceptance of testing, results and readiness to receive results. Outcomes were the proportion of patients accepting testing, proportion of positive tests, readiness of the patient to receive the results, and proportion of patients who had an HIV test ordered as part of care.We screened 2848 trauma patients, and enrolled 326 (11.5%) eligible patients. Median age was 33 (IQR 25-42 years), and 248 (76.0%) of participants were male. Of those enrolled, 250 (76.7%) patients accepted testing for HIV, and among them 247 (98.8%) were ready to receive their test results. Of those tested, 14 (5.6%) were found to be HIV positive and 12 were ready to receive results. Two months post hospital discharge 6 (50%), of those who were informed of positive results had visited Care and Treatment Clinics (CTC) for HIV treatment. Three additional patients had not yet attended and three could not be reached. The treating ED physician tested none of the enrolled patients for HIV as part of their regular treatment.In our cohort of adult trauma patients presenting to ED, routine HIV screening for unrelated reason, was feasible and acceptable. The yield is sufficient to warrant an on-going program and superior to having physicians choose which patients to test. Future studies should focus on factors affecting the linkage to CTC among HIV positive patients identified at the ED.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background According to the user instructions from the manufacturer of OraQuick HIV self-test (HIVST) kits, individuals whose kits show one red band should be considered to be HIV-negative, no matter how weak the band is. However, recent reports show potential for a second false weak band after storage, thereby creating confusion in the interpretation of results. In this study, we re-tested individuals whose results were initially non-reactive but changed to weak reactive results to determine their true HIV status. Methods This study was nested within a large, cluster-randomized HIVST trial implemented among pregnant women attending antenatal care and their male partners in central Uganda between July 2016 and February 2017. Ninety-five initially HIV-negative respondents were enrolled into this study, including 52 whose kits developed a second weak band while in storage and 43 whose kits were interpreted as HIV-positive by interviewers at the next follow-up interview. Respondents were invited to return for repeat HIVST which was performed under the observation of a trained nurse counsellor. After HIVST, respondents underwent blood-based rapid HIV testing as per the national HIV testing algorithm (Determine (Abbot Laboratories), STAT-PAK (Chembio Diagnostic Systems Inc.) and Unigold (Trinity Biotech plc.) and dry blood spots were obtained for DNA/PCR testing. DNA/PCR was considered as the gold-standard HIV testing method. Results After repeat HIVST, 90 (94.7%) tested HIV-negative; 2 (2.1%) tested HIV-positive; and 3 (3.2%) had missing HIV test results. When respondents were subjected to blood-based rapid HIV testing, 97.9% (93/95) tested HIV-negative while 2.1% (2/95) tested HIV-positive. Finally, when the respondents were subjected to DNA/PCR, 99% (94/95) tested HIV-negative while 1.1% (1/95) tested HIV-positive. Conclusions Nearly all initially HIV-negative individuals whose HIVST kits developed a second weak band while in storage or were interpreted as HIV-positive by interviewers were found to be HIV-negative after confirmatory DNA/PCR HIV testing. These findings suggest a need for HIV-negative individuals whose HIVST results change to false positive while under storage or under other sub-optimal conditions to be provided with an option for repeat testing to determine their true HIV status.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background During the initial scale up of ART in sub-Saharan Africa, prescribed regimens included drugs with high potential for toxicity (particularly stavudine). More recently a growing number of patients requires second line treatment due to treatment failure, especially following the expansion of viral load testing. We aim to determine the reasons and risk factors for modification of first line ART across the years. Methods We included patients started on standard first line ART (2NRTI + 1 NNRTI) between 2005 and 2016 at the Infectious Diseases Institute, Kampala, Uganda. We described the reasons for treatment modification categorized in (1) toxicity (2) treatment failure (3) other reason (new TB treatment, new pregnancy). We used Cox proportional hazard to identify factors associated with treatment modification due to toxicity. Results We included 14,261 patients; 9114 (63.9%), were female, the median age was 34 years (IQR: 29–40), 60.8% were in WHO stage 3 and 4. The median BMI and CD4 count were 21.9 (IQR: 19.6–24.8) and 188 cell/µL (IQR: 65–353) respectively; 27.5% were started on stavudine, 46% on zidovudine, and 26.5% on a tenofovir containing regimens. We observed 6248 ART modifications in 4868/14,261 patients (34.1%); 1615 were due to toxicity, 1077 to treatment failure, 1330 to contraindications, and 1860 patients following WHO recommendation of phasing out stavudine and substituting with another NRTI. Modification for drug toxicity declined rapidly after the phase out of stavudine (2008), while switches to second line regimes increased after the implementation of viral load monitoring (2015). Patients with normal BMI compared to underweight, (HR: 0.79, CI 0.69–0.91), with CD4 counts 200–350 cells/µL compared to &lt; 200 cells/µL (HR: 0.81− CI 0.71–0.93), and started on zidovudine (HR: 0.51 CI 0.44–0.59) and tenofovir (HR: 0.16, CI 0.14–0.22) compared to stavudine were less likely to have ART modification due to toxicity. Older patients (HR: 1.14 per 5-year increase CI 1.11–1.18), those in WHO stage 3 and 4 (HR: 1.19, CI 1.06–1.34) were more likely to have ART modification due to toxicity. Conclusions Toxicity as reason for drugs substitution decreased over time mirroring the phase out of stavudine, while viral load expansion identified more patients in need of second line treatment.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in the treatment quality of HIV throughout the world, several countries are still facing numerous obstacles in delivering HIV treatment at a sufficiently high quality, putting patients' lives in jeopardy. The aim of this status article is to give an overview of HIV treatment outcomes in the West African country, Guinea-Bissau, and to assess how newer treatment strategies such as long-acting injectable drugs or an HIV cure may limit or stop the HIV epidemic in this politically unstable and low-resource setting. Several HIV cohorts in Guinea-Bissau have been established and are used as platforms for epidemiological, virological, immunological and clinical studies often with a special focus on HIV-2, which is prevalent in the country. The Bandim Health Project, a demographic surveillance site, has performed epidemiological HIV surveys since 1987 among an urban population in the capital Bissau. The Police cohort, an occupational cohort of police officers, has enabled analyses of persons seroconverting with estimated times of seroconversion among HIV-1 and HIV-2-infected individuals, allowing incidence measurements while the Bissau HIV Cohort and a newer Nationwide HIV Cohort have provided clinical data on large numbers of HIV-infected patients. The HIV cohorts in Guinea-Bissau are unique platforms for research and represent real life in many African countries. Poor adherence, lack of HIV viral load measurements, inadequate laboratory facilities, high rates of loss to follow-up, mortality, treatment failure and resistance development, are just some of the challenges faced putting the goal of \"90-90-90″ for Guinea-Bissau well out of reach by 2020. Maintaining undetectable viral loads on treatment as a prerequisite of a cure strategy seems not possible at the moment. Thinking beyond one-pill-once-a-day, long-acting antiretroviral treatment options such as injectable drugs or implants may be a better treatment option in settings like Guinea-Bissau and may even pave the way for an HIV cure. If the delivery of antiretroviral treatment in sub-Saharan Africa in a sustainable way for the future should be improved by focusing on existing treatment options or through focusing on new treatment options remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background A substantial number of persons living with HIV (PLWH) in Nigeria do not experience durable viral suppression on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Understanding risk factors for first-line treatment failure informs patient monitoring practices and distribution of limited resources for second-line regimens. We determined predictors of immunologic and virologic failures in a large ART delivery program in Abuja, Nigeria. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, a tertiary health care facility, using data from February 2005 to December 2014 in Abuja, Nigeria. All PLWH aged ≥ 15 years who initiated ART with at least 6-month follow-up and one CD4 measurement were included. Immunologic failure was defined as a CD4 decrease to or below pre-ART level or persistent CD4 &lt; 100 cells per mm 3 after 6 months on ART. Virologic failure (VF) was defined as two consecutive HIV-1 RNA levels &gt; 1000 copies/mL after at least 6 months of ART and enhanced adherence counselling. HIV drug resistance (Sanger sequences) was analyzed using the Stanford HIV database algorithm and scored for resistance to common nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Univariate and multivariate log binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Of 12,452 patients followed, a total of 5928 initiated ART with at least 6 months of follow-up and one CD4 measurement. The entry point for 3924 (66.2%) was through the program’s own voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) center, while 1310 (22.1%) were referred from an outside clinic/program, 332 (5.6%) in-patients, and 373 (6.3%) through other entry points including prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and transferred from other programs. The mean CD4 at enrollment in care was 268 ± 23.7 cells per mm 3 , and the mean HIV-1 RNA was 3.3 ± 1.3.log 10 copies/mL. A total of 3468 (80.5%) received nevirapine (NVP) and 2260 (19.5%) received efavirenz (EFV)—based regimens. A total of 2140 (36.1%) received tenofovir (TDF); 2662 (44.9%) zidovudine (AZT); and 1126 (19.0%) stavudine (d4T). Among those receiving TDF, 45.0% also received emtricitabine (FTC). In a multivariate model, immunologic failure was more common among PLWH with female gender as compared to male [RR (95% CI) 1.22 (1.07–1.40)] and less common among those who entered care at the program’s VCT center as compared to other entry points [0.79 (0.64–0.91)], WHO stage 3/4 as compared to 1/2 [0.19 (0.16–0.22)], or CD4 200 + cells per mm 3 as compared to lower [0.19 (0.16–0.22)]. Virologic failure was more common among PLWH who entered care at the program’s VCT center as compared to other entry points [RR (95% CI) 1.45 (1.11–1.91) and those with CD4 &lt; 200 cells per mm 3 at entry into care as compared to higher [1.71 (1.36–2.16)]. Of 198 patient-derived samples sequenced during virologic failure, 42 (21%) were wild-type; 145 (73%) carried NNRTI drug resistance mutations; 151 (76.3%) M184I/V; 29 (14.6%) had ≥ 3 TAMs, and 37 (18.7%) had K65R, of whom all were on TDF-containing first-line regimens. Conclusions In this cohort of Nigerian PLWH followed for a period of 9 years, immunologic criteria poorly predicted virologic failure. Furthermore, a subset of samples showed that patients failing ART for extended periods of time had HIV-1 strains harboring drug resistance mutations.",

We aimed to examine the association between peer education, HIV risk perception, and HIV testing uptake, as well as to evaluate the mediated effect of HIV risk perception in the relationship between peer education and HIV testing uptake. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 1188 HIV-uninfected or unknown participants from populations of men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSWs), and drug users (DUs) in seven cities of China. Partial correlation analysis and regression analysis were employed to examine the associations among peer education, HIV risk perception, and HIV testing uptake. Mediation analysis was conducted to assess whether HIV risk perception mediated the hypothesized association. Results Receiving peer education was associated with higher odds of HIV testing uptake among MSM, FSWs and DUs. Perceiving risk of HIV infection was associated with higher odds of HIV testing uptake among MSM and DUs. Among MSM, the relationship between peer education and HIV testing uptake was mediated by moderate risk perception of HIV (indirect effect: 0.53, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.21), and by high risk perception of HIV (indirect effect: 0.50, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.17). Among DUs, the relationship between peer education and HIV testing uptake was mediated by moderate risk perception of HIV (indirect effect: 1.80, 95% CI 0.57 to 3.45). Conclusions Participants who received peer education tended to perceive their risk of HIV infection, which in turn was associated with increased HIV testing uptake among MSM and DUs. Therefore, in addition to peer education interventions, more report about HIV epidemic and risk assessment should also be scaled up to enhance HIV risk perception among key populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Prior studies have suggested that HAART initiation may vary by race/ethnicity. Utilizing the U.S. military healthcare system, which minimizes confounding from healthcare access, we analyzed whether timing of HAART initiation and the appropriate initiation of primary prophylaxis among those at high risk for pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) varies by race/ethnicity. Methods Participants in the U.S. Military HIV Natural History Study from 1998-2009 who had not initiated HAART before 1998 and who, based on DHHS guidelines, had a definite indication for HAART (CD4 &lt;200, AIDS event or severe symptoms; Group A), an indication to consider HAART (including CD4 &lt;350; Group B) or electively started HAART (CD4 &gt;350; Group C) were analyzed for factors associated with HAART initiation. In a secondary analysis, participants were also evaluated for factors associated with starting primary PCP prophylaxis within four months of a CD4 count &lt;200 cells/mm 3 . Multiple logistic regression was used to compare those who started vs. delayed therapy; comparisons were expressed as odds ratios (OR). Results 1262 participants were evaluated in the analysis of HAART initiation (A = 208, B = 637, C = 479 [62 participants were evaluated in both Groups A and B]; 94% male, 46% African American, 40% Caucasian). Race/ethnicity was not associated with HAART initiation in Groups A or B. In Group C, African American race/ethnicity was associated with lower odds of initiating HAART (OR 0.49, p = 0.04). Race and ethnicity were also not associated with the initiation of primary PCP prophylaxis among the 408 participants who were at risk. Conclusions No disparities in the initiation of HAART or primary PCP prophylaxis according to race/ethnicity were seen among those with an indication for therapy. Among those electively initiating HAART at the highest CD4 cell counts, African American race/ethnicity was associated with decreased odds of starting. This suggests that free healthcare can potentially overcome some of the observed disparities in HIV care, but that unmeasured factors may contribute to differences in elective care decisions.",

The ISS-HIV symptom scale was developed by an Italian working team including researchers, physicians and people living with HIV. The development process went through the following steps: (1) review of HIV/AIDS literature; (2) focus group; (3) pre-test analysis; (4) scale validation. The 22 symptoms of HIV-ISS symptoms scale were clustered in five factors: pain/general discomfort (7 items); depression/anxiety (4 items); emotional reaction/psychological distress (5 items); gastrointestinal discomfort (4 items); sexual discomfort (2 items). The internal consistence reliability was for all factors within the minimum accepted standard of 0.70. The results of this study provide a preliminary evidence of the reliability and validity of the ISS-HIV symptoms scale. In the new era where HIV infection has been transformed into a chronic diseases and patients are experiencing a complex range of symptoms, the ISS-HIV symptoms scale may represent an useful tool for a comprehensive symptom assessment with the advantage of being easy to fill out by patients and potentially attractive to physicians mainly because it is easy to understand and requires short time to interpret the results.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy in the reduction of sexually transmitted HIV infections. The prolonged use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) co-formulation (TDF/FTC), however, may result in augmented risk of renal toxicity. We aimed to evaluate changes in the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) in a real-world population setting of participants enrolled in PrEP Brazil , a 48-week prospective, open-label, demonstration study to assess the feasibility of daily oral TDF/FTC used by men who have sex with men and transgender women at high-risk of HIV infection, all over 18 years old. Methods Kidney function was assessed by serial measurement of serum creatinine and eGFR with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) formula on weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Adherence to PrEP was assessed by dosing TDF concentration in dried blood spots at weeks 4 and 48, measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or mass spectrometry. Results Of 392 participants completing the 48-week follow-up protocol with TDF blood detectable levels and eGFR measures, 43.1% were young adults, of Caucasian ethnic background (57.9%), with BMI below 30 kg/m 2 , without arterial hypertension. At screening, median eGFR was 93.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . At week 4 follow-up, 90 (23% of the study population) participants presented reductions in eGFR greater than 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as compared to baseline eGFR, some as large as 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , but with no clinical outcomes (adverse events and renal adverse events) severe enough to demand TDF/FTC discontinuation. A negative relationship was observed between TDF blood levels and eGFR at weeks 4 (r = − 0.005; p &lt; 0.01) and 48 (r = − 0.006; p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions These results suggest that the renal function profile in individuals on TDF/FTC may be assessed on week 4 and then only annually, allowing a more flexible medical follow-up in primary care centers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Routine screening for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) facilitates early diagnosis and treatment, thereby preventing morbidity and onward transmission. We estimated the prevalence of prior HIV/STI testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in Bangkok, Thailand, and identified factors associated with prior testing. Methods Cross-sectional analyses were performed using data collected at enrollment into an HIV incidence cohort. From April to October 2017, MSM and TGW were enrolled if they were aged 18–35 years, reported anal intercourse with a male or TGW partner, and reported behavioral vulnerability to HIV. Participants answered questions about demographics, sexual behaviors, and lifetime HIV/STI testing history. Multivariable robust Poisson regression was used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors potentially associated with prior testing. Results Among 1,014 participants, 348 (34.3%) were TGW and the median age was 21.6 (interquartile range 20.0-24.8) years. Prior testing for HIV was reported by 421 (41.5%) and for other STIs by 268 (26.4%). HIV testing was more common among participants aged ≥ 22 years (RR 1.37 [95% CI 1.13–1.67]), with college education as compared to secondary or less (RR 1.37 [95% CI 1.08–1.72]), and who met male sexual partners online (RR 1.52 [95% CI 1.24–1.85]), but lower among participants attracted to both men and women as compared to men only (RR 0.64 [95% CI 0.51–0.81]) and who met male sexual partners in bars (RR 0.83 [95% CI 0.72–0.97]). Similar associations were observed with prior testing for other STIs, including increased testing among participants with college education (RR 1.52 [95% CI 1.11–2.09]) and who met male sexual partners online (RR 1.73 [95% CI 1.30–2.31]), but lower among participants attracted to both men and women (RR 0.70 [95% CI 0.51–0.96]) and who met male sexual partners in bars (RR 0.67 [95% CI 0.54–0.83]). Conclusions Despite behavioral vulnerability, prior testing for HIV and other STIs was uncommon. Online engagement strategies may be effectively reaching Thai MSM and TGW who meet sexual partners online, but new interventions are needed to encourage testing among younger, less educated, and bisexual MSM and TGW.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background There is no other better way to safeguard an infant’s health in the first 6 months of life than exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). Breast milk is valuable in all aspects of an infant’s physical and mental growth as well as immune development. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with EBF practice among HIV-infected mothers in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Method A hospital-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among lactating HIV-infected mothers. A random sampling procedure was used to obtain 372 HIV-infected mothers of infants from 6 to 12 months of age who were still breastfeeding at the time of data collection. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with EBF practice. Statistical package for social science (SPSS volume 20) software was used for data entry and analysis. Results The prevalence of EBF practice was 58.1% at 95% Confidence Interval of 52.9% to 63.1%. More than half of the respondents 199 (53.5%) had adequate knowledge while 173(46.5%) had inadequate knowledge about EBF. After adjusting for confounders, factors associated with EBF practice were knowledge about EBF [Adequate knowledge (AOR = 5.11 at 95% CI 3.2–8.17, p &lt; 0.001)], ANC visits [Adequate (AOR = 1.76 at 95% CI 1.09–2.82, p = 0.002)], Income per day [1 0r more USD (AOR = 1.83 at 95% CI 1.14–2.94, p = 0.013)], positive perception of EBF [ positive perception (AOR = 3.51 at 95% CI 2.25–5.47, p &lt; 0.001) and having ever experienced a breast problem AOR = 3.91 at 95% CI 1.89–8.08, p &lt; 0.001. Conclusion More than half of interviewed mothers with HIV practiced EBF. The EBF practice among HIV lactating mothers was significantly influenced by adequate knowledge of EBF, positive perception toward EBF, adequate ANC visits, and having never experienced breast problems. Strengthening adherence to ANC routine visits, counseling on breastfeeding, and improving mothers’ knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding would contribute to the enhancement of EBF practice in this region. An innovative interventional study is recommended to develop more effective strategies to improve EBF knowledge and practice among HIV-infected mothers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Although Ethiopia is endemic to viral hepatitis and HIV, data that could guide population-specific interventions are limited. In this study, we determined the seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and assessed their associations with HIV-1 viral load suppression among HIV-1 infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at Mekelle hospital in northern Ethiopia. Methods Between February and April 2020, blood samples were collected from 439 participants. Samples were screened for HBsAg and anti-HCV on the immunochromatographic test and confirmed using the Enzyme-Linked Immuno-sorbent assay (Beijing Wantai Co. China). HIV-1 viral load was quantified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the Abbott platform. Binary and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify potential predictors. Results Overall, 10% (44/439) and 3.6% (16/439) of the participants were coinfected with HBV and HCV, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, being illiterate (AOR = 6.57; 95% CI 1.04–41.6), and having a history of sexually transmitted infections (AOR = 4.44; 95% CI 1.31–15.0) and multiple sexual partners (AOR = 29.9; 95% CI 7.82–114.8) were associated with HBV infection. On the other hand, participants with a history of chronic non-communicable diseases (AOR = 10.6, 95% CI 1.61–70.1), and those reporting a history of sexually transmitted infections (AOR = 5.21, 95% CI 1.39–19.5) were more likely to be infected with HCV. In further analysis, HCV infection status was significantly associated with decreased viral load suppression rate (AOR = 7.14; 95% CI 2.18–23.3) whereas no significant association was observed with the HBV infection. Conclusions The HBV coinfection rate in our study is high and, as per WHO's standard, corresponds to a hyperendemic level. The HCV coinfection rate is also substantially high and urges attention given its influence on the viral load suppression of HIV patients on ART at our study site. Our findings suggest the need to adopt universal screening and vaccination of people with HIV against HBV and screening for HCV at our study site and in Ethiopia at large, which contributes to Ethiopia's progress towards the 2030 global target of reducing the HBV infection.",

    "abstract": "Substance use among people living with HIV is associated with poor health, social, and psychological outcomes. This study assessed the prevalence of substance use and associated factors among youth attending HIV care and treatment centers (CTCs) in Dodoma, Tanzania.This cross-sectional study was carried out in Dodoma, Tanzania, from February to April 2020 among youth aged 15-24 attending HIV CTCs. Data was collected using sociodemographic, WHO ASSIST Version 3.0, BDI II, and SERAD questionnaires. Data analysis was done using Stata 17. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize continuous and categorical variables. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine factors independently associated with substance use.The prevalence of substance use was relatively low (6.6%). Older youth (20 to 24 years) were 2% less likely to use substances compared to the younger ones (15 to 19 years) (AOR: 0.07; 95% CI 0.01, 0.83). There were statistically significant decreasing odds of substance use with every year increase in age at HIV diagnosis (OR: 1.66; 95% CI 1.14, 2.41). Being unemployed was statistically significantly associated with decreased odds of substance use among this population (OR: 0.03; 95% CI 0.02, 0.33). Youth who had detectable viral loads were significantly more likely to use substances compared to those with undetectable viral loads (AOR: 12.9; 95% CI 1.07, 156.05).Despite the low prevalence of substance use found in this study, it is important to note that late age of HIV diagnosis, employment, and detectable viral load negatively impacted HIV positive youth with regards to substance use. It is recommended that CTCs emphasize routine screening for substance use among youth who have detectable viral loads.",

Therefore we have investigated anti-HIV antibody levels in 80 patients treated with HAART during chronic HIV-1 infection, who had an undetectable HIV-1 plasma viral load for at least five years.

This study investigated attitudinal motivators and barriers to the use of self-injectable antiretroviral agents among physicians and patients and measured the degree of concordance between physician and patient perspectives. Attitudes toward prescribing and usage of self-injectable antiretroviral therapy (SIAT) were assessed by structured interview in 2 cohorts sampled from the European Union and the USA: 499 HIV-treating physicians and 603 treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients. Motivators and barriers to prescribing SIAT were identified from statistical analysis of the associations between physicians' ratings of enfuvirtide-based therapy compared to standard oral-based therapy and 2 indicators of enfuvirtide prescribing behavior. Patients' attitudes were assessed by their responses to a written profile of enfuvirtide and their ratings of the likelihood of accepting a treatment offer. Both indicators of SIAT prescribing behavior were predicted by the same pattern of physician beliefs. Nonprescribing was associated with: (1) the belief that offering enfuvirtide would be perceived negatively by patients, leading to treatment refusal and nonadherence; (2) the belief that prescribing enfuvirtide is harder to justify in terms of time/resources; and (3) a lack of confidence in the efficacy and use of enfuvirtide in practice (all p < 0.05). However, physicians' beliefs were not in concordance with patients' views. After reading a profile of enfuvirtide, 76% patients said that they would be moderately or highly likely to accept a treatment offer, although most (72%) had not discussed enfuvirtide with their doctor. Patients' beliefs predicted the likelihood of accepting enfuvirtide. Physician and patient beliefs about SIAT influence prescribing behavior and compliance yet may not be concordant, with patients having more positive attitudes towards SIAT than anticipated by physicians.",

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been shown to increase CD4 T-cell numbers mainly by expanding CD4 cells and by prolonging their half-lives. HIV-infected patients previously enrolled into A328 had been randomized to antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone or ART followed by IL-2. In A5051, 53 patients from A328 who had previously received IL-2 were allowed to continue IL-2 for an additional 80 weeks; 27 patients who had received ART alone received IL-2 for 80 weeks.The patients previously receiving IL-2 continued to have elevated CD4 levels with extended use of IL-2. The prior ART-alone recipients had increases in CD4 levels to comparable levels as the prior IL-2 recipients (median 804 versus 847 cells/mm3 at week 72; 60% versus 9% had >50% increase in A5051 to week 72, p < 0.001). Those who had previously received IL-2 required fewer IL-2 cycles to maintain their CD4 T-cell counts compared to those newly initiating IL-2. The treatments were well tolerated with no significant differences in toxicity or discontinuations between those newly versus previously receiving IL-2.

The production of generic ART has greatly influenced the decline in drug prices and the increased in ART access. Generic ART has good pharmacokinetic profile, safety and efficacy. Toxicity is however the main cause for ART discontinuation. Several dose reduction studies have shown adequate pharmacokinetic parameters and short term efficacy with reduced dose ART.

We characterized RRE sequences from 13 HIV-1 infected individuals from North India which also included two mother-child pairs following vertical transmission. We observed high degree of conservation of sequences, including the 9-nt (CACUAUGGG) long sequence in stem-loop B, required for efficient binding of Rev protein. All of our 13 RRE sequences possessed G to A (position 66) mutation located in the critical branched-stem-loop B which is not present in consensus C or B sequence. We derived a consensus RRE structure which showed interesting changes in the stem-loop structures including the stem-loop B. Mother-Child RRE sequences showed conservation of unique polymorphisms as well as some new mutations in child RRE sequences. Despite these changes, the ability to form multiple essential stem-loop structures required for Rev binding was conserved. RRE RNA derived from one of the samples, VT5, retained the ability to bind Rev protein under in vitro conditions although it showed alternate secondary structure. This is the first study from India describing the structural and possible functional implications due to very unique RRE sequence heterogeneity and its possible role in vertical transmission and gene expression.",

Seventeen percent of women were seropositive for HCV. Factors significantly associated with HCV seropositivity in bivariate analyses among non-IDU women were partner IDU+ [Prevalence ratio (PR): 4.5 (95% CI: 1.4, 14.2)], and partner HCV+ [PR: 7.2 (95% CI: 1.8, 29.5)].

    "abstract": "As second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) becomes more accessible in resource-limited settings (RLS), the need for more affordable monitoring tools such as point-of-care viral load assays and simplified genotypic HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) tests increases substantially. The prohibitive expenses of genotypic HIVDR assays could partly be addressed by focusing on a smaller region of the HIV reverse transcriptase gene (RT) that encompasses the majority of HIVDR mutations for people on ART in RLS. In this study, an in silico analysis of 125,329 RT sequences was performed to investigate the effect of submitting short RT sequences (codon 41 to 238) to the commonly used virco®TYPE and Stanford genotype interpretation tools. Pair-wise comparisons between full-length and short RT sequences were performed. Additionally, a non-inferiority approach with a concordance limit of 95% and two-sided 95% confidence intervals was used to demonstrate concordance between HIVDR calls based on full-length and short RT sequences. The results of this analysis showed that HIVDR interpretations based on full-length versus short RT sequences, using the Stanford algorithms, had concordance significantly above 95%. When using the virco®TYPE algorithm, similar concordance was demonstrated (>95%), but some differences were observed for d4T, AZT and TDF, where predictions were affected in more than 5% of the sequences. Most differences in interpretation, however, were due to shifts from fully susceptible to reduced susceptibility (d4T) or from reduced response to minimal response (AZT, TDF) or vice versa, as compared to the predicted full RT sequence. The virco®TYPE prediction uses many more mutations outside the RT 41-238 amino acid domain, which significantly contribute to the HIVDR prediction for these 3 antiretroviral agents. This study illustrates the acceptability of using a shortened RT sequences (codon 41-238) to obtain reliable genotype interpretations by virco®TYPE and Stanford algorithms. Implementation of this simplified protocol could significantly reduce the cost of both resistance testing and ARV treatment monitoring in RLS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Several lines of evidence suggest that retinoids (retinol-ROL or vitamin A, and its active metabolites, retinoic acids-RAs) play important pathogenic roles in HIV infection and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-related events. We previously reported that antiretrovirals alter RAs synthesis in vitro . We hypothesised that in vivo serum retinoid concentrations are affected by both cART and HIV infection. This might explain several clinical and laboratory abnormalities reported in HIV-infected patients receiving cART. Methods The effects of optimal cART and chronic HIV on serum retinoids were firstly assessed longitudinally in 10 HIV-infected adults (group1 = G1): twice while on optimal cART (first, during long-term and second, during short term cART) and twice during 2 cART interruptions when HIV viral load (VL) was detectable. Retinoid concentrations during optimal long term cART in G1 were compared with cross-sectional results from 12 patients (G2) with suboptimal cART (detectable VL) and from 28 healthy adults (G3). Serum retinoids were measured by HPLC with ultraviolet detection. Retinoid concentrations were correlated with VL, CD4 + T- cell count and percentages, CD8 + 38 + fluorescence, triglycerides, cholesterol and C-peptide serum levels. Results During optimal cART, G1 participants had drastically reduced RAs (0.5 ± 0.3 μg/dL; P &lt; 0.01) but the highest ROL (82 ± 3.0 μg/dL) concentrations. During cART interruptions in these patients, RAs slightly increased whereas ROL levels diminished significantly (P &lt; 0.05). G3 had the highest RAs levels (7.2 ± 1.1 μg/dL) and serum ROL comparable to values in North Americans. Serum ROL was decreased in G2 (37.7 ± 3.2 μg/dL; P &lt; 0.01). No correlations were noted between RA and ROL levels or between retinoid concentrations and CD4 + T- cell count, CD8 + 38 + fluorescence, VL. ROL correlated with triglycerides and cholesterol in G1 (r s = 0.8; P = 0.01). Conclusions Serum RAs levels are significantly diminished by cART, whereas ROL concentrations significantly decreased during uncontrolled HIV infection but augmented with optimal cART. These alterations in retinoid concentrations may affect the expression of retinoid-responsive genes involved in metabolic, hormonal and immune processes and be responsible for some adverse events observed in HIV-infected persons treated with antiretrovirals. Further studies should assess concomitant serum and intracellular retinoid levels in different clinical situations in larger, homogenous populations.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is the result of biological events that progressively and irreversibly compromise the function of vital organs and eventually result in death. There is a general perception that ageing is accelerated in people living with HIV, with an increasing body of evidence to support this view. With the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy, the life expectancy of people living with HIV has improved. Since people with HIV are living longer than previously, while also ageing faster than the general population, there is an increase in HIV-positive patients living with age-related comorbidities. This brief overview of ageing and HIV discusses aspects of the complications of HIV infection as they impact the ageing process. How diseases of age affect patients with HIV provides clues to help unravel the interactions between HIV and ageing that ultimately should help clinicians understand the basis of ‘normal’ ageing and manage ageing HIV-positive patients more effectively.",

Blood lipid profile did not change significantly in either the global population or patients with HC. After a median observation of 17 months (IQR 13–20), 59 (25.3%) patients discontinued DRV/c, of which 13 were in DT. The durability DT resulted higher than that of triple therapy (log-rank test p = 0.01). Main reasons for stopping DRV/c were simplification (15 patients), adverse events (13 patients), planned discontinuation for treatment initiation with DAA (4 patients), treatment failure (2 patients); death (2 patients), other causes (10 patients). Twenty-six were lost to follow-up. DRV/c was safe and well tolerated. Dual therapies showed a better profile of tolerability and a longer durability compared to triple therapies.",

However, the antibody levels were higher in the four doses and four double doses groups. This study followed those patients for at least 3 years and aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the three vaccination regimens. Methods HIV-infected adults who had CD4+ cell counts &gt; 200 cells/mm 3 , undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, and negative for all hepatitis B virus markers were randomly assigned to receive one of three recombinant vaccines (Hepavax-Gene ® Berna, Korea) regimens: 20 μg IM at months 0, 1, and 6 (standard doses group, n = 44), 20 μg IM at months 0, 1, 2, 6 (four doses group, n = 44), or 40 μg IM at months 0, 1, 2, and 6 (four double doses group, n = 44) between February 2011 and May 4, 2012. Of 132 participants, 126 were evaluated from August 2015 to January 2016; 42 in the standard doses, 43 in the four doses, and 41 in the four double doses groups. Results At a median duration of 49.7 months (range 46.7–53.7) after completion of the primary vaccination schedule, the percentages of responders with anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL were 57.1% (95% CI 41.5–72.8%) in the standard doses group; 76.7% (95% CI 63.6–89.9%) in the four doses group ( P = 0.067 vs. the standard doses group); and 80.5% (95% CI 67.8–93.2%) in the four double doses group ( P = 0.033 vs. the standard doses group). Factors associated with a responder were the vaccination schedule (either four doses or four double doses groups) and a younger age. Conclusions Despite the highly effectiveness of the standard hepatitis B vaccination regimen at 6 months after completion, the long-term immunogenicity was lower than the four double doses regimen among HIV-infected adults with CD4+ cell counts &gt; 200 cells/mm 3 and undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA. The standard vaccination regimen may not be the best strategy to provide long-term immune response against hepatitis B virus among HIV-infected individuals.

Methods Logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with HIVDR. Variables associated with drug resistance in multivariable logistic regression were included in the Cochran–Armitage test for trend. Results A total of 11,976 patients were enrolled in the study. The prevalence of HIVDR among patients who received ART for 9–24 months during 2003–2008, 2009–2012, and 2013–2015 significantly decreased (15.5%, 6.3%, and 2.3%, respectively, P &lt; 0.01).

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives For migrant female sex workers (FSWs) at the Sino-Vietnamese border, the impact of work time in their current location on the spread of HIV/AIDS is not clear. Methods Data were collected from the Sino-Vietnamese border cities of Guangxi, China. Migrant FSWs working in these cities were studied. FSWs who worked less than 6 months in their current location were assigned to the short-term work group (ST FSWs), and FSWs who worked equal to or longer than 6 months in their current location were assigned to the long-term work group (LT FSWs). Logistic regression was performed to examine the impact of work time in the current location and factors associated with HIV infection. Results Among the 1667 migrant FSWs, 586 (35.2%) and 1081 (64.9%) were assigned to the ST FSW and LT FSW groups, respectively. Compared to LT FSWs, ST FSWs were more likely to be of Vietnamese nationality, be less than 18 years old when they first engaged in commercial sex work, and have a low-level of HIV-related knowledge and had higher odds of using condoms inconsistently, having more male clients, having no regular male clients, and having a history of male clients who used aphrodisiacs but lower odds of receiving free condoms distribution and education/HIV counselling and testing programme. The analysis of factors associated with HIV infection revealed that Vietnamese FSWs, less than 18 years old when they first engaged in commercial sex work, having no regular male clients, and having lower average charge per sex transaction were correlated with HIV infection. Conclusion FSWs with short-term work at the Sino-Vietnamese border had a higher risk of risky sex and were correlated with HIV risk factors. Vietnamese FSWs were at higher risk of HIV infection, and they were more likely to have short-term work. More targeted HIV prevention should be designed for new FSWs who recently began working in a locality to further control the spread of HIV, particularly cross-border FSWs.",

    "abstract": "About 13 years since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children living with HIV (CLHIV) in Zambia, HIV/AIDS testing and treatment guidelines for children have evolved over the years with limited documentation of long-term trends in the numbers testing HIV positive and initiating ART. We examined trends in HIV testing and ART initiation in Zambia. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected patient level data from 496 health facilities across Zambia. We used Poisson regression to derive incident rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for background characteristics and used a Cuzick non-parametric test for trends to test the 13-year trends. Median time from testing to ART initiation in days and incidence rates were derived using life tables in survival analysis. We used multi-level random effects Poisson regression model to determine variations in time from HIV testing to ART initiation by facility. Overall, the cumulative proportion of the children who tested positive and initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART for HIV) from 2004 to 2017 was 69% (n = 99 592). During the period under review proportions of ART initiation increased from 52% in 2004–2006 to 97% in 2016–2017 (P < 0.001) and time from testing to ART initiation reduced from a median of 17 days IQR (1–161) in 2004 to one day IQR (1–14), P < 0.001 in 2016–2017. CLHIV were 15 times more likely to be initiated on ART in 2016-17 compared to period 2004-6 (IRR = 15.2, 95% CI 14.7–15.7). Time to ART initiation increased with age and was higher in rural health facilities compared to urban facilities. About 11% of the variability in time to ART initiation in children could be attributed to differences between facilities. The substantial increase in ART initiation and reduction in time to ART initiation among CLHIV identified in this study, reflects improvements in the paediatric HIV programme in Zambia in relation to health care delivery and adherence to national testing and treatment guidelines that were adapted from WHO guidelines. However, age-related differentials in rates of ART initiation suggests that urgent interventions are needed to sustain and further improve programme performance.",

Methods The retrospective cohort was conducted among 6757 HIV/AIDS patients on ART (2NRTIs + 1NNRTI, 2NRTIs + 1PI and Single or two drugs) recruited in Guigang city, Guangxi, China, from January 2004 to December 2018. Participants were divided into ADE and non-ADE groups, and were followed-up every six months to observe treatment outcomes. Comparison of mortality between groups was performed using the log-rank test and Kaplan–Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to explore the risk factors of mortality. 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance confounding factors and adjust the mortality risk. Results Of 6757 participants with 29,096.06 person-years of follow-up, 16.86% (1139/6757) belonged to ADE group while the others (83.14%) belonged to the non-ADE group. The most common cause of death by ADE was disseminated mycosis (31.65%), followed by recurrent severe bacterial pneumonia (28.48%), herpes zoster (17.72%), and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (8.86%). The mortality of the ADE group was significantly higher than that of the non-ADE group [3.45/100 person-years (95% CI 2.92–3.97) vs. 2.34/100 person-years (95% CI 2.15–2.52), P &lt;0.001]. The death risk of the ADE group was also higher than that of the non- ADE group [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.291, 95% CI 1.061–1.571, P = 0.011], which was confirmed by PSM analysis (aHR = 1.581, 95% CI 1.192–2.099, P = 0.002). Cox analysis indicated that ADE, older age, male gender, previous non-use of cotrimoxazole, advanced WHO clinical stage, and low baseline CD4 + cell count were the risk factors for death. Conclusions Even on ART, the mortality risk of HIV positive individuals with ADE was higher than those without ADE. Active testing, earlier diagnosis, and timely therapy with ART may reduce the death risk of ADE.",

We present a patient that developed HLS and was able to be diagnosed efficiently with the help of an academic research institute of immunology. Case presentation A 21 years old male Mexican with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), late presenter; who developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and a disseminated histoplasmosis-related HLS, as part of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The patient required a long course of corticotherapy, intravenous immunoglobulin and massive transfusions (more than 10 units in 24 h, and a total of 83 units), besides amphotericin-B and ganciclovir treatment. An academic research institute of immunology aided in the accurate diagnosis of HLS with the implementation of tests not available within the hospital, thus improving the care provided to the patient. The patient recovered, was discharged, and continue to improve. Conclusion The objective of this report is to highlight the importance of having multidisciplinary support, including basic medical sciences groups providing specific tests that are sometimes very difficult to get, which provides a benefit to patients in the well-aimed diagnosis as part of applied translational medicine.",

The objective of this study was to describe the trends in prevalence of Diarrhoea, Bacterial pneumonia, Kaposi's sarcoma, Malaria and Geohelminths among HIV positive individuals over a 12 year period in Uganda.Observation data for 5972 HIV positive individuals enrolled with the AIDS support organisation (TASO) in Uganda were analysed. Study participants were drawn from three HIV clinics located in different geographical areas of Uganda and followed from January 2002 to December 2013. The prevalence trends for the above OIs were plotted using the Box Jenkins moving average technique. X (2)-test for trend was used to test for the significance of the trends and Pearson's correlation coefficient used to test for the strength of linear relationship between OI prevalence and calendar time. Mixed effect linear regression was used to estimate average monthly change in prevalence with monthly variation modelled as a random effect.A total of 204,871 monthly medical reports were retrieved and analysed. 73 % (4301/5972) were female with a median age of 32 years (inter-quartile range 26-39). Overall, significant decreasing mean annual prevalence trends (p < 0.05, X(2) trend) were observed for Diarrhoea (<1 month) with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r = -0.89), Malaria (r = -0.75), Bacterial Pneumonia (r = -0.52), and Geohelminth (r = -0.32). Non-significant increasing mean annual prevalence trend was observed for Kaposis sarcoma (p = 0.20, X(2) trend; r = +0.26). After adjusting for age, sex and clinic in a mixed effects linear regression model, average monthly prevalence declined significantly at a rate of 0.4 % for Kaposis sarcoma, 0.3 % for Geohelminths, 2 % for Malaria, 1 % for Bacterial Pneumonia and 3 % for Diarrhoea(<1 month). However, the rate of decline per month differed significantly (p < 0.05) by HIV clinic for Diarrhoea (<1 month), and age, sex and clinic for malaria.Overall, decreasing trends were observed in the above OIs. However the trends differed significantly by OI, geographical location and demographic characteristics. There is urgent need to integrate interventions targeting malaria and geohelminths in HIV programmes.",

    "abstract": "An HIV-1 tropism test is recommended prior to CCR5 antagonist administration to exclude patients harboring non-R5 virus from treatment with this class of antiretrovirals. HIV-1 tropism determination based on proviral DNA (pvDNA) may be useful in individuals with plasma viral RNA suppression. We developed a genotypic tropism assay for pvDNA and assessed its performance in a retrospective analysis of samples collected longitudinally. We randomly selected paired plasma/PBMC samples from the Women's Interagency HIV Study with plasma viral load ≥5,000 cp/mL at time 1 (T1), undetectable viral load maintained for ≥1 year and CD4+ >200 cells/μL at time 2 (T2). pvDNA was isolated from cryopreserved PBMCs. Sequences were analyzed in triplicate from 49/50 women, with tropism assigned using the geno2pheno (g2p) algorithm. The median time between T1 and T2 was 4.1 years. CXCR4-using virus was detected in 24% of the RNA samples and 33% of the pvDNA samples at T1, compared to 37% of the pvDNA samples at T2. Concordance between plasma RNA and pvDNA tropism was 88% at T1 and 80% at T2. The g2p scores for RNA (T1) vs DNA (T1, T2) were strongly correlated (Spearman rho: 0.85 (T1); 0.78 (T2)). In women with evidence of tropism switch at T2 (either R5 to non-R5 or non-R5 to R5), there was a correlation between change in tropism and time. Mean pvDNA viral load decreased by 0.4 log10 copies/106 cells between T1 and T2 (p < 0.0001), but this decrease was not significantly associated with tropism status. We demonstrated that pvDNA tropism in women with HIV-1 suppression is concordant with prior RNA tropism results, even after a median time of >4 years. pvDNA tropism testing may be useful to determine eligibility of patients with viral suppression to switch to a CCR5-antagonist based regimen as well as for research purposes.",

CD5-negative T cell clones respond preferentially over their CD5(+) counterparts against cells with low human histocompatibility-linked leukocyte antigen (HLA) levels. In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, CD5(-)CD8(+) T cells increase in prevalence with disease progression.To investigate potential causes of this expansion of CD5(-)CD8(+) T cells in HIV-1 infection, we compared CD5 expression on CD8(+) T cells reactive against HIV-1 peptides, common viral peptides and a self peptide that together span a broad range of TCR avidities in the context of the common HLA-A2 class I restriction molecule. Following stimulation, CD5 expression on peptide-specific CD8(+) T cells was assessed by flow cytometry.In healthy controls, there was no significant difference in the CD5(+) percentage of CD8(+) T cells specific for common viral peptides, but a lower percentage of those responding against a common self peptide expressed CD5. The same relationship occurred in HIV-infected individuals, however, a lower percentage of HIV peptide-specific CD8(+) T cells than other viral peptide-specific CD8(+) T cells expressed CD5. In terms of overall CD5 expression level at the peptide-specific responder population level, HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells resembled those responsive against the self peptide, despite much higher avidity TCR/HLA/peptide interactions.This deficit in CD5 expression selective for HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells is consistent with in vivo adaptation to low avidity HIV peptide variants and has potential consequences for CD8(+) T cell expansion, cross-reactivity and autoreactivity.",

    "abstract": "In 1983, during the earliest days of AIDS research, Deborah Anderson and her colleagues in Boston, Massachusetts hypothesized that AIDS was transmitted by virally-infected Trojan horse leukocytes in semen [1]. This prediction has been supported by numerous studies over the past two decades, although many questions remain concerning HIV infection of the male genital tract. In this issue of AIDS Research and Therapy, the Anderson group presents an important research tool to help address some of the critical unanswered questions in this area [2].\r\n\r\nA series of salient studies have shaped current concepts on HIV-1 in semen. In 1984, Ho et al. described retroviral particles and infected cells in the semen of a homosexual man with AIDS [3]. Shortly thereafter Stewart et al. reported infection of four out of eight women following artificial insemination with semen from one seroconverting individual [4], leading to a mandatory semen quarantine requirement and HIV testing of semen donors in Assisted Reproduction clinics. At that time, the detection of HIV, which was still termed HTLV-III, was not routinely feasible from blood, let alone from semen. Since then, technological advances have enabled the detection and quantitation of HIV-1 RNA and proviral DNA and greatly improved our understanding of the dynamics of HIV-1 in semen and sexual transmission risks. HIV-infected white blood cells have been detected throughout the male genital tract, and in preejaculatory fluid and semen from HIV+men [5,8]; the weight of evidence suggests that sperm are not infectious [9], leading to the successful development of sperm wash procedures to reduce the risk of HIV transmission from HIV-infected men to uninfected partners through assisted reproduction techniques [10]. A combination of epidemiological and clinical research studies have determined a relationship between HIV-1 RNA viral load in semen and the risk of sexual transmission. The most important factors associated with increased HIV viral loads in semen and risk of sexual transmission are: HIV-viremia and coinfections with other sexually transmitted pathogens [11,12]. HAART dramatically suppresses HIV-1 RNA viral loads in blood and semen, but HIV-1 proviral DNA can persist in semen WBCs for months after the initiation of HAART [13]. Data from other studies showing discordantly higher levels of HIV in semen than blood in some individuals support this finding. In addition, molecular sequencing studies indicate that the male genital tract is a compartment, like the central nervous system, in which HIV-1 replication and divergent evolution can occur under the influence of local factors [14]. Several clinically important questions remain: 1) Is HIV-1 primarily sexually transmitted by infected cells, cell-free virus or both? 2) What is the origin of cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 in semen? 3) Are men on HAART with undetectable peripheral viral loads capable of sexually transmitting drug-resistant HIV-1?\r\n\r\nEpisomal HIV-1 c-DNA, a by-product of HIV-1 infection, is currently used in clinical trials as a marker of residual viral replication and potential evolution of drug resistance mutations in viral reservoir sites in individuals on HAART [15]. Such a marker would be useful for identifying sites of HIV-1 replication in the male genital tract, and for monitoring cryptic HIV-1 infection in the genital tract of men on antiretroviral therapy. The only reported study that measured episomal HIV-1 c-DNA in blood and semen of men before and after initiation of HAART failed to detect HIV episomal 2-LTR cDNA in semen [16]. The method used to recover HIV-infected cells from semen in this study – separation of seminal WBC on Ficoll gradients – likely decreased the sensitivity of HIV episomal c-DNA detection because infected macrophages and a proportion of infected T-cells are lost through this approach. The paper by Xu et al. used a direct lysis technique optimizing recovery of DNA from HIV-infected cells in semen. Using this approach, combined with quantitative PCR and DNA sequencing, the investigators show that episomal 2-LTR cDNA is detectable in semen from a subset of men with other evidence of seminal HIV-1 infection. The marker was not detected in semen from 22 men at 1- and 6-months after peripheral viral suppression due to addition of indinavir to their ART regimen. This study is important because it provides a new tool for studying HIV infection of the male genital tract, and provides preliminary evidence that cryptic HIV-1 infection may not occur in the genital tract of men on HAART. Further studies will surely follow to confirm and extend these observations.",

Since boosted atazanavir and efavirenz are both considered preferred antiretrovirals a head to head comparison of their effects on serum lipids is needed. The primary objective of the study was to compare the effects of atazanavir (boosted and unboosted) and efavirenz based regimens on serum lipid profiles. Prospective cohort study nested within three ongoing cohorts of HIV-infected individuals. Participants initiating either atazanavir or efavirenz based regimens with documented pre- and post-initiation lipid values. Multivariate linear regression was conducted to estimate adjusted mean differences between treatment groups for high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), non-HDL-c, and log total cholesterol (TC) to HDL-c ratio outcomes; log-linear regression models were used to estimate differences in prevalence of low HDL-c and desirable TC. The final study population was comprised of 380 efavirenz and 281 atazanavir initiators. Both atazanavir and efavirenz users had increases in serum HDL-c and decreases in TC/HDL ratio. In comparison to individuals initiating efavirenz, boosted atazanavir users on average had lower HDL-c (-4.12 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and non HDL-c (-5.75 mg/dl, p < 0.01), but similar declines in TC/HDL ratio. Both efavirenz and atazanavir-based regimens (boosted and unboosted) resulted in similar beneficial declines in the TC/HDL ratio.",

Adherence scores varied from 0 - 25 (mean 1.06, median 0). The lowest detectable adherence score cut point using this instrument was >/= 5 for both initial suppression and maintenance of suppression. In the final Cox model of time to first undetectable pVL, controlling for prior treatment experience and baseline viral load, the adjusted hazard ratio for time updated adherence score was 0.36(score >/= 5) (95% CI: 0.19-0.69) [reference: <5]. In the final generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression model the adjusted odds ratio for time-updated adherence score was 0.17(score >/= 5) (0.05-0.66) [reference: <5].A brief, longitudinally administered self report adherence instrument predicted both initial virologic suppression and maintenance of suppression in patients using contemporary ARV regimens.

It is therefore important to understand barriers and facilitators of achieving the first 90 target. This study examined determinants of the first 90 target among females and males in order to inform strategies aimed at improving the HIV cascade in South Africa. Methods The data used in the analysis were obtained from a 2017 household-based cross-sectional nationally representative survey conducted using a multi-stage stratified cluster random sampling design. A series of hierarchical multiple logistic regression models were fitted to identify the determinants of the first 90 target by gender. Results Overall, 84.8% of HIV-positive individuals aged 15 years and older were aware of their HIV status. Females were significantly more aware of their HIV status compared to males (88.7% vs 78.2%, p &lt; 0.001). Both females aged 25 to 49 years [aOR = 3.20 (95% CI 1.35–7.57), p = 0.008], and 50 years and older [aOR = 3.19 (95% CI 1.04–9.76), p = 0.042] and males aged 25 to 49 years [aOR = 3.00 (95% CI 1.13–7.97), p = 0.028], and 50 years and older [aOR = 7.25 (95% CI 2.07–25.36), p = 0.002] were significantly more likely to know their HIV status compared to those aged 15 to 19 years. Males with tertiary education level were significantly more likely to be aware of their HIV positive status [aOR = 75.24 (95% CI 9.07–624.26), p &lt; 0.001] compared to those with no education or with primary level education. Females with secondary [aOR = 3.28 (95% CI 1.20–8.99), p = 0.021] and matric [aOR = 4.35 (95% CI 1.54–12.37), p = 0.006] educational levels were significantly more likely to be aware of their HIV positive status, compared to those with no education or with primary level education. Conclusion Significant progress has been made with regards to reaching the UNAIDS first 90 target. In this context achieving the first 90 target is feasible but there is a need for additional interventions to reach the males especially youth including those with no education or low levels of education.",

However, poor adherence to the therapy makes it ineffective. In this work, we construct an adherence prediction model of AIDS patients using the classical recency, frequency and monetary value (RFM) model in the data mining-based customer relationship management model to obtain adherence predictor variables. Methods We cleaned 257,305 diagnostic data elements of AIDS outpatients in Shanghai from August 2009 to December 2019 to obtain 16,440 elements. We tested the RFM and RFm (R: recent consultation month, F: consultation frequency, M/m: total/average medical costs per visit) models, three clustering methods (K-means, Kohonen and two-step clustering) and four decision algorithms (C5.0, the classification and regression tree, Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector and Quick, Unbiased, Efficient, Statistical Tree) to select the optimal combination. The optimal model and clustering analysis were used to divide the patients into two groups (good and poor adherence), then the optimal decision algorithm was used to construct the prediction model of adherence and obtain its predictor variables. Results The results revealed that the RFm model, K-means clustering analysis and C5.0 algorithm were optimal. After three rounds of k-means clustering analysis, the optimal RFm clustering model quality was 0.8, 10,614 elements were obtained, including 9803 and 811 from patients with good or poor adherence, respectively, and five types of patients were identified. The prediction model had an accuracy of 100% with the recent consultation month as an important adherence predictor variable. Conclusions This work presented a prediction model for medication adherence in AIDS patients at the designated AIDS center in Shanghai, using the RFm model and the k-means and C5.0 algorithms.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Integrase inhibitors (INIs)-based antiretroviral therapies (ART) are more recommended than efavirenz (EFV)-based ART for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Yet, the advantage of integrase inhibitors in treating TB/HIV coinfection is uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the effects and safety of INIs- versus EFV-based ART in TB/HIV coinfection, and demonstrate the feasibility of the regimens. Methods Four electronic databases were systematically searched through September 2020. Fixed-effects models were used to calculate pooled effect size for all outcomes. The primary outcomes were virologic suppression and bacteriology suppression for INIs- versus EFV-based ART. Secondary outcomes included CD4 + cell counts change from baseline, adherence and safety. Results Three trials (including 672 TB/HIV patients) were eligible. ART combining INIs and EFV had similar effects for all outcomes, with none of the point estimates argued against the INIs-based ART on TB/HIV patients. Compared to EFV-based ART as the reference group, the RR was 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.05) for virologic suppression, 1.00 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.05) for bacteriology suppression, 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.01) for adherence. The mean difference in CD4 + cell counts increase between the two groups was 14.23 cells/μl (95% CI 0− 6.40 to 34.86). With regard to safety (adverse events, drug-related adverse events, discontinuation for drugs, grade 3–4 adverse events, IRIS (grade 3–4), and death), INIs-based regimen was broadly similar to EFV-based regimens. The analytical results in all sub-analyses of raltegravir- (RAL) and dolutegravir (DTG) -based ART were valid. Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrates similar efficacy and safety of INIs-based ART compared with EFV-based ART. This finding supports INIs-based ART as a first-line treatment in TB/HIV patients. The conclusions presented here still await further validation owing to insufficient data.",

This realist evaluation aimed at: (1) describing the evaluation carried out in Haiti aiming to ascertain why, how and under which circumstances MSM are linked and retained along the continuum, (2) assessing the outcomes of this approach and (3) exploring the motivators and facilitators for the HIV continuum of services through mechanisms and pathways.Guided by a realist approach, first, an initial program theory (IPT) was developed based on literature and frameworks review, participant observations and discussions with stakeholders. Then, the IPT was tested using a mixed method explanatory study: a quantitative phase to build the continuum from a cross-sectional analysis, and a qualitative phase to explore the motivators and facilitators related to proper linkages along the continuum. Finally, the IPT was refined by eliciting the mechanisms and pathways for outcomes improvement.The results showed that the current service delivery model is suboptimal in identifying, engaging, linking and retaining MSM, resulting in loss to follow-up at every step of the continuum and failure to fully realize the health and prevention benefits of antiretroviral. However, the mechanisms through which linkages across the continuum can be improved are: self-acceptance, sense of community support and sense of comprehensive and tailored HIV services. These mechanisms are based on 10 different pathways: self-esteem, awareness and pride, perception of HIV risk, pcceptance and HIV status, addressing community stigma, strengthening of MSM organizations and community networks, societal acceptation and tolerance, stigma reduction training for healthcare providers, engagement of peers as educators and navigators and, adapted services delivery through drug dispensing points and mobile technology and financial assistance.The study findings show that engagement, adherence and retention to the continuum of HIV service for MSM are affected by a multi-layer of factors, thus highlighting the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to improve the program.",

AHF-Checkpoint fills a gap for key populations including LGBTQ and refugees, who experience HIV testing barriers at sexual health centres or general practices. The level of trust between lay providers and end users was highly valued by end users. They appreciated the low threshold to test at no costs, and the absence of waiting lists or triaging. Needs expressed by lay providers included more preparedness for emotionally charged situations, and extra training to improve STI knowledge. End users expressed a need for a full STI test package. Of the 5Cs, consent, counselling, and correct results were realised but confidentiality was sometimes difficult to achieve at pop-up locations, and referral barriers for confirmation testing (connection-to-care) were occasionally experienced by lay providers during weekends. Conclusion AHF-Checkpoint was described as a convenient and easily accessible service by end users and lay providers. Of the WHO 5Cs, connection-to-care could be optimised to ensure HIV confirmation and STI testing through a liaison approach with professionals from the regular healthcare sector.",

We aim to investigate the factors associated with EBV acquisition and the impact of EBV infection on the humoral response to HBV vaccination in infants born from HIV-positive, antiretroviral-treated mothers in Malawi. Methods A total of 149 HIV-exposed infants were included in this longitudinal study. EBV anti-VCA IgG were measured using an ELISA assay. The EBV seroconversion was correlated with the maternal viro-immunological conditions, with infant growth and immunological vulnerability, and with the humoral response to the HBV vaccine. Results No infant was EBV-positive at 6 months (n. 52 tested). More than a third of infants (49/115 or 42.6 %) on study beyond 6 months seroconverted at 12 months. At 24 months, out of 66 tested infants, only 13 remained EBV-uninfected, while 53 (80.3 %) acquired EBV infection, rising the total proportion of EBV seroconversion to 88.7 % (102/115 infants). EBV seroconversion was significantly associated with a low maternal educational status but had no impact on infant growth or vulnerability to infections. Reduced HBsAb levels and accelerated waning of antibodies were associated with early EBV seroconversion. Conclusions We found a heterogeneous timing of acquisition of EBV with the majority of infants born from HIV + mothers acquiring infection after 6 months. Anti-HBs levels were lower and appeared to wane faster in infants acquiring EBV infection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background A North–South (N–S) research collaboration is one way through which research capacity of developing countries can be strengthened. Whereas N–S collaboration in HIV/AIDS area may result in research capacity strengthening of Southern partners, it is not clear what factors are associated with this type of collaboration. The study aims to characterize N–S research collaboration focusing on HIV/AIDS and to determine factors associated with such N–S research collaborations. Methods Clinical trial data on HIV/AIDS-related studies conducted between 2000 and 2019 were obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov. Using these data, we characterized N–S collaborative studies focusing on HIV/AIDS and summarized them using frequencies and percentages. To determine factors associated with these studies, we used logistic regression and reported results as adjusted odds ratios with Wald 95% confidence intervals. Results and discussion Of the 4,832 HIV/AIDS-related studies retrieved from the registry, less than one-quarter (n = 1133, 23%) involved a Southern institution, with 77% of these studies classified as N–S collaborations. Majority of these studies have single PI (50%), are conducted at single location (39%); have large sample sizes (41%); are federally-funded (32%) or receive funding from other sources (32%); are intervention studies (64%); and involve a mixture of male and female participants (58%) and adult participants (54%). Single PIs (as opposed to multiple PIs) were more likely to be from the North than South institution (odds ratio = 5.59, 95%CI: 4.16 – 11.57). Trend analyses showed that N–S research collaborations produced HIV/AIDS-related studies at a faster rate than S–S research collaborations. N–S collaborations involving female or children produced HIV/AIDS-related studies between 2000 and 2019 at a significantly faster rate than S–S collaborations involving females and children during the same period. Holding other factors constant, N–S collaborative research focusing on HIV/AIDS are associated with: multiple PIs as opposed to single PI, multiple institutions as opposed to a single institution, multiple locations as opposed to a single location, large number of participants as opposed to small sample sizes, and public funding as opposed to industry funding. Almost half of these studies had a Northern PI only, about one-third had a Southern PI only, and much fewer had PIs from both North and South. However, these studies were less likely to receive funding from other sources than industry funding. Conclusions HIV/AIDS-related research is increasingly becoming a more collaborative global research involving more N–S collaborations than S–S collaborations. Factors associated with N–S collaborative studies focusing on HIV/AIDS include multiple PIs, institutions, and locations; large sample sizes; publicly funded; and involve vulnerable populations such as women and children. Whereas almost half of these studies have a Northern PI only, about one-third have a Southern PI only, and much fewer have PIs from both North and South. Our results inform future design and implementation of N–S research collaborations in this area. Suggestions for improvement of ClinicalTrials.gov registry are provided.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has a strong antiviral effect, but TDF is known to cause renal dysfunction. Therefore, we are investigating preventing renal dysfunction by replacing TDF with tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF), which is known to be relatively safe to the kidneys. However, the changes in renal function under long-term use of TAF are not known. In this study, we evaluated renal function in Japanese HIV-1-positive patients switching to TAF after long-term treatment with TDF. Methods A single-center observational study was conducted in Japanese HIV-1-positive patients. TDF was switched to TAF after at least 48 weeks of the treatment so we could evaluate the long-term use of TDF. The primary endpoint was the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 144 weeks of TAF administration. In addition, we predicted the factors that would lead to changes in eGFR after long-term use of TAF. Results Of the 125 HIV-1-positive patients who were prescribed TAF at our hospital during the study period, 70 fulfilled the study criteria. The eGFR at the time of switching from TDF to TAF was 81.4 ± 21.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . eGFR improved significantly after 12 weeks of taking TAF but significantly decreased at 96 and 144 weeks. The factors significantly correlated with the decrease in eGFR at 144 weeks on TAF were eGFR and weight at the start of TAF. Conclusions In this study, it was confirmed that switching to TAF was effective for Japanese HIV-1-positive patients who had been taking TDF for a long period of time and had a reduced eGFR. It was also found that the transition status depended on the eGFR and weight at the time of switch. Since HIV-1-positive patients in Japan are expected to continue taking TAF for a long time, renal function and body weight should be carefully monitored.",

Opsonized HIV-1 by complement enhances the infection of various mucosal target cells, such as dendritic cells (DC) and epithelial cells. Results We herein evaluated the effect of HIV-1 complement opsonization on microbicide candidates' activity, by using three in vitro mucosal models: CCR5-tropic HIV-1 JR-CSF transcytosis through epithelial cells, HIV-1 JR-CSF attachment on immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (iMDDC), and infectivity of iMDDC by CCR5-tropic HIV-1 BaL and CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 NDK . A panel of 10 microbicide candidates [T20, CADA, lectines HHA &amp; GNA, PVAS, human lactoferrin, and monoclonal antibodies IgG1B12, 12G5, 2G12 and 2F5], were investigated using cell-free unopsonized or opsonized HIV-1 by complements. Only HHA and PVAS were able to inhibit HIV trancytosis. Upon opsonization, transcytosis was affected only by HHA, HIV-1 adsorption on iMDDC by four molecules (lactoferrin, IgG1B12, IgG2G5, IgG2G12), and replication in iMDDC of HIV-1 BaL by five molecules (lactoferrin, CADA, T20, IgG1B12, IgG2F5) and of HIV-1 NDK by two molecules (lactoferrin, IgG12G5). Conclusion These observations demonstrate that HIV-1 opsonization by complements may modulate in vitro the efficiency of candidate microbicides to inhibit HIV-1 infection of mucosal target cells, as well as its crossing through mucosa.",

    "abstract": "Nef is a 27 KDa HIV-1 accessory protein. It downregulates CD4 from infected cell surface, a mechanism critical for efficient viral replication and pathogenicity. Agents that antagonize the Nef-mediated CD4 downregulation may offer a new class of drug to combat HIV infection and disease. TPCK (N-α-p-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone) and TLCK (N-α-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone) are alkylation reagents that chemically modify the side chain of His or Cys residues in a protein. In search of chemicals that inhibit Nef function, we discovered that TPCK and TLCK alkylated HIV Nef. Nef modification by TPCK was demonstrated on reducing SDS-PAGE. The specific cysteine residues modified were determined by site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry (MS). The effect of TPCK modification on Nef-CD4 interaction was studied using fluorescence titration of a synthetic CD4 tail peptide with recombinant Nef-His protein. The conformational change of Nef-His protein upon TPCK-modification was monitored using CD spectrometry Incubation of Nef-transfected T cells, or recombinant Nef-His protein, with TPCK resulted in mobility shift of Nef on SDS-PAGE. Mutagenesis analysis indicated that the modification occurred at Cys55 and Cys206 in Nef. Mass spectrometry demonstrated that the modification was a covalent attachment (alkylation) of TPCK at Cys55 and Cys206. Cys55 is next to the CD4 binding motif (A56W57L58) in Nef required for Nef-mediated CD4 downregulation and for AIDS development. This implies that the addition of a bulky TPCK molecule to Nef at Cys55 would impair Nef function and reduce HIV pathogenicity. As expected, Cys55 modification reduced the strength of the interaction between Nef-His and CD4 tail peptide by 50%. Our data suggest that this Cys55-specific alkylation mechanism may be exploited to develop a new class of anti HIV drugs.",

There were 40 patients with a mean ± SD age of 37 ± 8 years. Median (IQR) baseline CD4 was 123 (37-245) cells/mm3 and median (IQR) HIV-1 RNA was 55,800 (9,670-100,000) copies/mL.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The prevalence of bipolar disorder in HIV-infected patients is higher than the general population. Lithium is the most effective mood stabiliser, while tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is frequently used as part of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both TDF and lithium are associated with renal tubular toxicity, which could be additive, or a pharmacokinetic interaction may occur at renal transporters with a decrease in TDF elimination. Objective We report on the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the modification of diet in renal disease formula in participants who received ART including TDF and were enrolled in a 24 week randomised trial of lithium versus placebo in patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment. Methods We included HIV-infected adults with cognitive impairment established on ART for at least 6 months with a suppressed viral load attending public sector ART clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. We excluded participants with an eGFR &lt;60 mL/min and treated with medications predisposing to lithium toxicity. We reviewed participants weekly for the first month for adverse events followed by 4 weekly visits for renal function assessment, adverse event monitoring and adherence. Lithium dose was titrated to achieve the maintenance target plasma concentration of between 0.6 and 1.0 mmol/L. Sham lithium concentrations were generated for participants receiving placebo. Results We included 23 participants allocated to the lithium arm and 30 participants allocated to the placebo arm. Baseline characteristics were not statistically different with a mean age of 37.7 and 40.8 years, a median time on ART of 33 and 40 months and an eGFR of 139.3 and 131.0 mL/min in the lithium and placebo arms respectively. There was no statistical significant difference in the reduction in eGFR or increase in potassium between the two arms during the 24 weeks. Conclusions We found that 24-week treatment of HIV-infected patients with lithium and TDF did not result in increased nephrotoxicity.

    "abstract": "Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) can manifest with initiation or reintroduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in persons living with HIV (PLWH). In 2012, updated United States treatment guidelines recommended initiation of ART for all PLWH regardless of CD4 count. The objectives of this study were to quantify hospital usage attributable to IRIS and assess the reasons for hospitalization in PLWH before and after the guideline update. Subjects were PLWH between 18–89 years of age who were hospitalized between November 1, 2009 and July 31, 2014. Equivalent time periods before and after updated treatment guidelines were considered, and designated as Time Period 1 and Time Period 2, respectively. IRIS-attributable hospitalizations were identified by ICD9 codes and electronic medical record searches with subsequent review and confirmation. For hospitalizations that were not confirmed as being IRIS-attributable, primary discharge diagnoses were reviewed. A total of 278 PLWH were hospitalized 521 times throughout the study period. Time Period 1 had 9 PLWH with 12 IRIS-attributable hospitalizations while Time Period 2 had 6 PLWH with 9 IRIS-attributable hospitalizations. A larger proportion of IRIS-attributable hospital days was observed in Time Period 1 compared to Time Period 2 (7.5 vs 4.2%; p < 0.001). Median length of stay for IRIS-attributable hospitalizations was longer than for other diagnoses, particularly during Time Period 1 (12.0 vs 4.0; p = 0.05). The most common causes for hospitalizations in PLWH were non AIDS-defining infection, AIDS-defining malignancy, and gastrointestinal. PLWH who had HIV viral suppression (<200 copies/mL) accounted for 34 and 24% of hospitalizations in Time Periods 1 and 2 respectively. Hospitalizations for PLWH continue at high rates and IRIS is a significant contributing factor. In our single-center study, there was a lower number of IRIS-attributable hospitalizations and IRIS-attributable hospital days in Time Period 2 compared with Time Period 1. The hospital burden of IRIS may decrease over time as more PLWH are started on ART earlier in the course of infection. This study highlights the continued importance of early diagnosis and linkage to care of those infected with HIV, so that morbidity and costs associated with IRIS continue to decline.",

We collected visit data via encounter forms and demographic and laboratory data from electronic medical records. A post-pilot survey of perceptions of HIV screening was administered to providers and nurses. Multivariable analysis was used to identify factors associated with completion of testing. Visit provider and triage nurse were highly associated with both acceptance of screening and completion of testing, as were younger age, male gender, and race/ethnicity. 23.5% of patients completed tests, although 36.0% requested screening; time constraints as well as risk perceptions by both the provider and patient were cited as limiting completion of screening. Post-pilot surveys showed mixed support for ongoing HIV screening in this setting by providers and little support by nurses. Visit provider and triage nurse were strongly associated with acceptance of testing, which may reflect variable opinions of HIV screening in this setting by clinical staff. Among patients accepting screening, visit provider remained strongly associated with completion of testing. Despite longstanding recommendations for non-targeted HIV screening, further changes to improve the testing and results process, as well as provider education and buy-in, are needed to improve screening rates.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal NK phenotype and cytotoxic functions have been described in acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. Defective NK cytotoxicity is due to decreased expression of the Natural Cytotoxicity Receptors (NCRs), 2B4/CD244/p38, or NKG2D. This prompted us to test the expression of these molecules on circulating NK cells from patients with AIDS-related lymphomas (RL) in comparison with HIV + patients without lymphoma, healthy subjects and HIV-negative patients with lymphoma. Blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for NCRs, 2B4/CD244/p38 and NKG2D expression on NK cells defined as CD3-/CD56+ lymphocytes. We also analyzed by quantitative PCR specific RNA for NKp30/NCR3 and NKp46/NCR1. We could not detect any defect in NKp46/NCR1 expression between all groups. NKp44/NCR2, NKp30/NCR3 and NKG2D had lower expression in AIDS-RL in comparison with HIV + patients without lymphoma when compared to patients with similar (>0.3 G/L) CD4+ lymphocyte levels. Expression of 2B4/CD244/p38 was lower in AIDS-RL than in HIV-negative lymphoma. Comparison of specific NKp30/NCR3 and NKp46/NCR1 RNA showed increased steady state levels, despite decreased surface expression for NKp30/NCR3, suggesting abnormal post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We show a more pronounced defect in NK activating molecule when HIV infection is associated with lymphoma than when only one condition (HIV positivity or lymphoma) is present. Defective NK phenotype, in addition to CD4+ depletion and dysfunction, may participate to the increased incidence of lymphoma in HIV patients.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 coreceptor tropism testing is used to evaluate eligibility for CCR5 antagonist therapy. However, HIV-1 RNA-based tests are not suitable for virologically suppressed patients, therefore the use of proviral DNA tropism testing has been investigated. We describe a novel proviral DNA-based genotypic tropism assay and compare its performance to that of a sensitive HIV-1 RNA-based genotypic test.Tropism was determined using HIV-1 plasma RNA and proviral DNA from 42 paired samples from patients with plasma viral loads ≥1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. Proviral DNA sample types included whole blood, separated peripheral blood mononuclear cells resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and peripheral blood mononuclear cells resuspended in spun plasma. The HIV-1 envelope V3 region was PCR-amplified, sequenced in triplicate, and analyzed for tropism with the geno2pheno algorithm using a 10% false-positive rate (FPR).Amplicons were obtained from proviral DNA and plasma RNA in 41/42 samples. Tropism predictions were highly concordant (93%-98%) between proviral DNA and plasma RNA, regardless of the proviral DNA isolation method. Non-R5 proviral DNA results were obtained for 100% of patients with detectable non-R5 plasma HIV-1 RNA results. Geno2pheno FPRs for proviral DNA and plasma RNA were highly correlated (Spearman rho = 0.86).Our findings demonstrate that proviral DNA tropism determinations from whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells were highly concordant with plasma HIV-1 RNA tropism determinations. This assay may be useful for screening virologically suppressed patients for CCR5-antagonist eligibility and for research purposes.",

    "abstract": "HCV RNA viral load is an important predictor of sustained virological response and, recently, a significant correlation with liver fibrosis was described. We investigated on possible influence of clinical and viro-immunological variables on HCV viral load in HIV-HCV co-infected patients over a study time of three years (2009-2012).We retrospectively enrolled 98 adult patients with a diagnosis of chronic HIV infection in 2009, a diagnosis of chronic HCV infection with a detectable plasma HCV RNA in 2009 and 2012, HCV therapy-naïve or with failed and stopped antiviral treatment before June 2008. The following variables were recorded: age, gender, HCV genotype, IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype, HCV treatment status, advanced liver fibrosis diagnosis, antiretroviral therapy, CD4+ cell count, HCV viral load, HIV RNA (plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were measured from blood samples every three months at least). The correlation was established using linear regression analysis, analysis of variance and Fisher's exact test. Comparisons between groups were performed using Fisher's exact test, the independent samples t-test and the t-test for paired data, as appropriate, for continuous variables. A mixed mode (ME) maximum likelihood linear regression model was constructed to evaluate the dependence of HCV viral load.HCV RNA levels did not change significantly from 2009 to 2012 (from 3924650 ± 5320177 IU/ml to 3085128 ± 3372347 IU/ml, p = 0.13); the CD4+ count increased significantly (from a mean of 576 to a mean of 654, p = 0.003). Using linear regression, a positive correlation was observed for HCV load and genotype 1 (p = 0.002), nonresponder status (p = 0.04) and with interleukin 28B CC allele (p = 0.05). Other studied covariates failed to reach a significant correlation.The HCV RNA load, a known pretreatment predictor of response to antiviral therapy, was independent of the two main parameters of HIV disease, plasma HIV RNA and CD4 cell count, over an observation time of 3 years in patients with recovered or spontaneously maintained immunocompetence.",

Here we analyse phenotypic changes to natural killer (NK) cells in HIV patients who began ART with <200 CD4 T-cells/µl and maintained virological control for 12–17 years, compared with CMV seropositive and seronegative healthy control donors. Humoral responses to CMV antigens (lysate, gB, IE-1) remain elevated in the patients (P < 0.0001) despite the long duration of ART. Patient’s NK cells responded poorly to K562 cells when assessed by CD107a and IFNγ, but this could not be attributed to CMV as responses were low in CMV-seronegative controls. Moreover HIV (and not CMV) increased expression of CD57 on CD56lo cells. Comparisons with published studies suggest that CMV accelerates age-related increases in CD57 expression but levels plateau by 60–70 years of age, so the effect of CMV disappears. In HIV patients the plateau is higher and perhaps reached sooner.",

To support the increasing emphasis on biomedical interventions for prevention requires a renewed and reframed focus on HIV prevention messages to motivate engagement in risk-reduction activities. This paper examines youth and adult perceptions of HIV prevention messages and HIV risk assessment in a generalized HIV epidemic context in Uganda. We conducted 24 focus group discussions and 24 in-depth interviews with 15–45 year olds (n = 218) from three communities in the Rakai district of Uganda in 2012. We found generational differences in the how people viewed HIV, skepticism around introduction of new interventions, continued misconceptions and fears about condoms, and gender differences in content and salience of HIV prevention messages. Shifts in HIV education are needed to address gaps in HIV messaging to foster engagement in risk reduction strategies and adoption of newer biomedical approaches to HIV prevention.",

    "abstract": "New simian-human immunodeficiency chimeric viruses with an HIV-1 env (SHIVenv) are critical for studies on HIV pathogenesis, vaccine development, and microbicide testing. Macaques are typically exposed to single CCR5-using SHIVenv which in most instances does not reflect the conditions during acute/early HIV infection (AHI) in humans. Instead of individual and serial testing new SHIV constructs, a pool of SHIVenv_B derived from 16 acute HIV-1 infections were constructed using a novel yeast-based SHIV cloning approach and then used to infect macaques.Even though none of the 16 SHIVenvs contained the recently reported mutations in env genes that could significantly enhance their binding affinity to RhCD4, one SHIVenv (i.e. SHIVenv_B3-PRB926) established infection in macaques exposed to this pool. AHI SHIVenv_B viruses as well as their HIVenv_B counterparts were analyzed for viral protein content, function, and fitness to identify possible difference between SHIVenv_B3-PRB926 and the other 15 SHIVenvs in the pool. All of the constructs produced SHIV or HIV chimeric with wild type levels of capsid (p27 and p24) content, reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, and expressed envelope glycoproteins that could bind to cell receptors CD4/CCR5 and mediate virus entry. HIV-1env_B chimeric viruses were propagated in susceptible cell lines but the 16 SHIVenv_B variants showed only limited replication in macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 174×CEM.CCR5 cell line. AHI chimeric viruses including HIVenv_B3 showed only minor variations in cell entry efficiency and kinetics as well as replicative fitness in human PBMCs. Reduced number of N-link glycosylation sites and slightly greater CCR5 affinity/avidity was the only distinguishing feature of env_B3 versus other AHI env's in the pool, a feature also observed in the HIV establishing new infections in humans.Despite the inability to propagate in primary cells and cell lines, a pool of 16 SHIVenv viruses could establish infection but only one virus, SHIVenv_B3 was isolated in the macaque and then shown to repeatedly infected macaques. This SHIVenv_B3 virus did not show any distinct phenotypic property from the other 15 SHIVenv viruses but did have the fewest N-linked glycosylation sites.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In hospitalized people with HIV (PWH) there is an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 among hospitalized PWH as compared to HIV-negative individuals. Evidence suggests that tocilizumab—a humanized monoclonal interleukin (IL)-6 receptor inhibitor (IL-6ri) antibody—has a modest mortality benefit when combined with corticosteroids in select hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are severely ill. Data on clinical outcomes after tocilizumab use in PWH with severe COVID-19 are lacking. Case presentation We present a multinational case series of 18 PWH with COVID-19 who were treated with IL-6ri’s during the period from April to June 2020. Four patients received tocilizumab, six sarilumab, and eight received an undocumented IL-6ri. Of the 18 patients in the series, 4 (22%) had CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm 3 ; 14 (82%) had a suppressed HIV viral load. Eight patients (44%), all admitted to ICU, were treated for secondary infection; 5 had a confirmed organism. Of the four patients with CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm 3 , three were treated for secondary infection, with 2 confirmed organisms. Overall outcomes were poor—12 patients (67%) were admitted to the ICU, 11 (61%) required mechanical ventilation, and 7 (39%) died. Conclusions In this case series of hospitalized PWH with COVID-19 and given IL-6ri prior to the common use of corticosteroids, there are reports of secondary or co-infection in severely ill patients. Comprehensive studies in PWH, particularly with CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells, are warranted to assess infectious and other outcomes after IL-6ri use, particularly in the context of co-administered corticosteroids.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Infant antiretroviral prophylaxis has an important role in reduction of Human immune virus transmission from mother to child during the postpartum period. Male partner involvement was considered as a priority aforementioned area needs to be enhanced in Prevention of Mother-To Child Transmission (PMTCT). PMTCT service utilization can minimize the risk of the transmission of HIV from mother to child and related mortalities. Adequate utilization and adherence to this service has been challenging for some of the women if their partners are not aware or do partners do not support the women. The aim of this study is to assess the magnitude and determinants of male involvement in PMTCT service in Ethiopia. Methods and materials We had conducted an extensive search of literature as indicated in the guideline of reporting systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA). We had used PubMed, Google Scholar, and cross reference for searching articles. We had used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument for critical appraisal of studies. Met-analysis and meta-regression were computed to present the pooled prevalence and determinants of male partner involvement with a 95% confidence interval using Revman. Results Among a total of 338 studies, 11 studies were included in this analysis. The estimated pooled magnitude of male partner involvement was 40% (95% CI: 29.11–50.69). Knowledge of husband on PMTCT (2.30, 95% CI 1.75, 3.02), perceived responsibility for the women (4.22, 95% CI 2.31, 7.71), being government employee (2.89, 95% CI 2.02, 4.12), cultural barriers (3.44, 95% CI 2.54, 4.65) and educational status of husband (2.4, 95% CI 1.79, 3.50) were the determinants of pooled estimates of male partner involvement in PMTCT activities. Conclusion The pooled prevalence of male partner involvement was lower than the study conducted in sub Saharan Africa. Knowledge of husband on PMTCT, perceived responsibility for women, occupational status, cultural barriers and educational status of husband were determinants of male partner involvement. Therefore, the existing strategies to improve male involvement should be strengthened.",

We describe a systematic process used to identify attributes and levels for a discrete choice experiment (DCE) designed to elicit preferences for potential LA-ART options in the US. Methods Our approach was conducted in four stages: data collection, data reduction, removing inappropriate attributes, and optimizing wording. We started with 8 attributes defining potential LA-ART products based on existing literature and knowledge of products in development. We conducted 12 key informant interviews with experts in HIV treatment. The list of attributes, the set of plausible levels for each attribute, and restrictions on combinations of attribute levels were updated iteratively. Results Despite uncertainty about which products will become available, key informant discussions converged on 4 delivery modes (infusions and patches were not considered immediately feasible) and 6 additional attributes. Treatment effectiveness and frequency of clinical monitoring were dropped. Oral lead-in therapy was split into two attributes: pre-treatment time undetectable and pre-treatment negative reaction testing. We omitted product-specific systemic and local side effects. In addition to mode, the final set of attributes included: frequency of dosing; location of treatment; pain; pre-treatment time undetectable; pre-treatment negative reaction testing; and late-dose leeway. Conclusions A systematic process successfully captured elements that are both feasible and relevant to evaluating the acceptability of potential LA-ART alternatives to patients.",

The management and care of HIV/AIDS patients is being complicated by intestinal parasitic infections. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of intestinal parasitic infections among people living with HIV at Dessie Referral Hospital, North-east Ethiopia.This cross sectional study was conducted from March to May 2019. Systematic simple random sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Stool specimen was collected and examined microscopically using wet mount, formol-ether concentration technique and modified Zeihl-Neelsen methods. Socio-demographic characteristics and associated factors were collected using structured questionnaire. The recent CD4 cell count was obtained from patients ART follow-up record. Data were analysed using SPSS version 20 software. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was done to investigate the association between independent and dependent variables.Of the total of 223 study participants 120 (53.8%) were females and 162 (72.6%) were urban resident. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 47 (21.1%). Eleven different intestinal parasites species were detected. The dominant intestinal parasite species was Entameoba histolytica 14 (6.3%) followed by Enterobius vermicularis 5 (2.2%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that individuals who had a habit of hand washing after latrine were less likely to be infected with intestinal parasitic infection (AOR 0.15, 95% CI 0.05-0.412). On the other hand individuals who had CD4 cell count of < 200 cells/ml3 were 45.53 times more likely infected with intestinal parasites.The prevalence of intestinal parasite was higher than previous report from the same study area almost a decade ago. There was statistical significant association between hand washing habit after latrine, habit of eating raw vegetables and CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/ml3 and intestinal parasitic infections. Health education program interrupted in Dessie referral hospital should be continued to reduce the prevalence of intestinal parasites. Utilization of water treatment, washing hand after latrine and eating cooked or appropriately washed vegetables should also be promoted. Moreover, periodic laboratory stool specimen examination and prompt treatment are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background We developed a personalized Monocyte-Derived Dendritic-cell Therapy (MDDCT) for HIV-infected individuals on suppressive antiretroviral treatment and evaluated HIV-specific T-cell responses. Methods PBMCs were obtained from 10 HIV + individuals enrolled in trial NCT02961829. Monocytes were differentiated into DCs using IFN-α and GM-CSF. After sequencing each patient’s HIV-1 Gag and determining HLA profiles, autologous Gag peptides were selected based on the predicted individual immunogenicity and used to pulse MDDCs. Three doses of the MDDCT were administered every 15 days. To assess immunogenicity, patients’ cells were stimulated in vitro with autologous peptides, and intracellular IL-2, TNF, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production were measured in CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells. Results The protocol of ex-vivo treatment with IFN-α and GM-CSF was able to induce maturation of MDDCs, as well as to preserve their viability for reinfusion. MDDCT administration was associated with increased expression of IL-2 in CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells at 15 and/or 30 days after the first MDDCT administration. Moreover, intracellular TNF and IFN-γ expression was significantly increased in CD4 + T-cells. The number of candidates that increased in vitro the cytokine levels in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells upon stimulation with Gag peptides from baseline to day 15 and from baseline to day 30 and day 120 after MDDCT was significant as compared to Gag unstimulated response. This was accompanied by an increasing trend in the frequency of polyfunctional T-cells over time, which was visible when considering both cells expressing two and three out of the three cytokines examined. Conclusions MDDC had a mature profile, and this MDDCT promoted in-vitro T-cell immune responses in HIV-infected patients undergoing long-term suppressive antiretroviral treatment.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Data on safety and effectiveness of RPV from the real-world setting as well as comparisons with other NNRTIs such as efavirenz (EFV) remain scarce. Methods: Participants of EuroSIDA were included if they had started a RPV- or an EFV-containing regimen over November 2011-December 2017. Statistical testing was conducted using non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test and Chi-square test. A logistic regression model was used to compare participants’ characteristics by treatment group. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to estimate the cumulative risk of virological failure (VF, two consecutive values > 50 copies/mL). Results: 1,355 PLWH who started a RPV-based regimen (11% ART-naïve), as well as 333 initiating an EFV-containing regimen were included. Participants who started RPV differed from those starting EFV for demographics (age, geographical region) and immune-virological profiles (CD4 count, HIV RNA). The cumulative risk of VF for the RPV-based group was 4.5% (95% CI 3.3–5.7%) by 2 years from starting treatment (71 total VF events). Five out of 15 (33%) with resistance data available in the RPV group showed resistance-associated mutations vs. 3/13 (23%) among those in the EFV group. Discontinuations due to intolerance/toxicity were reported for 73 (15%) of RPV- vs. 45 (30%) of EFV-treated participants (p = 0.0001). The main difference was for toxicity of central nervous system (CNS, 3% vs. 22%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our estimates of VF > 50 copies/mL and resistance in participants treated with RPV were similar to those reported by other studies. RPV safety profile was favourable with less frequent discontinuation due to toxicity than EFV (especially for CNS).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background As one of the most prolific sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the world, Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) is one of the primary causes of genital ulcers. In addition, HSV-2 infection multiplies the risk of acquiring HIV. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at particularly high risk of contracting both diseases. Unfortunately, little information is available with regarding to the comprehensive prevalence of HSV-2 among MSM in mainland China. The objective of this manuscript was to determine the composite prevalence of HSV-2 among MSM in mainland China via systematic review and meta-synthesis. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Database for Chinese Periodicals, and the VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals for relevant articles published from the database’s inception to 28 April 2022 that reported data on the prevalence of HSV-2 within the MSM population in mainland China. We considered publications to be eligible for inclusion if they satisfied these conditions: (1) publication participants were MSM in China mainland. Studies were excluded if participants were exclusively all HIV-positive MSM, all HIV-negative MSM, injection-drug users, or MSM sex workers. These studies would have introduced selection bias and skewed pooled prevalence estimates higher or lower; (2) proportion of HSV-2 virus among MSM in China mainland were reported; (3) HSV-2 diagnosis was conducted in a laboratory based on a strict type-specific glycoprotein-G based assays diagnostic method or PCR method; and (4) had a sample size over 20. Exclusion criteria included: (1) not being an original manuscript, such as a review article; (2) being a guideline, correspondence, and/or conference abstract; (3) the publication population did not reside in China mainland when the study was carried out; and (4) if the same epidemiological data were printed in both English and Chinese journals, English articles were preferred. We assessed the risk of bias in each individual publication using the modified quality assessment tool for systematic reviews of observational publications (QATSO). This meta-analysis was conducted by using R software. Due to extensive heterogeneity between various publications, we employed a random effect model to calculate the composite prevalence and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We then conducted meta-regression to investigate the potential causes of observed heterogeneity. Lastly, we employed subgroup analysis based on characteristics of studies to compare the prevalence estimates across the groups. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot, Begg’s test and Egger’s test. Sensitivity analysis was also performed by removing each single study separately. Results This study included 31 articles (9 published in English and 22 in Chinese) in our meta-synthesis. The pooled prevalence of HSV-2 among MSM in China mainland was 0.094 (95%CI:0.074 to 0.116). Prevalence of HSV-2 among MSM in Southwest China was higher than other regions, prevalence of HSV-2 among MSM that recruited from VCT (Voluntary Counseling and Testing) was lower than other ways, respectively. Compared to 2000–2010, the prevalence of HSV-2 among MSM in mainland China showed a downward trend during 2011–2020, however, the difference was not statistically significant . Conclusion Prevalence of HSV-2 among MSM in China mainland is high, around 0.094. It indicated HSV-2 needed to be screening for MSM population among China mainland and proper actions should be taken to curve the trend of HSV-2 among MSM in China.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Prolonged exposure to HIV and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has been linked with endothelial cell activation which subsequently predisposes people living with HIV (PLWH) to cardiovascular diseases. Serum biomarkers of endothelial cell activation such as E-Selectin and endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) could aid in early detection of PLWH at a risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, there is a paucity of data on these biomarkers like E-selectin and endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) among PLWH on long term ART (≥ 10 years) in Uganda. The aim of this study is to determine the serum levels of these biomarkers in this population. Methods This was a cross-sectional study where we randomly sampled 73 stored serum samples of PLWH who were enrolled in the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) ART long term (ALT cohort). We measured serum levels of E-selectin and ESM-1 by ELISA. Data was summarized using median and interquartile range. Inferential statistics were performed to determine predictors of elevated levels of E-selectin. Results Of the 73 samples analyzed, 38 (52.1%) were from female participants. The mean age was 54 ± 9.0 years. Twenty participants (27.4%) had a history of smoking while 52 (71.2%) had a history of alcohol intake. Twenty-five (34.3%) of the participants were overweight whereas 4 (5.6%) were obese. Fifty-four (74%) had an undetectable viral load (≤ 0 copies/ml) and the mean duration of ART at the time of sampling (2014/2015) was 10.4 ± 0.4 years. While serum levels of ESM-1 were not detectable in any of our samples, the median E-selectin levels was 147.6 μm/L ranging from 8.44 μm/L and 1,979.36 μm/L. Sixty-seven participants (91.8%) had elevated levels of E-selectin (&gt; 39 μm/L). CD4 count &gt; 500 cells/µl compared to lower counts was a predictor of elevated levels of E-Selectin (adjusted Odd Ratio 12.5, 95% CI (1.03 — 149.95, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The majority (91.8%) of PLWH on long term ART had elevated levels of E-selectin. Having high CD4 count (&gt; 500 cells/µl) was predictive of elevated levels of E-Selectin. Future work should longitudinally assess the trend of levels of E-selectin and ESM-1 while assessing for cardiovascular diseases endpoint.",

At-risk alcohol use is more frequent among PLWH and increases the risk of health challenges. PLWH with at-risk alcohol use are more likely to meet criteria for prediabetes/diabetes and this is associated with impaired whole-body glucose-insulin dynamics. Methods The Alcohol &amp; Metabolic Comorbidities in PLWH: Evidence Driven Interventions Study (ALIVE-Ex Study, NCT03299205) is a longitudinal, prospective, interventional study to determine the effects of an aerobic exercise protocol on improving dysglycemia among PLWH with at-risk alcohol use. The intervention is a moderate intensity aerobic exercise protocol implemented 3 days per week for 10 weeks at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-New Orleans. Participants who have a fasting blood glucose level between 94 and 125 mg/dl will be enrolled in the study. Oral glucose tolerance tests, fitness assessments, and skeletal muscle biopsies will be performed pre- and post-exercise intervention. The primary outcome is to determine whether the exercise protocol improves measures of whole-body glucose-insulin dynamics, cardiorespiratory fitness, and skeletal muscle metabolic and bioenergetic function. Secondary outcomes are to determine whether the exercise intervention improves cognitive function and overall quality of life. Results generated will demonstrate the effect of exercise on glycemic measures in PLWH with subclinical dysglycemia and at-risk alcohol use. Conclusions The proposed intervention will also have the potential to be scalable to promote lifestyle changes among PLWH, particularly in underserved communities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In 2016 the WHO declared HIV self-testing and self-sampling an effective and safe test option that can reduce testing barriers. HIV self-tests and self-sampling kits (HIVST/HIVSS) are available for purchase at Dutch community pharmacies since 2019. We investigated the availability and accessibility of HIVST/HIVSS in community pharmacies, and factors associated with test availability. Methods An online survey among all Dutch community pharmacies (n = 1,987) was conducted between April and June 2021. Availability of HIVST/HIVSS and experiences of pharmacists with the test offer were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The association of pharmacy and pharmacists’ characteristics with HIVST/HIVSS availability was explored by logistic regression analysis. Results In total, 465 pharmacists completed the questionnaire. Of the responding pharmacists, 6.2% (n = 29) offered HIVST/HIVSS. The majority (82.8%) sold between 0 and 20 tests per year. In total, pharmacies sold an estimated 370 HIVST/HIVSS per year. Pharmacies having HIVST/HIVSS available were less often located in moderately-urbanized to rural neighborhoods (OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.16–0.77 versus highly-urbanized), and were less often located in moderate-to-low SES neighborhoods (OR 0.40, 95%CI 0.18–0.88 versus high-SES). Reasons for not offering HIVST/HIVSS by pharmacists were no or little demand (69.3%), and not being familiar with these tests (17.4%). 52% of the pharmacists provided information about testing to test buyers. Reported options to improve the test offer were giving advice about (performing) the test to test buyers (72.4%), placing tests visible on the counter (51.7%), and advertisement (37.9%). Conclusion HIVST/HIVSS have a limited practical availability in Dutch community pharmacies since their introduction in 2019, especially in lower-urbanized and lower-SES areas. Further research is needed to explore how to expand access to HIVST/HIVSS through community pharmacies in the Netherlands, and how to tailor it to the needs of pharmacy clients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Within the African region, there are an estimated 8 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) in South Africa. Seeking healthcare services from traditional healers (TH) is one of the alternative and complementary approaches to HIV/AIDS treatment. Identifying the associated factors of TH utilisation among older PLHIV is crucial in developing healthcare interventions that cater to the unique needs of this vulnerable group. This study investigated the factors associated with TH utilisation among older PLHIV. Methods We studied 516 older PLHIV using data from the WHO SAGE Well-Being of Older People Study (2011–2013). Chi-square, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were computed in STATA Version 14. The results were presented with both crude and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and at 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Of the 516 participants, 15.89% utilised TH. The major reason for TH utilisation among older PLHIV was the perception of receiving better healthcare services from TH (51.2%) and the flexibility to pay with goods instead of money (14.6%). The factors associated with TH utilisation were age [AOR = 0.05; CI 0.01, 0.37], being hypertensive [AOR = 2.07; CI 1.04, 4.11], and having more than four servings of fruits [AOR = 10.64; CI 2.95, 38.34]. TH utilisation was significantly lower among those who visited the clinic once or twice [AOR = 0.17; CI 0.05, 0.63], three to six times [AOR = 0.16; CI 0.05, 0.56], and more than 6 times [AOR = 0.09; CI 0.03, 0.34] compared to those who had no clinic visits. Conclusion In conclusion, a low proportion of TH utilisation was reported among older PLHIV in South Africa. TH utilisation is associated with age, hypertension status, frequency of clinic visits and fruit servings consumed. Our study suggests that being hypertensive was a motivating factor for older PLHIV to utilise TH. Therefore, it is imperative for the South African health department to integrate the services of TH into the mainstream health system to manage non-communicable diseases, particularly hypertension, among older PLHIV.",

Fifty patients with a total of 67 included eyes were randomly divided into low-dose (0.4 mg ganciclovir per week) and intermediate-dose (1.0 mg ganciclovir per week) groups. The primary clinical outcomes were the changes in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to the end of treatment and the 12-month follow-up visit as well as the number of intravitreal injections.In both groups, the median BCVA, expressed as the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), improved significantly from baseline to the end of treatment (both p < 0.001), while vision loss from CMVR continued to occur at the 12-month visit. The mean number of injections was 5.8 in the low-dose group and 5.4 in the intermediate-dose group. No significant differences were detected between the two groups (p > 0.05).

    "abstract": "The increased survival provided by the access, development, and evolution of antiretroviral drugs (ARV) greatly increased the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PWH). This has also led to an increased occurrence of diseases or morbidities related to aging. In individuals with multiple comorbidities, the simultaneous use of multiple medications, also known as polypharmacy, is common, and rational use of medications is essential. This study aims to describe the pharmacotherapeutic profile, estimate the prevalence of polypharmacy and identify factors associated with polypharmacy in a cohort of adult PWH from a referral unit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Cross-sectional study including PWH on ARV who received at least one medical prescription (outpatient/hospitalized) in 2019. We described the proportion of prescribed medications according to ARV and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classes stratified by age (< 50 vs. ≥50 years). Polypharmacy was defined as ≥ 5 medications prescribed beyond ARV. Logistic regression models assessed demographic and clinical factors associated with polypharmacy.A total of 143,306 prescriptions of 4547 PWH were analyzed. Median age was 44.4 years (IQR:35.4-54.1) and 1615 (35.6%) were ≥ 50 years. A total of 2958 (65.1%) participants self-identified as cisgender man, 1365 (30.0%) as cisgender woman, and 224 (4.9%) as transgender women. Most self-declared Black/Pardo (2582; 65.1%) and 1984 (44.0%) completed elementary education or less. Median time since HIV diagnosis was 10.9 years (IQR:6.2-17.7). Most frequently prescribed concomitant medications were nervous system (64.8%), antiinfectives for systemic use (60.0%), alimentary tract and metabolism (45.9%), cardiovascular system (40.0%) and respiratory system (37.1%). Prevalence of polypharmacy was 50.6% (95%CI: 49.2-52.1). Model results indicated that being older, self-identify as cisgender woman, having less education and longer time since HIV diagnosis increased the odds of polypharmacy.We found high rates of polypharmacy and concomitant medication use in a cohort of PWH in Brazil. Targeted interventions should be prioritized to prevent interactions and improve treatment, especially among individuals using central nervous system and cardiovascular medications, as well as certain groups such as cisgender women, older individuals and those with lower education. Standardized protocols for continuous review of patients' therapeutic regimens should be implemented.",

Although not currently recommended as first-line drugs in Japanese or overseas guidelines, use of such formulations may increase, in accordance with patient conditions and preference. We determine the level of satisfaction with current anti-HIV drugs and analyzed the preferences of patients who favor long-acting injectable drugs based on their satisfaction level with the present anti-HIV drugs. Methods People living with HIV (PLWH) who had received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least one month and consented to the study between 1 April and 31 December 2021 were included in a survey conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. The content of the survey included satisfaction with seven items (tablet size, ease and feeling when taking the medicine, color, taste, portability, daily oral therapy, and co-payment) related to the anti-HIV drugs they were taking and their need for future drugs (dosage form, frequency of dosing, long-acting injectable, etc.). In addition, factors related to the need for long-acting injectable medications were analyzed with regard to the relationship with satisfaction with anti-HIV drugs. Results Overall, 667 patients available for analysis were included in this study. Satisfaction with anti-HIV drugs was highest with regard to “co-payment” and lowest with “daily oral therapy”. Regarding the need for long-acting injectable medications, logistic regression analysis indicated that tablet size and daily oral therapy were significant predictors of patient preference for a once-every-eight-weeks intramuscular formulation in terms of their requirement for long-acting injectable medications (tablet size, OR = 2.14, 95%CI 1.030–4.430, p = 0.042; and daily oral therapy, OR = 1.75, 95%CI 1.010–3.030, p = 0.044). Conclusions Patients currently receiving anti-HIV drugs who express dissatisfaction with tablet size and daily oral therapy may prefer a long-acting injectable formulation, taking into consideration patient age, employment status, ART history, frequency of daily dosage and concomitant medications other than ART.",

This protocol had not been previously reported for the treatment of HIV-related PCNSL. Case presentation The two cases were characterized by the treatment choice of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. Rituximab was not recommended for them due to their very low CD4 + T cell counts. They both took MTX as the first-line therapy and got a relief in initial phase. For the first case, ibrutinib was kept both in the first-line therapy and in the maintenance therapy. When the second case underwent a progressive disease, we continued to use orelabrutinib as one of the salvage treatment, in combination with programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor plus lenalidomide. They both achieved a continuous response of up to 20 months without opportunistic infection. Conclusions This report highlights the safety and effectiveness of BTK inhibitors, as well as lenalidomide and PD-1 inhibitor in HIV-related PCNSL patients. Both the new therapeutic approaches and a multidisciplinary team authentically contributed to improved survival outcome among HIV-positive PCNSL patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Uganda Ministry of Health issued restrictive guidelines on the use of dolutegravir (DTG) in persons stratified to have a heightened risk of diabetes mellitus. This followed multiple reports of persons with HIV (PWH) presenting with accelerated hyperglycemia after a few weeks to months of exposure to DTG. Having demonstrated a low incidence of diabetes mellitus and improving blood glucose trajectories in a cohort of ART naïve Ugandan PWH on DTG, we sought to determine whether the observed improvement in blood glucose did not mask background compensated insulin resistance. Methods In this analysis, 63 patients underwent serial oral glucose tolerance tests over 48 weeks. Using fasting serum insulin and glucose, we calculated insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell function by homeostatic modelling (HOMA IR and HOMA%β respectively). Absolute mean changes between baseline and post-baseline blood glucose, pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance were computed by subtracting each post-baseline value from the baseline value and compared using student t-test. Multiple linear regression models were used to determine the factors associated with changes in pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance. Results Of the 63 participants, 37 (58%) were female. Median age was 31 (IQR: 28–37). Despite a trend towards an initial increase in both HOMA IR and HOMA%β at 12 weeks followed by a decline through 36 weeks to 48 weeks, the HOMA IR and HOMA%β at 48 weeks were not significantly different from baseline i.e. (difference in mean HOMA IR from baseline: 0.14, 95%CI: -0.46, 0.733, p = 0.648) and (difference in mean HOMA %β from baseline: 6.7, 95%CI: -13.4, 26.8, p = 0.506) respectively. Conclusion We demonstrated insignificant changes in both insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell function in clinically stable young adult Ugandan PWH on dolutegravir for 48 weeks. We add to the body of evidence demonstrating glucose metabolic safety of dolutegravir in ART naïve patients. Ugandan guidelines should reconsider restricting DTG initiation in ART naive adults at high risk for diabetes.",

Its genome contains two regulatory genes ( tat and rev ), three structural genes ( gag , pol , and env ), and four accessory genes ( nef, vpr, vpu , and vif ). Long terminal repeats (LTRs) in thegenome regulate integration, duplication, and expression of viral gene. The permissibility of HIV-1 infection hinges on the host cell cycle status. HIV-1 replicates by exploiting various cellular processes via upregulation or downregulation of specific cellular proteins that also control viral pathogenesis. For example, HIV-1 regulates the life cycle of p53, which in turn contributes significantly to HIV-1 pathogenesis. In this article, we review the interaction between HIV-1-associated factors and p53, providing information on their regulatory and molecular mechanisms, hinting possible directions for further research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV seroprevalence in Nigeria is increasing among men who have sex with men (MSM) from 14% to 2007 to 23% in 2014, threatening progress towards ending the epidemic in the country. Expanding access to HIV testing and linkage to care for key populations, like young MSM (YMSM), is critical to end the HIV epidemic in Nigeria. The Intensive Combination Approach to Roll Back the Epidemic in Nigerian Adolescents (iCARE Nigeria) pilot intervention successfully implemented a combination of evidence-based interventions utilizing peer navigators and popular social media apps and platforms to reach young men at risk for HIV exposure, including YMSM. We conducted sequential mixed methods explanatory implementation research to expand on the previously reported effectiveness and implementation outcomes and to explore the determinants and strategies which contributed to primary study results. Methods We conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions with 2 peer navigators and 3 study staff at the end of the pilot. We used directed content analysis to understand the quantitative results from the pilot. Using the Implementation Research Logic Model, we were able to identify and map strategies through mechanisms of action from barriers addressed to the reported implementation outcomes including feasibility, acceptability fidelity and adoption. Results We found that iCARE Nigeria’s pilot intervention implementers reported high feasibility, acceptability fidelity and adoption were associated with implementation of strategies which addressed many challenging contextual factors, including social stigma, online social networking, legal barriers surrounding MSM behavior, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies included integration of stakeholders’ interests, selection of experienced peer navigators including from the targeted population, training and supportive supervision using an implementation guide, ensuring safety (COVID and legal) and identification of clinics serving the targeted population. Conclusion Mixed methods using implementation research frameworks provided insights into the strategies and barriers and facilitators they addressed which may explain the success of the pilot. These results can inform strategies needed to scale-up the intervention to youth including YMSM in other areas in Nigeria and the region.

Caring for aged PLHIV necessitates the engagement of caregivers and patients to establish agreed-upon goals of treatment. However, there is limited literature on friendly and centered models of care for elderly PLHIV. We explored strategies to improve care in HIV clinics among PLHIV aged 50 years and above in Uganda. Methods We conducted 40 in-depth interviews in two hospitals with elderly PLHIV aged 50 years and above who had lived with HIV for more than ten years. We explored strategies for improving care of elderly PLHIV at both health facility and community levels. The in-depth interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The thematic approach guided data analysis. Results The elderly PLHIV suggested the following strategies to improve their care: creating geriatric clinics; increasing screening tests for non-communicable diseases in the ART clinics; community and home-based ART delivery; workshops at health facilities to provide health education on aging effectively; creating community support groups; financial assistance for the elderly PLHIV and advances in science. Conclusions There is need to improve community HIV care especially for the elderly and social and economic support in the community. Involving the elderly PLHIV in developing strategies to improve their health goes a long way to improve the patients' quality of care. There is a need to incorporate the raised strategies in HIV care or older adults.",

Ethiopia has made progress in reducing new HIV infections, but the burden remains high with ongoing challenges in prevention uptake. This study examined the utilization and factors associated with pre-exposure prophylaxis among female sex workers. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted in Bahir Dar city administration among female sexual workers in 2022. The results were collected using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire. Epi data for data entry and social package for social science for analysis were used. Result Overall, 15.9% (CI: 12.0-21.1) of female sexual workers received pre-exposure prophylaxis. Parents’ living condition (only father alive [AOR = 0.23, 95% CI, 0.02–0.64], only mother alive [AOR = 0.31, 95% CI, 0.02–0.74]), marital status being single (AOR = 0.27, 95% CI, 0.06–0.94), having history of STI (AOR = 2.82, 95% CI, 1.60–4.77) were associated with pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake. Conclusion This study showed low pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake. The study identified a history of sexually transmitted infections, marital status, and parent living conditions as significant factors. To increase pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake and reduce HIV incidence, an awareness campaign, tailored support, targeted interventions, and addressing concerns of high-risk groups are needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an evidence-based package of care to reduce mortality and morbidity among people with advanced HIV disease (AHD). Adoption of these recommendations by national guidelines in sub-Saharan Africa is poorly documented. We aimed to review national guidelines for AHD management across six selected countries in sub-Saharan Africa for benchmarking against the 2021 WHO recommendations. Methods We reviewed national guidelines from six countries participating in an ongoing randomized controlled trial recruiting people with AHD. We extracted information addressing 18 items of AHD diagnosis and management across the following domains: [1] Definition of AHD, [2] Screening, [3] Prophylaxis, [4] Supportive care, and [5] HIV treatment. Data from national guideline documents were compared to the 2021 WHO consolidated guidelines on HIV and an agreement score was produced to evaluate extent of guideline adoption. Results The distribution of categories of agreement varied for the national documents. Four of the six countries addressed all 18 items (Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Uganda). Overall agreement with the WHO 2021 guidelines ranged from 9 to 15.5 out of 18 possible points: Malawi 15.5 points, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone 14.5 points, South Africa 13.5 points, Uganda 13.0 points and Botswana with 9.0 points. Most inconsistencies were reported for the delay of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in presence of opportunistic diseases. None of the six national guidelines aligned with WHO recommendations around ART timing in patients with tuberculosis. Agreement correlated with the year of publication of the national guideline. Conclusion National guidelines addressing the care of advanced HIV disease in sub-Saharan Africa are available. Besides optimal timing for start of ART in presence of tuberculosis, most national recommendations are in line with the 2021 WHO standards.",

A codon-usage-optimized synthetic env gene permitted high, Rev-independent Env expression.

HIV-infected persons with lipodystrophy have been shown to have poor self-perceptions of health. We evaluated whether lipodystrophy in the HIV-infected population was associated with increased utilization of healthcare services and increased healthcare costs. To examine utilization of healthcare services and associated costs with respect to presence of lipodystrophy among HIV-infected patients. Healthcare utilization and cost of healthcare services were collected from computerized accounting records for participants in a body image study among HIV-infected patients treated at a tertiary care medical center. Lipodystrophy was assessed by physical examination, and effects of lipodystrophy were assessed via body image surveys. Demographic and clinical characteristics were also ascertained. Analysis of healthcare utilization and cost outcomes was performed via between-group analyses. Multivariate modeling was used to determine predictors of healthcare utilization and associated costs. Of the 181 HIV-infected participants evaluated in the study, 92 (51%) had clinical evidence of HIV-associated lipodystrophy according to physician examination. Total healthcare utilization, as measured by the number of medical center visits over the study period, was notably increased among HIV-infected subjects with lipodystrophy as compared to HIV-infected subjects without lipodystrophy. Similarly, total healthcare expenditures over the study period were $1,718 more for HIV-infected subjects with lipodystrophy than for HIV-infected subjects without lipodystrophy. Multivariate modeling demonstrated strong associations between healthcare utilization and associated costs, and lipodystrophy score as assessed by a clinician. Healthcare utilization and associated costs were not related to body image survey scores among HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy. Patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy demonstrate an increased utilization of healthcare services with associated increased healthcare costs as compared to HIV-infected patients without lipodystrophy. The economic and healthcare service burdens of HIV-associated lipodystrophy are significant and yet remain inadequately addressed by the medical community.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV-1 integrase (IN) is an attractive target for the development of drugs to treat AIDS, and inhibitors of this viral enzyme are already in the clinic. Nevertheless, there is a continuing need to devise new approaches to block the activity of this viral protein because of the emergence of resistant strains. To facilitate the biochemical analysis of wild-type IN and its derivatives, and to measure the potency of prospective inhibitory compounds, a rapid, moderate throughput solution assay was developed for IN-catalyzed joining of viral and target DNAs, based on the detection of a fluorescent tag. Results A detailed, step-by-step description of the new joining assay is provided. The reactions are run in solution, the products captured on streptavidin beads, and activity is measured by release of a fluorescent tag. The procedure can be scaled up for the analysis of numerous samples, and is substantially more rapid and sensitive than the standard radioactive gel methods. The new assay is validated and its utility demonstrated via a detailed comparison of the Mg ++ - and Mn ++ -dependent activities of the IN proteins from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the avian sarcoma virus (ASV). The results confirm that ASV IN is considerably more active than HIV-1 IN, but with both enzymes the initial rates of joining, and the product yields, are higher in the presence of Mn ++ than Mg ++ . Although the pH optima for these two enzymes are similar with Mn ++ , they differ significantly in the presence of Mg ++ , which is likely due to differences in the molecular environment of the binding region of this physiologically relevant divalent cation. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that a compound that can inhibit HIV-1 IN in the presence of either metal cofactors is only effective against ASV in the presence of Mn ++ . Conclusion A simplified, assay for measuring the joining activity of retroviral IN in solution is described, which offers several advantages over previous methods and the standard radioactive gel analyses. Based on comparisons of signal to background ratios, the assay is 10–30 times more sensitive than gel analysis, allows more rapid and accurate biochemical analyses of IN catalytic activity, and moderate throughput screening of inhibitory compounds. The assay is validated, and its utility demonstrated in a comparison of the metal-dependent activities of HIV-1 and ASV IN proteins.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Antiretrovirals, including tenofovir, can suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but cannot completely eradicate it. Patients with HIV infection are administered antiretroviral drugs over a long term; thus, managing consequent adverse drug reactions, such as renal dysfunction and bone mineral loss, is important. Currently, highly sensitive biomarkers that can detect adverse drug reactions early have not been well studied. Methods This single-center, prospective, observational study explored changes in the biomarkers of renal function, bone metabolism, and lipid profile before and after switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in patients with HIV infection. Results All 31 enrolled patients had been treated with antiretrovirals for more than 5 years. The rate of proteinuria decreased significantly after starting TAF-containing antiretroviral regimen. The urinary liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP)/creatinine ratio was significantly decreased at 3 and 6 months after switching to TAF compared with that before switching to TAF (− 0.5 μg/g Cr at 3 months, and − 0.8 μg/g Cr at 6 months; p &lt; 005 for both at 3 and 6 months). The urinary N-terminal telopeptide (NTx)/creatinine ratio decreased over the study period, and the ratios were significantly different between 3 and 6 months (− 11 nmol/mmol Cr at 3 months, − 15.2 nmol/mmol Cr at 6 months; p = 0.0069 at 3 months, p &lt; 0.0001 at 6 months). Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol level significantly increased at 3 (+ 26 mg/dL) and 6 months (+ 13 mg/dL) compared with that at the baseline ( p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions Switching from TDF to TAF decreased the levels of renal and bone biomarkers, such as urinary L-FABP and NTx, but increased low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. Future studies should evaluate if these biomarkers, such as urinary L-FABP and NTx, truly detect serious adverse drug reactions early.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In 2013, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended Option B+ as a strategy to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. In option B+ , lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) is offered to all HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding women to reduce MTCT rate to less than or equal to 5%. Its success depends on retaining women on ART during pregnancy, delivery and breast-feeding period. There is limited data on early retention on ART among pregnant women in Zimbabwe. We therefore assessed early retention among women on Option B + from antenatal care (ANC) until 6 months post ANC booking and at delivery in Bulawayo city and Mazowe rural district of Zimbabwe. Methods We collected data for pregnant women booking for ANC between January and March 2018, comparing early retention among ART naïve women and those already on ART. The two cohorts were followed up for 6 months post ANC booking, and this was done in two districts. Data were collected from routine tools used at facility level which include ANC, delivery and ART registers. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate retention probabilities at 1, 3 and 6 months post-delivery and for retention at delivery proportions were used. Poisson regression was used to investigate factors associated with non-retention at 6 months post ANC booking. Results A total of 388 women were included in the study with median age of 29 years (IQR: 25–34). Two-thirds booked in their second trimester. Retention at 3 and 6 months post ANC booking was 84% (95% CI 80–88) and 73% (95% CI 69–78) respectively. At delivery 81% (95% CI 76–84) were retained in care, 18% lost-to-follow-up and 1% transferred out. In this study we did not find marital status, gestation age, facility location, ART status at ANC booking, to be associated with loss to follow-up. Conclusion In this study, we found low retention at 3, 6 months and delivery, a threat to elimination of Mother-to-child Transmission of HIV in Zimbabwe. Our findings emphasize the need for enhanced interventions to improve early retention such as post-test counselling, patient tracing and visit reminders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Persons living with HIV (PLWH) who are members of sero-discordant and sero-concordant relationships may experience psychological stressors or motivators that affect HIV care. We assessed the association between sero-discordance status, antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake, and viral suppression in the African Cohort Study (AFRICOS). Methods AFRICOS enrolls PLWH and HIV-uninfected individuals at 12 sites in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria . At enrollment, we determined ART use through self-report. Viral suppression was defined as HIV RNA &lt; 1000 copies/mL. We analyzed PLWH who were index participants within two types of sexual dyads: sero-discordant or sero-concordant. Binomial regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for factors associated with ART use and viral suppression at study enrollment. Results From January 2013 through March 2018, 223 index participants from sero-discordant dyads and 61 from sero-concordant dyads were enrolled. The majority of the indexes were aged 25–34 years (50.2%), female (53.4%), and married (96.5%). Sero-discordant indexes were more likely to disclose their status to partners compared with sero-concordant indexes (96.4% vs. 82.0%, p &lt; 0.001). After adjustment, sero-discordant index participants were more likely to be on ART (aPR 2.8 [95% CI 1.1–6.8]), but no more likely to be virally suppressed. Results may be driven by unique psycho-social factors and global implementation of treatment as prevention. Conclusions PLWH in sero-discordant sexual partnerships demonstrated improved uptake of ART compared with those in sero-concordant partnerships. Interventions are needed to increase care engagement by individuals in sero-concordant relationships to improve HIV outcomes.",

    "abstract": "We estimated the predictive effects of ART-related perceptions on the actual ART uptake behavior among ART naïve PLWH stratified by different time of HIV diagnosis under the new strategy.A prospective cohort study was conducted among ART naïve PLWH in Guangzhou, China from June 2016 to June 2017. Cox regression model was used to evaluate the predictive effects of ART-related perceptions on ART initiation among PLWH stratified by different timepoint of HIV diagnosis (i.e., before or after the update of the new treatment policy).Among 411 participants, 150 and 261 were diagnosed before (pre-scaleup group) and after (post-scaleup group) the implementation of the new strategy, respectively. The ART initiation rate in the post-scaleup group (88.9%) was higher than that in the pre-scaleup group (73.3%) (p < 0.001). A significant difference of mean score was detected in each HBM construct between pre- and post-scaleup groups (p < 0.05). After adjusting for significant background variables, among all participants, only the self-efficacy [adjusted HR (HRa) = 1.23, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.43, p = 0.006], has a predictive effect on ART initiation; in pre-scaleup group, all constructs of HBM-related ART perceptions were predictors of ART initiation (HRa = 0.71 to 1.83, p < 0.05), while in post-scaleup group, no significant difference was found in each construct (p > 0.05).The ART initiation rate was high particularly among participants who diagnosed after the new treatment strategy. The important role of the time of HIV diagnosis on ART initiation identified in this study suggested that future implementation interventions may consider to modify the ART-related perceptions for HIV patients who diagnosed before the implementation of the new ART strategy, while expand the accessibility of ART service for those who diagnosed after the implementation of the new strategy.",

Case presentation The HIV infection of the patient was treated for the last four months with an integrase strand inhibitor (dolutegravir 50 mg/d) plus a NRTI backbone including lamivudine (150 mg/d) and abacavir (600 mg/d). In this renal transplant patient we hypothesize that the co-existence of sepsis, renal failure and an accumulation of lamivudine led to the development of fatal metabolic acidosis and hyperlactatemia. Although lamivudine is only rarely associated with hyperlactatemia, there is evidence that overdose may be a risk factor for developing it. In our patient the lamivudine concentration two days after stopping and during hemodiafiltration was more than 50 times higher than therapeutic target trough concentrations. Likely reasons for this were renal impairment and concurrent treatment with trimethoprim, known to inhibit the renal elimination of lamivudine. Conclusions NRTIs could trigger the development of hyperlactatemia in septic patients. The use of NRTI sparing regimens might be considered in the presence of this critical condition.",

    "abstract": "In 2018, approximately 1.6 million adolescents (aged 10-19) were living with HIV worldwide, with the highest HIV prevalence found in Eswatini. Adolescents and young adults living with HIV are a vulnerable population due to unique psychosocial challenges that come with having a stigmatizing disease. This group struggles more than other age-groups with medication adherence and requires novel approaches to supporting treatment, including peer-group encouragement, and self-expression.We piloted a theater camp for a group of adolescents and young adults enrolled at our HIV clinic in Mbabane, Eswatini, to determine the impact of having an outlet for creative expression and peer support on treatment and feelings of stigma. Pre- and post-camp surveys were administered to the participants to assess perceived stigma and impact of the camp. The results were analyzed using a Wilcoxon-signed rank test.Twenty individuals (ages 12-23) living with HIV participated in the camp concurrently with standard treatment. 25% showed a substantial decrease in viral load within six months of completing the camp (> 0.1 log10 change) while only 10% showed a substantial increase. Those who completed the survey felt the camp helped them with confidence, teamwork, and friendships. A comparison of pre- and post- surveys showed an overall decrease in personalized stigma. Quotes from participants reinforced these results.Adolescents and young adults living with HIV are an important population for further program development. Our study showed creative arts programming has beneficial psychosocial effects, aids in community building, and potentially enhances the effectiveness of medical treatment. Further programs and studies should continue to investigate creative arts as an avenue for self-expression and community building among vulnerable populations.",

However, it is not clear if there is a relevant protective effect against transmission and a beneficial effect in terms of HIV progression which cannot be attributed to CCR5 surface density alone. Therefore we investigated HIV-1 dependency factors (HDF) which might be differently regulated in CCR5 wild type (WT) and CCR5-delta32 heterozygous individuals.We examined CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from bone marrow samples from 19 healthy volunteers, 12 individuals with CCR5 WT and 7 with heterozygous CCR5-delta32 deletion. Samples were analyzed using a global gene expression oligonucleotide microarray (HG-U133plus 2.0, Affymetrix Inc.).A total of 205 genes were found with altered expression (3fold difference, present call rate of 75%, p < 0.05) and 7 of these had a connection to HIV-1 pathogenesis. In 4 genes: TOP1, CXCR2, SREBF2, and TAP we found a different regulation which was consistent with a supposed beneficial effect for CCR5-delta32 heterozygotes.The CCR5-delta32 deletion is associated with other HDFs in HIV-1 pathogenesis as a possible explanation for beneficial effects regarding the deletion leading to a variant expression profile in heterozygous carriers of this mutation.",

However, there is little evidence concerning the risk factors for and clinical characteristics of liver disease in antiretroviral (ARV)-treated HIV infection, in the absence of hepatitis B or C viral co-infection.A nested case-control study of HIV infected volunteers, matched by starting date of anti-retroviral treatment, was conducted in a Thai cohort studied from Nov 2002 - July 2012. Cases were defined as those subjects with an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT ≥ 40 IU/L) at two consecutive visits six months apart, while controls were defined as individuals who never demonstrated two consecutive elevated ALT results and had a normal ALT result (< 40 IU/L) at their last visit. Both groups had normal ALT levels prior to ARV initiation. Clinical demographics and risk factors for chronic hepatitis including HIV-related illness, ARV treatment and metabolic diseases were collected and analyzed. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for chronic hepatitis in HIV infection.A total of 124 matched pairs with HIV infection were followed over 3,195 person-years. The mean age (±SD) was 33.0 ± 7.3 years, with 41.1% of subjects being male. The incidence of chronic hepatitis was 5.4 per 100 person-years. The median time from initiation of ARV to chronic hepatitis was 1.3 years (IQR, 0.5-3.5). From univariate analysis; male sex, plasma HIV-1 RNA level > 5 log 10 copies/ml, metabolic syndrome at baseline visit, high BMI > 23 kg/m(2), abnormal HDL cholesterol at time of ALT elevation and treatment experience with NNRTI plus boosted PI were selected (p value < 0.2) to the final model of multivariate analysis. Male sex had 3.1 times greater risk of chronic hepatitis than the females by multivariate analysis (adjusted OR, 95% CI: 3.1, 1.5-6.3, p =0.002). High BMI ≥ 23 kg/m(2) was also associated with 2.4 times greater risk of chronic hepatitis (adjusted OR, 95% CI: 2.4, 1.2-4.8, p = 0.01).Chronic hepatitis in ARV-treated HIV-infected patients is common and may lead to a major health care problem. Male sex and high BMI ≥ 23 kg/m(2) carry higher risks for developing chronic hepatitis in this study. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for long-term hepatotoxicity.",

In control group we included 51 HIV patients without tuberculosis and on nevirapine-containing HAART. They were assessed for clinical and immunological response at the end of 24 and 48 weeks. Plasma nevirapine concentrations were measured at days 14, 28, 42 and 180 of starting HAART.97 out of 114 (85.1%) patients were alive at the end of 48 weeks. The CD4 cell count showed a mean increase of 108 vs.113 cells/mm3 (p=0.83) at 24 weeks of HAART in cases and controls respectively. Overall, 58.73% patients in cases had viral loads of less than 400 copies/ml at the end of 48 weeks.

This suggests that rifampicin-containing ATT may be co administered in resource limited setting with nevirapine-containing HAART regimen without substantial reduction in antiretroviral effectiveness. Larger sample sized studies and longer follow-up are required to identify populations of individuals where the reduction in nevirapine concentration may result in lower ART response or shorter response duration.",

Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine factors associated with ADIs. Results A total of 3721 individuals (81% male) initiated HAART during the study period. A total of 251 reports of ADIs were received from 214 unique patients. These occurred in a median of 4 months (IQR = 1-19 months) from HAART initiation. The proportion of individuals with a reported ADI did not change significantly from 4.6% in the earliest time period to 5.8% in the latest period (p = 0.181 for test of trend). There were no significant declines in any specific ADI over the study period.

The IFN-alpha receptors (R), IFN-gamma R, IFN-lambdas R and STAT1 mRNA and protein levels increased in acute HIV-1-infected patients (p < 0.01), in addition, Mx1 mRNA levels in acute HIV-1-infected patients are higher than those in HIV-negative subjects. IFN-lambdas R and IFN-alpha R mRNA levels are inversely correlated with CD4+ T-cell counts, but are positively correlated with viral loads. The dynamic changes of IFNs related genes in JAK-STAT pathway in acute HIV-1 infection will deepen our understanding of the roles of IFN-lambdas in HIV pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background With the advent of entry inhibitors, monitoring of viral tropism in the clinical setting is important. Conventional methods are cell-based and lengthy, therefore V3 sequence based prediction algorithms are becoming increasingly attractive as monitoring tools. Here we report a comparative analysis of viral tropism of strains circulating in Cameroon where diverse and emerging variant strains are prevalent. Methods Viruses were isolated from 17 HIV positive individuals from three cities in Cameroon. Ghost cell lines expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4 with CD4 or CD4 alone (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) were used to determine co-receptor usage. HIV replication was determined by measuring p24 antigen levels. Plasma viral load (VL) was determined using the Versant bDNA assay. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on the V3 region and sequences were edited, aligned and translated into amino acids as described in the algorithm. Bio-informatics tools based on the 11/25 and charge rule were used to predict co-receptor usage. Results The majority of patient isolates in our study were CRF02_AG or CRF02_AG containing recombinants. Tropism of these complex viruses based on the cell culture assay was determined to be R5 in 15/17 (88.2%) patients. However, two patient isolates were dual tropic R5X4 and had drug-specific mutations. Of these two patients, one was on antiretroviral treatment with a VL of 20,899 copies/ml and the other was drug-naïve with 141,198 copies/ml. Genotype based prediction was overall in good agreement with phenotype for R5 viruses, where 93% (14/15) of results were comparable, dual tropic viruses being reported as X4 viruses by prediction. Conclusion Our results indicate that most HIV strains in Cameroon were R5 tropic and some harbored drug-resistant mutations. V3 sequence based prediction compared well with cell based assays for R5 strains and may be useful even in settings where highly diverse strains are prevalent.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent with the UNAIDS 90-90-90 and NHAS plans, the District of Columbia (DC) launched its 90/90/90/50 plan (Plan) in 2015. The Plan proposes that by 2020, 90% of all DC residents will know their HIV status; 90% of residents living with HIV will be in sustained treatment; 90% of those in treatment will reach “Viral Suppression” and DC will achieve 50% reduction of new HIV cases. To achieve these goals targeted prevention strategies are imperative for areas where the relative risk (RR) of not being linked to care (NL), not retained in any care (NRC) and low viral suppression (NVSP) are highest in the District. These outcomes are denoted in this study as poor outcomes of HIV care continuum. This study applies the Bayesian model for RR for area specific random effects to identify the census tracts with poor HIV care continuum outcomes for DC. This analysis was conducted using cases diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 and reported to the surveillance system from the District of Columbia Department of Health (DC DOH), HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD and TB Administration. The jurisdictions of the District of Columbia is divided into 179 census tracts. It is challenging to plot sparse data in ‘small’ local administrative areas, characteristically which may have a single-count datum for each geographic area. Bayesian methods overcome this problem by assimilating prior information to the underlying RR, making the predicted RR estimates robust. The RR of NL is higher in 59 (33%) out of 179 census tracts in DC. The RR of NRC was high in 46 (26%) of the census tracts while 52 census tracts (29%) show a high risk of having NVSP among its residents. This study also identifies clear correlated heterogeneity or clustering is evident in the northern tracts of the district. The study finds census tracts with higher RR of poor linkage to care outcomes in the District. These results will inform the Plan which aims to increase targeted testing leading to early initiation of antiretroviral therapy. The uniqueness of this study lies in its translational scope where surveillance data can be used to inform local public health programs and enhance the quality of health for the people with HIV.",

    "abstract": "Like other countries, Tanzania instituted mobile and outreach testing approaches to address low HIV testing rates at health facilities and enhance linkage to care. Available evidence from hard-to-reach rural settings of Mbeya region, Tanzania suggests that clients testing HIV+ at facility-based sites are more likely to link to care, and to link sooner, than those testing at mobile sites. This paper (1) describes the populations accessing HIV testing at mobile/outreach and facility-based testing sites, and (2) compares processes and dynamics from testing to linkage to care between these two testing models from the same study context. An explanatory sequential mixed-method study (a) reviewed records of all clients (n = 11,773) testing at 8 mobile and 8 facility-based testing sites over 6 months; (b), reviewed guidelines; (c) observed HIV testing sites (n = 10) and Care and Treatment Centers (CTCs) (n = 8); (d) applied questionnaires at 0, 3 and 6 months to a cohort of 1012 HIV newly-diagnosed clients from the 16 sites; and (e) conducted focus group discussions (n = 8) and in-depth qualitative interviews with cohort members (n = 10) and health care providers (n = 20). More clients tested at mobile/outreach than facility-based sites (56% vs 44% of 11,733, p < 0.001). Mobile site clients were more likely to be younger and male (p < 0.001). More clients testing at facility sites were HIV positive (21.5% vs. 7.9% of 11,733, p < 0.001). All sites in both testing models adhered to national HIV testing and care guidelines. Staff at mobile sites showed more proactive efforts to support linkage to care, and clients report favouring the confidentiality of mobile sites to avoid stigma. Clients who tested at mobile/outreach sites faced longer delays and waiting times at treatment sites (CTCs). Rural mobile/outreach HIV testing sites reach more people than facility based sites but they reach a different clientèle which is less likely to be HIV +ve and appears to be less \"linkage-ready\". Despite more proactive care and confidentiality at mobile sites, linkage to care is worse than for clients who tested at facility-based sites. Our findings highlight a combination of (a) patient-level factors, including stigma; and (b) well-established procedures and routines for each step between testing and initiation of treatment in facility-based sites. Long waiting times at treatment sites are a further barrier that must be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Long-term success of cART is possible if the regimen is convenient and less-toxic. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of switching from a first-line NNRTI or boosted PI-based regimens to RPV-based regimens among virologically suppressed participants in resource-limited setting (RLS). Methods This is a prospective cohort study. Participants with plasma HIV-RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL receiving cART were switched from a PI- or NNRTI-based, to a RPV-based regimen between January 2011 and April 2018. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL after 12 months of RPV. The secondary endpoint was the virological response at 24 months and safety endpoint (change in lipid profiles and kidney function from baseline to 12 months). Results A total of 320 participants were enrolled into the study. The rationale for switching to RPV was based on toxicity of the current regimen (57%) or desire to simplify cART (41%). Totally, 177 (55%) and 143 (45%) participants were on NNRTI and boosted PI, respectively, prior to switching to RPV. After 12 months, 298 (93%) participants maintained virological suppression. There were significant improvements in the lipid parameters: TC (− 21 (IQR − 47 to 1) mg/dL; p &lt; 0.001), LDL (− 14 (IQR − 37 to 11) mg/dL; p &lt; 0.001) and TG (− 22 (IQR − 74 to 10) mg/dL; p &lt; 0.001). Also, there was a small but statistically significant decrease in eGFR (− 4.3 (IQR − 12 to 1.1) mL/min per 1.73m2; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions In RLS where integrase inhibitors are not affordable, RPV-based regimens are a good alternative option for PLHIV who cannot tolerate first-line NNRTI or boosted PI regimen, without prior NNRTI/PI resistance.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Entry inhibitors, such as Maraviroc, hold promise as components of HIV treatment and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis in Africa. Maraviroc inhibits the interaction between HIV Envelope gp120 V3-loop and CCR5 coreceptor. HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1-C) is predominant in Southern Africa and preferably uses CCR5 co-receptor. Therefore, a significant proportion of HIV-1-C CXCR4 utilizing viruses (X4) may compromise the effectiveness of Maraviroc. This analysis examined coreceptor preferences in early and chronic HIV-1-C infections across Africa. Methods African HIV-1-C Envelope gp120 V3-loop sequences sampled from 1988 to 2014 were retrieved from Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. Sequences from early infections (&lt; 186 days post infection) and chronic infections (&gt; 186 days post infection) were analysed for predicted co-receptor preferences using Geno2Pheno [Coreceptor] 10% FPR, Phenoseq-C, and PSSMsinsi web tools. V3-loop diversity was determined, and viral subtype was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. National treatment guidelines across Africa were reviewed for Maraviroc recommendation. Results Sequences from early (n = 6316) and chronic (n = 7338) HIV-1-C infected individuals from 10 and 15 African countries respectively were available for analyses. Overall, 518/6316 (8.2%; 95% CI 0.7–9.3) of early sequences were X4, with Ethiopia and Malawi having more than 10% each. For chronic infections, 8.3% (95% CI 2.4–16.2) sequences were X4 viruses, with Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe having more than 10% each. For sequences from early chronic infections (&lt; 1 year post infection), the prevalence of X4 viruses was 8.5% (95% CI 2.6–11.2). In late chronic infections (≥ 5 years post infection), X4 viruses were observed in 36% (95% CI − 16.3 to 49.9), with two countries having relatively high X4 viruses: South Africa (43%) and Malawi (24%). The V3-loop amino acid sequence were more variable in X4 viruses in chronic infections compared to acute infections, with South Africa, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe showing the highest levels of V3-loop diversity. All sequences were phylogenetically confirmed as HIV-1-C and clustered according to their co-receptor tropism. In Africa, Maraviroc is registered only in South Africa and Uganda. Conclusions Our analyses illustrate that X4 viruses are present in significantly similar proportions in early and early chronic HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals across Africa. In contrast, in late chronic infections, X4 viruses increase 3–5 folds. We can draw two inferences from our observations: (1) to enhance the utility of Maraviroc in chronic HIV subtype C infections in Africa, prior virus co-receptor determination is needed; (2) on the flip side, research on the efficacy of CXCR4 antagonists for HIV-1-C infections is encouraged. Currently, the use of Maraviroc is very limited in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The anti-retroviral combination of abacavir/lamivudine plus rilpivirine (ABC/3TC/RPV) is not recommended by international guidelines as the first-line regimen. However, it is potent, well-tolerated, and affordable, especially in resource-limited settings. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of ABC/3TC/RPV as an initial regimen for treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients. Methods A retrospective study was conducted in the largest HIV care centre in Singapore, with data collected June 2011 to September 2017. All treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults prescribed ABC/3TC as part of their initial anti-retroviral therapy regimen were included. The third drug was a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) such as RPV or efavirenz (EFV), or boosted protease-inhibitor (PI). Patients were followed up for 48 weeks. The primary end-point was the percentage of patients achieving virologic suppression, analysed using on-treatment analysis. Secondary outcomes included CD4-count change, treatment discontinuation and treatment-related adverse events. Results 170 patients were included in the study, 66 patients in the RPV group, 104 patients in the comparator group (EFV or boosted PI). 96% (n = 24) in the RPV group and 87% (n = 26) in the comparator group achieved viral suppression at 48 weeks (p = 0.28). Median (interquartile range) time to viral suppression was similar: 17 (14–24) weeks in the RPV group, and 21 (13–26) weeks in the comparator group. There were no statistically significant differences in the CD4 count between the two groups. 14% (n = 9) of patients on RPV discontinued treatment before 48 weeks, compared to 30% (n = 31) from the comparator group (p = 0.053). Of these, 23 discontinuations were due to drug adverse effects, and only 1 attributed to RPV (p &lt; 0.01). One patient in each group had virologic failure. Conclusion RPV is effective, safe and considerably more tolerable than compared to NNRTI or boosted PI in ABC/3TC-containing regimens for treatment-naïve patients. It offers an affordable and attractive option, especially in resource-limited settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Perinatal HIV infection negatively impacts cognitive functioning of children, main domains affected are working memory, processing speed and executive function. Early ART, even when interrupted, improves neurodevelopmental outcomes. Diffusion tension imaging (DTI) is a sensitive tool assessing white matter damage. We hypothesised that white matter measures in regions showing HIV-related alterations will be associated with lower neurodevelopmental scores in specific domains related to the functionality of the affected tracts. Methods DTI was performed on children in a neurodevelopmental sub study from the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral (CHER) trial. Voxel-based group comparisons to determine regions where fractional anisotropy and mean diffusion differed between HIV+ and uninfected children were done. Locations of clusters showing group differences were identified using the Harvard–Oxford cortical and subcortical and John Hopkins University WM tractography atlases provided in FSL. This is a second review of DTI data in this cohort, which was reported in a previous study. Neurodevelopmental assessments including GMDS and Beery-Buktenica tests were performed and correlated with DTI parameters in abnormal white matter. Results 38 HIV+ children (14 male, mean age 64.7 months) and 11 controls (4 male, mean age 67.7 months) were imaged. Two clusters with lower fractional anisotropy and 7 clusters with increased mean diffusion were identified in the HIV+ group. The only neurodevelopmental domain with a trend of difference between the HIV+ children and controls ( p = 0.08), was Personal Social Quotient which correlated to improved myelination of the forceps minor in the control group. As a combined group there was a negative correlation between visual perception and radial diffusion in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, which may be related to the fact that these tracts, forming part of the visual perception pathway, are at a crucial state of development at age 5. Conclusion Even directed neurodevelopmental tests will underestimate the degree of microstructural white matter damage detected by DTI. The visual perception deficit detected in the entire study population should be further examined in a larger study.",

Methods This was a longitudinal retrospective cross-sectional study that used secondary data from the Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). We examined RIC in 798 adult PLWH + T2DM who visited a CNICS clinic at least once in 2015. Six measures of RIC were examined: missed visits [measured as a continuous variable (total number of missed visits) and dichotomous variable (0 = never missed, 1 = missed)], visit adherence, 6-month visit gap, 4-month visit constancy, and the Health and Resources Services Administration HIV/AIDS Bureau’s RIC measure. We calculated Spearman correlation coefficients and conducted logistic regression and multi-group path analysis. Results Most RIC measures were significantly correlated (p &lt; 0.05) with one another; only 4-month visit constancy was not correlated with other measures. Except for the number of missed visits in older adult PLWH + T2DM, we found no significant relationships between RIC measures and CD4 cell count using logistic regression. However, multi-group path analysis demonstrated significant positive relationships between most RIC measures and CD4 cell count in both age groups. In younger adults living with HIV (YALWH) + T2DM, HbA1c level, but not CD4 count, was significantly associated with most RIC measures. Conclusions RIC is related to disease control (CD4 cell count and HbA1c level) in PLWH + T2DM and notably, HbA1c level was only significantly affected in YALWH + T2DM. A future study is needed to find more accurate reasons for the fact that only HbA1c level had significant relationships in YALWH + T2DM. The findings from this study provide guidance in measuring RIC in PLWH who have comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In the era of “test and treat strategy”, CD4 testing remains an important tool for monitoring HIV-infected individuals. Since conventional methods of CD4 count measurement are costly and cumbersome, POC CD4 counting technique are more affordable and practical for countries with limited resources. Before introducing such methods in Morocco, we decided to assess their reliability. Methods In this study 92 blood samples from HIV-infected patients, were tested by PIMA and FACSPresto to derive CD4 count. Flow cytometry using FacsCalibur, was used as reference method for CD4 count comparison. Linear regression, Bland–Altman analysis were performed to assess correlation and agreement between these POC methods and the reference method. In addition, sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and misclassification percentage at 350 and 200 CD4 count thresholds; were also determined. Finally, because FACSPresto can also measure hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, 52 samples were used to compare FACSPresto against an automated hematology analyzer. Results The coefficient of determination R 2 was 0.93 for both methods. Bland–Altman analysis displayed a mean bias of − 32.3 and − 8.1 cells/µl for PIMA and FACSPresto, respectively. Moreover, with a threshold of 350 CD4 count, PIMA displayed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, were 88.57%, 94.12%, 91.18%, 92.31%; respectively. FACSPresto showed 88.23%, 96.23%, 93.75% and 92.73%; respectively. Furthermore, the upward misclassification percentage was 8.57 and 5.88%, for PIMA and FACSPresto, respectively; whereas the downward misclassification percentage was 7.84% and 7.54%; respectively. With 200 cells/µl threshold, PIMA had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 83.33%, 98.53%, 93.75% and 95.71%, respectively. Regarding FACSPresto, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV was 82.35%, 98.57%, 88.57% and 95.83%; respectively. Upward misclassification percentage was 5.56% and 5.88%, for PIMA and FACSPresto, respectively; whereas downward misclassification percentage was 4.41% and 4.29%; respectively. Finally, the hemoglobin measurement evaluation displayed an R 2 of 0.80 and a mean bias of − 0.12 with a LOA between − 1.75 and 1.51. Conclusion When compared to the reference method, PIMA and FACSPresto have shown good performance, for CD4 counting. The introduction of such POC technology will speed up the uptake of patients in the continuum of HIV care, in our country.",

    "abstract": "Long acting and permanent contraceptive methods by far are the most effective, very safe and convenient methods than short acting contraceptive methods. But in less developed countries, use of long acting reversible contraceptive or permanent methods (LARCs/PMs) is very low. Therefore the aim of this study was to identify determinants of long acting contraceptive method utilization among HIV positive reproductive age women.An institutional based case control study was conducted among random sample of 354 HIV positive reproductive age women (total of 97.8% response rate) at Anti-Retroviral Therapy clinics from February 20 to March 20, 2019. Case to control ratio was 1:2. A structured questionnaire and information recorded from ART card review were used to collect the data. Each variable was entered in Bivariate analysis with dependent variables and those variables with P-value of ≤ 0.25 were included in the Multivariate analysis.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV status disclosure facilitates receipt of HIV prevention and treatment services. Although disclosure to sexual partners, family members or friends has been extensively studied, disclosure to community-based HIV programs is missing. This study assesses the magnitude of, and factors associated with undisclosed HIV status to a community-based HIV prevention program among caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Tanzania. Methods Data are from the USAID-funded Kizazi Kipya project that seeks to increase uptake of HIV, health, and social services by OVC and their caregivers in Tanzania. Data on OVC caregivers who were enrolled in the project during January–March 2017 in 18 regions of Tanzania were analyzed. Caregivers included were those who had complete information on their HIV status disclosure, household socioeconomic status, and sociodemographic characteristics. HIV status was self-reported, with undisclosed status representing all those who knew their HIV status but did not disclose it. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, with caregivers’ HIV status disclosure being the outcome variable was conducted. Results The analysis was based on 59,683 OVC caregivers (mean age = 50.4 years), 71.2% of whom were female. Of these, 37.2% did not disclose their HIV status to the USAID Kizazi Kipya program at the time of enrollment. Multivariate analysis showed that the likelihood of HIV status non-disclosure was significantly higher among: male caregivers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16–1.28); unmarried (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.03–1.23); widowed (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.07–1.18); those without health insurance (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.28–1.45); age 61 + years (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.59–1.88); those with physical or mental disability (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.04–1.25); and rural residents (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.34–1.86). HIV status non-disclosure was less likely with higher education ( p &lt; 0.001); and with better economic status ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion While improved education, economic strengthening support and expanding health insurance coverage appear to improve HIV status disclosure, greater attention may be required for men, unmarried, widowed, rural residents, and the elderly populations for their higher likelihood to conceal HIV status. This is a clear missed opportunity for timely care and treatment services for those that may be HIV positive. Further support is needed to support disclosure in this population.",

The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of the lipoarabinomannan antigen test (LAM-test) with and without α-mannosidase pre-treated urine in a cohort of PLWH in primary care clinics in Guatemala. We further determined TB incidence, and mortality rates and its risk factors in PLWH with TB symptoms. Methods Prospective longitudinal study of PLWH with TB symptoms. Urine samples were collected at 2 HIV sites to test the sensitivity of the LAM-test in urine with and without α-mannosidase pre-treatment. A composite reference standard of either a positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex culture and/or GeneXpert ® MTB/RIF (Xpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) results was used in the LAM-test diagnostic accuracy studies. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to study mortality predictors. Results The overall sensitivity of the LAM-test was of 56.1% with 95% CI of (43.3–68.3). There were no differences in the LAM-test sensitivity neither by hospital nor by CD4 T cell values. LAM-test sensitivity in PLWH with &lt; 200 CD4 T cells/µl was of 62.2% (95% CI 46.5–76.2). There were no significant differences in sensitivity when comparing LAM-test results obtained from untreated vs. α-mannosidase treated urine [55.2% (95% CI 42.6–67.4) vs. 56.9% (95% CI 44–69.2), respectively]. TB incidence in our cohort was of 21.4/100 person years (PYs) (95% CI 16.6–27.6), and mortality rate was of 11.1/100 PYs (95% CI 8.2–15.0). Importantly, PLWH with a positive LAM-test result had an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of death of 1.98 (1.0–3.8) with a significant p value of 0.044 when compared to PLWH with a negative LAM-test result. Conclusions In this study, α-mannosidase treatment of urine did not significantly increase the LAM-test performance, however; this needs to be further evaluated in a large-scale study due to our study limitations. Importantly, high rates of TB incidence and mortality were found, and a positive LAM-test result predicted mortality in PLWH with TB clinical symptoms.",

Enfuvirtide is therefore a welcome addition to the antiretroviral management of patients with multiclass resistant virus, given the low risk of systemic toxicities and novel mechanism of action relative to existing drug classes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ENF plus optimized background regimen (OBR) in a Mexican cohort of highly HIV-1 ARV-experienced patients.Prospective cohort of treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected adults with virological failure who started therapy with an ENF-containing regimen. The effectiveness of ENF treatment was evaluated with percentages of undetectable HIV-1 RNA viral load after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, and changes in CD4+ cell counts.Forty patients >18 years were included. After 24 weeks of treatment, 91% of patients had HIV-1 RNA viral load <400 copies/mL and 65.8% had <50 copies/mL. At week 48 of treatment, 81.4% of the patients had HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL and 55.5% had <50 copies/mL; in both cases p <0.0001 compared to baseline.

    "abstract": "Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) testing, an in vivo assessment of cell-mediated immunity, is a predictor of HIV disease progression beyond CD4 cell count. We investigated whether preserved DTH responsiveness was characteristic of HIV controllers compared to non-controllers and individuals on suppressive HAART.DTH testing consisted of ≥ 3 recall antigens applied approximately every 6 months. DTH responses were classified by the number of positive skin tests: anergic (0), partial anergic (1), or non-anergic (≥ 2). HIV controllers were compared to treatment naïve non-controllers (n = 3822) and a subgroup of non-controllers with VL < 400 copies/mL on their initial HAART regimen (n = 491). The proportion of non-anergic results at first DTH testing was similar for HIV controllers compared to non-controllers (81.9% vs. 77.6%; P = 0.22), but tended to be greater in HIV controllers compared to the HAART subgroup (81.9% vs. 74.5%; P = 0.07). Complete anergy was observed in 14 (10.1%) HIV controllers with CD4 counts ≥ 400 cells/uL. For longitudinal testing, the average percentage of non-anergic DTH determinations per participant was higher in HIV controllers compared to non-controllers (81.2 ± 31.9% vs. 70.7 ± 36.8%; P = 0.0002), however this difference was eliminated with stratification by CD4 count: 200-399 (83.4 ± 35.6% vs. 71.9 ± 40.9%; P = 0.15) and > 400 cells/uL (81.2 ± 31.5% vs. 80.4 ± 32.7%; P = 0.76).Spontaneous virologic control was not associated with DTH responsiveness, and several HIV controllers were anergic despite having elevated CD4 counts. These findings suggest that cellular immunity assessed by DTH is not a principal factor contributing to spontaneous virologic suppression in HIV controllers.",

Prospective clinic based study that enrolled patients referred for HCV therapy consideration. A hepatitis symptom inventory and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were administered to HIV/HCV individuals. The symptom inventory was factor analyzed and subscale reliability estimated with Cronbach's alpha. Predictive validity was evaluated using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Predictors of HCV treatment were identified using logistic regression. Between April 2008 to July 2010, 126 HIV/HCV co-infected patients were enrolled in the study. Factor analysis using data from 126 patients yielded a three-factor structure explaining 60% of the variance for the inventory. Factor 1 (neuropsychiatric symptoms) had 14 items, factor 2 (somatic symptoms) had eleven items, and factor 3 (sleep symptoms) had two items, explaining 28%, 22% and 11% of the variance, respectively. The three factor subscales demonstrated high intrinsic consistency reliability. GEE modeling of the 32 patients who initiated HCV therapy showed that patients developed worsening neuropsychiatric and somatic symptoms following HCV therapy with stable sleep symptoms. Bivariate analyses identified the following as predictors of HCV therapy initiation: lower HIV log10 RNA, lower scores for neuropsychiatric, somatic and sleep symptoms, lower CES-D scores and white ethnicity. In stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, low neuropsychiatric symptom score was the strongest independent predictor of HCV therapy initiation and HIV log10 RNA was inversely associated with a decision to initiate HCV treatment. A 41-item hepatitis-related symptom inventory was found to have a clinically meaningful 3-factor structure with excellent internal consistency reliability and predictive validity. In adjusted analysis, low neuropsychiatric symptom scores and controlled HIV infection were independent predictors of HCV treatment initiation. The usefulness of the HCV symptom inventory in monitoring HCV treatment should be evaluated prospectively.",

Alterations of CD8 + T cells and some of their subpopulations, such as interleukin (IL)-17-producing cells, are evidenced in treated individuals and are associated with systemic inflammation and adverse disease outcomes. We sought to evaluate if different CD8 + T cell subsets are differentially normalized during a clinical follow-up of people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving suppressive cART. Methods We explored the changes in the frequencies, activation/exhaustion phenotypes (HLA-DR, CD38, PD-1, and TIM-3), and function (total and HIV-specific cells expressing CD107a, perforin, granzyme B, interferon [IFN]-γ and IL-17) of CD8 + T cells from early-treated PLWH receiving cART in a 1-year follow-up, using a multidimensional flow cytometry approach. Results Despite continuous cART-induced viral suppression and recovery of CD4 + T cells, after a 1-year follow-up, the CD8 + T cell counts, CD4:CD8 ratio, PD-1 expression, and IL-17 production by CD8 + T cells exhibited incomplete normalization compared with seronegative controls. However, the proportion of CD8 + T cells with an exhausted phenotype (co-expressing PD-1 andTIM-3), and cells co-expressing cytotoxic molecules (Perforin and Granzyme B), reached normalization. Conclusions Although suppressive cART achieves normalization of CD4 + T cell counts, only particular subsets of CD8 + T cells are more rapidly normalized in PLWH receiving cART, which could be routinely used as biomarkers for therapy efficiency in these patients.",

The prevalence of HIV is estimated to be 21.1%, 11.4%, and 9.3% among Female Sex Workers, Men who have Sex with Men, and People Who Injected Drugs, respectively. This has prompted a closer examination of the factors contributing to this trend, with a particular focus on the low coverage of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in these key populations. The current prevalence reported in December 2023 signals a critical turning point that necessitates a reevaluation of the barriers and facilitators of Pre Exposure Prophylaxis intervention to combat the epidemic. It is imperative to acknowledge the severity of the situation and take decisive action to prevent further spread of the virus in the Isles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a highly dangerous infectious disease caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), a virus that attacks the human immune system. To explore the correlation between intestinal fungal community and immune function (Immune cells and inflammatory factors) in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The feces and blood samples were collected from two groups of subjects: PLWHA and healthy controls. High-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1, flow cytometry, and ELISA were performed to analyze the differences and correlations between fungal microbiota, cellular immune status and serum inflammatory factors in the two groups. There were significant differences in the composition of fungal microbiota between the two groups. The relative abundance of Candida , Bjerkandera , and Xeromyces in PLWHA was significantly higher than that of healthy volunteers ( P &lt; 0.01), while the relative abundance of Mycospaerella , Xeroxysium , Penicillium , and Glomerella in PLWHA was significantly lower than that of healthy volunteers. The correlation analysis results show that Mycospaerella and Xeromyces are significantly positively correlated with CD4 + /CD8 + T cells and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4. On the other hand, Candida was positively correlated with pro-inflammatory factors negatively correlated with CD4 + /CD8 + T cells and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4, while it is positively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. The significant increase in the relative abundance of Candida may be one of the important causes of intestinal damage in PLWHA. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the relationship between fungal microbiota structure and immune function in the gut ecology of PLWHA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is pivotal in extending the lives of people living with HIV (PLWH) and minimizing transmission. Rapid ART initiation, defined as commencing ART within seven days of HIV diagnosis, is recommended for all PLWH. Method A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. This study included PLWH diagnosed between January 2018 and December 2021 and treated by December 2022. Factors influencing rapid ART initiation were examined using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Results The study analyzed 1310 cases. The majority were male (77.4%), over 50 years old (46.7%), and contracted HIV through heterosexual transmission (70.0%). Rapid ART initiation was observed in 36.6% ( n = 479) of cases, with a cumulative treatment rate of 72.9% within 30 days post-diagnosis. Heterosexual contact was associated with longer intervals from diagnosis to treatment initiation compared to homosexual contact (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.813, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.668–0.988). Individuals older than 50 years (Adjusted HR = 1.852, 95%CI: 1.149–2.985) were more likely to initiate ART rapidly. Conversely, treatment at the Second Public Hospital (Adjusted HR = 0.483, 95% CI: 0.330–0.708) and a CD4 cell counts above 500 (Adjusted HR = 0.553, 95% CI: 0.332–0.921) were associated with a lower likelihood of initiating treatment within seven days. Conclusions A higher CD4 cell counts and receiving care in local public hospitals may deter rapid ART initiation. Providing CD4 counts results at diagnosis and offering testing and treatment in the same facility could enhance the rate of rapid ART initiation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Syphilis is an infection caused by the bacteria T reponema pallidum . It is mainly transmitted through oral, vaginal and anal sex, in pregnancy and through blood transfusion. Syphilis develops in primary, secondary, latent and tertiary stages and presents with different clinical features at each stage. Infected patients can remain asymptomatic for several years and, without treatment, can, in extreme cases, manifest as damage in several organs and tissues, including the brain, nervous tissue, eyes, ear and soft tissues. In countries with a high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) burden, syphilis increases the risk of HIV infections. We report the case of a young HIV-positive black woman who presented with alopecia and hypopigmentation as features of secondary syphilis. Case presentation A virologically suppressed 29-year-old woman on Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) presented with a short history of generalized hair loss associated with a non-itchy maculopapular rash and skin depigmentation on the feet. Limited laboratory testing confirmed a diagnosis of secondary syphilis. She was treated with Benzathine Penicillin 2.4MU. After receiving three doses of the recommended treatment, the presenting features cleared, and the patient recovered fully. Conclusion This case demonstrates the importance of a high index of clinical suspicion and testing for syphilis in patients presenting with atypical clinical features of secondary syphilis, such as hair loss and hypopigmentation. It also highlights the challenges in diagnosing and clinically managing syphilis in a resource-limited setting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Initiation of ART among people living with HIV (PLWH) having a CD4 count ≤ 350cells/µl, produces poor immunological recovery, putting them at a high risk of opportunistic infections. To mitigate this, PLWH on ART in Uganda frequently use herbal remedies like Artemisia annua and Moringa oleifera , but their clinical benefits and potential antiretroviral (ARV) interactions remain unknown. This study examined the impact of A. annua and M. oleifera on CD4 count, viral load, and potential ARV interactions among PLWH on ART at an HIV clinic in Uganda. Methods 282 HIV-positive participants on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a CD4 count ≤ 350cells/µl were randomized in a double-blind clinical trial to receive daily, in addition to their routine standard of care either; 1) A. annua leaf powder, 2) A. annua plus M. oleifera , and 3 ) routine standard of care only. Change in the CD4 count at 12 months was our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included changes in viral load, complete blood count, and ARV plasma levels. Participants were followed up for a year and outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Results At 12 months of patient follow-up, in addition to standard of care, administration of A. annua + M. oleifera resulted in an absolute mean CD4 increment of 105.06 cells/µl, ( p &lt; 0.001), while administration of A. annua plus routine standard of care registered an absolute mean CD4 increment of 60.84 cells/µl, ( p = 0.001) compared to the control group. The A. annua plus M. oleifera treatment significantly reduced viral load ( p = 0.022) and increased platelet count ( p = 0.025) and white blood cell counts ( p = 0.003) compared to standard care alone, with no significant difference in ARV plasma levels across the groups. Conclusion A combination of A. annua and M. oleifera leaf powders taken once a day together with the routine standard of care produced a significant increase in CD4 count, WBCs, platelets, and viral load suppression among individuals on ART. A. annua and M. oleifera have potential to offer an affordable alternative remedy for managing HIV infection, particularly in low-resource communities lacking ART access.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Intestinal parasitic infections (IP) are a major source of morbidity in people living with Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly in resource-limited settings, mostly as a result of high viral load. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the magnitude of intestinal parasitic infections and its determinants among patients with HIV/AIDS attending public health facilities in East and West Gojam Zones in Ethiopia. Methods Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 327 people living with HIV visiting public health facilities from December 2022 to May 2023. A simple random sampling technique was used to recruit participants. Face-to-face interviews were used to collect socio-demographics and determinants. The fresh stool was collected from each patient, transported, and tested in accordance with laboratory standard operating procedures of wet mount, formol-ether concentration technique, and modified acid-fast staining. Data were entered and analyzed in the statistical package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. A 95% CI with p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The overall prevalence of IP in patients with HIV/AIDS was 19.3% (63/327). Hookworm was the most identified parasite 33.3% (21/63) followed by E.histolytica 17% (11/63) and G. lamblia 14.3% (9/63). Parasitic infections were significantly higher among viral load &gt; 1000cps/ml ( p = 0.035), WHO stage 4 ( p = 0.002), CD4 &lt; 200 cell/mm 3 ( p = 0.001), and bare foot walking ( p = 0.001). Conclusion IP infections are moderately high among patients with HIV/AIDS in the study area. The proportion of parasites was greatly affected by high viral load, WHO stage 4, CD4 &lt; 200 cell/mm 3 , and being barefoot; this gives valuable insight to health professionals, health planners and community health workers. As a result, viral load monitoring, and WHO stage controlling were periodically assessed in patients with HIV/AIDS. Health education, awareness creation, routine stool examination, and environmental hygiene were regularly advocated to increase the life of patients with HIV/AIDS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The association between HIV infection and increased cardiometabolic risk, attributed to chronic inflammation in people living with HIV (PLWH) and/or antiretroviral therapy (ART) effects, has been inconsistent. In this study, we aimed to assess the associations of HIV-related factors with hypertension (HTN) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the potential mediation effects of body mass index (BMI) in the associations between ART use and HTN or T2DM in PLWH in Cameroon. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 14,119 adult PLWH from Cameroon enrolled in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) between 2016 and 2021. HTN was defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg and/or current use of antihypertensive medication, while T2DM was defined as fasting blood sugar ≥ 126 mg/dL and/or use of antidiabetic medications. Univariable and multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses examined the associations of factors with HTN alone, T2DM alone, and both (HTN + T2DM). Mediation analyses were conducted to assess the potential mediation roles of BMI, while controlling for age, sex, and smoking. Results Of the 14,119 participants, 9177 (65%) were women, with a median age of 42 (25 th –75th percentiles: 35–51) years. Age &gt; 50 years was associated with HTN alone, T2DM alone, and HTN + T2DM compared to the age group 19–29 years. Men had higher odds of having HTN + T2DM. Overweight and obesity were predictors of HTN alone compared to being underweight. WHO stages II and III HIV disease were inversely associated with HTN alone compared to stage I. The odds of diabetes alone were lower with ART use. BMI partially mediated the association between ART use and hypertension, with a proportion of mediation effect of 49.6% (all p &lt; 0.02). However, BMI did not mediate the relationship between ART use and diabetes. Conclusions Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were strongly associated with hypertension among PLWH, while HIV-related exposures had smaller associations. BMI partially mediated the association between ART use and hypertension. This study emphasizes the importance of screening, monitoring, and managing HTN and T2DM in older, male, and overweight/obese PLWH. Further research on the associations of HIV disease stage and ART use with HTN and T2DM is warranted.",

The objective of this review was to assess the pooled magnitude of MTCT of HIV and its risk factors among mother-infant pairs who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) after Option B+ in Ethiopia. Methods A systematic search of literature from PubMed, Hinari, African Journals Online (AJOL), Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases was conducted from June 11, 2013 to August 1, 2023. The authors used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to guide the article selection process and reporting. Observational studies that reported the magnitude and/or risk factors on MTCT of HIV among mother-infant pairs who initiated ART after the implementation of Option B+ in Ethiopia were included. We applied a random-effect model meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled magnitude and risk factors of MTCT of HIV. A funnel plot and Egger’s regression test were employed to check publication bias, and heterogeneity was assessed using I 2 statistics. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database with registration ID number CRD42022325938. Result Eighteen published articles on the magnitude of MTCT and 16 published articles on its risk factors were included in this review. The pooled magnitude of MTCT of HIV after the Option B+ program in Ethiopia was 4.05% (95% CI 3.09, 5.01). Mothers who delivered their infants at home [OR: 9.74; (95% CI: 6.89–13.77)], had not been on ART intervention [OR: 19.39; (95% CI: 3.91–96.18)], had poor adherence to ART [OR: 7.47; (95% CI: 3.40–16.45)], initiated ART during pregnancy [OR: 5.09; (95% CI: 1.73–14.97)], had WHO clinical stage 2 and above [OR: 4.95; (95% CI: 1.65–14.88]], had a CD4 count below 350 at enrolment [OR: 5.78; (95% CI: 1.97–16.98], had no or low male partner involvement [OR: 5.92; (95% CI: 3.61–9.71]] and whose partner was not on ART [OR: 8.08; (95% CI: 3.27–19.93]] had higher odds of transmitting HIV to their infants than their counterparts. Conclusion This review showed that the pooled magnitude of MTCT of HIV among mother-infant pairs who initiated ART after the Option B + program in Ethiopia is at the desired target of the WHO, which is less than 5% in breastfeeding women. Home delivery, lack of male partner involvement, advanced HIV-related disease, lack of PMTCT intervention, and poor ARV adherence were significant risk factors for MTCT of HIV in Ethiopia.",

However, how to measure the status of viral suppression varies, and it is hard to indicate the quality of HIV care. The study aimed to examine the long-term viral load suppression in these cases and explore potential factors affecting the control of long-term viral load. Methods This study analyzed viral load testing data from HIV patients who are still alive during the period from notification up to 2019–2020. Three indicators were calculated, including durable viral suppression, Viremia copy-years, and Viral load &gt; 1,500 copies/ml, to assess the differences between them. Results Among the 27,706 cases included in the study, the proportion of persistent viral load suppression was 87%, with 4% having viral loads exceeding 1,500 copies/ml. The average duration from notification to viral load suppression was 154 days, and the geometric mean of annual viral replication was 90 copies*years/ml. Regarding the last available viral load measurement, 96% of cases had an undetectable viral load. However, we observed that 9.3% of cases, while having an undetectable viral load for their last measurement, did not show consistent long-term viral load suppression. An analysis of factors associated with non-persistent viral load suppression revealed higher risk in younger age groups, individuals with an educational level of high school or below, injection drug users, cases from the eastern region, those seeking care at regional hospitals, cases with drug resistance data, individuals with lower healthcare continuity, and those with an initial CD4 count below 350 during the study period. Conclusions The recommendation is to combine it with the indicator of sustained viral load suppression for a more accurate assessment of the risk of HIV transmission within the infected community.",

    "abstract": "In the US, 1.2 million people live with HIV (PWH). Despite having near-normal life expectancies due to antiretroviral therapy (ART), many PWH seek an HIV cure, even if it means risking their lives. This willingness to take risks for a cure raises questions about \"affective forecasting biases,\" where people tend to overestimate the positive impact of future events on their well-being. We conducted a study to test two interventions to mitigate affective forecasting in the decisions of PWH about taking HIV cure medication. We recruited PWH to complete a 30-minute survey about their current quality of life (QoL) and the QoL they anticipate after being cured of HIV, and assigned them to either no additional intervention, to one of two interventions intended to reduce affective forecasting bias, or to both interventions: (1) a defocusing intervention designed to broaden the number of life domains people consider when imagining life changes associated with new circumstances (e.g. HIV cure); and (2) an adaptation intervention to help them gauge fading of strong emotions over time. The study design included a 2 × 2 design: defocusing (yes/no) x adaptation (yes/no) intervention. We assessed PWH's willingness to take hypothetical HIV sterilizing cure medication using the Time Trade-Off (TTO) and their quality of life predictions with WHOQOL-HIV. 296 PWH participated. Counter to what we had hypothesized, neither intervention significantly reduced PWH's willingness to trade time for a cure. Instead, the defocusing intervention increased their willingness to trade time (IRR 1.77, p = 0.03). Exploratory analysis revealed that PWH with lower current quality of life who received the defocusing intervention were more willing to trade time for a cure. These negative findings suggest that either these biases are difficult to overcome in the settings of HIV curative medication or other factors beyond affective forecasting biases influence willingness to participate in HIV curative studies, such as respondents' current quality of life.",

We describe the use and the factors associated with non-adherence to ART among Refugee HIV positive pregnant mothers aged 18–49 years in Kyangwali Refugee Camp, Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional study among HIV positive pregnant mothers aged 18–49 years in Kyangwali refugee camp between May and June 2023. Using a structured questionnaire, we collected data on use, and factors associated with non-adherence to ART. We used modified Poisson regression analysis to determine factors associated with non-adherence to ART. Of the 380 participants enrolled, 192 (50.5%) were married, mean age 32.1 years. Overall, 98.7; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [97.5–99.8%] were using ART and 27.4; 95% CI [22.9–31.9%] were non-adherent. Non-adherence was associated with: Initiating Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) care in the third trimester of pregnancy (adjusted Prevalence ration(aPR): 2.06; 95% CI: 1.27–3.35), no need to get permission to seek PMTCT services aPR 1.61; 95% CI [1.07–2.42] and poor attitude of PMTCT providers aPR 1.90; 95% CI [1.20–3.01]. Non-adherence to ART was generally high; therefore limiting the effectiveness of the PMTCT program in this setting. Refugee context specific education interventional programs aimed at early initiation into HIV care, strong social and psychological support from families, communities and health care providers are vital to improve adherence in this setting.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization has recommended a new method for HIV self-testing (HIVST) using oral fluid, intending to increase HIV testing rates, and linking individuals to medical care. Healthcare workers are chief health advocates in the community who need adequate knowledge and intention to use the newly recommended HIVST approach. However, studies on awareness and the intention to use oral fluid for HIV self-testing among Ethiopian healthcare workers are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to assess healthcare workers' knowledge of and intentions to use oral fluid for HIV self-testing in Hadiya Zone public hospitals in southern Ethiopia in 2022. We conducted a facility-based cross-sectional study among a sample of 352 healthcare workers from 1 to 30 June 2022. The data were entered into Epidata version 4.2 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. We used a logistic regression model with a 95% confidence interval for the interpretation of adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with P < 0.05. Of the total participants, 40.3% had good knowledge, and 63.1% intended to use oral fluid (HIVST). Approximately 92% of healthcare workers had not received training, and 48.3% had heard about HIVST. Only 12.3% knew about the availability of the kit in hospitals, and 19.9% had ever used HIVST. Being male (AOR = 2.28; 95% CI 1.33–3.95), receiving support for the implementation of HIVST (AOR = 2.07; 95% CI 1.21–3.56), hearing about HIVST (AOR = 5.05; 95% CI 2.89–8.81), having prior experience using HIVST (AOR = 2.94; 95% CI 1.71–5.05), having a spouse or partner (AOR = 2.78; 95% CI 1.14–6.82), and having multiple sexual partners (AOR = 2.76; 95% CI 1.13–6.78) were associated with good knowledge of oral HIVST. Being aged 25–29 years (AOR = 2.54; 95% CI 1.18, 5.41), perceiving the high cost of the HIVST kit (AOR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.16–0.84), and having poor knowledge (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI 1.13–3.23) were significantly associated with the intention to use the oral fluid for HIVST. This study highlights the need for technical updating training for healthcare workers to increase their knowledge of and intention to use oral fluid for HIVST. Promoting oral fluid HIVST through targeted education, supporting initiatives, and addressing cost concerns related to the testing kit may increase the uptake of oral fluid HIVST among healthcare workers.",

    "abstract": "Vertical transmission of HIV remains a major challenge in Guinea, especially, in low-resource rural areas. This paper presents the results of a pilot project designed to enhance the prevention of vertical transmission through a comprehensive improvement plan implemented across 66 large-cohort sites. Data from 66 large-cohort of mother to child transmission prevention (PMTCT) sites from 2019 to 2022 were analysed to compare PMTCT metrics before (2019–2020) and after (2021–2022) the improvement initiative. Key indicators were reviewed, and trends were statistically analysed using Mann‒Whitney tests, with a p value less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance. The implementation of this strategy significantly increased the antiretroviral therapy rate among HIV-positive pregnant women from 66 to 94%, and full antiretroviral prophylaxis coverage was achieved in infants. However, early infant diagnosis via polymerase chain reaction testing falls short of the national target, highlighting deficiencies in laboratory and specimen transport capacities. The study also revealed regional disparities in the use of PMTCT services. The improvement plan effectively enhanced antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis use, demonstrating the benefits of structured interventions and capacity development. Despite improvements, challenges such as insufficient polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and uneven access to services remain. Future initiatives should aim to equip PMTCT sites with essential resources and promote community-driven health-seeking behaviours in underserved areas.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, there has been a proliferation of mobile health (mHealth) interventions to address public health challenges such as HIV/AIDS. Hence, there is a need for standardizing the report of mHealth interventions and frameworks to enable effective knowledge sharing and promote developments. This study aims to review publications on mobile applications used for antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among people living with HIV (PLHIV) to evaluate their compliance with the standard reporting guideline by the WHO. A comprehensive search of published literature was conducted on PubMed, PubMed Central, and MEDLINE databases. We selected randomized controlled trials reporting mobile applications used to improve ART adherence among PLHIV. Only studies published in the last 10 years and the English language were included. Each selected study was reviewed by two independent reviewers against the standard 16-item checklist developed by the WHO. A total of 16 studies were included in the review. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States of America (n = 7). Only 4 (25%) of the studies reported more than 70% (11/16) of the items on the standard reporting checklist by WHO. More than 80% of the studies reported the intervention content (n = 15) and intervention delivery (n = 13). The least reported items were; interoperability/Health Information Systems (HIS) context (n = 2), infrastructure (population level such as electricity, internet connectivity, etc.) (n = 4), and cost assessment (n = 4). However, these are important factors that ensure the sustainability and usability of mHealth intervention, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Most mHealth interventions promoting ART adherence did not comply with the standard reporting guideline. The lack of standardization of mHealth interventions may be responsible for increased siloed mobile applications. Hence, there is a need for global adoption of the checklist by Ministries of Health, international organizations, journals, and relevant authorities.",

    "abstract": "Although the introduction of combined therapy with reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors has resulted in considerable decrease in HIV related mortality; it has also induced the development of multiple drug-resistant HIV-1 variants. The few studies on HIV-1 mutagenesis in HIV infected children have not evaluated the impact of HIV-1 mutations on the clinical, virological and immunological presentation of HIV disease that is fundamental to optimizing the treatment regimens for these patients. A cross sectional study was conducted to evaluate the impact of treatment regimens and resistance mutation patterns on the clinical, virological, and immunological presentation of HIV disease in 41 children (25 male and 16 female) at the Robert Wood Johnson Pediatric AIDS Program in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The study participants were symptomatic and had preceding treatment history with combined ARV regimens including protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Fifteen (36.6%) children were treated with NRTI+NNRTI+ PI, 6 (14.6%) with NRTI+NNRTIs, 13 (31.7%) with NRTI+PIs, and the remaining 7 (17.1%) received NRTIs only. Combined ARV regimens did not significantly influence the incidence of NRTI and NNRTI associated mutations. The duration of ARV therapy and the child's age had no significant impact on the ARV related mutations. The clinico-immunological presentation of the HIV disease was not associated with ARV treatment regimens or number of resistance mutations. However, primary mutations in the protease (PR) gene increased the likelihood of plasma viral load (PVL) ≥ 10,000 copies/mL irrespective of the child's age, duration of ARV therapy, presence of NRTI and NNRTI mutation. Viremia ≥ 10,000 copies/mL was recorded in almost all the children with primary mutations in the PR region (n = 12/13, 92.3%) as compared with only 50.0% (n = 14/28) of HIV infected children without (PR-), P < 0.008. However, CD-4 T cells were not affected by the mutations in the PR gene of the HIV-1 isolates. Primary PR resistance mutations significantly increase the likelihood for high viral replication in pediatric patients with moderate/severe HIV-1 infection, which may affect the long-term clinical prognosis of the HIV infected children.",

However, these systems cannot be readily used for delivery of anti-HIV-1 genes that target constituents of the packaging system itself due to inimical effects on vector titer. Here we describe HIV-1-based packaging systems containing the Rev-response element (RRE), of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in place of the HIV-1 RRE. The SIV RRE-containing packaging systems were used to deliver the anti-Rev gene, Rev M10, into HIV-1 susceptible target cells.An HIV-1 based packaging system was created using either a 272- or 1045-nucleotide long RRE derived from the molecular clone SIVmac239. The 1045-nucleotide SIV RRE-containing HIV-1 packaging system provided titers comparable to that of the HIV-1 RRE-based one. Moreover, despite the use of HIV-1 Rev for production of vector stocks, this packaging system was found to be relatively refractory to the inhibitory effects of Rev M10. Correspondingly, the SIV RRE-based packaging system provided 34- to 130-fold higher titers than the HIV-1 RRE one when used for packaging a gene transfer vector encoding Rev-M10. Jurkat T-cells, gene modified with Rev M10 encoding HIV-1 vectors, upon challenge with replication defective HIV-1 in single-round infection experiments, showed diminished production of virus particles.A simple modification of an HIV-1 gene delivery system, namely, replacement of HIV-1 RRE with that of SIV, allowed efficient delivery of Rev M10 transgene into T-cell lines for intracellular immunization against HIV-1 replication.",

However, the stability of these promoters in the reverse orientation has not been rigorously evaluated.A series of retroviral vectors was generated carrying the U6+1 promoter with 3 different HIV-1 RT-specific RNA aptamers and one control aptamer, all in the reverse orientation. After shuttle packaging, the CD4+ cell line CEMx174 was transduced with each vector, selected for expression of GFP, and challenged with HIV-1. We did not observe inhibition of HIV-1 replication in these transduced populations. PCR amplification of the U6+1 promoter-RNA aptamer inhibitor cassette from transduced CEMx174 cells and RT-PCR amplification from transfected Phoenix (amphotropic) packaging cells showed two distinct products: a full-length product of the expected size as well as a truncated product. The sequence of the full-length PCR product was identical to the predicted amplicon sequence. However, sequencing of the truncated product revealed a 139 bp deletion in the U6 promoter. This deletion decreased transcriptional activity of the U6 promoter. Analysis of the deleted sequences from the U6 promoter in the antisense direction indicated consensus splice donor, splice acceptor and branch point sequences.The existence of a cryptic splice site in the U6 promoter when expressed in a retroviral vector in the reverse orientation generates deletions during packaging and may limit the utility of this promoter for expression of small RNA inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV genotyping has had a significant impact on the care and treatment of HIV/AIDS. At a clinical level, the test guides physicians on the choice of treatment regimens. At the surveillance level, it informs policy on consolidated treatment guidelines and microbial resistance control strategies. Until recently, the conventional test has utilized the Sanger sequencing (SS) method. Unlike Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), SS is limited by low data throughput and the inability of detecting low abundant drug-resistant variants. NGS can improve sensitivity and quantitatively identify low-abundance variants; in addition, it has the potential to improve efficiency as well as lowering costs when samples are batched. Despite the NGS benefits, its utilization in clinical drug resistance profiling is faced with mixed reactions. These are largely based on a lack of a consensus regarding the quality control strategy. Nonetheless, transitional views suggest validating the method against the gold-standard SS. Therefore, we present a validation report of an NGS-based in-house HIV genotyping method against the SS method in Uganda. Results Since there were no established proficiency test panels for NGS-based HIV genotyping, 15 clinical plasma samples for routine care were utilized. The use of clinical samples allowed for accuracy and precision studies. The workflow involved four main steps; viral RNA extraction, targeted amplicon generation, amplicon sequencing and data analysis. Accuracy of 98% with an average percentage error of 3% was reported for the NGS based assay against the SS platform demonstrating similar performance. The coefficient of variation (CV) findings for both the inter-run and inter-personnel precision showed no variability (CV ≤ 0%) at the relative abundance of ≥ 20%. For both inter-run and inter-personnel, a variation that affected the precision was observed at 1% frequency. Overall, for all the frequencies, CV registered a small range of (0–2%). Conclusion The NGS-based in-house HIV genotyping method fulfilled the minimum requirements that support its utilization for drug resistance profiling in a clinical setting of a low-income country. For more inclusive quality control studies, well-characterized wet panels need to be established.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Uganda has registered a reduction in new HIV infections among children in recent years. However, mother-to-child transmission of HIV still occurs, especially among pregnant women who present late. To eliminate this transmission, all HIV-positive pregnant women should be identified during antenatal HIV testing. We described women newly identified HIV-positive during pregnancy and postnatal period 2015–2018. Methods We extracted surveillance data for women identified as HIV-positive during pregnancy and the postnatal period reported through the Health Management Information System from 2015–2018. We calculated proportions newly positive at antenatal, labor, and postnatal periods nationally and at district levels. We disaggregated data into ‘tested early’ (during antenatal care) and ‘tested late’ (during labor or postnatal period) and calculated the proportion positive. We evaluated trends in these parameters at national and district levels. Results Overall, 8,485,854 mothers were tested for HIV during this period. Of these, 2.4% tested HIV-positive for the first time. While the total number of mothers tested increased from 1,327,022 in 2015 to 2,514,212 in 2018, the proportion testing HIV-positive decreased from 3.0% in 2015 to 1.7% in 2018 (43% decline over the study period, p &lt; 0.001). Of 6,781,047 tested early, 2.2% tested HIV-positive. The proportion positive among those tested early dropped from 2.5% in 2015 to 1.7% in 2018. Of 1,704,807 tested late, 3.2% tested HIV-positive. The proportion positive among those tested late dropped from 5.2% in 2015 to 1.6% in 2018. At the district level, Kalangala District had the highest proportion testing positive at 13% (909/11,312) in 2015; this dropped to 5.2% (169/3278) in 2018. Conclusion The proportion of women newly testing HIV-positive during pregnancy and postnatal declined significantly during 2015–2018. A higher proportion of mothers who tested late vs early were HIV-positive. Failure to identify HIV early represents an increased risk of transmission. Ministry of Health should strengthen Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission (eMTCT) services to sustain this decrease through targeted interventions for poorly-performing districts. It should strengthen community-based health education on antenatal care and HIV testing and enhance the implementation of other primary prevention strategies targeting adolescents and young women.",

Monitoring the level of late presentation and understanding the factors associated with it would help to tailor screening and information strategies for better efficiency. We performed a retrospective cohort study in Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC. The studied population included HIV-positive adults newly enrolled in HIV care between January 2006 and June 2020 at 25 HIV urban care facilities. Patient information collected at presentation for HIV care included age, sex, WHO clinical stage and screening context. We used 2 definitions of late presentation: the WHO definition of advanced HIV disease (WHO stage 3/4 or CD4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm 3 ) and a more inclusive definition (WHO stage 3/4 or CD4 cell count &lt; 350 cells/mm 3 ). Results A total of 10,137 HIV-infected individuals were included in the analysis. The median age was 40 years; 68% were female. A total of 45.9% or 47.5% of the patients were late presenters, depending on the definition used. The percentage of patients with late presentation (defined as WHO stage 3/4 or CD4 cell count &lt; 350 cells/mm 3 ) decreased during recent years, from 70.7% in 2013 to 46.5% in 2017 and 23.4% in 2020. Age was associated with a significantly higher risk of LP (p &lt; 0.0001). We did not observe any impact of sex. Conclusions The frequency of late presentation for care is decreasing in Kinshasa, DRC. Efforts have to be continued. In particular, the issue of late diagnosis in older individuals should be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Men who have sex with men (MSM) are potentially at high risk for HIV infection, their HIV prevalence far exceeds the national prevalence rate. There are also a number of MSM who have sex with women, mostly unprotected, which can transmit HIV to their female sexual partners and even to the next generation. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the prevalence of heterosexual behaviors in Chinese men who have sex with men and the status of condom utilization as well as HIV infection among MSM with heterosexual behaviors, so as to further improve the investigation and prevention and control of AIDS in MSM population. We systematically searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Calligraphy (VIP), Pubmed, and Embase following certain retrieval strategies to find relevant articles published from January 1, 2015 to November 18, 2019, The useful information extracted from qualified articles, Stata 15.1 and Review Manager 5.3 were employed for further meta analysis. The estimated prevalence of heterosexual behaviors among MSM in the past year was 19.0% (95% CI 17.0%, 22.0%). The estimated condom utilization rate of the last heterosexual behavior among MSM and condom adherence rate of heterosexual behaviors among MSM were 51.0% (95% CI 44.0%, 58.0%) and 31.0% (95% CI 25.0%, 38.0%), respectively. And the pooled HIV prevalence in MSM with heterosexual behaviors was 9% (95% CI 6%, 13%). The sensitivity analysis showed that the results were stable. No publication bias was found by Egger’s test. There is a high proportion of MSM with heterosexual behaviors and low condom utilization in China. HIV prevalence in MSM with heterosexual behaviors is also high. Therefore, adequate attention should be given to this particular group and measures should be taken in order to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from subpopulations to the general population.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Medical care re-engagement is critical to suppressing viral load and preventing HIV transmission, morbidity and mortality, yet few rigorous intervention studies address this outcome. We assessed the effectiveness of a Ryan White Part A-funded HIV Care Coordination Program relative to ‘usual care,’ for short-term care re-engagement and viral suppression among people without recent HIV medical care. Methods The Care Coordination Program was launched in 2009 at 28 hospitals, health centers, and community-based organizations in New York City. Designed for people with HIV (PWH) experiencing or at risk for poor HIV outcomes, the Care Coordination Program provides long-term, comprehensive medical case management utilizing interdisciplinary teams, structured health education and patient navigation. The intervention was implemented as a safety-net services program, without a designated comparison group. To evaluate it retrospectively, we created an observational, matched cohort of clients and controls. Using the HIV surveillance registry, we identified individuals meeting program eligibility criteria from December 1, 2009 to March 31, 2013 and excluded those dying prior to 12 months of follow-up. We then matched clients to controls on baseline status (lacking evidence of viral suppression, consistently suppressed, inconsistently suppressed, or newly diagnosed in the past 12 months), start of follow-up and propensity score. For this analysis, we limited to those out of care at baseline (defined as having no viral load test in the 12 months pre-enrollment) and still residing within jurisdiction (defined as having a viral load or CD4 test reported to local surveillance and dated within the 12-month follow-up period). Using a GEE model with binary error distribution and logit link, we compared odds of care re-engagement (defined as having ≥ 2 laboratory events ≥ 90 days apart) and viral suppression (defined as having HIV RNA ≤ 200 copies/mL on the most recent viral load test) at 12-month follow-up. Results Among 326 individuals out of care at baseline, 87.2% of clients and 48.2% of controls achieved care re-engagement (Odds Ratio: 4.53; 95%CI 2.66, 7.71); 58.3% of clients and 49.3% of controls achieved viral suppression (Odds Ratio: 2.05; 95%CI 1.30, 3.23). Conclusions HIV Care Coordination shows evidence of effectiveness for care and treatment re-engagement.",

    "abstract": "Ritonavir-boosted saquinavir (SQVr) is nowadays regarded as an alternative antiretroviral drug probably due to several drawbacks, such as its high pill burden, twice daily dosing and the requirement of 200 mg ritonavir when given at the current standard 1000/100 mg bid dosing. Several once-daily SQVr dosing schemes have been studied with the 200 mg SQV old formulations, trying to overcome some of these disadvantages. SQV 500 mg strength tablets became available at the end of 2005, thus facilitating a once-daily regimen with fewer pills, although there is very limited experience with this formulation yet. Prospective, multicentre study in which efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of a regimen of once-daily SQVr 1500/100 mg plus 2 NRTIs were evaluated under routine clinical care conditions in either antiretroviral-naïve patients or in those with no previous history of antiretroviral treatments and/or genotypic resistance tests suggesting SQV resistance. Plasma SQV trough levels were measured by HPLV-UV. Five hundred and fourteen caucasian patients were included (47.2% coinfected with hepatitis C and/or B virus; 7.8% with cirrhosis). Efficacy at 52 weeks (plasma RNA-HIV <50 copies/ml) was 67.7% (CI95: 63.6 - 71.7%) by intention-to-treat, and 92.2% (CI95: 89.8 - 94.6%) by on-treatment analysis. The reasons for failure were: dropout or loss to follow-up (18.4%), virological failure (7.8%), adverse events (3.1%), and other reasons (4.6%). The high rate of dropout may be explained by an enrollement and follow-up under routine clinical care condition, and a population with a significant number of drug users. The median SQV Cmin (n = 49) was 295 ng/ml (range, 53-2172). The only variable associated with virological failure in the multivariate analysis was adherence (OR: 3.36; CI95, 1.51-7.46, p = 0.003). Our results suggests that SQVr (1500/100 mg) once-daily plus 2 NRTIs is an effective regimen, without severe clinical adverse events or hepatotoxicity, scarce lipid changes, and no interactions with methadone. All these factors and its once-daily administration suggest this regimen as an appropriate option in patients with no SQV resistance-associated mutations.",

The strong association between non-progression and maintenance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cell cytokine production and proliferative capacities suggests that invigorating CD8+ T cell immune responses would reduce viremia and slow disease progression. A series of studies have demonstrated that sequence variants of native immunogenic peptides can generate more robust CD8+ T cell responses and that stimulation with these 'heteroclitic' peptides can steer responses away from the phenotypic and functional attributes of exhaustion acquired during chronic HIV infection. Incorporation of heteroclitic peptide stimulation within therapeutic vaccines could favour induction of more effective cellular antiviral responses, and in combination with 'shock and kill' strategies, contribute towards HIV cure.",

    "abstract": "The anti-HIV activity of natural killer (NK) cells could be induced fast enough to potentially prevent the establishment of HIV infection. Epidemiological studies identified two genotypes encoding NK receptors that contribute to NK cell function, that were more frequent in people who remained uninfected despite multiple HIV exposures than in HIV-susceptible subjects. NK cells from carriers of the *h/*y+B*57 genotype have higher NK cell functional potential and inhibit HIV replication in autologous HIV-infected CD4+ T cells (iCD4) more potently than those from carriers of non-protective genotypes. HIV suppression depends on the secretion of CC-chemokines that block HIV entry into CD4+ cells. NK cell education and the effect of HIV infection on iCD4 cell surface expression of MHC-I antigens both influenced NK cell responses to autologous iCD4. The second KIR3DS1 homozygous protective genotype encodes an activating receptor that upon interacting with its HLA-F ligand on iCD4 induces anti-viral activity.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of the interval from HIV-1 infection to disease progression may be affected by selection bias, and data concerning asymptomatic early seroconverters are limited. We examined the interval until disease progression in HIV-1 seroconverters in whom the timing of infection could be estimated within 1 year before diagnosis.Subjects included newly diagnosed patients at Osaka National Hospital between 2003 and 2010 who had either (1) symptomatic acute HIV-1 infection with a negative or intermediate reaction on Western blotting and a positive reaction on an HIV RNA test (symptomatic acute group) or (2) a positive reaction on Western blotting at diagnosis and a <1-year interval from the last negative HIV test until the first positive test. The latter was divided into symptomatic recent or asymptomatic recent groups based on the presence or absence, respectively, of any transient fever between the last negative and first positive tests. Disease progression was defined as a fall in the CD4 count to <350 cells/microL on 2 consecutive tests, the start of anti-HIV therapy, or the onset of AIDS-indicator diseases. Information was retrospectively collected from medical records.Subjects included 210 patients: 91 in the symptomatic acute group, 72 in the symptomatic recent group, and 47 in the asymptomatic recent group. In the symptomatic acute (0.8 years) and symptomatic recent (2.2 years) groups, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of median interval until disease progression was significantly shorter than that in the asymptomatic recent group (2.9 years). Multivariate analysis by Cox's proportional hazards test showed that the symptomatic acute group (vs. asymptomatic recent group: hazard ratio: 1.93; 95% confidence interval: 1.14-3.36; p = 0.0140) and a baseline CD4 count of <400 cells/microL (hazard ratio: 3.88; 95% confidence interval: 2.57-5.96; p < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors associated with early disease progression.Symptomatic seroconversion was associated with early disease progression. Furthermore, the estimated median interval until the CD4 count was <350 cells/microL was only 2.9 years even in patients with asymptomatic seroconversion. These results suggest the importance of early diagnosis in early seroconverters.",

Factors predicting uTI were assessed with a conditional risk-set multiple failure time-to-event model to account for repeated events per subject. Association between uTI and mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards, with a competing risks extension to test for the influence of lost to follow-up (LTFU). 40,632 patients were included from 11 countries across 33 sites (17 Africa, 16 Asia). Median duration of follow-up was 1.61 years (IQR 0.54–3.31 years), 3386 (8.3 %) patients died, and 3453 (8.5 %) were LTFU.

There was no relationship between uTI and mortality after adjusting for disease status and considering LTFU as a competing risk. uTIs were frequent in people in ART programs in low-middle income countries and associated with younger age, female gender and advanced HIV. uTI did not predict survival when loss to follow-up was considered a competing risk.

Methods We conducted a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study including adult patients with controlled HIV-1 infection on any stable antiretroviral (ART) regimen, who switched to E/C/F/TDF. Success was measured by the proportion of patients with plasma viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml at W48 using the FDA snapshot algorithm. We also assessed risk factors associated with virological failure (VF). Results 382 patients with HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL who switched to E/C/F/TDF were included in the study. Most patients (69.9%) were male, with median age 44 years (IQR 38–51), who had been on ART for a median of 7 years (IQR 4–13). Median CD4 count was 614/mm 3 and 24.6% of the patients had a history of previous virological failure. The reasons for switching were simplification (67.0%) and tolerance issues (22.0%). At week 48, 314 (82.0% [95% CI 78.4–86.0]) patients had HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, 13 (3.5% [95% CI 3.64–8.41]) experienced virological failure. Genotype at failure was available in 6/13 patients with detection of resistance-associated mutations to integrase inhibitors and NRTIs in 5/6 (83.3%) patients. We found no predictive factor associated with virological failure except for a borderline significance with the duration of viral suppression before the switch. Tolerability of E/C/F/TDF was good with 23/382 (6.0%) patients experiencing mild adverse reactions. Conclusion In our cohort, switching well-suppressed patients to E/C/F/TDF resulted in few virologic failures and was well tolerated. However, resistance to integrase inhibitors emerged in patients with virological failure.",

Among the 24 patients, 2 (8%) complete responses and 6 (25%) partial responses were observed. 7 patients (29%) were at stable tumor status and others progressed.Data from the present study strongly support the use of camrelizumab (monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD-1 pathway) in this population, as it appears to be a feasible approach with no deleterious effects on PLWH and tolerability and acceptable efficacy. In addition, these findings further support the inclusion of PLWH with cancer in clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of ICIs on cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are used to assess the strength of preferences and value of interventions. However, researchers using this approach have been criticized for not conducting or publishing rigorous studies to select the required attributes and levels. Proper specification of attributes and their levels determines the validity of DCE. Hence, our study aimed to identify and define attributes and levels for the design of a DCE to elicit patients’ and providers’ preferences for ART service in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods Four stages were followed to derive the final list of attributes and levels: (1) a literature review to derive conceptual attributes; (2) key informant interviews of 17 providers and in-depth interviews of 15 adult stable patients to identify context-specific attributes and attribute levels; (3) ranking survey among 31 HIV/AIDS program implementers and rating survey among 35 adult stable patients and 42 health workers providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) service to indicate participants’ preference of attributes; and (4) an expert opinion to reduce the list of attributes and levels. Results First, a literature review identified 23 candidate attributes. Second, individual-level analysis of the qualitative transcripts confirmed 15 of these 23 attributes. Third, the ranking and rating surveys put the importance of the 23 ART service attributes in order of preference. Fourth, through discussions with eight experts, 17 attributes were discarded based on multiple criteria. The six retained attributes were: the location of ART refills, the frequency of receiving ART refills, the person providing ART refills, the participants/others seen at the same ART refill visit, medication refill pick-up/delivery times, and the total cost of the visit during antiretroviral (ARV) medication refill. Finally, levels were assigned to these 6 attributes based on data from the literature, transcripts, and knowledge of the Ethiopian context. Conclusions This detailed description illuminates the attribute development process and provides the reader with a basis for evaluating the rigor of this phase of DCE construction. This paper contributes empirical evidence to the limited methodological literature on attributes and levels of development for DCE, thereby providing further empirical guidance on ART service preference, specifically among patients of low- and middle-income countries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Intimate partner violence is the most pervasive but less recognized problem which affects millions of women world. It is more common among marginalized individuals including women affected by HIV. However, there is limited information regarding this problem among HIV-Positive Women in Ethiopia. Thus, the study was aimed to assess the magnitude and factors associated with intimate partner violence among HIV positive women in western Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-positive women on ART follow-up in Nekemte town. A total of 420 women were selected by the simple random sampling technique and an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. The data were entered to EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Univariable and mult- variable logistic regression analysis with their corresponding odds ratio (95%CI) were computed, and statistical significance was declared at p &lt; 0.05. Results The magnitude of intimate partner violence among HIV-positive Women during Lifetime and since diagnosed with HIV was 49.29%, [(95% CI: 44.3–53.6%)] and 41.67%, [(95% CI: 37.1–45.7%)] respectively. Skipping daily ART medication ≥ 6 times/month [AOR = 3.56; (95% CI 1.18, 10.74)], experiencing controlling behavior by a partner[AOR = 6.37; (95% CI 3.26, 12.44)], women inter-parental witness of violence [AOR = 1.74; (95% CI 1.09, 2.79)], women having favorable attitude that justify wife-beating [AOR = 1.76; (95% CI 1.06, 2.94)]and non-disclosure of test result to partner [AOR 0.38; (95% CI 0.22, 0.66)] were factors associated with intimate partner violence since diagnosed with HIV. Conclusion The magnitude of intimate partner violence among HIV-positive Women on ART follow-up was found to be high in the study area. Therefore, integrating intimate partner violence victim screening with ART services, empowering HIV-positive women, and increasing their awareness of sexual and reproductive rights is needed.",

The risk factor and optimal therapy remain unclear. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and dysphagia or difficulty in oral intake receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) suspension. However, there remains little evidence regarding ART suspension. Case presentation We experienced a case of a 55-year-old man diagnosed with HIV and severe multiple cerebral infarctions due to VZV vasculopathy. We started on bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (BIC/TAF/FTC) and acyclovir (ACV), and prednisone. He was started on BIC/TAF/FTC suspension because of deteriorated swallowing. The HIV viral load was increased; however, no drug-resistance genes were detected. We successfully treated him with doltegravir/abacavir/lamibudine suspension. We performed two literature reviews of the administration of BIC/TAF/3TC suspension and VZV vasculopathy in patients with HIV. Three cases of BIC/TAF/3TC suspension were considered treatment failures. Recent history of VZV infection and a CD4 count under 200 μL may be risk factors for VZV vasculopathy. The effective treatment may be using steroid and ACV; however, treatment duration could differ. Conclusions BIC/TAF/FTC suspension administration may be unstable, and treating ACV and steroid may be optimal therapy for VZV vasculopathy; however, the evidence level is low.",

Using a cross-sectional survey from a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Canadian HIV Trials Network study (CTN 328) of people living with HIV on vaccine immunogenicity, we examined the relationships between participant characteristics and behavioural practices intended to prevent COVID-19 infection. Participants living in four Canadian urban centers were enrolled between April 2021-January 2022, at which time they responded to a questionnaire on preventative behaviour practices. Questionnaire and clinical data were combined to explore relationships between preventive behaviours and (1) known COVID-19 infection pre-enrolment, (2) multimorbidity, (3) developing symptomatic COVID-19 infection, and (4) developing symptomatic COVID-19 infection during the Omicron wave. Among 375 participants, 49 had COVID-19 infection pre-enrolment and 88 post-enrolment. The proportion of participants reporting always engaging in preventative behaviours included 87% masking, 79% physical distancing, 70% limiting social gatherings, 65% limiting contact with at-risk individuals, 33% self-isolating due to symptoms, and 26% self-quarantining after possible exposure. Participants with known COVID-19 infection pre-enrolment were more likely to self-quarantine after possible exposure although asymptomatic (65.0% vs 23.4%, p < 0.001; Chi-square test). Participants with multiple comorbidities more likely endorsed physical distancing (85.7% vs 75.5%, p = 0.044; Chi-square test), although this was not significant in logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, race, number of household members, number of bedrooms/bathrooms in the household per person, influenza immunization, and working in close physical proximity to others. Overall, participants reported frequent practice of preventative behaviours.",

Several deleterious side effects including dyslipidemia and lipodystrophy, however, have been observed with HAART. Women are at a higher risk of developing adipose tissue alterations and these alterations have different characteristics as compared to men. We have previously demonstrated that in mice the HIV protease inhibitor, ritonavir, caused a reduction in weight gain in females, but had no effect on male mice. In the present study, we examined the potential causes of this difference in weight gain. Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) null mice or wild-type C57BL/6 mice, were administered 15 μg/ml ritonavir or vehicle (0.01% ethanol) in the drinking water for 6 weeks. The percent of total body weight gained during the treatment period was measured and confirmed that female LDL-R gained significantly less weight with ritonavir treatment than males. In wild type mice, however, there was no effect of ritonavir treatment in either sex. Despite the weight loss in LDL-R null mice, ritonavir increased food intake, but no difference was observed in gonadal fat weight. Serum leptin levels were significantly lower in females. Ritonavir further suppressed leptin levels in (p < 0.05). Ritonavir did not alter serum adiponectin levels in either gender. To determine the source of these differences, female mice were ovariectomized remove the gonadal sex hormones. Ovariectomy prevented the weight loss induced by ritonavir (p < 0.05). Furthermore, leptin levels were no longer suppressed by ritonavir (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that gonadal factors in females influence the hormonal control of weight gain changes induced by HIV protease inhibitors in an environment of elevated cholesterol.",

We performed IFNL genotyping on stored samples and evaluated the association of IFNL single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs368234815 and rs12979860) with CD4+:CD8+ ratio normalization (> 1) and expanded CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets; CD45RO+CD62L+ (central-memory), CD45RO+ CD62L-(effector-memory) and CD45RO-CD62L+ (naïve), using logistic and linear regression models, respectively.190 ambulatory PLWH recruited to the main study, 143 were included in the analysis (38 had no stored DNA and 9 no T-lymphocyte subpopulation). Of 143 included, the median age (IQR) was 45(39-48) years, 64% were male and 66% were of Caucasian ethnicity. Heterosexual-contact (36%), injecting drug-use (33%) and men who have sex with men (24%) were the most presented HIV-transmission risk groups. The majority of subjects (90.2%) were on ART with 79% of the cohort having an undetectable HIV-RNA (< 40 copies/ml) and the time since ART initiation was 7.5 (3.7-10.4) year. rs368234815 and rs12979860 displayed similar allelic frequencies, with minor alleles ΔG and T representing 39% and 42%, respectively, of circulating alleles. rs368234815 ΔG/ΔG minor homozygotes were significantly associated with increased odds for attaining a normalised CD4+:CD8+ ratio compared to rs368234815 T/T major homozygotes in PLWH virologically suppressed on effective ART (OR = 3.11; 95% CI [1.01:9.56]). rs368234815 ΔG/ΔG homozygosity was also significantly associated with lower levels of CD4+ effector memory T-cells (regression coefficient: - 7.1%, p = 0.04) and CD8+ naïve T-cell subsets were significantly higher in HIV-1 mono-infected PLWH with rs368234815 ΔG/ΔG (regression coefficient: + 7.2%, p = 0.04).In virally-suppressed, long-term ART-treated PLWH, rs368234815 ΔG/ΔG homozygotes were more likely to have attained normalisation of their CD4+:CD8+ ratio, displayed lower CD4+ effector memory and higher naive CD8+ T-cells.

    "abstract": "The 2012 International Symposium on HIV and Emerging Infectious Diseases (ISHEID) provided a forum for investigators to hear the latest research developments in the clinical management of HIV and HCV infections as well as HIV-1 reservoirs and cure research. Combined anti-retroviral therapy (c-ART) has had a profound impact on the disease prognosis of individuals living with HIV-1 infection. However, although these anti-retroviral regimens are able to reduce plasma viremia to below the limits of detection for sustained periods of time, there is a rapid recrudescence in plasma viremia if treatment is interrupted. Therefore, despite this potent anti-retroviral suppression, HIV-1 is able to persist within the infected individual. The main 2012 ISHEID theme was, hence “searching for an HIV cure”. In this report we not only give details on this main topic of the 2012 ISHEID but also summarize what has been discussed in the areas of HIV epidemiology, access to care, antiretroviral therapy management and recent progress in the therapy of HCV infection in patients with HIV.",

    "abstract": "During the HIV-1 replication cycle, several molecules including chemokine receptors and cholesterol are crucial, and are therefore potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Indeed statins, compounds that inhibit cellular synthesis of cholesterol and have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties were shown to inhibit HIV-1 infection by R5 tropic strains but not by X4 strains in vitro, mainly by altering the chemokine receptor/ligands axes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize in vivo, the capacity of statins to modulate in HIV seronegative and chronically HIV-1-infected adults the expression of CCR5 and CXCR4, of their ligands and the tropism of circulating HIV-1 strains. Samples from asymptomatic HIV-1-infected adults enrolled in a clinical trial aimed at evaluating the antiretroviral activity of lovastatin were used to evaluate in vivo the modulation by lovastatin of CCR5, CXCR4, their ligands, and the shift in plasma viral tropism over one year of intervention. In addition, ten HIV negative adults received a daily oral dose of 40 mg of lovastatin or 20 mg of atorvastatin; seven other HIV negative individuals who received no treatment were followed as controls. The frequency and phenotype of immune cells were determined by flow-cytometry; mRNA levels of chemokine receptors and their ligands were determined by real-time PCR. Viral tropism was determined by PCR and sequencing, applying the clonal and clinical model of analyses. Our study shows that long-term administration of lovastatin in HIV-infected individuals does not induce a shift in viral tropism, or induce a significant modulation of CCR5 and CXCR4 on immune cells in HIV-infected patients. Similar results were found in HIV seronegative control subjects, treated with lovastatin or atorvastatin, but a significant increase in CCL3 and CCL4 transcription was observed in these individuals. These findings suggest that long-term administration of statins at therapeutic doses, does not significantly affect the expression of HIV-1 co-receptors or of their ligands. In addition it is important to point out that based on the results obtained, therapeutic administration of statins in HIV-infected patients with lipid disorders is safe in terms of selecting X4 strains.",

    "abstract": "To identify the determinants of successful antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, researchers study the virological responses to treatment-change episodes (TCEs) accompanied by baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, and genotypic resistance data. Such studies, however, often differ in their inclusion and virological response criteria making direct comparisons of study results problematic. Moreover, the absence of a standard method for representing the data comprising a TCE makes it difficult to apply uniform criteria in the analysis of published studies of TCEs. To facilitate data sharing for TCE analyses, we developed an XML (Extensible Markup Language) Schema that represents the temporal relationship between plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 counts and genotypic drug resistance data surrounding an ARV treatment change. To demonstrate the adaptability of the TCE XML Schema to different clinical environments, we collaborate with four clinics to create a public repository of about 1,500 TCEs. Despite the nascent state of this TCE XML Repository, we were able to perform an analysis that generated a novel hypothesis pertaining to the optimal use of second-line therapies in resource-limited settings. We also developed an online program (TCE Finder) for searching the TCE XML Repository and another program (TCE Viewer) for generating a graphical depiction of a TCE from a TCE XML Schema document. The TCE Suite of applications – the XML Schema, Viewer, Finder, and Repository – addresses several major needs in the analysis of the predictors of virological response to ARV therapy. The TCE XML Schema and Viewer facilitate sharing data comprising a TCE. The TCE Repository, the only publicly available collection of TCEs, and the TCE Finder can be used for testing the predictive value of genotypic resistance interpretation systems and potentially for generating and testing novel hypotheses pertaining to the optimal use of salvage ARV therapy.",

We extracted the number of subjects, follow-up time, primary MAC events, mean CD4 count, and proportion of subjects on mono or dual antiretroviral therapy (ART) from each study. We derived the efficacy of each drug using adjusted indirect comparisons and, when possible, by direct comparisons. Five articles satisfied our inclusion criteria. Using direct comparison, we estimated the efficacies of rifabutin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin compared to placebo to be 53% (95% CI, 48-61%), 66% (95% CI, 61-74%), and 66% (95% CI, 60-81%), respectively. Using adjusted indirect calculations, the efficacy of rifabutin compared to placebo ranged from 41% to 44%. The adjusted indirect efficacies of clarithromycin and azithromycin were estimated to be 73% and 72%, respectively.Accurate estimates of specific drug dosages as compared to placebo are important for policy and implementation research.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) is a recommended approach to screen for HIV to all pregnant women during antenatal care (ANC) visits, and all with HIV positive results have to be enrolled into prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) program. However, little is known about the relationship between facility readiness and the uptake of PITC to pregnant women attending ANC in Tanzania. Therefore, this study assessed whether the facility readiness promotes the uptake of PITC to the pregnant women attending ANC for the purpose of improving the PMTCT interventions in Tanzania. Methods This study analyzed data for health facilities obtained from the 2014–2015 Tanzania service provision assessment survey. The Primary outcome measure was a composite variable (with score of 0–5) in which its higher scores indicates provision of high-quality of PITC. Also, facilities scored higher in the PMTCT service readiness index were considered to have high readiness to provide PMTCT services. In Poisson regression analyses, a series of models were fitted to assess whether there is an association between provision of high-quality of PITC and facility readiness. In all statistical analysis, a P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Results Out of 1853 included first-visit ANC consultations, only about one-third of pregnant women received all five components required for PITC. The mean percentage of PMTCT readiness score was moderate 63.96 [61.32–66.59]%. In adjusted model, we found that facility with high readiness to provide PMTCT services was significantly associated with the provision of high-quality of PITC (model 2: [β = 0.075, P = 0.00]). Conclusion In order to increase high-quality of PITC services, efforts should be made to improve the PMTCT facility readiness by increasing availability of trained staffs, diagnostic tools, and ARTs among health facilities in Tanzania.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection is an important indicator of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Effective antiretroviral therapy has dramatically reduced the incidence of and mortality due to HIV infection, although drug resistance and poor medication adherence continue to increase the risk of disseminated M. avium complex infection. However, gastrointestinal lesions in cases of disseminated M. avium complex infection resulting in protein-losing enteropathy have been rarely discussed. Therefore, we present a case of protein-losing enteropathy caused by disseminated M. avium complex infection in a patient undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Case presentation A 29-year-old man was diagnosed with AIDS 4 years ago and was admitted for a 10-month history of refractory diarrhea and fever. Despite receiving antiretroviral therapy, the viral load remained elevated due to poor medication adherence. The patient was diagnosed with disseminated M. avium complex infection and started on antimycobacterial drugs 2 years before admission. However, the infection remained uncontrolled. The previous hospitalization 1 year before admission was due to hypoalbuminemia and refractory diarrhea. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy caused by intestinal lymphangiectasia, and treatment with intravenous antimycobacterial drugs did not resolve his intestinal lymphangiectasia. The patient inevitably died of sepsis. Conclusions Clinical remission is difficult to achieve in patients with AIDS and protein-losing enteropathy caused by disseminated M. avium complex infection due to limited options of parenteral antiretroviral drugs. This report highlights the importance of identifying alternative treatments (such as an injectable formulation) for patients who do not respond to antiretroviral therapy due to protein-losing enteropathy with disseminated M. avium complex infection.",

Routine testing facilitates early diagnosis and treatment, thereby preventing morbidity and onward transmission. We evaluated factors associated with HIV and HCV testing in a behaviorally vulnerable cohort of predominantly MSM. Methods From June 2018 through June 2019, the BRAHMS study enrolled adults at ten German outpatient clinics that serve gender and sexual minority populations. Participants completed behavioral questionnaires that captured prior experience with HIV and HCV testing. Multivariable robust Poisson regression was used to evaluate factors potentially associated with testing in the previous 6 months. Results Among 1017 participants with median age 33 (interquartile range 28–39) years, 1001 (98.4%) reported any lifetime history of HIV testing and 787 (77.4%) reported any HCV testing, including 16 (1.6%) known to be living with HCV. Testing within the last 6 months was reported by 921 (90.6%) and 513 (50.4%) for HIV and HCV, respectively. Recent HIV testing was more common among participants with higher education level and recent HCV testing. Recent HCV testing was more common among participants with non-cisgender identity, lifetime history of illicit drug use, hepatitis B immunity or infection, and recent HIV testing. Conclusion Prior testing for HIV was common in this cohort, but interventions are needed to improve HCV risk stratification and access to testing. HIV testing infrastructure can be successfully leveraged to support HCV testing, but differentiated preventive care delivery is needed for some vulnerable populations.",

We analyzed virologic outcomes with respect to treatment history and HIV drug resistance. Design Post hoc analysis of a randomized trial. Methods Main inclusion criteria were an HIV RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL for ≥ 24 weeks and no resistance to integrase strand transfer inhibitors or bDRV. Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) were interpreted using the Stanford HIVdb mutation list. Outcomes measures were 48-week virologic response (HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, FDA snapshot) and HIV RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL (including discontinuation due to a lack of efficacy or reasons other than adverse events and HIV RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL, referred to as snapshot non-response). Results The analysis population included 263 patients (2DR: 131, 3DR: 132): 90.1% males; median age, 48 years; CD4 + T-cell nadir &lt; 200/µl, 47.0%; ≥ 2 treatment changes, 27.4%; NRTI, non-NRTI (NNRTI), and major protease inhibitor (PI) RAMs in 9.5%, 14.4%, and 3.4%, respectively. In patients with RAMs in the 2DR and 3DR groups, virologic response rates were 87.8% and 96.0%, respectively; the corresponding rates in those without RAMs were 85.7% and 81.8%. RAMs were unrelated to virologic non-response in either group. No treatment-emergent RAMs were observed. Conclusions DTG + bDRV is an effective treatment option without the risk of treatment-emergent resistance for PLWH on suppressive first- or further-line treatment with or without evidence of pre-existing NRTI, NNRTI, or PI RAMs. Trial registration : EUDRA-CT Number 2015-000360-34; registered 07 April 2015; https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2015-000360-34/DE .",

The main objective of this study to identify the determinants of CD4 cell count among antiretroviral therapy attendants of infected adults follow up in Gonder teaching referral hospital, Gonder, Ethiopia implemented by SAS version 94. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 216 regular follow up patients whose age greater than 14 years from December 1, 2012, to December 30, 2017. A multilevel model was used to identify the factors of CD4 cell count of patients and it considered variability between and within patients. Results The mean with a standard deviation of weight, and a hemoglobin level of patients were 55.48 (10.21), and 18.25 (33.028) respectively. This study concluded that the variation for CD4 cell count existed between patients was 63% and the remaining 37% of variation existing within patients. In this study, the random coefficient time-varying covariate model was well fitted which shows weight and hemoglobin level were statistically significant predictors at a 5% level of significance for the log of CD4 cell count of patients. Conclusion This study shows the hemoglobin level and weight of patients were statistically significant for the log of CD4 cell count of patients follow up in Gonder teaching referral hospital, Gonder, Ethiopia. Moreover, the result of the study shows that the log of CD4 count of patients increased when hemoglobin level and weight of patients increased. Hence, intervention should be given the ways to increase weight and hemoglobin levels of patients during follow up of antiretroviral therapy.",

Through sequencing the C2V3 region of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope, we studied the effect of short-term therapy on virus variants derived from naïve, central memory and effector memory CD4+ lymphocyte subsets.During short-term ART, HIV-1 infection levels declined in all lymphocyte subsets but not as much as RNA levels in serum. Virus diversity in the naïve and central memory lymphocyte populations remained unchanged, whilst diversity decreased in serum and the effector memory lymphocytes. ART differentially affected the virus populations co-circulating in one individual harboring a dual HIV-1 infection. Changes in V3 charge were found in all individuals after ART initiation with increases within the effector memory subset and decreases found in the naïve cell population.During early ART virus diversity is affected mainly in the serum and effector memory cell compartments. Differential alterations in V3 charge were observed between effector memory and naïve populations. While certain cell populations can be targeted preferentially during early ART, some virus strains demonstrate varied sensitivity to therapy, as shown from studying two strains within a dual HIV-1 infected individual.",

Because the pathophysiological mechanism of HIV-associated lipodystrophy remains to be elucidated, we analyzed subcutaneous adipose tissues from the patients. Methods All six patients had previously been treated with older nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs; stavudine, didanosine or zidovudine). Abdominal and inguinal subcutaneous fat samples were obtained from the HIV+ patients with hemophilia and HIV− healthy volunteers (n = 6 per group), and analyzed via DNA microarray, real-time PCR, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Results The time from initial NRTI treatment to collecting samples were 21.7 years in average. Cytometric analysis revealed infiltration of inflammatory M1 macrophages into HIV-infected adipose tissue and depletion of adipose-derived stem cells, possibly due to exhaustion following sustained adipocyte death. Genetic analysis revealed that adipose tissue from HIV+ group had increased immune activation, mitochondrial toxicity, chronic inflammation, progressive fibrosis and adipocyte dysfunction (e.g. insulin resistance, inhibited adipocyte differentiation and accelerated apoptosis). Of note, both triglyceride synthesis and lipolysis were inhibited in adipose tissue from patients with HIV. Conclusions Our findings provide important insights into the pathogenesis of HIV-associated lipodystrophy, suggesting that fat redistribution may critically depend on adipocytes’ sensitivity to drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity, which may lead either to atrophy or metabolic complications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Medication adherence plays a pivotal role in achieving the desired treatment outcomes. The proportion of HIV patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy is becoming a growing public health concern. However, to date, little attention has been given to second-line antiretroviral medication adherence. Moreover, the association between health facility characteristics and medication adherence has yet not been tested. Thus, this research was conducted to determine the magnitude of medication adherence and examine the role of facility-level determinants among HIV patients on second-line ART. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 714 HIV patients on second-line therapy who were selected via systematic random sampling in twenty public health facilities. Medication adherence was measured using the six-item Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ) tool. Data were collected in a personal interview as well as document reviews. A multi-level binary logistic regression was used to uncover individual and facility-level determinants. The effect size was presented using an adjusted odds ratio (AOR), and statistical significance was declared at a P value less than 0.05. Results The magnitude of optimal medication adherence among HIV patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy was 69.5% (65.9–72.7%). Medication adherence was positively associated with the use of adherence reminder methods [AOR = 3.37, (95% CI 2.03–5.62)], having social support [AOR = 1.11, (95% CI 1.02–1.23)], and not having clinical depression [AOR = 3.19, (95% CI 1.93–5.27). The number of adherence counselors [AOR = 1.20, (95% CI 1.04–1.40)], teamwork for enhanced adherence support [AOR = 1.82, (95% CI 1.01–3.42)], and caseloads at ART clinics were all significantly correlated with ARV medication adherence at the facility level. Conclusions A large proportion of HIV patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy had adherence problems. Both facility-level and individual-level were linked with patient medication adherence. Thus, based on the identified factors, individual and system-level interventions should be targeted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Thanks to direct-acting antivirals, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be cured, with similar rates in HCV-infected and HIV–HCV co-infected patients. HCV cure is likely to foster behavioral changes in psychoactive substance use, which is highly prevalent in people living with HIV (PLWH). Cannabis is one substance that is very commonly used by PLWH, sometimes for therapeutic purposes. We aimed to identify correlates of cannabis use reduction following HCV cure in HIV–HCV co-infected cannabis users and to characterize persons who reduced their use. Methods We used data collected on HCV-cured cannabis users in a cross-sectional survey nested in the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort of HIV–HCV co-infected patients, to perform logistic regression, with post-HCV cure cannabis reduction as the outcome, and socio-behavioral characteristics as potential correlates. We also characterized the study sample by comparing post-cure substance use behaviors between those who reduced their cannabis use and those who did not. Results Among 140 HIV-infected cannabis users, 50 and 5 had reduced and increased their use, respectively, while 85 had not changed their use since HCV cure. Cannabis use reduction was significantly associated with tobacco use reduction, a decrease in fatigue level, paying more attention to one’s dietary habits since HCV cure, and pre-HCV cure alcohol abstinence (p = 0.063 for alcohol use reduction). Conclusions Among PLWH using cannabis, post-HCV cure cannabis reduction was associated with tobacco use reduction, improved well-being, and adoption of healthy behaviors. The management of addictive behaviors should therefore be encouraged during HCV treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been linked with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in populations where some individuals are seronegative. However, effects of CMV are unclear in HIV patients who all have high levels of CMV antibodies. Other metrics of their CMV burden are needed. Amongst transplant recipients, CMV drives the expansion of NK cell populations expressing NKG2C and/or LIR1 and lacking FcRγ. Methods Indonesian HIV patients (n = 40) were tested before ART and after 6 months, with healthy local controls (n = 20). All patients had high CMV antibody titres. 52% started therapy with CMV DNA detectable by qPCR, providing a crude measure of CMV burden. Proportions of CD56 Hi or CD56 Lo NK cells expressing FcRγ, NKG2C or LIR1 were determined flow cytometrically. CVD was predicted using carotid intimal media thickness (cIMT). Values were correlated with levels of CMV antibodies on ART. Results Patients had low proportions of CD56 Lo and more CD56 Hi NK cells. However proportions of FcRγ − NK cells were lowest in patients with CMV DNA, and cIMT values related inversely with FcRγ − NK cells in these patients. Percentages of NKG2C + CD56 Lo NK cells were similar in patients and controls, but rose in patients with CMV DNA. Proportions of NKG2C + CD56 Hi NK cells correlated with levels of CMV antibodies in CMV DNA-negative patients. Conclusions We show that the very high burdens of CMV in this population confound systems developed to study effects of CMV in other populations. FcRγ − NK cells may be depleted by very high CMV burdens, but NKG2C and antibody levels may be informative in patients on ART.",

There are currently few data on ART regimens that include Integrase inhibitors (INSTIs) other than RAL among this patient subgroup. Methods We evaluated the safety and efficacy of different kinds of INSTI-based regimens among patients with HIV and concomitant colorectal cancer (CRC) who received antineoplastic agents. Results From January 2020 to November 2021, 66 patients were enrolled. The patients were divided into three groups: 20 patients treated with dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC)/tenofovir (TDF) (group I), 24 patients treated with DTG/albuvirtide (ABT) (group II), and 22 patients treated with bictegravir (BIC)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/emtricitabine (FTC) (group III). The majority of AEs during treatment were of grade 1–2. Treatment‐related AEs of grade 3–4 occurred in 6 patients (9.09%), and no grade 5 AEs occurred. The most common AEs were nausea (100%) and neutrophils (84.85%) attributed to anticancer agents, and there was no significant difference in the incidence of these AEs among the three groups (P &gt; 0.05). Viral load rebound was not observed among pretreated patients during chemotherapy. The viral load of untreated patients who started their ART concomitant with chemotherapy almost decreased to the lower limit of detection 6 months after ART initiation (only one patient in group III had a viral load of 102 copies/ml). At the 6th month, the CD4 count in group I decreased significantly from baseline (P &lt; 0.05). However, the change in CD4 count was not significant in group II (P = 0.457) or group III (P = 0.748). Conclusions DTG- or BIC-containing regimens are good options for patients with HIV and concomitant CRC.",

Health professionals should be able to assess PLHIV who are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 and provide appropriate medical treatment. This study aimed to assess clinical factors associated with COVID-19 severity and developed a scoring system to predict severe COVID-19 infection among PLHIV. Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated PLHIV at four hospitals diagnosed with COVID-19 during the first and second wave COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The independent risk factors related to the severity of COVID-19 were identified with multivariate logistic regression. Results 342 PLHIV were diagnosed with COVID-19, including 23 with severe-critical diseases. The cumulative incidence up to December 2021 was 0.083 (95% CI 0.074–0.092). Twenty-three patients developed severe-critical COVID-19, and the mortality rate was 3.2% (95% CI 1.61%–5.76%). Having any comorbidity, CD4 count of &lt; 200 cells/mm 3 , not being on ART, and active opportunistic infection were independent risk factors for developing severe COVID-19.

    "abstract": "This easy-to-read, scrupulously researched, and fascinating book addresses two critical, but stubborn problems which threaten to reduce the effectiveness of many externally-funded HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs in Africa. First is the reluctance by biomedical and public health practitioners to recognize the essential value of qualitative and ethnographic data for the success of AIDS intervention programs in Africa. Second is the challenge of explaining the culturally coherent logic behind the seemingly irrational and contradictory views of Africans who blame sorcery and witchcraft for the HIV/AIDS epidemic. While this book will not completely solve both of these entrenched problems, it is a powerful statement about the value of systematically studying local explanatory models of the AIDS epidemic and offers a convincing and fine-grained analysis of the African quest to explain and account for personal misfortune in a time of significant social and economic uncertainty.\r\n\r\nRodlach's description of AIDS-related sorcery accusations and conspiracy theories is rooted in over a decade of work and research in rural and urban Zimbabwe. Although the book focuses specifically on Zimbabwe, there are many similarities to accounts of the AIDS epidemic elsewhere throughout southern and central Africa. His methodology draws on the usual skill-set of a qualitative researcher (key-informant interviews, observation, focus-groups, printed media and archival research, etc) and his theoretical framework rarely veers far from the standard anthropological literature on witchcraft in Africa (Douglas, Herdt and Stoller, Comaroff and Comaroff, Geschiere, Ashforth); but his extended residence in Zimbabwe as a practicing priest in the local Catholic Church clearly distinguishes him from other social scientific researchers. Fluent in Ndebele, Rodlach gained the confidence of his informants as he ministered to their suffering; this trust made possible his frank discussions about deeply-held and often hidden explanations of AIDS misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe chapters on conspiracy theories will be of most interest to clinicians, medical researchers, and other healthcare providers as these professionals feature prominently in local explanations of the origin of HIV and the spread of AIDS. In fact, these are Rodlach's strongest chapters because they are based on a broad and diverse range of evidence and, unlike accusations of sorcery and witchcraft, conspiracy theories are publicly discussed thus revealing a shared consensus and logic. The origin of HIV is sometimes attributed to clever (meaning selfish) western researchers and their Zimbabwean colleagues whose experiments on HIV in primates went awry and infected the human population. Rodlach suggests that this local disgust of biomedical research originates in strong taboos against transgressions of primate-human boundaries, the researchers' failure to adhere to other local knowledge and traditions, and the suspect intentions of anyone who is personally enriched by biomedical research. Clearly, this is fertile ground for the emergence of a conspiracy theory that holds biomedical research responsible for the spread of HIV. Rodlach then situates these seemingly irrational beliefs in the context of colonial medical practices during the Spanish Influenza epidemic of 1918–1919, rampant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality, and the poisoning of maize flour by white Rhodesian farmers. This serves to demonstrate that that which is seemingly irrational is, in fact, a logical interpretation of the origin of HIV/AIDS against these historical circumstances.\r\n\r\nAlso of interest to healthcare practitioners is an explanation of why even literate and educated Zimbabweans can simultaneously hold both biomedical and conspiracy explanations for the origin and transmission of HIV. Elite and healthy civil sector professionals who initially discredit sorcery charges may later invoke these same explanations to account for why they are diagnosed with AIDS when others are not. To explain this, Rodlach argues that causality is ambiguous. Because a variety of biomedical and social factors can lead to the symptoms of AIDS, and these causal factors can be variously categorized as remote, intermediate, proximate, or ultimate, it is therefore possible for people to hold multiple and even contradictory explanations of HIV. Clearly, the most effective AIDS education programs engage with, rather than deny, these multiple explanations. However, the link between beliefs and behaviors was not substantially addressed in the book, and the cursory discussion of the A-B-C controversy needed more critical attention. Despite these small shortcomings, Witches, Westerners, and HIV is an engaging discussion of a difficult and complex topic, and as a result, this book is an important contribution to the literature on explanatory models of HIV/AIDS in Africa.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of HIV-1 resistance to antiretroviral therapies (ART) has declined in high-income countries over recent years, but drug resistance remains a substantial concern in many low and middle-income countries. The Q151M and T69 insertion (T69i) resistance mutations in the viral reverse transcriptase gene can reduce susceptibility to all nucleoside/tide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors, motivating the present study to investigate the risk factors and outcomes associated with these mutations. We considered all data in the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database for blood samples obtained in the period 1997–2014. Where available, treatment history and patient outcomes were obtained through linkage to the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort study. A matched case–control approach was used to assess risk factors associated with the appearance of each of the mutations in ART-experienced patients, and survival analysis was used to investigate factors associated with viral suppression. A further analysis using matched controls was performed to investigate the impact of each mutation on survival. A total of 180 patients with Q151M mutation and 85 with T69i mutation were identified, almost entirely from before 2006. Occurrence of both the Q151M and T69i mutations was strongly associated with cumulative period of virological failure while on ART, and for Q151M there was a particular positive association with use of stavudine and negative association with use of boosted-protease inhibitors. Subsequent viral suppression was negatively associated with viral load at sequencing for both mutations, and for Q151M we found a negative association with didanosine use but a positive association with boosted-protease inhibitor use. The results obtained in these analyses were also consistent with potentially large associations with other drugs. Analyses were inconclusive regarding associations between the mutations and mortality, but mortality was high for patients with low CD4 at detection. The Q151M and T69i resistance mutations are now very rare in the UK. Our results suggest that good outcomes are possible for people with these mutations. However, in this historic sample, viral load and CD4 at detection were important factors in determining prognosis.",

In particular, the gap in HTR was mainly attributed to variation in characteristics such as ever had sex (34.7%) and ever given birth (31.6%) and variation in effects of characteristics such as education level (− 68.8%) and marital status (− 12.6%).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Vacuolar encephalomyelopathy, a disregarded diagnosis lately, was a major neurological disease in the terminal stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection in the pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. Granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD) was classically identified as a non-infectious complication of common variable immunodeficiency; however, it is now being recognized in other immunodeficiency disorders. Here, we report the first case of GLILD accompanied by vacuolar encephalomyelopathy in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected man. Case presentation A 40-year-old Japanese man presented with chronic dry cough and progressing paraplegia. Radiological examination revealed diffuse pulmonary abnormalities in bilateral lungs, focal demyelinating lesions of the spinal cord, and white matter lesions in the brain. He was diagnosed with GLILD based on marked lymphocytosis detecting in bronchoalveolar lavage, and transbronchial-biopsy proven T-cellular interstitial lung disease with granulomas. Microbiological examinations did not reveal an etiologic agent. The patient was also diagnosed with HIV-associated vacuolar encephalomyelopathy on the basis of an elevated HIV viral load in cerebrospinal fluid. After initiating ART, the brain lesions and paraplegia improved significantly, and interstitial abnormalities of the lungs and cough disappeared. Conclusion This report highlights that even in the post-ART era in developed countries with advanced healthcare services, HIV-associated vacuolar encephalomyelopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a progressive neurological disorder during the first visit. Furthermore, GLILD may represent an HIV-associated pulmonary manifestation that can be treated by ART.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In pregnancy, reduction of HIV plasma viral load (pVL) for the prevention of vertical transmission is time-constrained. The study primary objective is to investigate factors associated with faster initial HIV RNA half-life decay when combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) is initiated in pregnancy. Methods This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational study, conducted in south England, United Kingdom, between August 2001 and February 2018. Data were extracted from case notes of eligible women initiating cART during the index pregnancy. Anonymised data were collated and analysed centrally. Regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with faster HIV RNA half-life decay in the first 14 days after commencing cART (first-phase), and with achieving an undetectable maternal pVL by 36 weeks’ gestation. We then assessed whether HIV- and obstetric- related parameters differed by antiretroviral third agent class and whether the proportions of women with undetectable pVL at 36 weeks’ gestation and at delivery differed by antiretroviral third agent class. Results Baseline pVL was the only independent factor associated with faster first-phase HIV RNA half-life decay on commencing cART. Lower pVL on day 14 after starting cART was associated with an increased likelihood of achieving an undetectable pVL by 36 weeks’ gestation. Integrase inhibitor-based cART was associated with a faster first-phase HIV RNA half-life decay on commencing cART. Overall, 73% and 85% of women had an undetectable pVL at 36 weeks’ gestation and at delivery respectively, with no significant difference by antiretroviral third agent class. Conclusions Only high baseline pVL independently contributed to a faster rate of first-phase viral half-life decay. pVL at 14 days after initiating cART allows early identification of treatment failure. In the first 14 days after initiating cART in pregnancy, integrase inhibitor-based cART reduced maternal pVL faster than protease inhibitor- and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase-based cART. While our study findings support INSTI use when initiated in pregnancy especially when initiated at later gestations and in those with higher baseline pVL, other non-INSTI based cART with more data on safety in pregnancy also performed well.",

We hypothesized that such variation and/or differences in the degree to which these cells expressed the immunoregulatory enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), would be associated with CD4(+) T cell recovery after the initiation of ART. This hypothesis was tested in a cross-sectional study of four groups of HIV-infected subjects, including those who were seronegative, untreated virologic controllers [detectable viral load (VL) of <1000 copies/mL], untreated virologic non-controllers [VL > 10,000 copies/mL], and ART-mediated virologic controllers [VL < 75 copies/mL]. A longitudinal analysis of ART-treated subjects was also performed along with regression analysis to determine which biomarkers were associated with and/or predictive of CD4(+) T cell recovery. Suppressive ART was associated with increased levels of classical monocyte subpopulations (CD14(hi)CD16(-)) and decreased levels of non-classical monocyte populations (CD14(dim)CD16(+)). Among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), HO-1 was found to be most highly up-regulated in CD14(+) monocytes after ex vivo stimulation. Neither the levels of monocyte subpopulations nor of HO-1 expression in CD14(+) monocytes were significantly associated with the degree of CD4(+) T cell recovery. Monocyte subpopulations and HO-1 gene expression were, however, restored to normal levels by suppressive ART.

Total state-based federal funding for HIV, state-based funding for HIV prevention, and state-based funding for HIV treatment were compared to state-based HIV diagnosis and prevalence rates from 2006-2009. Total state-based federal funding for HIV and funding for HIV prevention and treatment were highly correlated with HIV diagnosis and prevalence rates during the time horizon of the study; however, correlations between state-based HIV prevention funding and state-based HIV diagnosis rates were lower than the correlations between state-based HIV treatment funding and HIV prevalence. Our findings suggest that state-based federal resource allocation for HIV prevention and treatment may be better aligned with HIV diagnosis and prevalence rates than previously reported; however resource allocation for HIV prevention is less aligned than funding for HIV treatment signaling the need to reexamine state-based federal funding for HIV prevention.",

    "abstract": "The success of antiretroviral therapy in resource-scarce settings is an illustration that complex healthcare interventions can be successfully delivered even in fragile health systems. Documenting the success factors in the scale-up of HIV care and treatment in resource constrained settings will enable health systems to prepare for changing population health needs. This study describes changing demographic and clinical characteristics of adult pre-ART cohorts, and identifies predictors of pre-ART attrition at a large urban HIV clinic in Nairobi, Kenya.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of data on HIV infected adults (≥15 years) enrolling in pre-ART care between January 2004 and September 2015. Attrition (loss to program) was defined as those who died or were lost to follow-up (having no contact with the facility for at least 6 months). We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to determine time to event for the different modes of transition, and Cox proportional hazards models to determine predictors of pre-ART attrition.Over the 12 years of observation, there were increases in the proportions of young people (age 15 to 24 years); and patients presenting with early disease (by WHO clinical stage and higher median CD4 cell counts), p = 0.0001 for trend. Independent predictors of attrition included: aHR (95% CI): male gender 1.98 (1.69-2.33), p = 0.0001; age 20-24 years 1.80 (1.37-2.37), p = 0.0001), or 25-34 years 1.22 (1.01-1.47), p = 0.0364; marital status single 1.55 (1.29-1.86), p = 0.0001) or divorced 1.41(1.02-1.95), p = 0.0370; urban residency 1.83 (1.40-2.38), p = 0.0001; CD4 count of 0-100 cells/µl 1.63 (1.003-2.658), p = 0.0486 or CD4 count >500 cells/µl 2.14(1.46-3.14), p = 0.0001.In order to optimize the impact of HIV prevention, care and treatment in resource scarce settings, there is an urgent need to implement prevention and treatment interventions targeting young people and patients entering care with severe immunosuppression (CD4 cell counts <100 cells/µl). Additionally, care and treatment programmes should strengthen inter-facility referrals and linkages to improve care coordination and prevent leakages in the HIV care continuum.",

Interventions included clinician education, point-of-care lactate meters, switch from stavudine to zidovudine in high risk patients and stavudine dose reduction. This study assessed trends in referral rate, severity at presentation and case fatality rate for severe SHL. Retrospective study of severe SHL cases diagnosed at a referral facility from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2008. Severe SHL was defined as patients with compatible symptoms and serum lactate ≥ 5 mmol/l attributable to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Cumulative ART exposure at referring ART clinics was used to calculate referral rates. There were 254 severe SHL cases. The referral rate (per thousand patient years [py] ART exposure) peaked in 2005 (20.4/1000py), but fell to 1.3/1000py by 2008 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.07, 95%CI 0.04-0.11). In 2003, 66.7% of cases presented with a standard bicarbonate (SHCO3) level <15 mmol/l, but this fell to 12.5% by 2008 (p for trend < 0.001). Case fatality rate fell from a peak of 33.3% in 2004 to 0% in 2008 (p for trend = 0.002). These trends suggest the interventions were associated with reduced referral, less severe metabolic acidosis at presentation and improved survival.",

We assessed whether routinely collected clinical markers could improve prediction of concurrent HIV RNA levels.We included individuals followed within the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort who initiated antiretroviral therapy and had concurrent HIV RNA and biomarker measurements >/=4 months after HAART. A two tiered approach to determine whether clinical markers could improve prediction included: 1) identification of predictors of HIV RNA levels >500 copies/ml and 2) construction and validation of a prediction model.Three markers (mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], CD4, and change in percent CD4 from pre-HAART levels) in addition to the change in MCH from pre-HAART levels contained the most predictive information for identifying an HIV RNA >500 copies/ml. However, MCH and change in MCH were the two most predictive followed by CD4 and change in percent CD4. The logistic prediction model in the validation data had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.69-0.79) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.91), respectively.Immunologic criteria have been shown to be a poor guideline for identifying individuals with high HIV RNA levels. MCH and change in MCH were the strongest predictors of HIV RNA levels >500. When combined with CD4 and percent CD4 as covariates in a model, a high level of discrimination between those with and without HIV RNA levels >500 was obtained. These data suggest an unexplored relationship between HIV RNA and MCH.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Pediatric tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and TB-HIV co-infection are health problems with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithms that can reduce morbidity and mortality. Implementation and operational barriers affect adherence to guidelines in many resource-constrained settings, negatively affecting patient outcomes. This study aimed to assess performance in the pediatric HIV and TB care cascades in Mozambique. Methods A retrospective analysis of routine PEPFAR site-level HIV and TB data from 2012 to 2016 was performed. Patients 0–14 years of age were included. Descriptive statistics were used to report trends in TB and HIV indicators. Linear regression was done to assess associations of site-level variables with performance in the pediatric TB and HIV care cascades using 2016 data. Results Routine HIV testing and cotrimoxazole initiation for co-infected children in the TB program were nearly optimal at 99% and 96% in 2016, respectively. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation was lower at 87%, but steadily improved from 2012 to 2016. From the HIV program, TB screening at the last consultation rose steadily over the study period, reaching 82% in 2016. The percentage of newly enrolled children who received either TB treatment or isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT) also steadily improved in all provinces, but in 2016 was only at 42% nationally. Larger volume sites were significantly more likely to complete the pediatric HIV and TB care cascades in 2016 (p value range 0.05 to &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Mozambique has made significant strides in improving the pediatric care cascades for children with TB and HIV, but there were missed opportunities for TB diagnosis and prevention, with IPT utilization being particularly problematic. Strengthened TB/HIV programming that continues to focus on pediatric ART scale-up while improving delivery of TB preventive therapy, either with IPT or newer rifapentine-based regimens for age-eligible children, is needed.",

The main objective of this study to identify the determinants of CD4 cell count among antiretroviral therapy attendants of infected adults follow up in Gonder teaching referral hospital, Gonder, Ethiopia implemented by SAS version 94. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 216 regular follow up patients whose age greater than 14 years from December 1, 2012, to December 30, 2017. A multilevel model was used to identify the factors of CD4 cell count of patients and it considered variability between and within patients. The mean with a standard deviation of weight, and a hemoglobin level of patients were 55.48 (10.21), and 18.25 (33.028) respectively. This study concluded that the variation for CD4 cell count existed between patients was 63% and the remaining 37% of variation existing within patients. In this study, the random coefficient time-varying covariate model was well fitted which shows weight and hemoglobin level were statistically significant predictors at a 5% level of significance for the log of CD4 cell count of patients. This study shows the hemoglobin level and weight of patients were statistically significant for the log of CD4 cell count of patients follow up in Gonder teaching referral hospital, Gonder, Ethiopia. Moreover, the result of the study shows that the log of CD4 count of patients increased when hemoglobin level and weight of patients increased. Hence, intervention should be given the ways to increase weight and hemoglobin levels of patients during follow up of antiretroviral therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV is an infectious disease affecting 36.7 million people worldwide. In recent times, Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) has become accessible to the majority of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and this has transformed the course of infection to one that is chronic, characterized by fewer diseases pathognomonic of AIDS. In view of this, there is a pressing need for better markers, apart from the routine HIV indicators, to detect comorbidities such as Neurocognitive Impairment (NCI). The aim of this study was to find out the association between Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) index and Neurocognitive function in HIV positive patients. Methods In our study, we included 97 HIV positive patients and their Neurocognitive function was assessed using a combination of Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Grooved Pegboard Test, while VACS index was calculated using the most recent laboratory values. Binomial Logistics Regression analyses, adjusting for potential confounding variables, was performed to determine the association between VACS score and Neurocognitive Impairment. Results We found that a higher VACS Index was associated with global and domain-wise Neurocognitive impairment (p &lt; 0.01), specifically in the domains of attention (p &lt; 0.01) and fine motor skills (p = 0.01). Our study also showed that among all the VACS components, older age (p = 0.02) and lower hemoglobin (p &lt; 0.01) values were associated with global NCI. After plotting an ROC curve, a VACS cut-off score of 11.00 was identified as it had good sensitivity (87.0%) and specificity (71.4%) in identifying Global NCI. Conclusion Our findings extend prior research on the use of VACS Index to predict global and domain-wise NCI in HIV-positive patients. However, further research with more comprehensive neurocognitive testing is required in our setting before VACS Index can be used as a tool to screen for neurocognitive dysfunction among PLHIV.",

    "abstract": "For over a decade, antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited countries was only recommended for patients with advanced HIV disease. We investigated this group of patients in order to determine any relationship between degree of immunosuppression during treatment initiation and the subsequent levels of inflammatory biomarkers, reservoir size and plasma marker of fungal translocation after achieving long-term virological control.We analyzed 115 virally suppressed (female 83.5%) and 40 untreated (female 70%) subjects from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The size of HIV latent reservoir (proviral DNA copy) was determined using quantitative PCR. Inflammatory biomarkers; IL-6, IL-10, and soluble CD14 (sCD14), were measured using multiplex cytometric beads array. Antibody titers for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV), plasma level of 1-3-beta-D-Glucan (BDG) was measured using ELISA. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured using nephelometric method.The median age was 36 (IQR 32-44) and 47 (IQR 43-54) years in untreated and virally suppressed patients respectively. Median duration of treatment for virally suppressed patients was 9 years (IQR 7-12) and median baseline CD4 count was 147 cells/mm3 (IQR 65-217). Virally suppressed patients were associated with significantly lower plasma levels of IL-10, sCD14 and BDG (P < 0.05) when compared to untreated patients. However, plasma level of IL-6 was similar between the groups. Baseline advanced level of immunosuppression (CD4 < 100cells/cm3) was associated with significantly higher plasma level of IL-6 (P = 0.02), hsCRP (P = 0.036) and BDG (P = 0.0107). This relationship was not seen in plasma levels of other tested markers. Degree of baseline immunosuppression was not associated with the subsequent proviral DNA copy. In addition, plasma levels of inflammatory marker were not associated with sex, CMV or EBV antibody titers, treatment duration or regimen.Our data suggest that advanced immunosuppression at ART initiation is associated with severity of inflammation and elevated fungal translocation marker despite long term virological control. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential increased burden of non-AIDS comorbidities that are linked to elevated inflammatory and fungal translocation markers as a result of the policy of HIV treatment at CD4 count < 200 cells/cm3 implemented for over a decade in Tanzania.",

Research in the HIV/AIDS field typically relies on clinical and epidemiological studies, thereby often excluding social dimensions of the illness as well as factors explaining its prevention. The current study analyzes HIV-prevention through an interdisciplinary theoretical approach. It aims to comprehensively understand the mechanisms associated with the willingness to take PrEP among MSM in terms of psychological, social, behavioral, cultural, and demographic factors. Methods We analyze data from the survey “Gay Men and AIDS” conducted in Germany in 2013 prior to market approval for PrEP. Analyses were performed using the statistical software SPSS 25.0, while results were visualized using the R programming language. Results We find that perceived risk of infection, social norms (anticipated HIV-stigma), practices (e.g. regular condomless sex), and socio-demographic factors (young age, being single) all have a positive effect on the willingness to take PrEP, while education reveals a negative, and income no effect. Conclusions Results indicate that beyond well-established socio-psychological mechanisms of health behavior, social factors play a crucial role in understanding the willingness of PrEP uptake. This study enriches existing health behavior theories with sociological concepts such as social norms and social practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background AIDS-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (AR-PCNSL) is an AIDS-defining disease that usually occurs when the CD4 count is less than 50 cells/μl. The frequency of the disease has substantially decreased in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Prognosis is poor with rapid progression leading to death within 2–3 months if left untreated. Case description A 65 years old male presented to medical attention with gait disturbance, weight loss and slight left-sided hemiparesis. Human immunodeficiency virus infection was diagnosed with an initial CD4 count of 116 cells/µl and a viral load of 260,000 copies/ml. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed three brain lesions involving the right frontal lobe and the left parietal lobe, which on biopsy led to a diagnosis of AR-PCNSL. HAART was initiated with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and the patient declined systemic chemotherapy. Due to poor performance status, he was transferred to palliative care. Under HAART, he slowly recovered with normalization of CD4 count and undetectable viral load. Medical imaging showed complete remission (CR) of the brain lesions. At 3-year follow-up, the patient remains in CR, but presented mild neurocognitive dysfunction possibly secondary to WBRT. Conclusion Nowadays, treatment paradigm parallels that of primary central nervous system lymphoma in the immunocompetent population based on systemic chemotherapy (primarily high-dose intravenous methotrexate and steroids) in association with HAART. The role of WBRT is questionable because of late neurotoxic effects.",

We evaluated drug resistance mutations at 39 codon sites (21 protease inhibitor (PI) resistant codons and 18 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistant codons) for 92 clinically stable NRTI-experienced, PI-naive HIV-infected children 2 to 17 years of age who were initiating new therapy with ritonavir plus zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine or plus stavudine. The association between baseline drug resistance mutations and subsequent viral failure after 12 and 24 weeks of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was studied. There were few primary PI associated mutations in this PI-naïve population, but 84% had NRTI mutations – codons 215 (66%), 41 (42%), 67 (37%), 210 (33%) and 70 (32%). None of the specific baseline drug resistance mutations were associated with a higher rate of virologic failure after 12 or 24 weeks of HAART. Median week 12 viral load decreased as the total number of NRTI mutations at baseline increased (P = 0.006). Specifically, a higher level of baseline ZDV resistance mutation was associated with a decrease in viral failure after 12 weeks on a ZDV-containing HAART regimen (P = 0.017). No increase was seen in the rate of viral failure after HAART associated with the presence of resistance mutations at baseline. This paradoxical result may be due to adherence, replicative capacity, or ZDV hypersusceptibility to the new regimen.",

However, the role of regulatory T cells (T regs ) and Programmed death-1 (PD-1) in intestinal CMV infection is unclear. In this study, we evaluate the expression of programmed death -1 (PD-1) and its association with regulatory T cells (T regs ) in patients with HIV/AIDS having CMV colitis. Methods CMV was detected in the intestinal mucosal biopsy samples via nucleic acid in situ hybridization. PD-1, CD4, CD8, and T reg -specific marker as well as the winged-helix transcription factor and forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) were detected by immunohistochemical methods. Results Intestinal CMV diease was identified in 20 out of 195 patients with HIV/AIDS enrolled in our study. CMV was diagnosed microscopically by the presence of giant cell inclusion bodies in epithelial cells, histiocytes, and fibroblasts. Levels of immunoreactive PD-1 detected in mucosal biopsies from patients with HIV/AIDS having CMV colitis were significantly higher than CMV-negative control group ( p = 0.023). FoxP3 + cells were detected in the CMV colitis group slight more than that in the control group. CD4 + T lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood and intestinal mucosal biopsies from CMV colitis group were all notably decreased compared with those with control group ( p &lt; 0.001 for both). PD-1 had a significant negative correlation with CD4 counts in intestinal mucosa ( p = 0.016). CD8 + T lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa were slightly lower than those in the control group, although the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions CMV colitis with HIV/AIDS is associated with significant changes in T lymphocyte populations. These findings may have important implications for disease pathogenesis and progression.",

The use of RAL 1200 mg once daily (qd) for first-line therapy is well established. We assessed efficacy and safety of RAL 1200 mg qd, as part of triple combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), for maintenance strategy. Methods The QDISS trial (NCT03195452) was a 48-week multicenter, single-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate the ability of 2 NRTIs + RAL 1200 mg qd to maintain virological suppression in HIV-1 infected subjects on a stable cART with 2 NRTIs and a third agent for at least 6 months. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at week 24, by the FDA snapshot algorithm. Results Of 100 participants 91% maintained viral suppression (95% CI: 83.6–95.8) at week 24 and 89% (81.2–94.4) at week 48. At week 24, there was one virological failure, without emergence of resistance-associated mutation and 10 participants had discontinued, 4 because of adverse events (AEs). Over 48 weeks, 7 AEs of grade 3–4 were reported, one possibly study-drug related (spontaneous abortion). BMI remained stable regardless of previous therapy or baseline BMI category. Over 48 weeks, total cholesterol ( p = 0.023) and LDL-cholesterol ( p = 0.009) decreased, lifestyle and ease subscale significantly improved ( p = 0.04). The quality of life and Patients Reported Outcomes (PROs) also improved at W12 ( p = 0.007).

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Evidence on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes is limited for new antiretroviral therapies (ART). Dolutegravir-based treatment is being rolled out as the preferred first-line treatment for HIV in many low- and middle-income countries. We compared HRQoL between treatment-naïve pregnant women randomized to dolutegravir- or efavirenz-based ART in a clinical trial in Uganda and South Africa. Methods We gathered HRQoL data from 203 pregnant women of mean age 28 years, randomized to either dolutegravir- or efavirenz-based ART. We used the medical outcomes study-HIV health survey at baseline, 24 and 48 weeks between years 2018 and 2019. Physical health summary (PHS) and mental health summary (MHS) scores were the primary study outcomes, while the 11 MOS-HIV subscales were secondary outcomes. We applied mixed model analysis to estimate differences within and between-treatment groups. Multivariate regression analysis was included to identify associations between primary outcomes and selected variables. Results At 24 weeks postpartum, HRQoL scores increased from baseline in both treatment arms: PHS (10.40, 95% CI 9.24, 11.55) and MHS (9.23, 95% CI 7.35, 11.10) for dolutegravir-based ART; PHS (10.24, 95% CI 9.10, 11.38) and MHS (7.54, 95% CI 5.66, 9.42) for efavirenz-based ART. Increased scores for all secondary outcomes were significant at p &lt; 0.0001. At 48 weeks, improvements remained significant for primary outcomes within group comparison. Estimated difference in PHS were higher in the dolutegravir-based arm, while increases in MHS were more for women in the efavirenz-based armat 24 and 48 weeks. No significant differences were noted for corresponding PHS scores at these time points compared between groups. Differences between arms were observed in two secondary outcomes: role function (1.11, 95% CI 0.08, 2.13), p = 0.034 and physical function outcomes (2.97, 95% CI 1.20, 4.73), p = 0.001. In the multivariate analysis, internet access was associated with higher PHS scores while owning a bank account, using the internet and longer treatment duration were associated with an increase in MHS scores. Conclusion We found no important differences in HRQoL outcomes among HIV-positive women started on dolutegravir relative to efavirenz in late pregnancy. Increases in HRQoL in the first year after delivery provide additional support for the initiation of ART in HIV-positive women presenting late in pregnancy.

Nonadherence to ART is one of the HIV care problem in Liberia despite the availability of free ART. Psychosocial factors, i.e., perceived stigma and social support likely contributed to nonadherence to ART. We investigated associations among clinical factors, psychosocial factors, and nonadherence to ART. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 185 PLWH, age ≥ 18 years receiving ART in Ganta, Nimba county, Liberia at least 3 months. The structured questionnaire was used to collect data from April to May 2020. Associated factors of nonadherence to ART were identified using multivariable binary logistic regression, and the p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of 185 respondents, 62.2% showed nonadherence to ART. Females reported higher nonadherence compared with males (64.4% vs. 56.6%). Multivariable binary logistic regression revealed strong experiences of stigma (PORadj = 2.392, p-value = 0.018), poor information support (PORadj = 2.102, p-value = 0.026) increased prevalence of ART nonadherence among Liberian PLWH. Conclusions The healthcare providers may apply interventions to reduce perceived stigma and to enhance continuous information provision in addition to support from health care providers and family members. An intensive monitoring of ART side effects is needed to be strengthened in particular among newly started ART patients.",

Pharmacologic measures are objective, but pharmacy refill data is more accessible and cost-efficient. This study compared short-term and long-term efavirenz (EFV) drug levels with pharmacy refill adherence data (PRA) and evaluated their ability to predict viral suppression among people living with HIV in Nigeria.Paired hair and dried blood spot (DBS) samples were obtained from 91 adults living with HIV receiving 600 mg EFV-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) and EFV concentrations were measured via validated methods using liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry. PRA was estimated from pharmacy records, based on the number of days a patient collected medication before or after the scheduled pick-up date. PRA was categorized into ≤ 74%, 75-94% and ≥ 95%, defined as poor, medium and high adherence, respectively. HIV viral loads closest to the hair sampling time (within 6 months) were also abstracted. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analyses compared the ability of adherence metrics to predict viral suppression.Based on PRA, 81% of participants had high adherence while 11% and 8% had medium and poor adherence, respectively. The median (IQR) EFV concentrations were 6.85 ng/mg (4.56-10.93) for hair and 1495.6 ng/ml (1050.7-2365.8) for DBS. Of the three measures of adherence, hair EFV concentration had the highest Area Under Curve (AUC) to predict viral suppression. Correlations between EFV concentrations in DBS and hair with PRA were positive (r = 0.12, P = 0.27 and r = 0.21, P = 0.05, respectively) but not strong.EFV concentrations in hair were the strongest predictor of viral suppression and only weakly correlated with pharmacy refill adherence data in Nigeria. This study suggests that resource-limited settings may benefit from objective adherence metrics to monitor and support adherence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The chronic illness trajectory and its outcomes are well explained by the concept of illness identity; the extent to which ill individuals have integrated their diagnosed chronic illness into their identity or sense of self. The capacity to measure illness identity in people living with HIV (PLHIV) is still relatively unexplored. However, this is potentially useful to help us understand how outcomes for PLHIV could be improved and sustained. This paper aims to explore the cross-cultural adaptation of a Belgian developed Illness Identity Questionnaire (IIQ) and validate the instrument using a sample of South African adults living with HIV. We followed a phased scale adaptation and validation process which included an investigation of conceptual, item, semantic and operational equivalence and also examined the psychometric properties of the IIQ. The concept of illness identity with its four factors; engulfment, rejection, acceptance and enrichment in PLHIV, was found to be relevant within this context. Five items from the original IIQ were excluded from the adapted IIQ due to either semantic insufficiency and/or inadequate measurement equivalence. The mode of administration of the IIQ was changed to accommodate current study participants. The original four factor 25-item model did not fit current data, however, a better contextualized, four-factor, 20-item model was identified and found valid in the current setting. The results showed adequate statistical fit; χ 2 /d.f. = 1.516, RMSEA = 0.076, SRMR = 0.0893, and CFI = 0.909. Convergent and discriminant validity were also tenable. The cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the IIQ was successful, resulting in the availability of an instrument capable of measuring illness identity in PLHIV in a high HIV prevalence and resource-constrained setting.

Qualitative data were thematically analysed. Quantitative data were analysed using a SPSS 24 package to determine frequencies and differences in patients' responses (p < 0.05). The socio-ecological model framed the study.All 412 patients reported valuing the provision of free ARVs. Patients' positive experiences included: routine blood results mostly being available, most staff greeted patients, there were sufficient nurses, patients were satisfied with the time that they spent with doctors, clean clinics, and private and safe counselling areas. The negative experiences included: poor relationships with nurses, negative staff attitudes, disrespectful staff, information was lacking, inadequate counselling at times, varying and inflexible appointments, challenges with data capture and registration systems; varying ARV collection frequencies, routine health tests and processes per site, and the absence of patient committees and representatives.The results reflected positive and negative experiences which varied between the facilities, as processes and systems differed at each site. Innovative patient-centred processes and programmes could be implemented to ensure patients have mostly positive experiences. As part of continuous improvement, patients' experiences should be regularly explored to ensure that the ART programme meets their needs and expectations.",

We evaluated the impact of an intensive case management intervention on HIV treatment outcomes in Kalangala District, predominantly inhabited by fisher folk and female sex workers. Methods This quasi-experimental pre-post intervention evaluation included antiretroviral therapy naïve adults aged ≥ 18 years from six health facilities in the pre-intervention (Jan 1, 2017–December 31, 2017) and intervention phase (June 13, 2018–June 30, 2019). The primary outcomes were 6-month retention and viral suppression (VS) before and after implementation of the intervention involving facility and community case managers who supported participants through at least the first three months of ART. We used descriptive statistics to compared the characteristics, overall outcomes (i.e., retention, lost to follow up, died), and VS of participants by phase, and used mixed-effects logistic regression models to determine factors associated with 6-month retention in care. Marginal (averaging over facilities) probabilities of retention were computed from the final multivariable model. Results We enrolled 606 and 405 participants in the pre-intervention and intervention phases respectively. Approximately 75% of participants were aged 25–44 years, with similar age and gender distributions among phases. Approximately 46% of participants in the intervention were fisher folk and 9% were female sex workers. The adjusted probability of 6-month retention was higher in the intervention phase, 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77–0.90) versus pre-intervention phase, 0.73 (95% CI: 0.69–0.77, p = 0.03). The retention probability increased from 0.59 (0.49–0.68) to 0.73 (0.59–0.86), p = 0.03 among participants aged 18–24 years, and from 0.75 (0.71–0.78) to 0.85 (0.78–0.91), p = 0.03 among participants aged ≥ 25 years. VS (&lt; 1,000 copies/mL) was approximately 87% in both phases. Conclusions After implementation of the case management intervention, we observed significant improvement in 6-month retention in all age groups of a highly mobile population of predominantly fisher folk.",

We report a rare case of adrenal IMT in a patient with HIV infection, which is believed to be the first of its kind worldwide. Case presentation We present a rare case of a 44-year-old man with HIV infection who was diagnosed with adrenal IMT. The patient refused regular highly active antiretroviral therapy 13 years ago until he was admitted to hospital after an adrenal mass was found. The patient underwent successful computed-tomography-guided needle biopsy, and pathological analysis showed fibroblastic–myofibroblastic proliferation with inflammatory infiltration, which confirmed a diagnosis of IMT. We failed to perform complete resection of the tumor because of its diffuse invasion. The patient was complicated with severe multiple pulmonary infections postoperatively because of immunodeficiency, which eventually caused his death 2 months later. Conclusion Differential diagnosis of IMT is difficult, and tumor biopsy is an essential means of diagnosis. Surgical resection is preferred for both adrenal and HIV-related IMTs. Conservative treatment should be considered when there are technical difficulties with complete resection, and most patients have achieved good outcomes. However, more cases and longer follow-up are warranted to confirm long-term outcomes of HIV-related IMT.",

Viral replication increased with Qc and decreased with high doses of Cq. The increase of replication caused by Qc was reversed by AZT. Neither Qc nor Cq significantly changed the antiviral activity of AZT.Cq does not potentiate the effect of AZT, but it is effective by itself at high doses. The rise of HIV replication by Qc could be deleterious in HIV endemic regions, where it is used as antimalarial. The mechanisms associated to this phenomenon must be identified.",

    "abstract": "Tubular dysfunction is common in HIV-infected people and detection of proteinuria is essential to identify this problem. In low-income countries, resources for detection of proteinuria using the Kidney Disease Improve Global Outcomes (KDIGO) gold standard urinary protein/creatinine ratio (uPCR) is rarely possible, and use of the protein reagent strip (PRS) could be an option in these places. The aims of this study were to establish the concordance between PRS and uPCR to detect tubular proteinuria in HIV-infected people, and to assess the sensitivity and specificity of PRS as a diagnostic method in this group. A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between the two techniques to detect protein in urine. Participants were enrolled for a period of 6 months. The measurements were performed in participants who were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or prior to the start of treatment. Proteinuria was defined as uPCR ≥ 150 mg/g, and/or ≥ trace on PRS. A phi coefficient was calculated to establish the degree of correlation. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of PRS compared with uPCR using standard methods. A total of 799 subjects were included. Of these, 737 (92%) were men. The mean age was 32.9 years (±10.1 years). Most (561, 70%) were on antiretroviral treatment. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated according to Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)-4 was 113.0 mL/min (±22.6). Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (10, 1.3%) and hypertension (17, 2.1%). The prevalence of proteinuria detected by PRS was 8.3% (n = 66) and by uPCR 10.6% (n = 85). The concordance assessed by phi correlation coefficient was 0.70, p < 0.001, with a sensitivity of 51.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41%–62%) and specificity 97% (95% CI 39%–97%). There is a high concordance between detection of proteinuria by PRS and uPCR. Therefore, in low-income countries PRS can be helpful for detecting tubular damage in people infected with HIV.",

    "abstract": "India has a large number of HIV infected patients being followed up at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centers. The patients are regularly offered CD4 count estimation for deciding their eligibility for ART initiation as well as for monitoring response to ART, making CD4 count estimation a very critical test. Hence, quality control of CD4 testing is utmost important for ultimate success of ART program. As the commercial controls are very expensive, internal quality control (IQC), at present, is being done by duplicate analysis method using previous day samples in most of the laboratories. Hence the study was undertaken to review performance of duplicate analysis method for monitoring daily IQC.Quality control (QC) data from 11 Indian laboratories using duplicate analysis and/or commercial controls for IQC of CD4 testing was collected for reviewing information on QC parameters such as precision, accuracy and trend monitoring. Precision was determined by r(2) values and mean % variation for duplicate analysis and coefficient of variation (% CV) for commercial controls. Accuracy was monitored by rate of QC failures for both the types of control and trend monitoring was done by plotting LJ charts for commercial controls and by plotting daily % variation for duplicate analysis.The laboratories using duplicate analysis for IQC showed good precision with mean % variation ranging from 0.5 to 7.2. There was good match between r(2) values and % CV of the laboratories performing both the types of QC methods. Rates of QC failures were 2.3 for duplicate analysis and 3 per laboratory-year for IMMUNO-TROL controls. Daily trend monitoring showed fluctuation of daily counts around mean in LJ charts and of percent variation around 0% in duplicate analysis method. Commercially available controls showed limitations such as altered specimen quality leading to difficulties in manual gating and issues with the establishment of laboratory range.Duplicate analysis can serve as a cheaper alternative to commercially available controls for IQC of CD4 testing especially when supplemented with other QC measures for controlling variations caused by reagent, equipment, staff and environment in addition to the successful participation in External Quality Assurance programme.",

Fifty-nine of these women had both viral resistance and human host genotypic results. Efavirenz resistance according to metabolizer genotype was; 47% in slow, 34% in extensive and 28% in intermediate metabolizers, but the difference was not statistically significant due to the small sample size. Conclusions There was no statistically significant difference in EFV resistance between EFV metabolizer genotypes in women who started antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and had high viremia in the postpartum period.

    "abstract": "Women who are newly diagnosed with HIV infection during pregnancy may not be ready to immediately initiate lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART; called Option B +) as is recommended. Lack of \"readiness\" drives early disengagement from care and undermines prevention of HIV transmission to infants. Several studies have shown high early attrition of women initiating ART in pregnancy. Although poor ART uptake and adherence have been attributed to various factors including stigma, disclosure issues and structural issues, there is no standard way of determining which pregnant woman will face challenges and therefore need additional support. We developed and validated a novel ART readiness tool in Lusaka, Zambia.The aim of this study was to develop and validate a tool that could be used to assess how ready a newly diagnosed pregnant woman living with HIV would be to initiate ART on the day of diagnosis. Using a mixed method design, we conducted this study in three public-setting health facilities in Lusaka, Zambia. Informed by qualitative research and literature review, we identified 27 candidate items. We assessed content validity using expert and target population judgment approaches. We administered the 27-item questionnaire to 454 newly diagnosed pregnant women living with HIV, who were enrolled into a randomized trial (trials number NCT02459678). We performed item reduction analysis and used Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.70 as threshold for reliability.A total of 454 pregnant women living with HIV enrolled in the study between March 2017 and December 2017; 452 had complete data for analysis. The correlation coefficient between the 27 items on the completed ART readiness scale ranged from 0.31 to 0.70 while item discrimination index ranged from -0.01 to 2.38. Sixteen items were selected for the final scale, representing three domains, which we classified as \"internalized and anticipated HIV stigma\", \"partner support\" and \"anticipated structural barriers\".We developed and validated a tool that could be used to assess readiness of newly diagnosed women living with HIV to initiate ART. This ART readiness tool could allow clinics to tailor limited resources to pregnant women living with HIV needing additional support to initiate and remain on ART.",

This study compared the effectiveness of PITC versus CITC in HIV case detection by the different departments of health facilities.This retrospective cross-sectional study used health facility-based HIV testing data collected from adults aged 18 years and above between June 2017 - July 2019 in the Shinyanga region, Tanzania. Chi-square and logistic regression analysis were used to assess determinants of yield (HIV positivity).A total of 24,802 HIV tests were performed of which 15,814 (63.8%) were by PITC and 8,987 (36.2%) by CITC. Overall HIV positivity was 5.7%, higher among CITC at 6.6% than PITC at 5.2%. TB and IPD departments had the highest HIV positivity 11.8% and 7.8% respectively. Factors associated with a positive test were testing at a department in the facility compared to CITC, first-time test, and being or having been married compared to being single.Success in identifying HIV + patients was highest among people visiting the clinic for HIV testing (CITC) and first-time testers. With PITC, HIV + patient detection differed between departments, suggesting divergent risk profiles of respective clients and/or divergent HIV alertness of staff. This underscores the importance of increased targeting for PITC to identify HIV + patients.",

However, data on renal function of PLWH are limited in China so far. In this study we assessed the prevalence of kidney disease in patients either on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or not respectively in a single center in China and explored the possible risk factors associated. Methods In the cross-sectional study, we recruited hospitalized adult PLWH. Demographic characteristics, clinical information and laboratory variables were collected. Kidney disease was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and/or isolated hematuria, proteinuria, microalbuminuria. We calculated the prevalence of kidney disease and used logistic regression to assess its associated risk factors. Results A total of 501 adult PLWH were enrolled, 446 (89.0%) males and 55 (11.0%) females. The median age was 39 (IQR 30–50) years old. The prevalence of kidney disease was 19.0%, 22 (4.4%) patients with eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 53 (10.6%) patients with hematuria, 11 (2.2%) patients with proteinuria, and 40 (8.0%) patients with microalbuminuria. 297 (59.3%) patients were receiving ART. The patients on ART had a higher prevalence of renal disease than those had not been administrated with ART (22.6% vs. 13.7%, P = 0.013). On the multivariate logistic regression analysis among patients not on ART, lower haemoglobin (OR 0.994, 95%CI: 0.902–0.988, P = 0.013) were significantly associated with kidney disease. While among those on ART, older age (OR 1.034, 95%CI: 1.003–1.066, P = 0.032), lower haemoglobin (OR 0.968, 95%CI: 0.948–0.988, P = 0.002) and lower albumin (OR 0.912, 95%CI: 0.834–0.997, P = 0.044) were significantly associated with kidney disease. Conclusions The prevalence of kidney disease among hospitalized PLWH in China is high, especially in patients on ART. A larger scale study on Chinese outpatient PLWH should be conducted, so as to precisely assess prevalence of kidney disease in general Chinese PLWH.",

HIV-induced autoimmune diseases often do not respond well to systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Opportunistic infections may occur in patients with either acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or heavy immunosuppressive treatment, and can further complicate the clinical presentation. Case presentation A patient presenting with immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (IgAV) with treatment-refractory purpuric skin rash and suspect intestinal vasculitis was discovered to have AIDS. HIV was the trigger of IgAV, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis mimicked intestinal vasculitis. Antiretroviral treatment improved both CMV colitis and the control of the autoimmune disease. Conclusions An autoimmune disease relapsing despite adequate immunosuppressive treatment and/or the presence of recurrent severe opportunistic infections may be clues to an underlying HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a decline in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related mortality, but comorbidities, including organ dysfunction, are increasingly the focus of care. Heart transplant (HT) is a very effective therapeutic strategy for end-stage heart failure (HF); however, clinicians may be hesitant due to concerns of complex drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between ART and HT immunosuppressive regimens and the potential impact of ART on long-term HT outcomes. In this report, we describe long-term (76-month) follow-up of a patient with HIV-positive status who underwent orthotopic HT with special emphasis on complex drug interactions.A 58-year-old man with HIV-1 developed ischemic cardiomyopathy, progressed to end-stage HF and underwent orthotopic HT. To avoid DDIs with planned immunosuppressive therapies, the ART regimen was modified to consist of lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, rilpivirine, and raltegravir. Following HT, the patient's immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. He has had normal cardiac function and no opportunistic infections and was subsequently switched to tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and bictegravir in combination for convenience. Serial HIV-1 RNA blood levels were constantly below the limit of quantification, and his CD4 count remained above 200 cells/mm3 (30-35%). Several DDIs were identified and addressed; however, his long-term post-HT complications included one episode of asymptomatic acute cellular rejection, adenocarcinoma of the prostate, basal cell carcinoma, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and peripheral neuropathy.The clinical outcome of this case supports the conclusion of previously published reports, summarized here within, demonstrating that HIV-1 positive status should not preclude HT in carefully selected individuals. Both addressing potential DDIs prior to HT and long-term monitoring for routine post-transplant complications and secondary and incidental malignancies are imperative.",

In this study, we aimed to compare the anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of HIV-infected and uninfected adult Ugandans with new-onset type 2 diabetes to evaluate the influence of HIV infection on specific surrogate markers of adiposity, insulin resistance, and pancreatic beta-cell function. Methods We consecutively recruited 500 HIV-infected and uninfected adult Ugandans with new-onset type 2 diabetes (diagnosed in &lt; 3 months) from seven tertiary hospitals over a 20-month period and compared their anthropometric and metabolic characteristics to identify any significant differences. Results Of the 500 participants with new-onset type 2 diabetes, 59 (11.8%) had a self-reported history of HIV infection. Compared with HIV-uninfected participants with type 2 diabetes, participants with HIV infection and type 2 diabetes had a lower median (IQR) hip circumference (97.8 [91.0-106.0] cm vs. 104.0 [96.0-112.0], p = 0.002) and visceral fat level (8 [6–11] vs. 10 [7–12], p &lt; 0.001) assessed using bioimpedance analysis. No statistically significant difference was noted with the markers of pancreatic beta-cell function (fasting, 30-minute, and 120-minute C-peptide concentrations, oral insulinogenic index, and homeostatic model assessment 2-beta cell function) and insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment 2-insulin resistance) between both groups. Conclusion In our study population, HIV infection was not associated with increased adiposity, pancreatic beta-cell function, and insulin resistance. Large prospective studies are needed to investigate the effect of HIV on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in adult Ugandans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Key populations (KPs) are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection and efforts to prevent HIV infections among KPs have been less successful, largely due to existing laws and legislation that classify the groups as illegal. Understanding the HIV infection pathway and the burden of HIV infection among Female Sex Workers (FSWs), Transgender people (TG), Men who have sex with Men (MSM), People who Inject Drugs (PWID), and Prison Inmates (PIs) is critical to combatting the HIV epidemic globally. This study aims to estimate HIV prevalence and model the risk factors of HIV positivity rate among the aforementioned KPs in Sierra Leone. This study used Time Location Sampling, Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS), and Conventional cluster Sampling designs to generate a representative sample of FSWs, MSM, TG, PI, and PWID. HIV prevalence and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals among each KP were estimated by adjusting for sampling weight using the logit-transformed confidence intervals. To determine correlates of HIV test positivity among KPs, a multivariable modified Poisson regression model that adjusts for RDS survey weights was used and sensitivity analysis was conducted using a multivariable logistic regression model with cluster robust standard errors. The prevalence of HIV among FSWs in the six regional headquarter towns was estimated to be 11.8% (95% CI: 7.9–17.1); MSM was 3.4% [95% CI: 1.9–5.8]; TGs was 4.2% (95% CI: 2.9–6.1); PWIDs was 4.2% (95% CI: 2.7–6.4) and PI was 3.7% (95% CI: 1.4–9.6). The correlates of HIV test positivity among KPs and PIs include HIV-related knowledge, marital status, district, income, age and sex of KP, level of education, alcohol intake, injecting drugs, and use of lubricants. HIV prevalence is relatively high among FSWs, MSMs, PWID, and TGs as compared to the previous estimate of the general population. There is a need to scale up and strengthen evidence-based HIV prevention interventions such Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis and needle and syringe exchange programmes targeting KPs, including prison inmates. Government must scale up both non-clinical and clinical routine HIV and STI testing and counseling services at the correctional center and drop-in centers for KPs screening/testing, and ensure that services are responsive to the needs of KP.",

The drivers of health outcomes, on the other hand, are the factors that influence the likelihood of experiencing positive or negative health outcomes. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) continues to be a significant global public health challenge, with an estimated 38 million people living with the aim of this study was therefore to develop and empirically test a conceptual research model using SEM, aimed at explaining the magnitude of various factors influencing HIV and other health outcomes among patients attending Adherence Clubs.This was a cross sectional survey study design conducted in 16 health facilities in the City of Ekurhuleni in Gauteng Province, South Africa. A total of 730 adherence club patients were systematically sampled to participate in a closed ended questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The proposed model was tested using structural equation modelling (AMOS software: ADC, Chicago, IL, USA).A total of 730 adherence club members participated in the study. Of these, 425 (58.2%) were female and 305 (41.8%) were male. The overall results indicated a good reliability of all the scale involved in this study as Cronbach alphas ranged from 0.706 to 0.874, and composite reliability from 0.735 to 0.874. The structural model showed that the constructs health seeking behavior (β = 0.267, p = 0.000), health care services (β = 0.416, p = 0.000), stigma and discrimination (β = 0.135, p = 0.022) significantly predicted health outcomes and explained 45% of its variance. The construct healthcare service was the highest predictor of health outcomes among patients in adherence clubs.Patient health seeking behaviour, healthcare services, stigma and discrimination were associated with perceived health outcomes. Since adherence clubs have been found to have a significant impact in improving patient outcomes and quality of life, there is a need to ensure replication of this model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) experience a high prevalence of psychosocial health problems, such as harmful substance use and depression, as well as being disproportionately affected by HIV. HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) may provide psychosocial benefits beyond its intended purpose of reducing HIV infection. We explore the psychosocial impact of oral PrEP use on gay men in England using qualitative data from the PROUD study. From February 2014 to January 2016, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 gay men and one trans woman. Participants were purposively recruited based on trial arm allocation, adherence, and sexual risk behaviours. By removing HIV risk from sex, PrEP improves users’ wellbeing by reducing HIV-related anxiety and internalised stigma and increasing HIV prevention self-efficacy, sexual pleasure, and intimacy. In turn, these psychological changes may influence behaviour in the form of greater sexual freedom, reduced harmful drug use, and more protective sexual health behaviours. However, PrEP may create internal conflict for some gay men, due to its disruption of social norms around condom use and its perceived influence on their sexual behaviour leading to reduced condom self-efficacy. These findings provide a baseline of PrEP’s psychosocial impact amongst some of the first PrEP users in England and supports calls to consider the psychosocial impact of PrEP in prescribing guidelines.",

Our aim was to review and identify any new emerging priorities from the perspectives of people living with HIV, clinicians, researchers, and representatives from community organizations. Methods We conducted a multi-stakeholder international consultation with people living with HIV, researchers, clinicians and representatives of community-based organizations. Stakeholders convened for a one-day Forum in Manchester, United Kingdom (UK) to discuss research priorities via a web-based questionnaire and facilitated discussions. We analyzed data using conventional content analytical techniques and mapped emerging priorities onto the foundational framework. Results Thirty-five stakeholders from the UK(n = 29), Canada(n = 5) and Ireland(n = 1) attended the Forum, representing persons living with HIV or representatives from community-based organizations(n = 12;34%), researchers or academics(n = 10;28%), service providers(n = 6;17%), clinicians(n = 4;11%); and trainees(n = 4;11%). Five priorities mapped onto the Framework of Research Priorities across three content areas: A–Episodic Health and Disability Aging with HIV (disability, frailty, social participation), B-Rehabilitation Interventions for Healthy Aging across the Lifespan (role, implementation and impact of digital and web-based rehabilitation interventions) and C–Outcome Measurement in HIV and Aging (digital and web-based rehabilitation health technology to measure physical activity). Stakeholders indicated methodological considerations for implementing digital and web-based rehabilitation interventions into research and practice and the importance of knowledge transfer and exchange among the broader community. Conclusion Results highlight the sustained importance of the Framework of Research Priorities and provide further depth and areas of inquiry related to digital and web-based rehabilitation interventions and technology aging with HIV.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In spite of the global decreasing mortality associated with HIV, adolescents living with HIV (ADLHIV) in sub-Saharan Africa still experience about 50% mortality rate. We sought to evaluate survival rates and determinants of mortality amongst ADLHIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in urban and rural settings. Methods A multi-centered, 10-year retrospective, cohort-study including ADLHIV on ART ≥ 6 months in the urban and rural settings of the Centre Region of Cameroon. Socio-demographic, clinical, biological, and therapeutic data were collected from files of ADLHIV. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate survival probability after ART initiation; the log rank test used to compare survival curves between groups of variables; and the Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the determinants of mortality. Results A total of 403 adolescents’ records were retained; 340 (84%) were from the urban and 63 (16%) from the rural settings. The female to male ratio was 7:5; mean age (Standard deviation) was 14.1 (2.6) years; at baseline, 64.4% were at WHO clinical stages I/II, 34.9% had ≥ 500 CD4 cells/mm 3 , 91.1% were anemic, and the median [Inter Quartile Range] duration on ART was5.3 [0.5–16] years. The survival rate at 1, 5 and 10 years on ART was respectively 97.0%, 55.9% and 8.7%; with mean survival time of 5.8 years (95% CI 5.5–6.1). In bivariate analysis, living in the rural setting, non-disclosed HIV status, baseline CD4 count &lt; 500 cells/mm 3 , not being exposed to nevirapine prophylaxis at birth and being horizontally infected were found to be the determinants of higher mortality with poor retention in care slightly associated with mortality. In multivariate analysis, living in rural settings, poor retention in care and anemia were independent predictors of mortality (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Although ADLHIV have good survival rate on ART after 1 year, we observe poor survival rates after 5 years and especially 10 years of treatment experience. Mitigating measures against poor survival should target those living in rural settings, anemic at baseline, or experiencing poor retention in care.",

    "abstract": "Don't let the title fool you, this book gives a wide view of the state of the field in HIV treatment world-wide and includes some enticing discussions of potential targets and strategies on the horizon. Given its wide range of topics and its focus on more than just small molecule inhibitors of HIV, the title seems almost too restrictive. The book is divided into 4 areas: Issues in Clinical Management, Issues Related to Drug Resistance, Implementation in Developing Countries, and New Antiviral Targets. As such, it could be a good source of information for investigators new to the field or those needing a quick source of information in areas tangential to their main focus. As is the case with many textbooks that attempt to describe rapidly moving fields, many of the areas covered in the book contain newer information, and readers are advised to investigate more recent publications in areas they may find of interest.\r\n\r\nWith its emphasis on drug resistance, toxicity, and complex dosing strategies, the section on clinical management sets the stage for the remainder of the book by making the case for the need for additional drugs and other anti-viral strategies. A chapter on immune-based therapies was also included in this section, focusing on clinical trial results that involved the use of various cytokines to affect immune and viral parameters. More attention here and in the last section could have been paid to different delivery systems as well as to strategies that target the innate immune system. The third chapter in this section, on the use of treatment interruption strategies to manage HIV infection gave a complicated picture of the relevance of this strategy in the HIV treatment armamentarium. More recent studies of this approach, such as the recently released interim results of the SMART study, only serve to confirm that risks associated with treatment interruption need to be considered in the design of any trial that incorporates this strategy.\r\n\r\nThe section on drug resistance was comprehensive to this unpracticed eye. The extensive discussions on resistance mutations in chapter 4 were reiterated to a large extent in the following chapter. Here editorial assistance would have been of value in paring down this information and omitting redundancies. I found the section in chapter 4 on lethal mutagenesis as a potential therapeutic strategy to be particularly interesting and recent additions to the literature point to KP-1212 as a mutagenic nucleoside with favorable activity in vitro. Conflicting accounts of possible mitochondrial toxicity point to the need for closer examination of this issue.\r\n\r\nChapters 6 and 7 gave informative overviews of the difficulties inherent in implementing HIV treatment in developing countries. The chapter on prevention of mother-to-child transmission was particularly enlightening.\r\n\r\nThe final section on new antiviral targets includes a comprehensive overview of entry inhibitors, and a discussion of inhibitors of host factors. I found the latter discussion to have been confusingly written in passages, missing in certain critical details (what were the effects of NAC on viral load, a critical parameter in the testing of any drug with potential anti-viral activities) and in need of editorial assistance. But it left the reader with the correct impression of the relative lack of good, non-toxic inhibitors of host factors. This section omits reference to recently released data on promising phase I studies on the maturation inhibitor PA-457, the first of its class to enter clinical trials. The chapter on RNAi is a nice summary of the state of the art in this rapidly emerging field. As was pointed out by the authors, given the specificity of these molecules and the inherent difficulties in delivering them to the cells of interest, it is unclear whether this strategy will have an impact as a therapy on a virus as heterogeneous and rapidly changing as HIV. What was quite clear was the value of this approach as a basic research tool to examine the role of the factor of interest. The final chapter, on clearance of the latent reservoir, pointed out the difficulties inherent in deleting this long-lived reservoir of infected cells. Given that these cells do not transcribe or express viral proteins in a way that is accessible to current retroviral inhibitors or immune-based strategies, the challenges are indeed great but must be met if HIV is ever to be eradicated from the infected individual. Promising but preliminary results of a recent clinical trial of the DNA remodeling drug valproic acid were not discussed.\r\n\r\nIn sum, this book gives a balanced account of issues related to the clinical management of HIV in both developed and developing countries. Additional glimpses are provided of new developments of possible relevance to HIV treatment. These offer hope that the pipeline of new drugs and therapies will continue to expand to meet the growing need imposed by the development of resistance and toxicities associated with current therapies.",

    "abstract": "This Editorial is to commemorate “World AIDS Day” by increasing the awareness of AIDS, its treatment and prevention strategies.\r\n\r\nEducation is the single most crucial factor that can eradicate AIDS.\r\n\r\nOn the World AIDS Day, let us commit ourselves to learning and educating the world the scourge of AIDS.\r\n\r\nWhat is World AIDS Day? (http://www.worldaidsday.org/about-world-aids-day.php)\r\n\r\nWorld AIDS Day is held on 1 December each year and is an opportunity for people worldwide to unite in the fight against HIV, show their support for people living with HIV, and to commemorate people who have died. World AIDS Day was the first ever global health day and the first one was held in 1988.\r\n\r\nBetween 2011-2015, World AIDS Days will have the theme of “Getting to Zero: Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS related deaths”. The World AIDS Campaign focuses on “Zero AIDS related deaths” signifies a push towards greater access to treatment for all; a call for governments and pharmaceutical companies to act now. It is a call to honor promises like the Abuja declaration and for African governments to at least hit targets for domestic spending on health and HIV. (http://www.who.int/campaigns/aids-day/2013/en/)\r\n\r\nFurther Reading: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_AIDS_Day\r\n\r\nAs a tribute on the World AIDS Day AIDS Research and Therapy is publishing five high profile review articles to show our commitment in educating the world of the leading therapeutics and prevention efforts conducted by the dedicated research community. The articles span from Molecular Biology (Wilusz) to Humanities (Ramjee and Daniels) strategies. The goal has been to increase the awareness of therapeutics and suffering of the AIDS afflicted communities in post-HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) era. Specifically:\r\n\r\nDr. Wilusz presents persuasive arguments for novel potential therapeutics strategies that take into account the unique post-transcriptional events in HIV replication. For example, involvement of HIV TAT protein on highly structured 5’ end of HIV mRNAs and active repression of a promoter proximal signal for HIV polyadenylation.\r\n\r\nHsu et al. review serious non-AIDS events (SNAEs) such as malignancies, cardiovascular, renal and hepatic, neurological and bone disorders causing morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Since SNAEs are multifactorial, the authors have suggested several novel strategies and interventions to reduce the burden of these disorders.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the burden of metabolic complications (MC) in HAART treated individuals is high (de Paula et al.). The authors focus on the underlying mechanisms of MC highlighting pathophysiological and epidemiological aspects during HIV infection and during HAART treatment. Management of MC in HIV population is imperative.\r\n\r\nThe article by Achhra and Boyds reviews the clinical trials related to sparing antiretroviral treatment of the major class of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). The authors described the regimens currently used in NRTI-sparing regimen, their advantages and disadvantages, and the majority of clinical trials related to them.\r\n\r\nFinally, but most importantly, sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of HIV infections accounting for almost two-thirds of world’s HIV infections (Ramjee and Daniels). The worst affected are younger women who have a larger prevalence of infection. Prevention strategies are crucial that take into consideration the socioeconomic and cultural aspects of women at large.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that these articles, on World AIDS Day, will increase the awareness of the AIDS burden and the strategies to combat and prevent it. Let the entire world learn the implications of AIDS so that it can be eliminated in a humanitarian way.\r\n\r\nKailash Gupta, Ph.D.\r\n\r\nEditor-in-Chief\r\n\r\nAIDS Research and Therapy",

    "abstract": "Atazanavir (ATV) is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV infection. It is useful in patients on methadone replacement therapy as its once daily dosing facilitates co-administration with methadone and, unlike the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, efavirenz, it does not accelerate the metabolism of methadone via induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes [1]. ATV is associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in 6-40% of patients, overt jaundice in 7-8% and discontinuation in up to 2% [2,3]. The pathophysiology of ATV-hyperbilirubinaemia is analogous to Gilbert’s syndrome; ATV competitively inhibits UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT) enzymes leading to reduced glucuronidation of bilirubin and increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin [4,5]. Patients with the UGT1A1*28 genotype are particularly, but not exclusively, vulnerable [6,7]. Our study aimed to determine the clinical predictors of ATV-associated hyperbilirubinaemia in our patient population.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to study the virological outcomes associated with two different types of treatment interruption strategies in patients with allergic reactions to nevirapine (NVP). We compared the virological outcomes of (1) HIV-1-infected patients who discontinued an initial NVP-based regimen because of cutaneous allergic reactions to NVP; different types of interruption strategies were used, and second-line regimen was based on efavirenz (EFV); and (2) HIV-1-infected patients who began an EFV-based regimen as a first-line therapy (controls). This retrospective cohort included patients who began an EFV-based regimen, between January 2002 and December 2008, as either an initial regimen or as a subsequent regimen after resolving a cutaneous allergic reaction against an initial NVP-based regimen. The study ended in March 2010. The primary outcome was virological failure, which was defined as either (a) two consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA levels >400 copies/mL or (b) a plasma HIV-1 RNA level >1,000 copies/mL plus any genotypic resistance mutation. A total of 559 patients were stratified into three groups: (a) Simultaneous Interruption, in which the subjects simultaneously discontinued all the drugs in an NVP-based regimen following an allergic reaction (n=161); (b) Staggered Interruption, in which the subjects discontinued NVP treatment while continuing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone therapy for a median of 7 days (n=82); and (c) Control, in which the subjects were naïve to antiretroviral therapy (n=316). The overall median follow-up time was 43 months. Incidence of virological failure in Simultaneous Interruption was 12.9 cases per 1,000 person-years, which trended toward being higher than the incidences in Staggered Interruption (5.4) and Control (6.6). However, differences were not statistically significant. Among the patients who had an acute allergic reaction to first-line NVP-based therapy and later began an EFV-based regimen, virological outcomes resulting from a staggered interruption of treatment (with a continuation of NRTI backbone therapy for 7 days after discontinuing NVP) did not differ from those of the patients who began an EFV-based regimen as their initial therapy (Control). However, the virological failure of Simultaneous Interruption was possibly higher than those of Control and Staggered Interruption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug resistance testing before initiation of, or during, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not routinely performed in resource-limited settings. High levels of viral resistance circulating within the population will have impact on treatment programs by increasing the chances of transmission of resistant strains and treatment failure. Here, we investigate Drug Resistance Mutations (DRMs) from blood samples obtained at regular intervals from patients on ART (Baseline-22 months) in Karonga District, Malawi. One hundred and forty nine reverse transcriptase (RT) consensus sequences were obtained via nested PCR and automated sequencing from blood samples collected at three-month intervals from 75 HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals in the ART programme. Results Fifteen individuals showed DRMs, and in ten individuals DRMs were seen from baseline samples (reported to be ART naïve). Three individuals in whom no DRMs were observed at baseline showed the emergence of DRMs during ART exposure. Four individuals who did show DRMs at baseline showed additional DRMs at subsequent time points, while two individuals showed evidence of DRMs at baseline and either no DRMs, or different DRMs, at later timepoints. Three individuals had immune failure but none appeared to be failing clinically. Conclusion Despite the presence of DRMs to drugs included in the current regimen in some individuals, and immune failure in three, no signs of clinical failure were seen during this study. This cohort will continue to be monitored as part of the Karonga Prevention Study so that the long-term impact of these mutations can be assessed. Documenting proviral population is also important in monitoring the emergence of drug resistance as selective pressure provided by ART compromises the current plasma population, archived viruses can re-emerge",

    "abstract": "WR1065 is the free-thiol metabolite of the cytoprotective aminothiol amifostine, which is used clinically at very high doses to protect patients against toxicity induced by radiation and chemotherapy. In an earlier study we briefly reported that the aminothiol WR1065 also inhibits HIV-1 replication in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human T-cell blasts (TCBs) infected in culture for 2 hr before WR1065 exposure. In this study we expanded the original observations to define the dose-response curve for that inhibition, and address the question of additive effects for the combination of WR1065 plus Zidovudine (AZT). Here we also explored the effect of WR1065 on SIV by examining TCBs taken from macaques with well-established infections several months with SIV.TCBs from healthy human donors were infected for 2 hr with HIV-1, and viral replication (p24) was measured after 72 hr of incubation with or without WR1065, AZT, or both drugs. HIV-1 replication, in HIV-1-infected human TCBs, was inhibited by 50% at 13 microM WR1065, a dose at which 80% of the cells were viable. Cell cycle parameters were the same or equivalent at 0, 9.5 and 18.7 microM WR1065, showing no drug-related toxicity. Combination of AZT with WR1065 showed that AZT retained antiretroviral potency in the presence of WR1065. Cultured CD8+ T cell-depleted PHA-stimulated TCBs from Macaca mulatta monkeys chronically infected with SIV were incubated 17 days with WR1065, and viral replication (p27) and cell viability were determined. Complete inhibition (100%) of SIV replication (p27) was observed when TCBs from 3 monkeys were incubated for 17 days with 18.7 microM WR1065. A lower dose, 9.5 microM WR1065, completely inhibited SIV replication in 2 of the 3 monkeys, but cells from the third macaque, with the highest viral titer, only responded at the high WR1065 dose.The study demonstrates that WR1065 and the parent drug amifostine, the FDA-approved drug Ethyol, have antiretroviral activity. WR1065 was active against both an acute infection of HIV-1 and a chronic infection of SIV. The data suggest that the non-toxic drug amifostine may be a useful antiretroviral agent given either alone or in combination with other drugs as adjuvant therapy.",

Five-year retrospective cohort analysis of persons living with HIV (PLWH) treated for HCV. The HCV symptom-inventory (HCV-SI) was administered before, during, and after HCV treatment. Discriminant validity was assessed, separately, in mixed model linear regression of HCV-SI T-scores on treatment regimens (pegylated-interferon and ribavirin; pegylated-interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir; and interferon-free antivirals); and side effect-related premature treatment discontinuation (SE-DC). From the 103 patients who completed the HCV-SI, 7% were female, 26% non-white, 32% cirrhotics and 91% had undetectable HIV viral loads. Most had genotype 1 (83%) and were HCV treatment-naïve (78%). We treated 19% of patients with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin, 22% with pegylated-interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir and 59% received interferon-free antivirals. Overall, 77% achieved a sustained virologic response, and 6% discontinued HCV treatment due to side effects. In the treatment discrimination model, compared to the no treatment period, HCV-SI scores were significantly (p < 0.01) lower for interferon-free antivirals and higher for interferon-containing regimens. In the SE-DC model, the total HCV-SI, somatic and neuropsychiatric scores significantly predicted those patients who prematurely discontinued HCV treatment (P < 0.05). The HCV-SI effectively differentiated among treatment regimens known to vary by side effect profiles and between patients with and without treatment discontinuation due to side effects. The HCV-SI may have value as a patient-reported outcome instrument predicting the risk of HCV treatment discontinuation.",

Methods A single arm, open-label 48-week study was conducted of regimen simplification to E/C/F/TDF plus darunavir 800 mg daily from stable therapy including two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, and an integrase inhibitor. Participants had plasma HIV viral load consistently &lt; 200 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min, and no genotypic resistance to major components of the study regimen. Plasma viral load was measured at weeks 2 and 4, then every 4 weeks throughout the study. Safety laboratory assessments were conducted at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48. Antiretroviral drug concentrations were measured at baseline and once ≥ 2 weeks after the regimen change. Results Ten HIV-infected adults (8 male and 2 female; median age 50.5 years) were enrolled. All maintained virologic suppression on the new regimen for 48 weeks. One subject experienced a decrease in eGFR from 62 mL/min at baseline to 52 mL/min at week 12; study medications were continued and his eGFR remained stable (50–59 mL/min) thereafter. No subjects discontinued study medications for renal function changes or other adverse events. Darunavir trough concentration were lower on the new regimen than on darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg (n = 5; p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Despite low darunavir trough concentrations, treatment simplification to a two-pill, once-daily regimen of E/C/F/TDF plus darunavir was safe and effective for 48 weeks among 10 selected treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients.

Case presentation We report a 34-year old newly diagnosed HIV+ male patient presented with abnormal body movement (ABM) involving his right hemibody associated with loss of consciousness lasting few minutes of two weeks duration. The ABM occurred frequently (&gt; five times per week) and associated with frothy and excessive salivation. He reported headache following each spells. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral frontal T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity; post contrast study showed bilateral small ring enhancing lesion with perilesional oedema, the biggest one on the left hemisphere, with a 10 mm diameter; considering patient advanced immunosuppression and underlying HIV infection, the brain MRI findings were consistent with cerebral toxoplasmosis. Bipolar montage electroencephalography (EEG) study showed generalized background slowing, prominent in the left fronto-centeral region. Patient was managed with combination antiretroviral therapy, anti-toxoplasmosis medication, and anticonvulsant. On follow up, the frequency of seizure attack has significantly reduced. Conclusion Considering the high prevalence of HIV infection and associated seizure among people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, this case fairly highlights on the importance of utilizing advanced imaging techniques such as MRI and EEG in identifying the underlying causes of HIV-associated seizures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Maintaining people living with HIV (PLWHIV) in clinical care is a global priority. In the Metro Detroit area of Michigan, approximately 30% of PLWHIV are out of care. To re-engage lost-to-follow-up patients, Wayne Health Infectious Disease clinic launched an innovative Homecare program in 2017. In addition to home healthcare delivery, the program included links to community resources and quarterly community meetings. We aimed to evaluate Homecare’s impact on participants’ ability to stay engaged in HIV care and reach viral suppression. We included data from PLWHIV and their healthcare workers. Methods We used a convergent mixed-methods design, including first year program record review, semi-structured interviews, and a validated Likert scale questionnaire rating illness perception before and after Homecare. Interview data were collected from 15 PLWHIV in Metro Detroit and two healthcare workers responsible for program delivery. Semi-structured interviews focused on obstacles to clinic-based care, support networks, and illness perceptions. Interview data were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic approach. A fully coded analysis was used to create a conceptual framework of factors contributing to Homecare’s success. Means in eight categories of the Brief Illness Perception (IPQ) were compared using paired T-tests. Results In the first year of Homecare, 28 of 34 participants (82%) became virally suppressed at least once. The program offered (1) social support and stigma reduction through strong relationships with healthcare workers, (2) removal of physical and resource barriers such as transportation, and (3) positive changes in illness perceptions. PLWHIV worked towards functional coping strategies, including improvements in emotional regulation, acceptance of their diagnosis, and more positive perspectives of control. Brief-IPQ showed significant changes in six domains before and after Homecare. Conclusion Homecare offers an innovative system for successfully re-engaging and maintaining lost-to-follow-up PLWHIV in care. These findings have implications for HIV control efforts and could inform the development of future programs for difficult to reach populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Human genetic contribution to HIV progression remains inadequately explained. The type 1 interferon (IFN) pathway is important for host control of HIV and variation in type 1 IFN genes may contribute to disease progression. This study assessed the impact of variations at the gene and pathway level of type 1 IFN on HIV-1 viral load (VL). Methods Two cohorts of antiretroviral (ART) naïve participants living with HIV (PLWH) with either early ( START ) or advanced infection ( FIRST ) were analysed separately. Type 1 IFN genes (n = 17) and receptor subunits ( IFNAR1, IFNAR2 ) were examined for both cumulated type 1 IFN pathway analysis and individual gene analysis. SKAT-O was applied to detect associations between the genotype and HIV-1 study entry viral load (log10 transformed) as a proxy for set point VL; P-values were corrected using Bonferroni (P &lt; 0.0025). Results The analyses among those with early infection included 2429 individuals from five continents. The median study entry HIV VL was 14,623 (IQR 3460–45100) copies/mL. Across 673 SNPs within 19 type 1 IFN genes, no significant association with study entry VL was detected. Conversely, examining individual genes in START showed a borderline significant association between IFNW1 , and study entry VL (P = 0.0025). This significance remained after separate adjustments for age, CD4 + T-cell count, CD4 + /CD8 + T-cell ratio and recent infection. When controlling for population structure using linear mixed effects models (LME), in addition to principal components used in the main model, this was no longer significant (p = 0.0244). In subgroup analyses stratified by geographical region, the association between IFNW1 and study entry VL was only observed among African participants, although, the association was not significant when controlling for population structure using LME. Of the 17 SNPs within the IFNW1 region , only rs79876898 (A &gt; G) was associated with study entry VL (p = 0.0020, beta = 0.32; G associated with higher study entry VL than A) in single SNP association analyses. The findings were not reproduced in FIRST participants. Conclusion Across 19 type 1 IFN genes, only IFNW1 was associated with HIV-1 study entry VL in a cohort of ART-naïve individuals in early stages of their infection, however, this was no longer significant in sensitivity analyses that controlled for population structures using LME.",

Resolution of symptoms have occurred with switches to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens; however, little is known regarding the development of angiolipomas when switching from NNRTI- to modern, integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimens. We describe a patient who underwent switch therapy from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine/efavirenz (TDF/FTC/EFV) to tenofovir alafenamide/FTC/bictegravir (TAF/FTC/BIC) who later developed angiolipomas. Case Presentation A 55-year-old male had been on TDF/FTC/EFV for 8 years before switching to TAF/FTC/BIC. Nineteen months after antiretroviral switch, the patient presented with multiple lesions in the upper extremities and abdomen. Diagnostic biopsies revealed non-encapsulated angiolipomas and HHV-8 and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was ruled out. New lesions continued to appear 29 months after ART switch, after which now lesions appeared and prior lesions remained stable with no increase in size noted. No surgical intervention or change in antiretroviral therapy was needed. Conclusions Angiogenesis may have been suppressed with TDF/FTC/EFV treatment, however when switched to TAF/FTC/BIC, promoted the growth of angiolipomas. Clinicians should be aware of the impact of switching to modern ART therapies resulting in possible adipogenesis.",

This study, the first of its kind in Yemen, investigates the rate and determinants of switching from first-line to second-line ART among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Aden City, Yemen. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from PLWH who started first-line ART at Al-Wahda Hospital from 2007 to May 2022. PLWH in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs, those already on second-line ART at enrollment, and those with less than 3 months of follow-up were excluded. Cumulative incidence curves and multivariable proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with switching, considering death and loss to follow-up as competing risks. Analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS version 26. Results Out of 149 PLWH, 18 (12.1%) switched to second-line ART with a cumulative incidence rate of 1.8 per 100 person-years. Significant factors for switching included being older than 33 years (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.12–1.89), having WHO stage 3 disease (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.21–2.06), and being on a TDF-FTC-EFV-based first-line regimen (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.03–1.77). This switching rate is consistent with rates observed in other resource-limited settings, indicating it is neither exceptionally high nor low compared to similar contexts​. Conclusions The study highlights key factors associated with switching to second-line ART in Yemen, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and continuous monitoring to enhance treatment outcomes. These findings are consistent with regional data from other resource-limited settings.",

    "abstract": "The provision of professional counseling services for persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) is crucial in the prevention and treatment continuum of the disease. However, for counselors of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leading to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) to give their best, their motivations to become counselors and the challenges they face in their line of duty need to be contextually understood and addressed. We ascertained the roles, motivations, and experiences of HIV/AIDS counselors in the Volta Region of Ghana to inform HIV/AIDS counseling decision-making in the region and the country. A phenomenological study conducted among sixteen (16) HIV/AIDS counselors from five HIV/AIDS sentinel sites in the Volta region of Ghana, recruited through a purposive sampling approach and interviewed to ascertain their HIV/AIDS counseling-related experiences. The data were thematically analyzed using the Atlas. ti software, and sub-themes supported with verbatim quotes. Five motives for becoming an HIV/AIDS counselor were found. These include being randomly assigned to the unit, developing interest in the job, because of the status of a relative, witnessing bad attitudes of healthcare providers, and seeing HIV- clients lacking knowledge of the condition. The study found that these counselors performed six core roles: providing nutritional counseling, educating clients on HIV, treatment, and medication provision, conducting testing and comprehensive counseling of clients, providing social support to clients, and offering financial support to clients. The experiences these counselors had were boosting clients' health status, counseling clients back to a normal mental state, cooperation from clients, participants gaining knowledge on HIV through counseling, counseling clients to accept their status, and when a client delivered an HIV-negative baby. Their negative experiences included clients denying their HIV status, clients defaulting on their treatment, uncooperative clients, death of clients due to fear of breach of confidentiality, self-stigmatization among clients, and the myths some people hold towards HIV/AIDS. By organizing capacity-building training programs for HIV/AIDS counselors in the Volta region and addressing the negative experiences they encounter, they could be empowered to provide effective counseling, curative, and social services to people living with HIV in the region, leading to improved health outcomes.",

Without treatment, the infection can progress to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), with a high mortality potential. The objective of this study was to analyze the time trend of AIDS mortality in Brazil, macro-regions, federal units and their respective capitals, from 2012 to 2022. This is a time-series study of all AIDS deaths in Brazil from 2012 to 2022. The study included the annual number of deaths and the crude and standardized mortality rates. The Joinpoint regression model was used for the time analysis of the standardized rates. Annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) were calculated. A 95% confidence interval (CI) and a 5% significance level were used. During the period analyzed, 128,678 AIDS deaths were recorded in Brazil, with a crude mortality rate of 6.3/100,000 and a standardized mortality rate of 5.3/100,000. From 2012 to 2020, three regions showed a declining trend in AIDS mortality: Central-West (AAPC − 2.3%; 95%CI -4.3 to -0.21; p = 0.03), Southeast (AAPC − 5.6%; 95%CI -6.8 to -4.0; p < 0.001), and South (AAPC − 4.4%; 95%CI -5.27 to -3.6; p < 0.001). There was also a downward trend in 10 states and 10 capitals. There was an increase in the number of deaths from 2020 onwards in the North, Northeast and Southeast regions compared to 2019. There was a downward trend in AIDS mortality from 2012 to 2020 and an upward trend from 2020 to 2022. The regional differences observed could reflect the social disparities that exist in Brazil.

    "abstract": "With access to and uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the United States can prevent new HIV infections. To end the HIV epidemic, health insurance plans must facilitate access to comprehensive preventive care benefits. Since plan benefit designs vary considerably by plan, it is difficult to systematically determine plans that facilitate and restrict preventive services for PrEP. We applied an unsupervised machine learning method to cluster 17,061 Qualified Health Plans offered to individuals. We examined the clusters to draw conclusions about the types of benefits insurance companies tend to group together in plans. Then we analyzed the geographic distribution of those clusters across the United States to assess geographic inequities in access to HIV preventive care. Our method uncovered three cohesive clusters of plans. Plans in Cluster 1: the least restrictive cluster, facilitate access to preventive care using copays over coinsurance on almost all benefits; Cluster 2: the moderately restrictive cluster, plans cover HIV prevention benefits with copays but restrict access to general health benefits with coinsurance; and Cluster 3: the most restrictive cluster, plans cover almost all benefits using coinsurance. Overall, increased prior authorization requirements tend to accompany reductions in out-of-pocket costs. Examining the geographic plan distribution, states with at least one rating area where at least 75% of plans offered are in the most restrictive cluster included: Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming. Insurance plan design is complex. To address the ambitious call to end the HIV epidemic in this country, plans should also take into account both public health and health equity factors to create plan designs that ensure access to critical preventive services for people who need them most. Addressing the growing disparities in PrEP access along racial and ethnic lines should be a national priority, and federal and state insurance regulators as well as insurance plans themselves should be part of the conversation about how to ensure people who would benefit from PrEP can access it. Better state/federal regulation of plan design to ensure access is consistent, equitable, and based on clinical recommendations will reduce the variability across plan designs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Traditional complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM) are products and practices that differ from conventional allopathic medicine. There continues to be an increase in the use of these methods of treatment in developed and developing countries worldwide. This often owes to the perceived ability of these treatment methods to cure chronic medical conditions like HIV. However, TCAM use among PLHIV may be associated with reduced compliance with antiretroviral medications, resulting in poor viral load suppression and increased risk for opportunistic infections. The concomitant use of antiretroviral drugs and TCAM practices may be influenced by some sociodemographic and health-related factors. Objective To determine the prevalence of TCAM use and examine the sociodemographic and health-related factors associated with its use among PLHIV on antiretroviral medications at the Infectious Disease unit of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among attendants at an adult HIV clinic. 420 study participants were selected by systematic sampling. Data related to TCAM use, sociodemographic and health-related factors were collected using a standardized questionnaire and patient chart review. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the association between TCAM use, sociodemographic and health-related factors. Results Of the 420 study participants, majority were female (76.2%) and urban community dwellers (77.9%). 77.4% of participants had been diagnosed with HIV for $$\\:\\ge\\:$$ 5 years and had been on anti-retroviral medications for more than 5 years. The prevalence of TCAM use among PLHIV was 25.2%. No sociodemographic or HIV-related health factor was significantly associated with TCAM use in the study population. Conclusion TCAM use was high among PLHIV. No sociodemographic or health-related factor was found to be associated with TCAM use. Further studies employing a qualitative approach using key informant interviews and focused group discussions are needed to explore reasons for its use. Care providers and policy-makers should look beyond sociodemographic and health-related factors in addressing TCAM use among PLHIV.",

A total of 2188 patients with AIDS admitted for the first time between January 2016 and December 2021 were included. The RHR was categorized into tertiles. Disease progression was estimated using 60-day mortality rates. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the RHR with disease progression, and a two-piecewise Cox regression model was used to reveal the RHR effect at admission on 60-day mortality. We observed a U-shape relationship between RHR and 60-day mortality. For a above 90 bpm, the 60-day mortality rose rapidly with a multivariable adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.032 (95% confidence interval [CI 1.016–1.048, P < 0.001). Below the threshold, 60 days mortality decreased as the RHR increased to 90 bpm with a multivariate-adjusted OR of 0.943 (95% CI 0.904–0.984, P = 0.0065). This study identified a U-shape relationship between RHR and 60-day mortality in HIV/AIDS patients. Further research is needed to characterize the role of RHR in the timely prevention of mortality in HIV/AIDS patients.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has become an increasingly common cause of death among people living with HIV (PLHIV) receiving successful antiretroviral therapy (ART). In Chongqing, approximately half of the PLHIV were middle-aged or elderly, and their diets were mainly high in salt, spices and oil; however, there is still a lack of relevant research on the risk factors and whether the disease burden of ASCVD is greater in these areas. This study was to investigate the risk of ASCVD in middle-aged and elderly PLHIV receiving ART and analyze the factors influencing high risk. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Questionnaire surveys, physical examinations and laboratory examinations were used to collect information from PLHIV aged ≥ 45 years. Pooled cohort equations (PCEs) were used to calculate the 10-year ASCVD risk and analyze the influencing factors. The 10-year ASCVD risk score was used to define patients in the low-risk subgroup (< 7.5%) and high-risk subgroup (≥ 7.5%), and the risk factors were compared between the two groups. In total, 463 PLHIV (median age 55.0 years, male 68.5%) were included, and the median duration of ART was 45.0 (15.0, 70.3) months. Of the 463 PLHIV, 13 (2.8%) had a known history of ASCVD. In the present study, 153 PLHIV (33.0%) were classified into the high-risk group, and 310 PLHIV (67.0%) were classified into the low-risk group. Compared with the low-risk group, the high-risk group was more likely to be female, older age, live in urban areas, be unemployed, have poor sleep quality, have higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), have higher total cholesterol (TC), and have diabetes and hypertension; however, coffee consumption was associated with a low risk of ASCVD. In addition, there were no differences in HIV viral load, CD4 + T-cell count, or duration on ART, or ART regimes between the two groups. According to multiple logistic regression, older age [odds ratio (OR) = 62.469, 95% CI 27.456, 142.134], female sex [OR = 9.635, 95% CI 4.384, 21.179], higher LDL-c levels [OR = 1.018, 95% CI 1.000, 1.036], accompanied hypertension [OR = 8.642, 95% CI 3.373, 22.143] and diabetes [OR = 10.806, 95% CI 3.787, 30.834] were found to be independent risk factors for the 10-year risk of ASCVD. The overall 10-year ASCVD risk is great for middle-aged and elderly PLHIV in Chongqing, China. The risk factors for the 10-year risk of ASCVD were older age, female sex, elevated LDL-c level, and coexisting hypertension and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Many persons are unaware of HIV infection until they present in an advanced stage of the disease. Diagnosing HIV infection in its earliest stages reduces morbidity and mortality and contributes to improved public health. Increased testing for HIV is critical for prevention, and primary care providers play an essential role in early HIV screening. However, lack of knowledge and confidence are barriers to the adoption of screening practices. Continuing professional development (CPD) may enhance greater HIV testing uptake amongst primary care providers by improving awareness and comfort. This paper aims to report on the impact of a multimodal CPD initiative to increase HIV screening and test ordering across primary care settings in British Columbia, Canada. Methods The ‘HIV Testing Initiative in Family Practice’ was designed as a multimodal education strategy to encourage family physicians to adopt routine HIV testing in their practices. The initiative encompassed a variety of core and supplementary educational activities, including interactive in-person CPD workshops, practice resources, and patient education materials. An interrupted time series study was undertaken to evaluate the effect on HIV test ordering before and after workshop participation. Participants also completed post-workshop surveys to assess satisfaction. Results In total, 316 individuals participated in the core educational activities of the initiative. The number of HIV tests ordered increased significantly amongst participants following workshop participation ( p &lt; .001). HIV test ordering increased for both rural and urban providers with no significant difference ( p = .075) on the number of tests ordered between these groups. Participants were very satisfied with workshop participation, with an overall mean satisfaction rating of 4.78 (out of 5) and reported high satisfaction with the format (4.64 out of 5) and interactivity (4.76 out of 5) features across the workshops. Discussion The findings suggest that the introduction of a multimodal CPD intervention may have effected change in family physicians’ HIV testing practices. The HIV testing rates of physicians who had participated in CPD workshops increased significantly, and participant evaluation data indicated a greater understanding of the rationale for routine HIV testing, as well as an increase in comfort with recommending HIV tests to patients.",

Methods This cohort study included PWH enrolled in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) who were prescribed a standard 3-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen containing dolutegravir (DTG), bictegravir (BIC), cobicistat boosted elvitegravir (EVG), raltegravir (RAL), or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV) plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors between January 1, 2014, and March 31, 2020, and who were ≥50 years at regimen initiation. The association between regimen and virologic effectiveness or discontinuation was assessed using logistic regression models with inverse probability of treatment weights. Pairwise comparisons were made between DTG-based regimen and each of the other 3-drug regimens, stratified by ART experience. Results Among 15,702 PWH (across treatment groups, median age 58–62 years; 94–98% male; 5–11% Hispanic; 44–60% Black; 29–42% White), 5,800 received DTG-based regimens, 2,081 BIC-based regimens, 4,159 EVG-based regimens, 1,607 RAL-based regimens, and 2,055 received DRV-based regimens. Among ART-naïve PWH, there were no statistical differences in the odds of virologic suppression, and 6- and 12-month discontinuations were higher in those on DRV. Among ART-experienced PWH, compared to DTG, those on RAL and DRV were less likely to be suppressed at 6 months (RAL vs DTG: aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.51–0.81; DRV vs DTG: aOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.76) and those on EVG and DRV were less likely suppressed at 12 months (EVG vs DTG: aOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68–0.99; DRV vs DTG: aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52–0.80). Those on DRV were more likely to have virologic failure within 12 months (aOR 1.96, 95% CI 1.30–2.97). Six- and 12-month discontinuations were higher in those on RAL and DRV, but less likely for BIC-based regimens. Conclusions DTG-based regimens demonstrated higher levels of effectiveness and durability compared to DRV- or RAL-based regimens and had similar treatment responses as BIC- and EVG-based regimens among ART-experienced older PWH.",

Methods Treatment-experienced patients starting treatment with EVG/COB/TFV/FTC + DRV during the years 2014–2018 and with more than 24 weeks of follow-up were included. TFV could be administered either as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir alafenamide. We evaluated virological response, defined as viral load (VL) &lt; 50 copies/ml and &lt; 200 copies/ml at 24 and 48 weeks after starting this regimen, stratified by baseline VL (&lt; 50 or ≥ 50 copies/ml at the start of the regimen). Results We included 39 patients (12.8% women). At baseline, 10 (25.6%) patients had VL &lt; 50 copies/ml and 29 (74.4%) had ≥ 50 copies/ml. Among patients with baseline VL &lt; 50 copies/ml, 85.7% and 80.0% had VL &lt; 50 copies/ml at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively, and 100% had VL &lt; 200 copies/ml at 24 and 48 weeks.

During the first 48 weeks, no patients changed their treatment due to toxicity, and 4 patients (all with baseline VL ≥ 50 copies/ml) changed due to virological failure. Conclusions EVG/COB/TFV/FTC + DRV was well tolerated and effective in treatment-experienced patients with undetectable viral load as a simplification strategy, allowing once-daily, two-pill regimen with three antiretroviral drug classes. Effectiveness was low in patients with detectable viral loads.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Due to improved coverage and scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART), patients are increasingly transferring between ART-providing sites. Self-transfers may constitute a high proportion of patients considered lost to follow-up (LTFU), and if overlooked when reporting patients who have dropped out of HIV care, may result in an incorrect estimation of retention. We determined the prevalence of self-transfers, and successful tracing, and identified associated factors among people living with HIV (PLHIV) LTFU from care at public health facilities in Sheema District, Southwestern Uganda. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective medical records review during February and March 2022. We included records of all PLHIV who were LTFU from 2017 to 2021, and who were registered at government-owned ART clinics in Sheema District. LTFU was considered for those who were not taking ART refills for a period of ≥ 3 months. We abstracted demographic and clinical data from medical records at the selected clinics. Participants were traced via phone calls or in-person to ascertain the outcomes of LTFU. We performed multivariate modified Poisson regression to identify factors associated with self-transfer, and successful tracing. Results Overall, 740 patients were identified as LTFU from three ART-providing clinics; of these, 560 (76%) were self-transfers. The mean age was 30 (SD ± 10) years, and most (69%, n = 514) were female; the majority (87%, 641/740) were successfully traced. Age (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.13, 95% CI 1.01–1.25, P = 0.026 for those aged 18–30 years compared to &gt; 30 years), female sex (aPR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.11–1.25, P &lt; 0.001), and having WHO clinical stage 1–2 (aPR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.89–3.91, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with self-transfer. Presence of a phone contact in the patient’s file (aPR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.01–1.90, P = 0.026) was associated with successful tracing of the patients considered LTFU. Conclusion Self-transfers accounted for the majority of patients recorded as LTFU, highlighting the need to account for self-transfers among patients considered LTFU, to accurately estimate retention in care. ART-providing facilities should regularly update contact information for PLHIV to enable successful tracing, in the event that the patients are LTFU. This calls for a health-tracking system that easily identifies self-transfers across ART-providing clinics using unique patient identifiers.",

    "abstract": "There are more than 7,800 people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Victoria, Australia. Crucial in maximising the individual and population level benefits from antiretroviral therapy (ART) is understanding how to achieve patient retention in care and the factors that drive it. This study was an expansion of a 2015 assessment of HIV-care retention in Victoria, which sought out to determine whether the inclusion of a broader range of HIV-healthcare sites would yield more accurate estimates of retention in HIV-care. We aimed to improve our understanding of HIV-care retention in Victoria, Australia, identify people living with HIV (PLHIV) with unknown outcomes, and attempt to re-engage PLHIV in care.A network of 15 HIV-care sites was established in Victoria, Australia across diverse care settings which ranged from low-caseload rural sites to high-caseload metropolitan GP clinics and hospitals. Individuals who had an HIV viral load (VL) performed in both calendar years of 2016 and 2017 were classified as retained in care. Individuals with a VL test in 2016 but not in 2017 were considered to potentially have unknown outcomes as they may have been receiving care elsewhere, have disengaged from care or died. For this group, an intervention of cross-referencing partially de-identified data between healthcare sites, and contact tracing individuals who still had unknown outcomes was performed.For 5223 individuals considered to be retained in care across 15 healthcare sites in the study period, 49 had unconfirmed transfers of care to an alternative provider and 79 had unknown outcomes. After the intervention, the number of unconfirmed care transfers was reduced to 17 and unknown outcomes reduced to 51. These changes were largely attributed to people being reclassified as confirmed transfers of care. Retention in care estimates that did not include the patient outcome of confirmed transfer of care ranged from 76.2 to 95.8% and did not alter with the intervention. However, retention in care estimates which considered confirmed transfers and those that re-entered care at a new site as retained in care significantly increased across five of the sites with estimates ranging from 80.9 to 98.3% pre-intervention to 83.3-100% post-intervention. Individuals whose outcomes remained unknown post-intervention were more often men who have sex with men (MSM) when compared to other categories (person who injects drugs (PWID), combined PWID/MSM, men who identify as heterosexual or unknown) (74.5% vs. 53.5%, [p = 0.06]) and receiving ART at their last HIV-care visit (84.3% vs. 67.8% [p = 0.09]).This study confirmed high retention in HIV-care and low numbers of people disengaged from HIV-care in Victoria. This was demonstrated across a larger number of sites with varying models of care than a prior assessment in 2015. These data align with national and state targets aiming for 95% of PLHIV retained in HIV-care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Studies on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in children living with HIV (CLHIV) are limited due to the small population and low accession rate of ART. Methods All 0-14-year-old CLHIV admitted to the Ganzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 2006 to June 2023 were included retrospectively. The information of treatment regimens, disease progression, and laboratory tests of the patients under ART were used to explore the outcomes and impacts of long-term ART. The normality of all the data was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Results From 2006 to 2023, 18 CLHIV were reported in Ganzhou. Among them, 11 received ART and were followed up for 60.0 ± 48.4 months. After receiving ART, the median viral load of them decreased from 89,600 copies/ml to 22 copies/ml ( P = 0.007), the median CD4 + T cell count increased from 380.7 cells/µL to 661.9 cells/µL ( P = 0.028), and the median CD8 + T cell count decreased from 1065.8 cells/µL to 983.3 cells/µL ( P = 0.584). The laboratory test results regarding liver function, renal function, blood cell count, and glucolipid metabolism tended to be within normal reference ranges, and the mean height-for-age z-score and weight-for-age z-score increased. However, all the three CLHIV who received cotrimoxazole developed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, upper respiratory infection, skin lesions, bacterial pneumonia and/or thrush; the mean body-mass-index-for-age z-score decreased from 0.52 to -0.63. Conclusion For CLHIV, ART could effectively inhibit the replication of HIV and improve the immune function of patients. More studies that focus on ART in CLHIV are urgently needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV testing remains an important tool in identifying people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). An early diagnosis of HIV can lead to a prolonged life expectancy if treatment is initiated promptly. Indicator conditions can be the first sign of an HIV infection and should therefore be recognised and consequently a HIV test should be carried out. Testing should occur in all individuals as sexuality can be experienced by everyone, and stigma can lead to the exclusion of vulnerable groups, leading to a gap in diagnosis and treatment [1, 2]. Case presentation A 63-year-old man, who identifies as bisexual and has had an intellectual disability since birth, presented at our health care centre for HIV testing. A decade ago, the patient was diagnosed with Stage III Diffuse Large B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, an AIDS defining cancer. The patient presented at a Haematology and Oncology department 3 months prior, due to a weight loss of 10 kg over the past 5 months. Oral thrush, an HIV-indicator condition, had been diagnosed by the otolaryngologists shortly before. During this medical evaluation, pancytopenia was identified. Despite the presence of indicator conditions, the patient was never tested for HIV in the past. Staff members from the care facility for intellectually disabled suggested conducting a HIV test in our clinic through the public health department, where HIV positivity was revealed. The AIDS-defining diagnosis, along with a CD4 + cell count of 41/µl, suggests a prolonged period of HIV positivity. Conclusion Due to the presence of existing indicator conditions, an earlier HIV diagnosis was possible. We contend that most of the recent illnesses could have been prevented if earlier testing had been carried out. Therefore, patients presenting with AIDS indicator conditions, including those with mental disabilities, should be given the opportunity to be tested for HIV. HIV/AIDS trainings should be made available to health care professionals as well as to personnel interacting with vulnerable groups.",

Point of Care (PoC) HEID has shown to reduce test turnaround times, allow for task shifting and has the potential to reduce infant mortality. We aimed at assessing the feasibility of nurse based PoC-HEID in five facilities of Mbeya region. Methods We analysed data from healthcare workers at five obstetric health facilities that participated in the BABY study which enrolled mothers living with HIV and their HIV exposed infants who were followed up until 6 weeks post-delivery. Nurses and laboratory personnel were trained and performed HEID procedures using the Xpert HIV-1 Qual PoC systems. Involved personnel were interviewed on feasibility, knowledge and competency of procedures and overall impression of the use of HIV-1 Qual PoC system in clinical settings. Results A total of 28 health care workers (HCWs) who participated in the study between 2014 and 2016 were interviewed, 23 being nurses, 1 clinical officer, 1 lab scientist and 3 lab technicians The median age was 39.5 years. Majority of the nurses (22/24) and all lab staff were confident using Gene Xpert PoC test after being trained. None of them rated Gene Xpert handling as too complicated despite minor challenges. Five HCWs (5/24) reported power cut as the most often occurring problem. As an overall impression, all interviewees agreed on PoC HEID to be used in clinical settings however, about half of them (11/24) indicated that the PoC-HEID procedures add a burden onto their routine workload. Conclusion Overall, health care workers in our study demonstrated very good perceptions and experiences of using PoC HEID. Efforts should be invested on quality training, targeted task distribution at the clinics, continual supportive supervision and power back up mechanisms to make the wide-scale adoption of nurse based PoC HEID testing a possibility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Despite the widespread use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, scant information on HIV drug resistance mutations (DRMs) has been gathered over the past decade. This review aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of pre-exposure prophylaxis and its two-way impact on DRM. Methods We systematically reviewed studies on DRM in pre-exposure prophylaxis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Cochrane, and SAGE databases were searched for English-language primary studies published between January 2001 and December 2023. The initial search was conducted on 9 August 2021 and was updated through 31 December 2023 to ensure the inclusion of the most recent findings. The registration number for this protocol review was CRD42022356061. Results A total of 26,367 participants and 562 seroconversion cases across 12 studies were included in this review. The pooled prevalence estimate for all mutations was 6.47% (95% Confidence Interval-CI 3.65–9.93), while Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/Emtricitabine-associated drug resistance mutation prevalence was 1.52% (95% CI 0.23–3.60) in the pre-exposure prophylaxis arm after enrolment. A subgroup analysis, based on the study population, showed the prevalence in the heterosexual and men who have sex with men (MSM) groups was 5.53% (95% CI 2.55–9.40) and 7.47% (95% CI 3.80–12.11), respectively. Notably, there was no significant difference in the incidence of DRM between the pre-exposure prophylaxis and placebo groups (log-OR = 0.99, 95% CI −0.20 to 2.18, I2 = 0%; p = 0.10). Discussion Given the constrained prevalence of DRM, the World Health Organization (WHO) advocates the extensive adoption of pre-exposure prophylaxis. Our study demonstrated no increased risk of DRM with pre-exposure prophylaxis (p &gt; 0.05), which is consistent with these settings. These findings align with the previous meta-analysis, which reported a 3.14-fold higher risk in the pre-exposure prophylaxis group than the placebo group, although the observed difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.21). Conclusions Despite the low prevalence of DRM, pre-exposure prophylaxis did not significantly increase the risk of DRM compared to placebo. However, long-term observation is required to determine further disadvantages of extensive pre-exposure prophylaxis use. PROSPERO Number: CRD42022356061.",

    "abstract": "Anemia is common and associated with increased morbidity among people with HIV (PWH). Classification of anemia using the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) can help investigate the underlying causative factors of anemia. We characterize anemia using MCV among PWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and identify the risk factors for normocytic, macrocytic, and microcytic anemias. Including PWH with anemia (hemoglobin measure < 12.9 g/dL among men and < 11.9 g/dL among women) in the NA-ACCORD from 01/01/2007 to 12/31/2017, we estimated the annual distribution of normocytic (80–100 femtolitre (fL)), macrocytic (> 100 fL) or microcytic (< 80 fL) anemia based on the lowest hemoglobin within each year. Poisson regression models with robust variance and general estimating equations were used to estimate crude and adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk factors for macrocytic (vs. normocytic) and microcytic (vs. normocytic) anemia stratified by sex. Among 37,984 hemoglobin measurements that identified anemia in 14,590 PWH, 27,909 (74%) were normocytic, 4257 (11%) were microcytic, and 5818 (15%) were macrocytic. Of the anemic PWH included over the study period, 1910 (13%) experienced at least one measure of microcytic anemia and 3208 (22%) at least one measure of macrocytic anemia. Normocytic anemia was most common among both males and females, followed by microcytic among females and macrocytic among males. Over time, the proportion of anemic PWH who have macrocytosis decreased while microcytosis increased. Macrocytic (vs. normocytic) anemia is associated with increasing age and comorbidities. With increasing age, microcytic anemia decreased among females but not males. A greater proportion of PWH with normocytic anemia had CD4 counts $$\\le$$ 200 cells/mm3 and had recently initiated ART. In anemic PWH, normocytic anemia was most common. Over time macrocytic anemia decreased, and microcytic anemia increased irrespective of sex. Normocytic anemia is often due to chronic disease and may explain the greater risk for normocytic anemia among those with lower CD4 counts or recent ART initiation. Identified risk factors for type-specific anemias including sex, age, comorbidities, and HIV factors, can help inform targeted investigation into the underlying causes.",

Mixed methods sequential explanatory study involving a quantitative retrospective chart review for clients on PI-based ART who had received IAC from Dec 2016 to May 2023 and qualitative interviews for clients on PI-based ART who had received IAC in the past six months at an urban public HIV clinic in Uganda.

One half (51%, 95/186) of the clients had achieved viral suppression and the odds of suppression increased by 30% for every additional month on IAC. Respondents perceived the effectiveness of PI-based ART and IAC in achieving and supporting viral suppression, respectively. Despite the perceived effectiveness of PI-based ART and IAC, suboptimal levels of viral suppression were observed among clients on PI-based ART who had received IAC.

Methods Monthly aggregated HIV data from all HIV care clinics for persons aged ≥ 15 years were collected from 13 pilot cities. The data period encompassed 3-years prior to SUFA (26 Dec 2010–25 Dec 2013) and 3-years post-SUFA (26 Dec 2013–25 Dec 2016). The ITS was performed using a multilevel negative binomial regression model to assess the immediate and trend changes in each stage of the HIV continuum of care. Results In the pre-SUFA period, the overall coverage in the respective risk populations for HIV tests, cases, enrolments, eligible cases and ARV initiation were 1.0%, 8.6%, 98.9%, 76.9% and 75.8% respectively. In the post-SUFA period coverage was 3%, 3.8%, 98.6%, 90.3% and 81.2% respectively—with a significant increase in the median number of HIV tests, HIV cases, those eligible for ARV treatment and treatment initiation (p &lt; 0.05 for each). The ITS analysis demonstrated immediate increases in HIV tests (IRR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.25, 1.59; p &lt; 0.001) and an immediate decrease in detected HIV cases per person tested (IRR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.69–0.86; p &lt; 0.001) in the month following commencement of SUFA. There was also a 3% decline in the monthly trend for HIV tests performed (IRR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.97–0.98, p &lt; 0.001), a 1% increase for detected cases (IRR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.0–1.02, p &lt; 0.001), and a 1% decline for treatment initiation (IRR = 0.99,95% CI 0.99–1.0 p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions SUFA was associated with an immediate and sustained increase in the absolute number of HIV tests performed, detected HIV cases, and close to complete coverage of detected cases that were enrolled to care and defined as eligible for treatment. However, treatment initiation remained sub-optimal. The findings of this study provide valuable information on the real-world effect of accelerating ARV utilizing Treatment as Prevention for the full HIV continuum of care in limited resource countries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the main driving forces of T-cell senescence in the general population, whereas its differential impact in people living with HIV (PLWH) is less well characterized. The study explores the effect of latent CMV infection on T-cell subsets, monocyte/macrophages activation markers, and CRP in PLWH on long-term ART. Methods Cross-sectional cohort study including PLWH on long-term suppressive ART. Individuals of 4 groups (HIV+CMV−, HIV+CMV+, HIV−CMV+, and HIV−CMV−) were matched 1:1:1:1 for age and sex. Immunophenotyping of lymphocyte and T-cell subsets by multicolor flow cytometry was performed in fresh blood samples collected from patients and healthy donors. Results Both, latent CMV and treated HIV infection were associated with an expansion of CD8 T cells, a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio, and with CD8 T-cell activation with a cumulative effect in CMV/HIV-coinfected individuals. CMV was associated with elevated numbers of late effector and terminally differentiated CD8 T-cells. Compared to CMV monoinfection, CMV/HIV coinfection showed to be associated with lower proportion of CD28−CD8+ T cells expressing CD57 suggesting that HIV preferentially expands CD28−CD57−CD8+ T cells and impedes terminal differentiation of CD28−CD8+ T cells. We could not show any association between HIV or CMV infection status and concentration of CRP and CD163. Conclusions CMV infection is associated with phenotypic signs of T-cell senescence, promoting exacerbation and persistence of alterations of the T-cell compartment in PLWH on effective ART, which are associated with adverse clinical outcomes and may be an attractive target for therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy and tolerability of an antiretroviral regimen are important considerations for selection of HIV-1 infection maintenance therapy. Abacavir/lamivudine plus rilpivirine (ABC/3TC + RPV) has been shown in international studies to be effective and well-tolerated in virologically suppressed individuals. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of switching to ABC/3TC + RPV as maintenance therapy in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected individuals in Singapore.In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included individuals who were prescribed ABC/3TC + RPV, had HIV-1 viral load (VL) < 50 copies/ml immediately pre-switch, and had no documented history of resistance mutations or virologic failure to any of the components. The follow-up period was 48 ± 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of individuals who maintained virologic suppression of HIV-1 VL < 50 copies/ml at the end of follow-up period based on on-treatment analysis. The secondary outcomes were the resistance profiles associated with virologic failure, changes in immunologic and metabolic parameters, and the safety profile of ABC/3TC + RPV.A total of 222 individuals were included in the study. The primary outcome was achieved in 197 individuals [88.8%, 95% confidence interval: 83.7-92.4%]. There were 21 individuals (9.5%) who discontinued treatment for non-virologic reasons. The remaining 4 individuals experienced virologic failure, of whom, 3 of these individuals had developed emergent antiretroviral resistance and had HIV-1 VL > 500 copies/ml at the end of the 48 ± 12 weeks follow-up period. The remaining individual experienced sustained low level viremia and subsequently achieved viral suppression without undergoing resistance testing. A total of 49 adverse events were observed in 31 out of 222 individuals (14.0%), which led to 13 individuals discontinuing therapy. Neuropsychiatric adverse events were most commonly observed (53.1%). A statistically significant increase in CD4 was observed (p < 0.01), with a median absolute change of 31 cells/uL (interquartile range: - 31.50 to 140.75). No significant changes in lipid profiles were detected.ABC/3TC + RPV is a safe and effective switch option for maintenance therapy in virologically suppressed HIV-1 individuals with in Singapore.",

The secretory ribonucleases (RNases) found in vertebrates have cytotoxic ribonucleolytic activity that is kept in check by a cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor protein, RI. Methods We engineered amino acid substitutions that enable human RNase 1 to evade RI upon its cyclization into a zymogen that is activated by the HIV-1 protease. In effect, the zymogen has an HIV-1 protease cleavage site between the termini of the wild-type enzyme, thereby positioning a cleavable linker over the active site that blocks access to a substrate. Results The amino acid substitutions in RNase 1 diminish its affinity for RI by 10 6 -fold and confer high toxicity for T-cell leukemia cells. Pretreating these cells with the zymogen leads to a substantial drop in their viability upon HIV-1 infection, indicating specific toxicity toward infected cells.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background To evaluate the effect of reconstruction and repair, using a mini-plate and bone graft for HIV -positive patients with giant cell tumor of long bone. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 12 HIV positive patients with giant cell tumor of long bone. A non-HIV-positive cohort of patients, matched for age, sex, and disease type, was selected as the control group. From June 2012 to August 2020, curettage by ultrasonic scalpel was performed in all patients, combined with min- plate and bone graft treatment. All patients were followed- up for 18 to 60 months. Limb function was evaluated, using the MSTS93 scoring system, and any examples of postoperative recurrence, distant metastasis, complications, MSTS93 score, and fracture prognosis were recorded. Results The mean age of HIV group was 43.5 years. The ratio of men to women was 11: 1. In all cases the histopathological diagnosis was clear, except the patients with primary malignant giant cell tumor of bone, including five, three, two, and two cases in the proximal tibia, distal femur, distal tibia, and talus, respectively. Following their surgery, all patients were followed up with an average of 31.24 ± 11.84 months. No local recurrence or pulmonary metastases were observed. Post-surgery, all the 12 patients showed good bone morphologic repair and reconstruction, good bone healing, good joint function, and no pathological fractures around their lesion. In the HIV group, one case of giant cell tumor in the proximal tibia showed mild articular surface collapse and mild valgus deformity of the knee joint but retained good joint function. The MSTS scores of excellent or good in the two groups comprised 83.3%, thus, there was no significant difference between them (P &gt; 0.05). Compared with preoperatively, the MSTS scores in the HIV group were significantly improved, ranging from 7 to 11 points preoperatively to 24 to 27 points postoperatively; this difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Reconstruction and repair, using a mini-plate and bone graft for HIV -positive patients with giant cell tumor of long bone can achieve satisfactory results. The mini- plate requires little space and is flexible during reconstruction and fixation, significantly reducing complications such as surgical site infection, as well as preserving joint function and avoiding amputation; therefore, it is a safe and effective treatment method.",

Here we assess CMV and inflammatory markers linked with vascular health in young adult patients treated in Indonesia.HIV-infected adults (n = 32) were examined when they began antiretroviral therapy (ART) with < 200 CD4 T-cells/µl (V0) and after 60 months (V60). Age-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 32) were assessed once.Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD) was assessed by ultrasound on brachial arteries at V60 and in HC. Plasma markers of immune activation and endothelial activation, and CMV antibodies (lysate, gB, IE-1) were assessed in all samples. Results were assessed using bivariate (non-parametric) and multivariable analyses.Levels of inflammatory biomarkers and CMV antibodies declined on ART, but the antibodies remained higher than in HC. FMD values were similar in patients and HC at V60. In HIV patients, levels of CMV lysate antibody correlated inversely (r = - 0.37) with FMD. The optimal model predicting lower FMD values (adjusted R2 = 0.214, p = 0.012) included CMV lysate antibodies and chondroitin sulphate. In HC, levels of sTNFR correlated inversely with FMD (r = - 0.41) and remained as a risk factor in the optimal multivariable model, with CMV glycoprotein-B (gB) antibody predicting a healthier FMD (adjusted R2 = 0.248, p = 0.013).Higher levels CMV antibodies optimally predict vascular health measured by FMD in HIV patients. However in healthy controls, sTNFR marks risk and CMV gB antibody may be protective.",

It reduces both the duration and the chance of viral control due to cross-resistance between different alternative drugs and overlapping toxicity between and within a class of antiretroviral drugs in Ethiopia. However, information's on the time of initial regimen discontinuation and its predictors are not well studied.This study aimed to assess the time to initial highly active antiretroviral therapy discontinuation and its predictors among HIV patients in Felege Hiwot comprehensive specialized hospital, North West Ethiopia.Institution-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 418 HIV patients who started HAART from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019. Data were collected from the patient chart using a data extraction tool. The Kaplan-Meier curve was employed to compare survival rates. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was applied to identify independent predictors of time to initial regimen discontinuation.A total of 418 patients on anti-retroviral therapy were followed. Incidence of initial HAART discontinuation was 16.7/100 person year. The median survival time was 3.5 years. Predictors showed association for time to initial HAART discontinuation were taking > 1 ART pills/day (AHR = 4.1, 95% CI 3.0-6.5), baseline CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3 (AHR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.5-4.7), 100-199 cells/mm3 (AHR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.0), baseline WHO clinical stage IV (AHR = 2.68, 95% CI 1.6-4.3) and stage III (AHR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.3) and TB infection (AHR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.5).Most of the discontinuation occurred after 1 year of initiation of HAART. Baseline WHO clinical stage, TB infection, baseline CD4 count, and taking > 1 ART pill/day were found predictors of initial HAART regimen discontinuation. Work on early detection of HIV before the disease is advanced and initiation of one ART regimen daily is vital for survival on the initial regimen.",

However, both drugs are only recommended for the patients who have pre-treatment HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL. In resource-limited settings, pre-treatment HIV RNA is not routinely performed and not widely available. The aims of this study are to determine factors associated with pre-treatment HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL and to construct a model to predict this outcome. HIV-infected adults enrolled in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database were eligible if they had an HIV RNA measurement documented at the time of ART initiation. The dataset was randomly split into a derivation data set (75% of patients) and a validation data set (25%). Factors associated with pre-treatment HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL were evaluated by logistic regression adjusted for study site. A prediction model and prediction scores were created. A total of 2592 patients were enrolled for the analysis. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age was 35.8 (29.9–42.5) years; CD4 count was 147 (50–248) cells/mm3; and pre-treatment HIV RNA was 100,000 (34,045–301,075) copies/mL. Factors associated with pre-treatment HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL were age <30 years [OR 1.40 vs. 41–50 years; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.80, p = 0.01], body mass index >30 kg/m2 (OR 2.4 vs. <18.5 kg/m2; 95% CI 1.1–5.1, p = 0.02), anemia (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.40–2.10, p < 0.01), CD4 count >350 cells/mm3 (OR 3.9 vs. <100 cells/mm3; 95% CI 2.0–4.1, p < 0.01), total lymphocyte count >2000 cells/mm3 (OR 1.7 vs. <1000 cells/mm3; 95% CI 1.3–2.3, p < 0.01), and no prior AIDS-defining illness (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.5–2.3, p < 0.01). Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis yielded area under the curve of 0.70 (95% CI 0.67–0.72) among derivation patients and 0.69 (95% CI 0.65–0.74) among validation patients. A cut off score >25 yielded the sensitivity of 46.7%, specificity of 79.1%, positive predictive value of 67.7%, and negative predictive value of 61.2% for prediction of pre-treatment HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL among derivation patients. A model prediction for pre-treatment HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL produced an area under the ROC curve of 0.70. A larger sample size for prediction model development as well as for model validation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Treatment management after repeated failure of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is difficult due to resistance and adherence challenges. For people who have failed non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-(NNRTI-) and protease inhibitor-(PI-) based regimens with no or limited resistance, remaining on PI-based ART is an option. Using data from an ART strategy trial (A5288) in low/middle-income countries which included this option, we explored whether predictors can be identified distinguishing those who experienced further virologic failure from those who achieved and maintained virologic suppression.A5288 enrolled people with confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL after ≥ 24 weeks of PI-based ART and prior failure on NNRTI-based ART. This analysis focused on the 278 participants with no resistance to the PI being taken and no or limited nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance, who continued their PI with flexibility to change NRTIs. Proportional hazards models were used to evaluate predictors of virologic failure during follow-up (VF: confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL at ≥ 24 weeks of follow-up).56% of participants were female. At study entry, median age was 40 years, time on ART 7.8 years, CD4 count 169 cells/mm3, HIV-1 RNA 20,444 copies/mL; and 37% had NRTI resistance. The estimated proportion experiencing VF increased from 39% at week 24 to 60% at week 96. In multivariable analysis, significant predictors at study entry of VF were higher HIV-1 RNA (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.20 for ≥ 10,000 versus < 10,000 copies/mL), lower age (1.96 for < 30 versus ≥ 30 years), NRTI resistance (1.74 for present versus absent), lower CD4 count (1.73 for < 200 versus ≥ 200 cells/mm3), and shorter ART duration (1.62 for < 10 versus ≥ 10 years). There was a strong trend in proportion with VF at week 96 with the number of these five risk factors that a participant had, varying from 8% for zero, to 31%, 40%, 73%, and 100% for one, two, three, and four/five. Only 13% of participants developed new NRTI or PI resistance mutations.A simple count of five predictors might have value for identifying risk of continued VF. Novel antiretroviral and adherence support interventions are needed to improve virologic outcomes for higher risk individuals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Behavioral economic (BE) biases have been studied in the context of numerous health conditions, yet are understudied in the field of HIV prevention. This aim of this study was to quantify the prevalence of four common BE biases—present bias, information salience, overoptimism, and loss aversion—relating to condom use and HIV testing in economically-vulnerable young adults who had increased likelihood of acquiring HIV. We also qualitatively examined participants’ perceptions of these biases. Methods 43 participants were enrolled in the study. Data were collected via interviews using a quantitative survey instrument embedded with qualitative questions to characterize responses. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using descriptive statistics and deductive-inductive content analyses. Results 56% of participants were present-biased, disproportionately discounting future rewards for smaller immediate rewards. 51% stated they were more likely to spend than save given financial need. Present-bias relating to condom use was lower with 28% reporting they would engage in condomless sex rather than wait one day to access condoms. Most participants (72%) were willing to wait for condom-supported sex given the risk. Only 35% knew someone living with HIV, but 67% knew someone who had taken an HIV test, and 74% said they often think about preventing HIV (e.g., high salience). Yet, 47% reported optimistically planning for condom use, HIV discussions with partners, or testing but failing to stick to their decision. Most (98%) were also averse ( b = 9.4, SD ±.9) to losing their HIV-negative status. Qualitative reasons for sub-optimal condom or testing choices were having already waited to find a sex partner, feeling awkward, having fear, or not remembering one’s plan in the moment. Optimal decisions were attributed qualitatively to self-protective thoughts, establishing routine care, standing on one’s own, and thinking of someone adversely impacted by HIV. 44% of participants preferred delayed monetary awards (e.g., future-biased), attributed qualitatively to fears of spending immediate money unwisely or needing time to plan. Conclusion Mixed methods BE assessments may be a valuable tool in understanding factors contributing to optimal and sub-optimal HIV prevention decisions. Future HIV prevention interventions may benefit from integrating savings products, loss framing, commitment contracts, cues, or incentives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background This retrospective study aimed to characterize the distribution of HIV-1 genotypes and the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in people with antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure in Suzhou City, China. Methods Pol gene of HIV-1 viruses in blood samples of EDTA anticoagulants from 398 patients with failed antiviral treatment was successfully amplified by using an in-house assay. Drug resistance mutations were analyzed by using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database system ( https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-mutations/ ). HIV-1 genotypes were determined by the REGA HIV subtyping tool (version 3.46, https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/hiv ). Near full-length genomes (NFLG) of HIV-1 viruses were obtained by next generation sequencing method. Results Sequences analysis of the pol gene revealed that CRF 01_AE (57.29%, 228/398) was the dominant subtype circulating in Suzhou City, followed by CRF 07_BC (17.34%, 69/398), subtype B (7.54%, 30/398), CRF 08_BC (6.53%, 26/398), CRF 67_01B (3.02%, 12/398) and CRF55_01B (2.51%, 10/398). The overall prevalence of drug-resistant mutations in cases with ART failure was 64.57% (257/398), including 45.48% (181/398) for nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) mutations, 63.32% (252/398) for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) mutations, and 3.02% (12/398) for protease inhibitors (PIs) mutations. Ten near full-length genomes (NFLG) of HIV-1 viruses were identified, including six recombinants of CRF 01_AE and subtype B, two recombinants of CRF 01_AE, subtype B and subtype C sequences, one recombinant of CRF 01_AE and subtype C and one recombinant of CRF 01_AE, subtype A1 and subtype C. Conclusions The high prevalence of drug-resistant HIV-1 viruses was a serious challenge for HIV prevention and treatment of people with HIV infection. Treatment regimens for ART failure patients should be adjusted over time based on the outcome of drug resistance tests. NFLG sequencing facilitates the identification of new recombinants of HIV-1.",

Survival outcomes in HIV-associated Burkitt lymphoma remain worse than non-HIV-associated Burkitt lymphoma, despite widespread implementation of antiretroviral therapy. We aimed to determine the association between HIV status and risk for 30-day and 90-day readmission in the US after index hospitalization for Burkitt lymphoma.Data were abstracted from the 2010-2020 Nationwide Readmissions Database; hospitalizations included patients with a primary BL diagnosis and were stratified by comorbid HIV. The primary outcome was all-cause readmission (30-day and 90-day). Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), and hospital cost. Between-HIV differences were evaluated via logistic and log-normal regression; multivariable models adjusted for comorbid kidney disease, hypertension, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and sepsis.Overall, there were 8,453 hospitalizations for BL and 6.0% carried an HIV diagnosis. Of BL hospitalizations, 68.4% were readmitted within 30-days post index BL hospitalization and 6.8% carried a HIV diagnosis. HIV-associated BL was associated with 43% higher adjusted odds of 30-day readmission (aOR 95% CI: 4% higher to 97% higher, p = 0.026).

We investigated whether the number of IAC sessions is associated with suppressed VL among PLHIV in Kampala, Uganda. Methods We conducted a nested case-control study among PLHIV with unsuppressed VL after ≥ 3 IAC sessions (cases) and a 2:1 random sample of PLHIV with suppressed VL after ≥ 3 IAC sessions (controls). Unsuppressed VL was defined as VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml. We performed multivariable logistic regression to identify factors that differed significantly between cases and controls. Results Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar among the 16 cases and 32 controls including mean age, sex, baseline CD4 count, VL before IAC, and WHO clinical stage. Only the number of IAC sessions differed significantly between cases and controls in unadjusted (p = 0.012) and adjusted (p = 0.016) analyses. Each unit increase in IAC session was associated with unsuppressed VL (Adjusted odds ratio 5.09; 95% CI 1.35–19.10). Conclusions VL remained unsuppressed despite increasing IAC frequency. The fidelity to standardized IAC protocol besides drug resistance testing among PLHIV with unsuppressed VL before IAC commencement should be examined.",

    "abstract": "Ethics, AIDS, and Africa – three concepts that conjure up a host of powerful associations. Ethics: our fragile human attempts to negotiate acceptable paths through conflicts of value. AIDS: the world's deadliest epidemic since the Black Plague of the 14th century. And Africa: cradle of humankind, burdened by colonization, famine, poverty and civil war. In what ways do ethics, AIDS and Africa go together, and how is our thinking challenged by their relationship?\r\n\r\nEditors Van Niekerk and Kopelman have assembled an impressive list of well-respected authors to deal with this question. Their contributions focus on the impact of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and take on some of the key ethical issues raised by HIV/AIDS research, policy and clinical practice in the region. Although rich in details, it is fair to say that four general themes dominate this book: the ethical role of national governments in tackling the AIDS epidemic, with special focus on the South African case; the epidemic and responses to it as reflections of global inequity; the ethical responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies in the struggle against HIV/AIDS, and the dilemmas involved in HIV prevention research, particularly in vaccine studies.\r\n\r\nFor a book on ethics, there is an unusual amount of agreement. None of the authors seriously doubts the terrifying social impact HIV/AIDS is currently having in sub-Saharan Africa. There is general condemnation of the lack of leadership and intransigence of the South African government in its approach to both rolling out AIDS treatment and redoubling its HIV prevention efforts. There is also no question among the contributors that poverty, lack of education, gender inequality and inadequate health care infrastructure both fuel the spread of the virus and limit access to treatment, and that tackling the epidemic in Africa is inseparable from larger economic, social, political, human rights and development issues.\r\n\r\nBut there are also interesting cracks in the consensus. Solomon Benatar argues that the AIDS epidemic in Africa has exposed our world as fundamentally inequitable and unstable, and little progress will be made unless current international relations in politics and trade are rethought and remade. Anton Van Niekerk counters that efforts in low-resource countries should focus on what is doable in the short-term, rather than a quixotic pursuit for global reform, and he argues that national governments in Africa cannot be mere passive beneficiaries of international funding – they have an ethical duty to create policies and programs that sustain global AIDS initiatives. David Resnik claims that pharmaceutical companies have ethical responsibilities towards those suffering from AIDS in the developing world, but given the money-making imperatives of big pharma, this responsibility can only realistically take the form of some investment in R&D in the developing world, discounts on drug prices or drug give-aways. For Richard Ashcroft and Udo Schuklenk, such 'charity' on the part of multinational corporations is simply not good enough. When a country is experiencing a devastating public health crisis, compulsory licensing of essential AIDS treatment may be the most effective and ethically justified way of getting medication to those who need it. In this way, Ashcroft and Schuklenk provide the activist slogan Patients before patents with a deeper philosophical justification.\r\n\r\nKevin De Cock, WHO's Director of the Department of HIV/AIDS, recently stated at the last International AIDS Conference in Toronto that 'we cannot treat our way out of this epidemic.' HIV prevention research and policies are crucial: the former to find novel ways of preventing new infections, and the latter to channel prevention strategies into practice. The chapters by Keymanthri Moodley, Godfrey Tangwa and Melissa Stobie et. al. offer an excellent overview of the ethical and cultural issues encountered in conducting HIV vaccine research in sub-Saharan Africa with adults and children. Both Tangwa and Moodley tantalizingly claim that the informed consent process – cornerstone of the ethical conduct of biomedical research in the West – inappropriately assumes that the African research participant can be separated from his kinship and community ties. What would count as a more 'culturally sensitive' consent process, however, remains elusive. Stobie et. al. usefully discuss the tensions between ethical concerns for individuals and concern for social groups in HIV vaccine research. On the one hand, it would be in the best interest of children as a class for there to be an efficacious HIV vaccine, at least for children growing up in a high HIV prevalence setting. But it may or may not be in an individual child's best interest to participate in an HIV vaccine trial. The discussion of the deep ambiguities in South African laws and guidelines concerning the best interests of children, the limits of parental consent to research involving children and the determination of risk in pediatric studies is both illuminating and sobering. It is not as if laws and guidance on pediatric research are much clearer elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are some minor limitations to this book. Although the title refers to Africa, the focus is really on sub-Saharan Africa, with a special emphasis on South Africa. To a certain extent, this is understandable and justified. South Africa has an estimated 5.5 million persons living with HIV and approximately 1000 persons dying of AIDS daily. The South Africa government is a reliable source of bizarre HIV-related publicity, be it the President's embrace of rogue scientists who deny HIV causes AIDS, a health minister who suggests garlic and nutritional supplements are as effective as anti-retrovirals in controlling AIDS, or a previous head of the South African AIDS Council who claims a post-coital shower (after sex with an HIV positive woman) can protect him against the virus. South Africa also, as it turns out, has exceptional centers for bioethics and research ethics at Cape Town and Pretoria. Nevertheless, the book might have profited by looking farther afield and incorporating voices of West and East Africans, and Africans living above the Sahara.\r\n\r\nMany of the pieces in the book seem to have been originally written around 2001, and therefore the factual data and the ethical commentary based on the data sometimes appear a bit dated. The results of the efforts by the Global Fund, PEPFAR, the Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation over the last five years are not well-represented. HIV prevention research is currently focused on more on female-controlled methods (microbicides) and controversial surgical interventions (male circumcision) as the development of an effective vaccine still seems a lot way off. Keeping the ethics up to date is clearly a difficult task, given the rapid evolution in disease dynamics and in the political, economic and scientific responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\r\n\r\nThese minor reservations aside, Ethics and AIDS in Africa is a highly illuminating, stimulating and informative guide to the ethical dilemmas faced by researchers, policy-makers and health care providers in the countries hardest hit by HIV/AIDS. The book clearly delivers on its promise that HIV/AIDS, as it continues to ravage low-resource countries of Africa, challenges everyone's ethical thinking.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In Nigeria, private for-profit health facilities present an opportunity to achieve the UNAIDS 95-95-95 HIV targets because of their reach and patronage. However, little is known about determinants of outcomes in these facilities. This study describes patient outcomes and the patient and health facility characteristics associated with these outcomes in adults receiving HIV treatment in private facilities in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Benue and Nasarawa states in north-central Nigeria. Methods A retrospective longitudinal analysis of program data collected between 2013 and 2019 was done. Patient attributes and outcomes were compared across the two states and FCT. Incidence rates were determined for all cause exit, mortality and loss to follow up (LTFU). Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify associations between patient and facility attributes and these outcomes. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the factors associated with viral suppression among the study participants. Results Of the 22,010 study subjects, 42.7%, 22.2% and 35.1%, respectively, were in Benue, FCT and Nasarawa. Almost a third (31.8%) had received antiretroviral treatment (ART) for less than a year at censoring. Incidence rates for all-cause exit, mortality and loss to follow up (LTFU) were 17.2 (95% CI 16.8, 17.5), 2.1 (95% CI 2.0, 2.2), and 11.2 (95% CI 10.8, 11.8) per 100 person years respectively. Males had higher risks of death (HR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.25–1.73), and LTFU (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.00–1.16). Age at ART start showed a dose–response association with both mortality and LTFU. Care at model facilities (OR = 2.16, p &lt; 0.001 ), Zidovudine (AZT)-based regimens (OR = 2.00, p &lt; 0.001 ), and lowest quartile baseline CD4 + count (OR = 2.40, p &lt; 0.001 ) were associated with regimen switch. 75.6% of subjects were viral suppressed. Male gender (OR = 0.84, p = 0.025 ); AZT-based regimen (OR = 0.72, p &lt; 0.001 ), age in the bottom quartile (OR = 0.71, p = 0.002 ) were associated with virally suppression. Conclusion Private for-profit facilities are a major provider of HIV and other health services in Nigeria. With appropriate technical support and engagement, they can help accelerate efforts to achieve epidemic control of HIV in Nigeria, and contribute to achievement of UNAIDS 95-95-95 target by 2030.",

Previously, identified risk factors for mortality may be biased towards these patients, as compared to those who experience late mortality. Aim To compare risk factors for early and late mortality in PLWHIV commencing ART. Methods A retrospective cohort study of ART-naïve patients aged ≥ 18 years from an outpatient HIV clinic in Zimbabwe. Data were collected between January 2010 and January 2019. Predictors for early (≤ 1 year) and late mortality (&gt; 1 year) were determined by multivariable cox proportional hazards analyses, with patients censored at 1 year and landmark analysis after 1 year, respectively. Results Three thousand and thirty-nine PLWHIV were included in the analysis. Over a median follow-up of 4.6 years (IQR 2.5–6.9), there was a mortality rate of 8.8%, with 50.4% of deaths occurring within 1 year. Predictors of early mortality included CD4 count &lt; 50 cells/µL (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.24–2.72, p &lt; 0.01), WHO Stage III (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.28–3.27, p &lt; 0.01) or IV (HR 2.83, 95% CI 1.67–4.81, p &lt; 0.01), and eGFR &lt; 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.56–3.96, p &lt; 0.01).

Conclusions Traditional markers of mortality risk in patients commencing ART appear to be limited to early mortality. Proteinuria and diabetes are some of the few predictors of late mortality, and should be incorporated into routine screening of patients commencing ART.",

Participant ages ranged between 18-46 years (median age 26 years; interquartile range, 21-31 years). Most participants had at least one sex partner over the last 12 months (68.2%). Younger men (18-24 years old vs. 25-46 years old) (odds ratio [OR], 1.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-2.0]), those with multiple partners ([OR], 1.5 (CI) 1.3-1.8]) and participants unsure of their last partner's HIV status (OR, 1.4 [95% CI 1.1-1.7]) were more likely to have traditional beliefs on gender roles.Young men with traditional beliefs on gender roles may be more likely to engage in high-risk sexual behaviour and could be good candidates for HIV prevention programmes.
