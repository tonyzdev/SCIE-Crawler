    "abstract": "Amphiphiles are synthetic or natural molecules with the ability to self-assemble into a wide variety of structures including micelles, vesicles, nanotubes, nanofibers, and lamellae. Self-assembly processes of amphiphiles have been widely used to mimic biological systems, such as assembly of lipids and proteins, while their integrated actions allow the performance of highly specific cellular functions which has paved a way for bottom-up bionanotechnology. While amphiphiles self-assembly has attracted considerable attention for decades due to their extensive applications in material science, drug and gene delivery, recent developments in nanoscience stimulated the combination of the simple approaches of amphiphile assembly with the advanced concept of supramolecular self-assembly for the development of more complex, hierarchical nanostructures. Introduction of stimulus responsive supramolecular amphiphile assembly-disassembly processes provides particularly novel approaches for impacting bionanotechnology applications. Leading examples of these novel self-assembly processes can be found, in fact, in biosystems where assemblies of different amphiphilic macrocomponents and their integrated actions allow the performance of highly specific biological functions. In this perspective, we summarize in this tutorial review the basic concept and recent research on self-assembly of traditional amphiphilic molecules (such as surfactants, amphiphile-like polymers, or lipids) and more recent concepts of supramolecular amphiphiles assembly which have become increasingly important in emerging nanotechnology.",

A compendium of viscosity models is given including recent data on viscous flow model based on network defects in which thermodynamic parameters of configurons—elementary excitations resulting from broken bonds—are found from viscosity-temperature relationships. Glass-liquid transition phenomena are described including the configuron model of glass transition which shows a reduction of Hausdorff dimension of bonds at glass-liquid transition.",

    "abstract": "Time-resolved macromolecular crystallography unifies structure determination with chemical kinetics, since the structures of transient states and chemical and kinetic mechanisms can be determined simultaneously from the same data. To start a reaction in an enzyme, typically, an initially inactive substrate present in the crystal is activated. This has particular disadvantages that are circumvented when active substrate is directly provided by diffusion. However, then it is prohibitive to use macroscopic crystals because diffusion times become too long. With small micro- and nanocrystals diffusion times are adequately short for most enzymes and the reaction can be swiftly initiated. We demonstrate here that a time-resolved crystallographic experiment becomes feasible by mixing substrate with enzyme nanocrystals which are subsequently injected into the X-ray beam of a pulsed X-ray source.",

The transmittance of the prepared thin films is 92.4% and 88.4%. Determination of the optical constants such as refractive index, absorption coefficient, and dielectric constant in this wavelength range has been evaluated. Further, normal dispersion of the refractive index has been analyzed in terms of single oscillator model of free carrier absorption to estimate the dispersion and oscillation energy. The lattice dielectric constant and the ratio of free carrier concentration to free carrier effective mass have been determined. Moreover, photoluminescence measurements of the thin films in the spectral range from 350 nm to 900 nm have been presented. Electrical measurements for resistivity evaluation of the films have been done. An analysis in terms of order-disorder of the material has been presented to provide more consistency in the results.",

This phenomenon has led to the development of various kinds of materials and conceptions of many novel applications such as development of a memory device utilizing the multifunctionality of the multiferroic materials leading to a multistate memory device with electrical writing and nondestructive magnetic reading operations. Though, interdependence of electrical- and magnetic-order parameters makes it difficult to accomplish the above and thus rendering the device to only two switchable states, recent research has shown that such problems can be circumvented by novel device designs such as formation of tunnel junction or by use of exchange bias. In this paper, we review the operational aspects of multiferroic memories as well as the materials used for these applications along with the designs that hold promise for the future memory devices.",

The magnitude of ME coupling in the composite systems is dependent upon the elastic coupling occurring at the interface of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive phases. The multiferroic ME films in comparison with bulk ME composites have some unique advantages and show higher magnitude of ME response. In ME composite films, thickness of the films is one of the important factors to have enough signal. However, most of all reported ME nanocomposite structured films in literature are limited in overall thickness which might be related to interface strain resulting from difference in thermal expansion mismatch between individual phases and the substrate. We introduced noble ME composite film fabrication technique, aerosol deposition (AD) to overcome these problems. The success in AD fabrication and characterization of ME composite films with various microstructure such as 3-2, 2-2 connectivity are discussed.",

The different steps involved in the adsorption of the particles and the particle-surfactant mixtures from bulk to the interface are also discussed. We also include here the different equations of state provided so far to explain the interfacial behavior of the nanoparticles. Finally, we discuss the mechanical properties of the interfacial particle layers via dilatational and shear rheology. We emphasize along that section the importance of the shear rheology to know the intrinsic morphology of such particulate system and to understand how the flow-field-dependent evolution of the interfacial morphology might eventually affect some properties of materials such as foams and emulsions. We dedicated the last section to explaining the importance of the particulate interfacial systems in the stabilization of foams and emulsions.",

    "abstract": "This review is devoted to the simple process of drying a multicomponent droplet of a complex fluid which may contain salt or other inclusions. These processes provide a fascinating subject for study. The explanation of the rich variety of patterns formed is not only an academic challenge but also a problem of practical importance, as applications are growing in medical diagnosis and improvement of coating/printing technology. The fundamental scientific problem is the study of the mechanism of micro- and nanoparticle self-organization in open systems. The specific fundamental problems to be solved, related to this system, are the investigation of the mass transfer processes, the formation and evolution of phase fronts, and the identification of mechanisms of pattern formation. The drops of liquid containing dissolved substances and suspended particles are assumed to be drying on a horizontal solid insoluble smooth substrate. The chemical composition and macroscopic properties of the complex fluid, the concentration and nature of the salt, the surface energy of the substrate, and the interaction between the fluid and substrate which determines the wetting all affect the final morphology of the dried film. The range of our study encompasses the fully wetting case with zero contact angle between the fluid and substrate to the case where the drop is levitated in space, so there is no contact with a substrate and angle of contact can be considered as 180°.",

In this paper, the Al 2 O 3 films with different thickness were prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology at 200°C in order to achieve amorphous structure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) results indicated that the Al 2 O 3 films were amorphous structure and stable O/Al ratio. The surface topography investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the samples were smooth and crack-free. Spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE) measurements were operated to investigate the effect of thickness on the structure and optical properties of films with Tauc-Lorentz model. It is found that the band gap exhibits a steady value ~2.3 eV by the UV-VIS transmittance method, but the T-L model was ~3.0 eV. The refractive index and extinction coefficient are related to the variation of thickness and the samples surface quality of amorphous network structure in the thin films. The outstanding optoelectronic properties and facile fabrication of Al 2 O 3 films amorphous structure can be extended to other similar oxides, which could display wide applications in various engineering and industrial fields.",

A single-phase spinel structure was found through X-ray diffraction (XRD). The crystallite size is in the range of 17.55–66.98 nm, and lattice parameters are in the range of 8.351–8.434 Å. X-ray analysis revealed a slight shift of the peaks towards shorter angles when the zinc concentration increased from 0.25 to 0.75. XRD measurements revealed the metal ion distribution in the spinel ferrite system. For each sample, XRD data were used to compute structural characteristics such as lattice spacing, lattice constant, crystallite size, oxygen position parameter, tetrahedral and octahedral ionic radii, and bond lengths. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra and field emission-electron scanning microscope (FESEM) were used to evaluate the elemental content and morphology. EDS analysis confirmed the presence of expected elements in the samples and confirmed the high doping rate of more than 180% of Zn ions in Ni ferrite. The evaluated particle sizes were determined to be 79.2 and 118.4 nm for zinc content of 0.25 and 0.75, respectively. The nearly spherical shape of the nanoparticles was shown in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The magnetic moment, remanent, coercivity, and saturation magnetization were calculated by using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) results.

    "abstract": "Multiferroic materials have sparked significant interest in the realm of materials science because of their potential impact on various device applications. This study focuses on the synthesis of nanocrystalline La1−xPrxFeO3 (LPFO) materials, where x can be either 0 or 0.5, using a solid-state technique. The aim is to gain insights into their structural, optical, dielectric, and magnetic properties. To confirm the chemical phase of the synthesized materials, X-ray diffractometer and Raman spectroscopy were employed. The outcome of the Rietveld analysis reveals that the LPFO crystallites exhibit orthorhombic symmetry with a Pbnm space group. The functional groups that were present in the LPFO samples were identified using FT-IR spectroscopic analysis. The morphological studies using scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope indicate that the synthesized samples exhibit excellent homogeneity with uniformly distributed grains. In order to investigate the dielectric constant (εʹ) and dielectric loss (tan δ) were examined as functions of temperature and frequency. Pr3+ dopants had a notable impact on the dielectric characteristics, particularly within the frequency span of 10 kHz–1 MHz and over the temperature variation of 40–160°C. The ambient temperature magnetic properties of the LPFO ferrite materials displayed antiferromagnetic behavior. Ultimately, this research reveals insightful information on the structural, optical, dielectric, and magnetic properties of the synthesized nanocrystalline LPFO materials, shedding light on their potential applications in the multifunctional devices.",

The utilization of vanadium oxide nanoparticles as counter electrodes (CEs) in DSSCs has been the subject of research due to its enhanced stability, cost-effectiveness, and favorable photovoltaic characteristics. The device has been fabricated in configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)||TiO2||ruthenium (II) dye (N719)||iodide—triiodide electrolyte||VO2 (counter electrode)||FTO and investigate their photovoltaic performance.

The utilization of a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) that is equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrum reveals a dense microstructure characterized by a uniform distribution of vanadium (V) and oxygen (O) across the whole surface. The Raman spectroscopic examination of VO2 reveals the existence of many Raman bands, thereby confirming the presence of the monoclinic phase. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were employed to investigate the catalytic activity of the CE toward the electrolyte.

Among different experimental methods, nanoindentation testing is arguably the most commonly applied method of studying size effect in various materials where increases in the hardness with decreasing indentation depth are usually related to indentation size effects. Such indentation size effects have been observed in both metals and polymers. While the indentation size effects in metals are widely discussed in the literature and are commonly attributed to geometrically necessary dislocations, for polymer the experimental results are far sparser and there does not seem to be a common ground for their rationales. The indentation size effects of polymers are addressed in this paper, where their depth dependent deformation is reviewed along with the rationale provided in the literature.",

The monoclinic single-phase nature of the as-deposited films, structure was changed to triclinic structure by annealing them at higher temperatures than 400°C, which has been determined by the X-ray diffraction analysis. By Raman scattering is confirmed the change of crystalline phase, of monoclinic to triclinic, since that lattice vibrational modes of as-deposited WO 3 and annealed at 500°C present clearly differences. WO 3 band gap energy can be varied from 2.92 to 3.15 eV by annealing WO 3 from 0 to 500°C as was obtained by transmittance measurements. The photoluminescence response of the as-deposited film presents three radiative transitions observed at 2.85, 2.41, and 2.04 eV that could be associated with oxygen vacancies; the first one is shifted to higher energies as the annealing temperature is increased due to the change of crystalline phase of the WO 3 .",

The desired range of ME coefficient in the sintered composite is 0.5–1 V/cm⋅Oe. The studies showed that the soft piezoelectric phase quantified by smaller elastic modulus, large grain size of piezoelectric phase (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mo>~</mml:mo></mml:math>1 <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math>m), and layered structures yields higher magnitude of ME coefficient. It is also found that postsintering thermal treatment such as annealing and aging alters the magnitude of magnetization providing an increase in the magnitude of ME coefficient. A trilayer composite was synthesized using pressure-assisted sintering with soft phase [0.9 PZT–0.1 PZN] having grain size larger than 1 <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math>m and soft ferromagnetic phase of composition Ni 0.8 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 Fe 2 O 4 [NCZF]. The composite showed a high ME coefficient of 412 and 494 mV/cm⋅Oe after sintering and annealing, respectively. Optimized ferrite to PZT thickness ratio was found to be 5.33, providing ME coefficient of 525 mV/cm⋅Oe. The ME coefficient exhibited orientation dependence with respect to applied magnetic field. Multilayering the PZT layer increased the magnitude of ME coefficient to 782 mV/cm⋅Oe. Piezoelectric grain texturing and nanoparticulate assembly techniques were incorporated with the layered geometry. It was found that with moderate texturing, d 33 and ME coefficient reached up to 325 pC/N and 878 mV/cm⋅Oe, respectively. Nanoparticulate core shell assembly shows the promise for achieving large ME coefficient in the sintered composites. A systematic relationship between composition, microstructure, geometry, and properties is presented which will lead to development of high-performance magnetoelectric materials.",

However, its massive manufacturing routes from its precursor graphene oxide (GO) are involved in the production of toxic gasses and consist of hazardous explosive steps that severely hurt and threaten ecological balance and human health. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the green, effective, and economical approach for the synthesis of graphene by using Vernonia amygdalina (VA) plant leaf extracts for the effective and efficient reduction of GO. The nonexplosive two-step synthesis of GO in a short period of time in the absence of an ice bath was used in this study. The appropriate solvent for the extraction of VA for the green synthesis of graphene was methanol, and the reducing and capping agent in the plant extract was identified to be terpenoids and polyphenols. The graphene/rGO obtained this way was characterized by UV-VIS, XRD, FTIR, SEM, HR-TEM, and EDAX that confirmed the successful reduction of GO to graphene under the hydrothermal process. The HR-TEM images showed the development of few layers of graphene. The FTIR result also shows the complete reduction of GO. Hence, methanol extracted VA leaves consisted of the most appropriate compounds for reducing and capping agent in the green synthesis and could be the preferred method for the large-scale production of graphene-based materials.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive investigation of the electromagnetic properties of CdAB2 compounds, where A represents Cr, Mn, or Fe, and B denotes P or As. To investigate the spin-polarized behavior of these compounds the A atoms were substituted at the Group IV (Ge) position in CdGeB2 in the chalcopyrite crystal structure. Our results reveal that all the CdAB2 compounds exhibit compelling spin-splitting of energy states near the Fermi level (EF). Notably, CdAB2 materials with A = Cr and Mn exhibit intriguing half-metallic ferromagnetic (HMF) characteristics, with the calculated total magnetic moments of 2.00 and 3.00 µB/f.u., respectively. The HMF properties originated in CdAB2 (A = Cr and Mn; B = P, As) these compounds owing to the hybridization of partially filled -3d(t2g) states of A atoms with the p-states of B (P, As) atoms, with minor contributions from Cd’s-like states. In contrast, CdFeB2 displays distinct behavior, demonstrating spin-splitting of energy levels around the EF indicative of a stable ferromagnetic (FM) state and the absence of HMF at their equilibrium volume. The calculated total magnetic moments for CdFeP2 and CdFeAs2 are about 1.83 (1.64 µB/f.u.) and 1.94 µB/f.u. (1.84 µB/f.u.) under generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (local spin density approximation (LSDA)) approximations, respectively. Perhaps these CdAB2 compounds (A = Cr and Mn; B = P, As) with HMF characteristic within both LSDA and GGA formalisms makes them highly promising candidates for spin injectors in the spintronic device applications. Furthermore, their semiconducting nature renders CdCrB2 and CdMnB2 materials compatible with silicon and other semiconducting lattices, enhancing their potential practical applications in the spintronic technologies. In conclusion, this study presents a thorough exploration of the robust electronic and magnetic properties of CdAB2 chalcopyrites, offering exciting prospects for their utilization in the future spintronic applications.",

X‐ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed NiO’s cubic structure, with sizes of 17.01 nm for pure NiO and 30.87 nm for composites. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed flowerlike morphologies, energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX) authenticated the elemental composition without any impurities. Ultraviolet–visible (UV‐Vis) spectroscopy demonstrated heightened absorption in doped and nanocomposite samples. The bandgap energy calculated using Tauc’s plot reduced from 2.95 to 2.55 eV with increase in zinc (Zn) content. In Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) characterization, the Ni–O stretching vibration appeared at 666.7 cm −1 in doped samples, while Zn–O stretching was evident at 586.03 cm −1 . Photoluminescence analysis unveiled a strong peak at 470 nm (near band edge) and another at 665 nm (indicative of defects), exhibiting intensified signals in doped and nanocomposite samples due to a higher defect density. The dielectric constant showed increased values at low frequencies attributed to real and space charge polarization. Notably, the conductivity of Zn‐doped and nanocomposite samples displayed an upward trend with frequency due to a higher defect density. This study unveils insights into the intricate optical and electrical properties of these novel nanostructures, showcasing their potential in advanced energy storage applications.",

    "abstract": "A sol-gel dip-coating process was used to deposit almost stress-free highly c -axis oriented zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films onto glass substrates. The effects of low silver doping concentration (Ag/Zn &lt; 1%) on the structural, morphological, optical, and waveguide properties of such films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy, UV-Visible spectrophotometry, and M-lines spectroscopy (MLS). XRD analysis revealed that all the films were in single phase and had a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The grain size values were calculated and found to be about 24–29 nm. SEM micrographs and AFM images have shown that film morphology and surface roughness were influenced by Ag doping concentration. According to UV-Vis. measurements all the films were highly transparent with average visible transmission values ranging from 80% to 86%. It was found that the Ag contents lead to widening of the band gap. MLS measurements at 632.8 nm wavelength put into evidence that all thin film planar waveguides demonstrate a well-guided fundamental mode for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarized light. Moreover, the refractive index of ZnO thin films was found to increase by Ag doping levels.",

There are three main approaches for generating p-type ZnO: substitutional group IA elements on a zinc site, codoping of donors and acceptors, and substitution of group VA elements on an oxygen site. The relevant issues are whether there is sufficient incorporation of the appropriate dopant impurity species, does it reside on the appropriate lattice site, and lastly whether the acceptor ionization energy is sufficiently small to enable significant p-type conduction at room temperature. The potential of nitrogen doping and formation of the appropriate acceptor complexes is highlighted although theoretical calculations predict that nitrogen on an oxygen site is a deep acceptor. We show that an understanding of the growth and annealing steps to achieve the relevant acceptor defect complexes is crucial to meet requirements.",

For the n -type SiC, Ni-based metallization is most commonly used for Schottky and ohmic contacts. Many experimental studies have been performed in order to understand the mechanism of ohmic contact formation and different models were proposed to explain the Schottky to ohmic transition for Ni/SiC contacts. In the present review, we summarize the last key results on the matter and post open questions concerning the unclear issues of ohmic contacts to n -type SiC. Analysis of the literature data and our own experimental observations have led to the conclusion that the annealing at high temperature leads to the preferential orientation of silicide at the heterointerface (0001)SiC//(013)<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>-Ni 2 Si.

It is found that in the oxides of metals with cation radii larger than ≈ 0.7 Å, the oxide valence band top remains nearly at the same energy (±0.2 eV) irrespective of the cation sort. Using this result, it becomes possible to predict the interface band alignment between oxides and semiconductors as well as between dissimilar insulating oxides on the basis of the oxide bandgap width which are also affected by crystallization. By contrast, oxides of light elements, for example, Be, Mg, Al, Si, and Sc exhibit significant shifts of the valence band top.

Two binary mixtures of phospholipids with the same polar head and differing in the alkyl chain length, DMPC + DPPC and DMPC + DSPC, are discussed. Both techniques give consistent phase diagrams, which compare well with literature results, showing their capability to map the phase behaviour of pure lipids as well as lipid mixtures. This work can be considered as a departure point for further investigations on more complex lipid mixtures displaying relevant phases such as the liquid-ordered phase and solid-lipid interfaces with biologically functional importance.",

The structural properties such as equilibrium lattice constant, equilibrium unit cell volume, bulk modulus, and its derivative are in reasonable agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical works. From elastic constants, mechanical parameters such as anisotropy factor A , shear modulus G , bulk modulus B , Young’s modulus E , and Poison’s ratio n are determined by using Voigt–Reuss–Hill average approximation. In addition, Debye temperature and longitudinal and transversal sound velocities are predicted from elastic constants. The electronic band structure and density of states of both compounds are obtained and compared with the available experimental as well as theoretical data. Born effective charge (BEC), phonon dispersion curve, and density of states are computed from functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Lastly, the spontaneous polarization is determined from the modern theory of polarization, and they are in agreement with the previous findings.",

ZnO nanorods were grown on p-Silicon substrate by the aqueous chemical growth (ACG) method. The SEM image revealed high density, vertically aligned hexagonal ZnO nanorods with an average height of about 1.2 μ m. Electrical characterization of n-ZnO nanorods/p-Si heterojunction diode was done by current-voltage (I-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V), and conductance-voltage (G-V) measurements at room temperature. The heterojunction exhibited good electrical characteristics with diode-like rectifying behaviour with an ideality factor of 2.7, rectification factor of 52, and barrier height of 0.7 V. Energy band (EB) structure has been studied to investigate the factors responsible for small rectification factor. In order to investigate nonidealities, series resistance and distribution of interface state density (N SS ) below the conduction band (CB) were extracted with the help of I-V and C-V and G-V measurements. The series resistances were found to be 0.70, 0.73, and 0.75 KΩ, and density distribution interface states from 8.38 × 10 12 to 5.83 × 10 11 eV −1 cm −2 were obtained from 0.01 eV to 0.55 eV below the conduction band.",

The local field enhancement factor increases significantly at two resonant frequencies. The results demonstrate that the local field enhancement factor in the cylindrical core–shell nanoparticle increases when the natural attribute of the dielectric function of the dielectric core is varied by adding a dielectric function to it. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the magnitude of the imaginary part of the active dielectric core increases as the onset and offset input intensities increase. This indicates that the optical bistability or threshold width range widens as the imaginary part of the dielectric function of the dielectric core increases, thereby enlarging the threshold domain to improve system activation.",

In this paper, the monolayer graphene was grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Using the graphene as the electric channel, we have fabricated a graphene field-effect transistor (G-FET) biosensor that can be used for label-free detection of RNA. Compared with conventional method, the G-FET RNA biosensor can be run in low cost, be time-saving, and be miniaturized for RNA measurement. The sensors show high performance and achieve the RNA detection sensitivity as low as 0.1 fM, which is two orders of magnitude lower than the previously reports. Moreover, the G-FET biosensor can readily distinguish target RNA from noncomplementary RNA, showing high selectivity for RNA detection. The developed G-FET RNA biosensor with high sensitivity, fast analysis speed, and simple operation may provide a new feasible direction for RNA research and biosensing.",

These NPs have been prepared with vanadium concentrations varying from 0% to 4% via the coprecipitation method. Structural, morphological, and optical properties of the prepared nanoparticles have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and UV-Vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Structural properties showed that both undoped and SnO 2 : V NPs exhibited the tetragonal structure, and the average crystal size has been decreased from 20 nm to 10 nm with the increasing doping level of vanadium. Optical studies showed that the absorption edge of SnO 2 : V NPs showed a redshift with the increasing vanadium concentration. This redshift leads to the decrease in the optical band gap from 3.25 eV to 2.55 eV. A quenching in luminescence intensity has been observed in SnO 2 : V NPs, as compared to the undoped sample. Rhodamine B dye (RhB) has been used to study the photocatalytic degradation of all synthesized NPs. As compared to undoped SnO 2 NPs, the photocatalytic activity of SnO 2 : V NPs has been improved. RhB dye was considerably degraded by 95% within 150 min over on the SnO 2 : V NPs.",

It is expected that these factors can be used to control the degree of reduction of Bi2O3, and the relationship between these factors and the color change of the process for bismuth glass is discussed. Due to high-temperature melting, the bismuth-doped borate glasses have changed into dark/black from original transparent yellow and the light transmittance will decrease, so it is not used in optical applications. The thermal properties of glass are measured by a thermomechanical analyzer (TMA), and the glass structure is analyzed by FTIR and XPS. The results show that the glass is mainly composed of [BiO6] octahedron, [BiO3] triangle, [BO4] tetrahedron, and triangle [BO3] units, and the network of the glass system is mainly bonded by B-O-B, B-O-Zn, B-O-Bi, and Bi-O-Bi. The glass thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of this glass system increases with the increase of Bi2O3 content, and the O1s nuclear electron binding energy shifts to the lower energy direction with the increase of Bi2O3 addition. In terms of FTIR, as the melting temperature rises, the B-O-B bonding vibration concentration of [BO4] inside the borate glass decreases, and the density of B-O-B bonding vibration of [BO3] increases, Moreover, the increase in melting temperature increases the probability of reducing Bi ions to Bi0, reduces the bonding of Bi-O-B, and increases the bonding of B-O-B, and the CTE also slightly decreases.",

Specifically, it aims to understand the competing phase tendencies concerning particle size in the prototypical phase‐separated compound Nd 0.65 Ca 0.35 MnO 3 (NCMO). Nanosized material was synthesized through sintering sol–gel derived powders at a temperature of 900°C. Using the Rietveld refinement technique, the structure of the NCMO was investigated. It was found that NCMO has an orthorhombic shape with the Pnma spatial group. Mn2p and Mn2s core‐level X‐ray photoemission spectroscopy confirms that Mn has +3, +4 ions coexist in the intended ratio. The transition from paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) states is shown by magnetization measurements performed at H = 100 Oe. Observations of note include the disparity between zero‐field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled warming (FCW) magnetization, indicating a glassy behavior at lower temperatures, and the hysteresis loop between cooling and warming cycle in the presence of field magnetization. Isothermal magnetization loop analysis confirms the dominance of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) component at higher magnetic fields. However, the resistivity versus temperature data does not reveal an insulator–metal transition (IMT). Instead, the PM state in the sample shows conduction via variable range hopping.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a comparison of structural, optical, mechanical, and electronic characteristics of CsCdX 3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) by employing first principle calculations. We performed this calculation using the general gradient approximation (GGA) scheme within the Perdew–Berke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, which is carried out by the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) system. The computation’s validity is validated by a comparison of accessible mathematical and experimental findings. The computed lattice constants show excellent consistency with those obtained from the theoretical calculation and experimental techniques. The computed result explicates that when the larger halogen is substituted for the smaller one, the cell volume and lattice parameter of CsCdX 3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) increase. The obtained mechanical characteristics evidence that CsCdX 3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) compounds are ductile, and ductility increases with the replacement of Cl with Br and I, respectively, and CsCdI 3 exhibits the highest amount of ductility. Indirect bandgap semiconductor to metallic transition is found in the energy band diagrams when I occupies the X site of CsCdX 3 instead of Cl and Br. Furthermore, the absorption coefficient, the dielectric constant, conductivity, and refractive index demonstrate that when Cl is replaced by I and Br, redshift occurs in the optical spectra. Among the compounds, the reflectivity of CsCdI 3 is the highest in the IR region, making CsCdI 3 suitable as an IR reflector. But in the UV region, CsCdCl 3 could be suitable as a UV reflector.",

The multilayer architecture is the key feature for the presence of electronic topological transitions where the Fermi surface of one of the subbands changes dimensionality. The superlattice misfit strain between the active and spacer layers is shown to be a key variable to drive the system to the highest critical temperature that occurs at a particular point of the 3D phase diagram () where is the charge transfer or doping. The plots of as a function of misfit strain at constant charge transfer in cuprates show a first-order quantum critical phase transition where an itinerant striped magnetic phase competes with superconductivity in the proximity of a structural phase transition, that is, associated with an electronic topological transition.

According to ideas of the plane-wave method the system dynamics is described in terms of plane waves (a superposition of a number of plane waves), which are continuous functions and propagate throughout the medium. Since in magnonic crystals the sought-for superposition of plane waves represents the dynamic magnetization, the magnetic boundary conditions on the interfaces between constituent materials should be inherent in the Landau-Lifshitz equations. In this paper we present the derivation of the two expressions for the exchange field known from the literature. We start from the Heisenberg model and use a linear approximation and take into account the spacial dependence of saturation magnetization and exchange constant present in magnetic composites. We discuss the magnetic boundary conditions included in the presented formulations of the exchange field and elucidate their effect on spin-wave modes and their spectra in one- and two-dimensional planar magnonic crystals from plane-wave calculations.",

The detection of VOCs in the air may rely on each of the following effects sequentially observed one after the other: (i) slight changes in orientation and order parameter of liquid crystal, (ii) formation of bubbles on the top of the liquid crystalline droplet, and (iii) complete isotropisation of the liquid crystal.

    "abstract": "Metasurfaces, kinds of planar ultrathin metamaterials, are able to modify the polarization, phase, and amplitude of physical fields of optical light by designed periodic subwavelength structures, attracting great interest in recent years. Based on the different type of the material, optical metasurfaces can be separated in two categories by the materials: one is metal and the other is dielectric. Metal metasurfaces rely on the surface plasma oscillations of subwavelength metal particles. Nevertheless, the loss caused by the metal structures has been a trouble, especially for devices working in transmit modes. The dielectric metasurfaces are based on the Faraday-Tyndall scattering of high-index dielectric light scattering particles. By reasonably designing the relevant parameters of the unit structure such as the size, direction, and shape, different functions of metasurfaces can realize and bring a wide range of applications. This article focuses on the metasurface concepts such as anomalous reflections and refractions and the working principle of different types of metasurfaces. Here, we briefly review the progress in developing optical over past few years and look into the near future.",

To control the surface wettability, modification on the physical surface structures has been a useful method. In this paper, we reported the controlling physical surface structure of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) films by different film-forming methods, spin-coating, bar-coating, and electrospinning. The wettability of these PVB films was examined, and the surface morphologies and roughness were investigated. The results indicated that coating PVB films were hydrophilic, while electrospun films were hydrophobic. The physical surface structure was the key role on the interesting transition of their surface wettability. Theoretical analyses on these results found that the coating PVB films showed different mechanism with electrospun ones. These results may help to find the way to control the PVB film surface wettability and then guide for applications.",

We find that the electron-phonon interaction can still have important signatures, even if many anomalies appear, and the overall effect is far from conventional. In particular in the paramagnetic phase the effects of phonons are much reduced in the low-energy properties, while the high-energy physics can be strongly affected by phonons. Moreover, the electron-phonon interaction can still give rise to important effects, like phase separation and charge-ordering, and it assumes a predominance of forward scattering even if the bare interaction is assumed to be local (momentum independent). Antiferromagnetic correlations reduce the screening effects due to electron-electron interactions and revive the electron-phonon effects.",

Global properties of , such as number and positions of peaks, are extracted by combining optics, neutron scattering, ARPES and tunnelling measurements. These methods give evidence for strong electron-phonon interaction (EPI) with in cuprates near optimal doping. We clarify how these results are in favor of the modified Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) theory for HTSC cuprates near optimal doping. In Section 2 we discuss theoretical ingredients—such as strong EPI, strong correlations—which are necessary to explain the mechanism of d-wave pairing in optimally doped cuprates. These comprise the ME theory for EPI in strongly correlated systems which give rise to the forward scattering peak. The latter is supported by the long-range part of EPI due to the weakly screened Madelung interaction in the ionic-metallic structure of layered HTSC cuprates. In this approach EPI is responsible for the strength of pairing while the residual Coulomb interaction and spin fluctuations trigger the d-wave pairing.",

Through the phenomenological Landau theory, developed on the basis of the calculations by the density functional theory (DFT) and the experimental results, we quantify the strength of the spin-lattice interaction as it relates to the Stoner criterion for the onset of magnetism. We suggest that the coupling between electrons and phonons through the spin channel may be sufficiently strong to be an important part of the superconductivity mechanism in Fe pnictides.",

In particular it is discussed how the use of IXS has improved our understanding of viscoelastic properties of water at THz frequencies. This specifically involves some solid-like features such as the onset of shear wave propagation, a sound velocity surprisingly similar to the one of ice, and an anomalously low sound absorption coefficient. All these properties can be explained by assuming the coupling of THz density fluctuations with a structural relaxation process connected to the breaking and forming of hydrogen bonds (HBs). This review also includes more recent IXS results demonstrating that, upon approaching supercritical conditions, relaxation phenomena in water gradually lose their structural character becoming essentially collisional in character. Furthermore, GHz spectroscopy results on supercooled water, suggesting the occurrence of a structural arrest, are discussed. An overview of the new opportunities offered by next generation IXS spectrometers finally concludes this review.",

This type of device driving can be altered by minor amounts of ions typically present in liquid crystal materials. Therefore, it is very important to understand how nanodopants can affect ions in liquid crystals. In this paper, a recently developed model of contaminated nanoparticles is applied to existing experimental data. The presented analysis unambiguously indicates that, in general, nanomaterials in liquid crystals can behave as a source of ions or as ion traps.

The highest values obtained were after the fifth and final reduction cycle, yielding a stiffness of 22.4 N/m, a hardness of 0.55 GPa, and a reduced Young’s modulus of 1.62 GPa as compared to a stiffness of 22.8 N/m, a hardness of 0.58 GPa, and a reduced Young’s modulus of 1.84 GPa for a commercially purchased graphene film made by CVD. This data was then compared to the expected values of pristine single layer graphene. Furthermore, two RC circuits were built, one using a parallel plate capacitors made of light scribed graphene on a kapton substrate (LSGC) and a second one using a CVD deposited graphene on aluminum (CVDGC). Their RC time constants and surface charge densities were compared.",

To improve the value of the band gap, the exchange correlation potential is also approximated with Hubbard correction (GGA + U). The equilibrium state properties such as lattice parameters, unit cell volume, bulk modulus, and its derivative were calculated and are in good agreement with the existing data. The mechanical properties such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young’s modulus, and elastic anisotropy were determined from the obtained elastic constants. The ratio of bulk modulus to shear modulus confirms that the orthorhombic phase of <h:math xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <h:msub> <h:mrow> <h:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">C</h:mi> <h:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</h:mi> <h:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">H</h:mi> <h:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">f</h:mi> <h:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</h:mi> </h:mrow> <h:mrow> <h:mn>3</h:mn> </h:mrow> </h:msub> </h:math> is a ductile material.

The thermodynamic parameters such as free energy, entropy, and heat capacity were examined with variations in temperature. Finally, the absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, energy loss function, reflectivity, and refractive index are discussed in detail in the spectral range 0–1.6 Ry (21.77 eV). The polarizations along (100), (010), and (001) directions significantly show different optical responses.",

In these EHBLs, the interlayer interaction can be stronger than the intralayer interactions. Theoretical works have indicated the possibility of a very rich phase diagram in EHBLs consisting of excitonic superfluid phases, charge density waves, and Wigner crystals. Experiments have revealed that the Coulomb drag on the hole layer shows strong nonmonotonic deviations from a behaviour expected for Fermi-liquids at low temperatures. Simultaneously, an unexpected insulating behaviour in the single-layer resistances (at a highly “metallic” regime with ) also appears in both layers despite electron mobilities of above and hole mobilities over . Experimental data also indicates that the point of equal densities () is not special.",

    "abstract": "The lifetime of optical components is determined by the combination of laser-induced damage initiation probability and damage propagation rate during subsequent laser shots. This paper reviews both theoretical and experimental investigations on laser-induced damage initiation and growth at the surface of optics. The damage mechanism is generally considered as thermal absorption and electron avalanche, which play dominant roles for the different laser pulse durations. The typical damage morphology in the surface of components observed in experiments is also closely related to the damage mechanism. The damage crater in thermal absorption process, which can be estimated by thermal diffusion model, is typical distortion, melting, and ablation debris often with an elevated rim caused by melted material flow and resolidification. However, damage initiated by electron avalanche is often accompanied by generation of plasma, crush, and fracture, which can be explained by thermal explosion model. Damage growth at rear surface of components is extremely severe which can be explained by several models, such as fireball growth, impact crater, brittle fracture, and electric field enhancement. All the physical effects are not independent but mutually coupling. Developing theoretical models of multiphysics coupling are an important trend for future theoretical research. Meanwhile, more attention should be paid to integrated analysis both in theory and experiment.",

The simulated Raman spectra together with literature data support interpretation and refinement of experimental spectra which reveal components arising from titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) and amorphous boron carbide (B 4 C) impurity phases as well as graphitic carbon. These contaminations are the by-products of synthesis, consolidation, and sintering aids employed to fabricate powder and bulk titanium diboride.",

The enhancement in PL intensity has been attributed to the increased surface area from GNPs, which results in increased emissions due to the increased scattering of excitation. The subsequent decay of PL intensity with doping more amounts of GNPs in liquid crystals 5CB was due to the aggregation of the GNPs, which resulted in decayed emissions due to the decay of the scattering of excitation. The concentration and the size of GNPs, as well as the orientation of the LCs’ director, with respect to the excitation, which depend on the intensity of the PL, were also investigated.",

In this paper, we studied the evaporation and pattern formation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) colloid droplets on smooth substrate and rough substrates with different roughness. We found that the evaporation of droplets shows remarkable coffee-ring effect on smooth substrate and that the cross-section of the ring is wedge-shaped with its thickness decreasing from the edge to the center. However, with increasing roughness, the effect strengthened, with the section of the coffee-ring changing from wedge- to hill-shaped. The contact angle decreased with increasing roughness, leading to an increase in evaporation rate. Moreover, wicking led to additional evaporation, which also enhanced capillary flow, moving more particles to the edge. In addition, the rough structure of the substrate inhibited the back-flow of the capillary flow, preventing the particles’ move to the center. The formation of radial wrinkles on the edge also led to particle retention, preventing them from moving to the center. All these factors contribute to the decreased width and increased height of the coffee-ring pattern after evaporation on rough surfaces. It is an effective method to regulate the deposition pattern of evaporating droplet by changing the substrate roughness.",

Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) doped by different concentrations up to 5 wt.% of nanosized Fe2O3 have been prepared (ZIF-8/Fe2O3). The effect of doping ratio 1, 3, and 5 wt.% on the structural and electrochemical properties of ZIF-8/Fe2O3 has been investigated. The structural characterization has been carried out using TGA, BET, XRD, and FTIR. The XRD analysis revealed that the crystalline size of our sample increased by approximately 16% as a result of doping ZIF-8 with 5 wt.% of Fe2O3. The structural analysis of the doped samples revealed that the material exhibited enhanced thermal stability and porosity, with an increase of approximately 105 m2/g. The introduction of doped nanometal oxides improved the capacitance value of ZIF-8 by significantly increasing its surface area. Additionally, the electron transport efficiency within ZIF-8/5 wt.% Fe2O3/electrode is increased. The Nyquist plot decreases as the doping of Fe2O3 increases. This indicates a decrease in the charge transfer resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which is desired in applications such as batteries, fuel cells, or electrochemical sensors where faster electron transfer is needed for improved performance.",

In the present ferrite system, the area ratio of Fe 3+ ions at the A- and B-sites determined from the spectral analysis of Mössbauer spectra gives evidence that Al 3+ ions replace iron ions at B-sites. This change in the site preference reflects an abrupt change in magnetic hyperfine fields at A- and B-sites as aluminum concentration increases, which has been explained on the basis of supertransferred hyperfine field. On the basis of estimated cation distribution, it is concluded that aluminum doped manganese ferrites exhibit a 55% normal spinel structure.",

The presence of two phases in composites was confirmed by XRD technique. The variations of dielectric constant () with frequency in the range of 100 kHz–1 MHz at room temperature and also with temperature at three different frequencies (50 kHz, 100 kHz, and 500 kHz) were studied. Detailed studies on the dielectric properties were done confirming that the magnetoelectric interaction between the constituent phases may result in various anomalies in the dielectric behaviour of the composites. It is proposed that interfaces play an important role in the dielectric properties, causing space charge effects and Maxwell-Wagner relaxation, particularly at low frequencies and high temperatures. The piezoelectric d 33 constant was studied at room temperature, and the d 33 constant value decreased with ferrite content. Magnetic properties like B-H loops traces were studied to understand the saturation magnetic ( M s ) and magnetic moment () of the present particulate composites. The magnetoelectric (ME) output was measured by varying dc bias magnetic field. A large ME output signal of 2780 mV/cm Oe was observed in the composite having 50% ferrite.

Longitudinal modulus showed a sharp minimum, and internal friction exhibits a sharp peak at ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition.

This paper deals with the technological aspects of the spinodal processes by giving a brief account of the theory and to correlate the two phenomena termed as spinodal dewetting of thin nanofilms and surface-directed phase separation. The MC simulation micrographs at early stage of spinodal dewetting of a (linear) polymer film confined between two hard walls (using FENE potential between the beads on same chain and Morse potential between inter and intra chain beads) show similarities with surface-directed phase separation (using metropolis algorithm) in creation of holes. The spinodal dewetting is also criticized on the basis of global minimization of free energy emerging from dipole-quadrupole interactions. A novel molecular scale-driving mechanism coming from asymmetric interface formation in spinodal processes is also proposed. It can be believed that the modeling done with the films under confinement of two walls works as a classical mathematical ansatz to the dipole-quadrupole interaction coming from quantum origins and giving rise to lateral interactions in the process reflecting a colossal behavior in thin nano films though weak in nature.",

It is shown that the initial shear modulus of MREs increases by 56% with a 20% volume fraction of particles compared to that of pure rubber. Then by introducing the Maxwell stress tensor, a two-dimensional plane stress RVE for the MRE is developed in COMSOL Multiphysics to study its response under a magnetic field. The influences of magnetic field intensity, radius of particles, and distance between two adjacent particles on the macroscopic mechanical properties of MRE are also investigated. The results show that the shear modulus increases with the increase of the applied magnetic field intensity and the radius of particles and the decrease of the distance between two adjacent particles in a chain.

    "abstract": "Nanoporous tin oxide layers were obtained on various Sn substrates including high- and low-purity foils and wire by one-step anodic oxidation carried out in a 0.3 M oxalic acid electrolyte at various anodizing potentials. In general, amorphous oxide layers with the atomic ratio of Sn : O (1 : 1) were grown during anodization, and a typical structure of the as-obtained film consists of the “outer” layer with less regular, interconnetted pores and the “inner” layer with much more uniform and regular channels formed as a result of vigorous gas evolution. It was found that the use of electrochemical cell with the sample placed horizontally on the metallic support and stabilized by the Teflon cover, instead of the typical two-electrode system with vertically arranged electrodes, can affect the morphology of as-obtained layers and allows fabrication of nanoporous oxides even at anodizing potentials up to 11 V. An average pore diameter in the “outer” oxide layer increases with increasing anodizing potential, and no significant effect of substrate purity on the structure of anodic film was proved, except better uniformity of the oxides grown on high-purity Sn. A strong linear relationship between the average steady-state current density and anodizing potential was also observed.",

To assure the accuracy of calculation, the convergence test of total energy with respect to energy cutoff and k -point sampling is performed. The relaxed atomic position for the CdS in zb and wz structure is obtained by using total energy and force minimization method following the Hellmann–Feynman approach. The structural optimization and electronic band structure properties of CdS are investigated. Analysis of the results shows that LDA and GGA underestimate the bandgap due to their poor approximation of exchange-correlation functional. However, the Hubbard correction to GGA and the hybrid functional approximation give a good bandgap value which is comparable to the experimental result. Moreover, the optical properties such as real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, the absorption coefficient, and the energy loss function of CdS are determined.",

It has been shown that both monoclinic CuO and cubic Cu 2 O phases were grown on the copper surface with NW diameters of almost 200 nm for all samples. While NWs were shown to be dense for low heating rates, they end up being broken for quick heating. The underlying growth mechanism was described basing on a detailed comprehensive study, and the effect of the heating rate was explained by considering the thermal shock effect and in-plane tensile stresses on curved surfaces. This study contributes to the research for suitable methods for the use of recyclable metals in technological applications. In particular, copper oxide NWs were deposited, for the first time, on FTO/glass substrates, and the optical characterization revealed that this method is a promising way to improve the surface contact for solar cells and catalytic applications.",

The equilibrium state properties such as lattice parameters, unit cell volume, bulk modulus, and its derivative are determined. The band gap values of monolayer 2H-WTe2 are investigated for unstrained, 2% biaxial compression, and biaxial tensile stress using GGA, respectively. The obtained band gap values of 2H-WTe2 with respect to GGA are 1.043, 1.1487, and 0.9439 eV for unstrained, biaxial compression, and tensile strain, respectively. Moreover, the band gap values determined using Hubbard correction (GGA + U) are 1.1089 eV (unstrained), 1.2332 eV (2% biaxial compression), and 0.9945 eV (2% biaxial tensile stress), respectively. The band gap value obtained using Hubbard correction predicts the experimental value more precisely. The projected density of state shows W (3d) orbital is more dominant both in the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum. Moreover, a small amount of tensile or compressive strain is used to tune the band gap of the monolayer without affecting its direct band gap nature. In addition to this, the phonon dispersion and optical properties are discussed for tensile strain, unstrained, and compressive strain, respectively.",

Later several experimental features led to theoretical models based on strong electronic correlations. The high- superconductors cuprates are quasi-bidimensional (2D) and thus lead to the existence of Van Hove singularities (VHs) in the band structure, that is, a peak in the electronic density of states. The presence of VHs near the Fermi-level in the cuprates is now well established. In this context we show that many physical properties of these materials can be explained using electron-phonon interaction, in particular the high critical temperature , the anomalous isotope effect, the superconducting gap and its anisotropy, and the marginal Fermi-liquid properties. These compounds present a topological transition for a critical hole doping hole per plane.",

The added complexity of the cuprates with potentially numerous competing phases including charge, spin, orbital, and lattice ordering, makes teasing out any unique phenomena challenging. In this review, we present our work using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to explore the role of the lattice and its effect on the valence band electronic structure in the cuprates. We provide an introduction to the ARPES technique and its unique ability to the probe the effect of bosonic renormalization (or \"kink\") on the near-E$_F$ band structure. Our survey begins with the establishment of the ubiquitous nodal cuprate kink leading to the way isotope substitution has shed a critical new perspective on the role and strength of electron-phonon coupling. We continue with recently published work on the connection between the phonon dispersion as seen with inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) and the location of the kink as observed by ARPES near the nodal point. Finally, we present very recent and ongoing ARPES work examining how induced strain through chemical pressure provides a potentially promising avenue for understanding the broader role of the lattice to the superconducting phase and larger cuprate phase diagram.",

The parameters characterizing the drift of the oxygen vacancies in YSZ such as the ion drift activation energy, mobile ion concentration, and the drift mobility have been determined in the temperature range 300–500 K. These data are important for deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of the electroforming and resistive switching in the YSZ-based MOM and MOS stacks, which are promising for the Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) and other memristor device applications.",

It usually has an aperture for concentrated sunlight coming in, and the heat loss is unavoidable because of this aperture. Generally, in order to improve the thermal efficiency, a layer of coating having high absorptivity for sunlight would be covered on the surface of the absorber tubes inside the cavity receiver. As a result, it is necessary to investigate the effects of the emissivity of absorber tubes on the thermal performance of the receiver. In the present work, the thermal performances of the receiver with different absorber emissivity were numerically simulated. The results showed that the thermal efficiency increases and the total heat loss decreases with increasing emissivity of absorber tubes. However, the thermal efficiency increases by only 1.6% when the emissivity of tubes varies from 0.2 to 0.8. Therefore, the change of absorber emissivity has slight effect on the thermal performance of the receiver. The reason for variation tendency of performance curves was also carefully analyzed. It was found that the temperature reduction of the cavity walls causes the decrease of the radiative heat loss and the convective heat loss.",

The same is visible from the surface morphology which shows the formation of hexagonal structure for higher Fe concentration. The topography shows gradual variation with Fe incorporation. The optical energy band gap obtained from the transmittance spectrum decreases from 3.42 to 3.06 eV with increase in Fe concentration indicating the red shift and this trend is consistent with the earlier experimental results.

Because of the enhancement of operating flux and the expansion of laser driver scale, the problem of contamination seriously influences their construction period and operation life. During irradiation by intense laser beams, the contaminants on the metallic surface of beam tubes can be transmitted to the optical surfaces and lead to damage of optical components. For the high-power solid-state laser facilities, contamination control focuses on the slab amplifiers, spatial filters, and final-optical assemblies. In this paper, an effective solution to control contaminations including the whole process of the laser driver is put forward to provide the safe operation of laser facilities, and the detailed technical methods of contamination control such as washing, cleanliness metrology, and cleanliness protecting are also introduced to reduce the probability of laser-induced damage of optics. The experimental results show that the cleanliness level of SG-III laser facility is much better to ensure that the laser facility can safely operate at high energy flux.",

    "abstract": "Thermal oxidation of silicon belongs to the most decisive steps in microelectronic fabrication because it allows creating electrically insulating areas which enclose electrically conductive devices and device areas, respectively. Deal and Grove developed the first model (DG-model) for the thermal oxidation of silicon describing the oxide thickness versus oxidation time relationship with very good agreement for oxide thicknesses of more than 23 nm. Their approach named as general relationship is the basis of many similar investigations. However, measurement results show that the DG-model does not apply to very thin oxides in the range of a few nm. Additionally, it is inherently not self-consistent. The aim of this paper is to develop a self-consistent model that is based on the continuity equation instead of Fick’s law as the DG-model is. As literature data show, the relationship between silicon oxide thickness and oxidation time is governed—down to oxide thicknesses of just a few nm—by a power-of-time law. Given by the time-independent surface concentration of oxidants at the oxide surface, Fickian diffusion seems to be neglectable for oxidant migration. The oxidant flux has been revealed to be carried by non-Fickian flux processes depending on sites being able to lodge dopants (oxidants), the so-called DOCC-sites, as well as on the dopant jump rate.",

An analysis is made of the dependence of the energy of electrons and holes on the internal and external radii, and it is determined that the energy of electrons and holes in cylindrical layers with a constant thickness weakly depends on the internal radius.

By the structural analysis, we found that nondefects geometry is more compact than defects geometries. To investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of HS-G/MoS2 and C sites vacancy defects in HS-G/MoS2 materials, we have studied band structure, density of states (DOS), and partial density of states (PDOS). By analyzing the results, we found that HS-G/MoS2 is metallic in nature but C sites vacancy defects in HS-G/MoS2 materials have a certain energy bandgap. Also, from the band structure calculations, we found that Fermi energy level shifted towards the conduction band in vacancy defects geometries which reveals that the defected heterostructure is n-type Schottky contacts. From DOS and PDOS analysis, we obtained that the nonmagnetic HS-G/MoS2 material changes to magnetic materials due to the presence of C sites vacancy defects. Right 1C atom vacancy defects (R-1C), left 1C atom vacancy defects (L-1C), centre 1C atom vacancy defects (C-1C), and 2C (1C right and 1C centre) atom vacancy defects in HS-G/MoS2 materials have magnetic moments of −0.75 µB/cell, −0.75 µB/cell, −0.12 µB/cell, and +0.39 µB/cell, respectively.

The band gap energy decreased gradually with the increase of concentration of lanthanum. The micrographs observed that the material is basically made up of some rings or rods such as particles in pure La-Ma in barium hexaferrite.

    "abstract": "The stannite structured ZnAg2SnS4 was developed from its parent composition ZnAg2GeS4, which is considered to be an excellent photocatalytic material, as the demands for photocatalytic effect on organic and waste water treatment have been increasing around the globe. First and foremost, the geometry optimization was performed by density functional theory (DFT) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)-ballpark figured as the successful candidate for computational screening containing heavy metal complexes. The structural geometry parameters were determined along with the electronic band structure, density of state (DOS), partial density of state (PDOS), Mulliken charge population, elastic constant, and optical characteristics. When the Ge (ZnAg2GeS4) atom has been swapped out by a Sn (ZnAg2SnS4) atom, the changes in band gap is noticeable, which rises from 0.94 eV to 1.15 eV with the same geometry and surface area. But, after 7% Fe doping, it has decreased to 0.32 eV. The PDOS demonstrates that the production of hydrogen for photocatalytic influence on wastewater treatment is dependent on the Fe atom's ability to induce and boost the electron density in both the conduction band and the valence band. The study of the elastic constant and mechanical constant revealed that these crystals are extremely stable in any environment. The dielectric constant and optical absorptions illustrate the superior evidence for photocatalytic activity. To sum up, it could be said that after doping of Fe, the elastic constant and mechanical constant show all universal anisotropic index crystals and ZnAg2Sn0.93Fe0.07S4 can absorb a variety of UV radiation, which raises the possibility that it could function as a photocatalyst.",

A slow creep regime, where the motion is controlled by wall pinning and thermal activation, and a flow regime with linear variation of the DW velocity, are observed. In asymmetric stacks, where the Rashba spin-orbit field stabilizes the domain wall against turbulent transformations, the steady linear regime is extended to higher currents, leading to higher velocities than in single-layer or symmetric stacks. The pinning and depinning at and from a local constriction were also studied. The results indicate that engineering pinning sites in these strips provide an efficient pathway to achieve both high stability against thermal fluctuations and low-current depinning avoiding Joule heating. Finally, the current-driven dynamics of a pinned domain wall is examined, and both the direct and the alternating contributions to the induced voltage signal induced are characterized. It was confirmed that the direct contribution to the voltage signal can be linearly enhanced with the number of pinned walls, an observation which could be useful to develop domain-wall-based nano-oscillators.",

Details of the origin of the energy reduction in cross-tie/vortex walls as compared to Néel walls are also examined, and canting inside cross-tie and vortex structures in films thicker than 1<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ℓ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ex</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>is explained.",

In this paper we summarize recent theoretical developments related to the Fourier analysis of the cross-correlation functions. Results of our simulations demonstrate the application of XCCA to two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) disordered ensembles of particles. We show that the structure of a single particle can be recovered using X-ray data collected from a 2D disordered system of identical particles. We also demonstrate that valuable structural information about the local structure of 3D systems, inaccessible from a standard small-angle X-ray scattering experiment, can be resolved using XCCA.",

    "abstract": "Geometrically frustrated conducting magnets display extraordinarily large anomalous Hall effects (AHEs) that could be used to realise materials required for the emerging field of spintronics. While the intrinsic Berry phase developed in collinear ferromagnets is well explained through the effects of spin-orbit interactions within the Karplus and Luttinger model, its origins in frustrated magnets are not. The direct space mechanism based on spin chirality that was originally applied to the pyrochlore Nd 2 Mo 2 O 7 appears unsatisfactory. Recently, an orbital description based on the Aharonov-Bohm effect has been proposed and applied to both the ferromagnetic pyrochlores Nd 2 Mo 2 O 7 and Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 ; the first of which features long-ranged magnetic order while the latter is a chiral spin liquid. Two further examples of geometrically frustrated conducting magnets are presented in this paper—the kagome-like Fe 3 Sn 2 and the triangular PdCrO 2 . These possess very different electronic structures to the 3-dimensional heavy-metal pyrochlores and provide new opportunities to explore the different origins of the AHE. This paper summarises the experimental findings in these materials in an attempt to unite the conflicting theoretical arguments.",

The results indicate that mechanical couplings between stacked cylinders are found to yield pronounced suppression of the cross-sectional ovalization. Numerical computations have been performed to measure the degree of suppression in a quantitative manner and to explore how it is affected by the variations in the bending curvature, the number of stacked cylinders, and the interlayer coupling strength.",

The study on capillary pressure-water saturation curves has been conducted through experimentation and theoretical models. The results show that as the pressure increases up to 12 MPa, (1) capillary pressure-water saturation curves shift to lower values at given water saturation, (2) after the drainage process, residual water saturation decreases, and (3) after the imbibition process, capillary CO 2 trapping increases. Capillary pressure-water saturation curves above 12 MPa appear to be similar because of relatively constant contact angle and interfacial tension. Also, as brine salinity increases from 1 M to 3 M NaCl, (1) capillary pressure-water saturation curves shift to lower capillary pressure, (2) residual water saturation decreases, and (3) capillary CO 2 trapping increases. The results show that pressure and brine salinity have an influence on the capillary pressure-water saturation curves. Also, the scaled capillary CO 2 entry pressure considering contact angle and interfacial tension is inconsistent with atmospheric conditions due to the lack of wettability information. Better exploration of wettability alteration is required to predict capillary pressure-water saturation curves at various conditions that are relevant to geological CO 2 sequestration.",

The maximum adsorption capacity calculated from Langmuir model was high up to 45.5 mg/g at 298 K (pH = 7.0) and the removal efficiency was greater than 80%. In order to investigate the mechanism of fluoride removal, various adsorption isotherms such as Langmuir and Freundlich were fitted. The experimental data revealed that the Langmuir isotherm gave a more satisfactory fit for fluoride removal. Finally, the tested results of ground water samples from three places, Yuefang, Jiangji, and Sanyi which exhibited high removal efficiency, also demonstrate the potential utility of the Ce-bpdc as an effective adsorbent.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the interactions between H atoms and the (100), (110), and (111) surfaces of platinum have been investigated by using the London-Eyring-Polanyi-Sato (LEPS) potential function. The adsorption zones (sites) and LEPS energy values of these sites have been determined theoretically. In addition, the potential-energy surfaces for each Pt surface have been obtained in detail. Further, the adsorption sites on the surface, scattering from the surface, diffusion paths on the surface, and transition regions to the subsurface, have been determined and the differences have been examined in detail among the surfaces. From these results, it is found that an H atom has the lowest binding energy at the hollow sites on the Pt (100) and Pt (111) surfaces and that it has the lowest binding energy at the long-bridge sites on the Pt (110) surface. It has also been determined that the hollow sites on the three surfaces are the regions through which H atoms can penetrate into the subsurface. In addition, it has also been found that, for each of the three Pt surfaces, the diffusion of an H atom across the surface may follow a bridge-hollow-bridge pathway. These results are in agreement with previous experimental and theoretical results. Besides, the adsorption and diffusion manners of hydrogen atoms on each of the Pt surfaces have been analyzed deeply.",

    "abstract": "Aside from the terrestrial magnetic field that is generated from the earth core, power transmission, and distribution lines, transformers and other equipment do produce a certain amount of magnetic field that could interfere with the performance of photovoltaic modules. This study conducted an experiment and investigated the performance of a silicon photovoltaic module subjected to a magnetic field. The current-voltage and power-voltage characteristics were plotted in the same axis system and allowed us to find, as a function of the magnetic field, the electrical parameters of the photovoltaic module such as maximum electric power, fill factor, conversion efficiency, and charge resistance at the maximum power point. These electrical parameters were then used to calculate the series and shunt resistances of the equivalent circuit of the photovoltaic module. The results have shown that the efficiency of a solar module is affected by the presence of magnetic fields. However, the magnitude of ambient magnetic field generated by power transmissions lines and other equipment is extremely low (in the order of 10 −2 mT or less) as compared to the values of the magnetic field used in this study. That made it difficult to conclude as to the impact of such field on solar photovoltaic installations.",

    "abstract": "Even photosynthesis—the most basic natural phenomenon underlying life on Earth—involves the nontrivial processing of excitations at the pico- and femtosecond scales during light-harvesting. The desire to understand such natural phenomena, as well as interpret the output from ultrafast experimental probes, creates an urgent need for accurate quantitative theories of open quantum systems. However it is unclear how best to generalize the well-established assumptions of an isolated system, particularly under nonequilibrium conditions. Here we compare two popular approaches: a description in terms of a direct product of the states of each individual system (i.e., a local approach) versus the use of new states resulting from diagonalizing the whole Hamiltonian (i.e., a global approach). The main difference lies in finding suitable operators to derive the Lindbladian and hence the master equation. We show that their equivalence fails when the system is open, in particular under the experimentally ubiquitous condition of a temperature gradient. By solving for the steady state populations and calculating the heat flux as a test observable, we uncover stark differences between the formulations. This divergence highlights the need to establish rigorous ranges of applicability for such methods in modeling nanoscale transfer phenomena—including during the light-harvesting process in photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "With the development trend of wireless and broadband in the communication link and even the whole information industry, the demand of high-frequency microwave bandwidth has been increasing. The RoF network system solves the problem of spectrum congestion in low-frequency band by providing an effective technology for the distribution of high-frequency microwave signals over optical fiber links. However, the traditional mm-wave generation technique is limited by the bandwidth of electronic devices. It is difficult to generate high-frequency and low-phase noise mm-wave signals with pure electrical components. The mm-wave communication technology based on photon assisted can overcome the bandwidth bottleneck of electronic devices and provide the potential for developing the low-cost infrastructure demand of broadband mobile services. This paper will briefly explain the characteristics of the RoF network system and the advantages of high-frequency mm-wave. Then we, respectively, introduce the modulation schemes of RoF mm-wave generation based on photon assisted including directly modulated laser (DML), external modulation, and optical heterodyne. The review mainly focuses on a variety of different mm-wave generation technologies including multifrequency vector mm-wave. Furthermore, we list several approaches to realize the large capacity data transmission techniques and describe the digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm flow in the receiver. In the end, we summarize the RoF network system and look forward to the future.",

    "abstract": "The jellium model is commonly used in condensed matter physics to study the properties of a two-dimensional electron gas system. Within this approximation, one assumes that electrons move in the presence of a neutralizing background consisting of uniformly spread positive charge. When properties of bulk systems (of infinite size) are studied, shape of the jellium domain is irrelevant. However, the same cannot be said when one is dealing with finite systems of electrons confined in a finite two-dimensional region of space. In such a case, geometry and shape of the jellium background play a role on the overall properties of the system. In this work, we assume that the region where the electrons are confined is represented by a jellium background charge with an elliptical shape. It is shown that, in this case, the Coulomb self-energy of the elliptically shaped region can be exactly calculated in closed analytical form by using suitable mathematical transformations. The results obtained reveal the external influence of geometry/shape on the properties of two-dimensional systems of few electrons confined to a small finite region of space.",

The adsorption energies, adsorption configurations, Mulliken charge population, surface work functions, and density of states (DOS) of the most stable doped borophene/gas-molecule configurations were calculated, and the interaction mechanisms between the gas molecules and the doped borophene were further analyzed. The results indicated that most of the gas molecules exhibited strong chemisorption at the VB site (the center of valley bottom B–B bond) of the doped borophene (compared to pristine borophene). Electronic property analysis of the C-doped borophene/CO2 and the NO2 adsorption system revealed that there were numerous charge transfers from the C-doped borophene to the CO2 and NO2 molecules. This indicated that C-doped borophene was an electron donor, and the CO2 and NO2 molecules served as electron acceptors. In contrast to variations in the adsorption energies, electronic properties, and surface work functions of the different gas, C-, N-, and O-doped borophene adsorption systems, we concluded that the C-, N-, and O-doped borophene materials will improve the sensitivity of CO, CO2, and NO2 molecule; this improvement of adsorption properties indicated that C-, N-, and O-doped borophene materials are excellent candidates for surface work functions transistor to detect gas molecules.",

    "abstract": "The structural, dynamical, and thermodynamic properties of zinc‐blende (ZB) mercury selenide (HgSe) and cadmium selenide (CdSe) were systematically explored using an ab initio pseudopotential approach based on the density functional theory (DFT). The optimized lattice constants are in excellent agreement with the available experimental and theoretical results. The electronic properties show semiconducting behavior with a direct bandgap of 0 and 0.36 eV for HgSe and CdSe, respectively. Also, using the linear response approach, the detailed vibration properties of HgSe and CdSe are obtained. According to the calculated phonon dispersion, it is concluded that HgSe and CdSe are dynamically stable in the ground state; several peculiarities in the dispersion curves of these materials are generally similar, but the zone‐boundary frequencies and zone‐center optical frequencies of HgSe are lower than those of CdSe. The phonon frequencies at the high‐symmetry points Γ , X , and L for HgSe and CdSe are in good agreement with the other theoretical reported. On the other hand, the dielectric properties are investigated and discussed. The results show that the dielectric tensor is diagonal, and the Born effective charge tensor is also isotropic. Finally, based on the lattice dynamical properties, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of both compounds, such as Helmholtz free energy F , internal energy E , entropy S , and specific heat C v . The results show that HgSe and CdSe exhibit similar but slightly different behaviors in terms of its thermodynamic properties, which is expected because the atoms Hg and Cd are in the same group and exhibit a different atom mass. Most of the results presented in this study are novel and should provide a useful reference for future studies.",

    "abstract": "iPP/Talc composites were produced, with different methods of filler addition in iPP matrix. Two different grades of Talc were used for comparison. The tensile tests results showed that talc particles promoted an improvement in composite rigidity, indicating the reinforcing effect of the talc particles in the iPP matrix. However, PP/talc-based composites that were prepared from a masterbatch and with talc grade with smaller particle size showed a better efficiency on dispersion/distribution of particle filler on the thermoplastic matrix, resulting in an improvement in Young’s modulus property, even with higher filler contents. SEM analyses evaluated the composite morphologies and different mathematical models were used as a tool on prediction of mechanical behaviour of the materials. It was observed that the results of Young’s modulus of the composites can be adjusted by different models, depending on the talc characteristics and the mixing procedure used.",

The effective Young modulus of a surface depends on the interfacial tension, equilibrium contact angle, radius of colloidal particles, and their surface density. For the nanometrically scaled particles the line tension becomes essential and has an influence on the effective Young modulus.",

In order to further improve the photocatalytic activity, Pt nanoparticles were loaded uniformly with the average size of 3-4 nm on TiO 2 porous films by the photoreduction method. It was found that the loading of Pt expanded the light absorption ability of the porous film and improved the transformation efficiency of CO 2 to methane.

With this foundation, experimental observations of normal stress differences in some suspensions and colloidal systems are surveyed, along with constitutive models that allow for normal stress differences to arise prior to yielding. Yield stresses are a hallmark of attractive colloidal systems and vital in their processing. In contrast, little attention has been given to the role of normal stress differences in these systems. The presence or absence of normal stress differences necessarily affects the isotropy of the normal stress field through the solid particulate phase (treated as a continuum), in turn affecting estimation of yield stress. Given the importance of yield stresses in dealing with practical industrial problems, and in understanding fundamental behaviours, it is important to ensure that yield measurements can be relied upon.",

In this context, free zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) have been increasingly shown with broad antimicrobial activities. However, biological properties of immobilized ZnO NPs on matrixes like nanofibrous membranes are still limited. In this study, in situ synthesized ZnO NPs/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibrous membranes were fabricated by electrospinning with different zinc acetate concentrations. Characterization results indicated that, with 5 mM zinc acetate, uniform size ZnO NPs (~40 nm) were formed and evenly distributed on the membrane surface. The surfaces became more hydrophobic with higher concentration of zinc acetate. ZnO NPs/PVA nanofibrous membranes showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities and cell adhesion inhibiting effects against four microorganisms including Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus , Gram-negative Escherichia coli , fungi Candida albicans , and spores of Aspergillus niger . Our data revealed that the major antimicrobial mechanism could be attributed to cell membrane damage and cellular internalization of ZnO NPs, while the hydrophobic surface of the membrane primarily contributed to the cell adhesion inhibition. This study suggests that ZnO NPs/PVA nanofibrous membranes could potentially be used as an effective antimicrobial agent to maintain agricultural and food safety.",

    "abstract": "Borophene is a new type of two-dimensional material with a series of unique and diversified properties. However, most of the research is still in its infancy and has not been studied in depth. Especially in the field of semiconductor optoelectronics, there is no related research on the modulation of photoelectric properties of borophene. In this work, we focus on the effect of doping on the photoelectric properties of borophene by using the first-principles pseudopotential plane wave method. We calculate the geometric structure, electronic structure, Mulliken population analysis, and optical properties of impurity (X = Al, Ga) doped α-sheet borophene. The results show that α-sheet borophene is an indirect band gap semiconductor with 1.396 eV. The band gap becomes wider after Al and Ga doping, and the band gap values are 1.437 eV and 1.422 eV, respectively. Due to the orbital hybridization between a small number of Al-3p electrons and Ga-4p state electrons and a large number of B 2p state electrons near the Fermi level, the band gap of borophene changes and the peak value of the electron density of states reduces after doping. Mulliken population analysis shows that the B0-B bond is mainly covalent bond, but there is also a small amount of ionic bond. However, when the impurity X is doped, the charge transfer between X and B atoms increases significantly, and the population of the corresponding X-B bonds decreases, indicating that the covalent bond strength of the chemical bonds in the doped system is weakened, and the chemical bonds have significant directionality. The calculation of optical properties shows that the static dielectric constant of the borophene material increases, and the appearance of a new dielectric peak indicates that the doping of Al and Ga can enhance the ability of borophene to store electromagnetic energy. After doping, the peak reflectivity decreases and the static refractive index n0 increases, which also fills the gap in the absorption of red light and infrared light by borophene materials. The research results provide a basis for the development of borophene materials in the field of infrared detection devices. The above results indicate that doping can modulate the photoelectric properties of α-sheet borophene.",

We found that, in contrast to the previously studied two‐dimensional (2D) variations of this model that harbor critical points between their ground state phases, the non‐bipartite pyrochlore lattice in three spatial dimensions appears to exhibit a first‐order transition between a magnetically‐ordered (MO) phase and some, as yet uncharacterized, paramagnetic (PM) phase. We also observe that the MO phase survives to a relatively large value of N = 8 and that it is gone for N = 9.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the structural, mechanical, electronic, optical and magnetic properties of the RhNbSb half‐Heusler compound were examined and analyzed using density functional theory (DFT). According to the results, type I atomic arrangement is structurally the most stable for the compound. In all three of its atomic arrangement types, the compound is mechanically stable and ductile according to the analysis of its mechanical properties. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) + U approach was applied in addition to GGA approach, where U is Hubbard parameter, to increase the accuracy of results in electronic band structure, density of states (DOS), and magnetic moments. Therefore, electronic band structure and DOS calculations demonstrate that the compound exhibits metallic properties in both its type I and type II atomic arrangements with GGA predictions. However, under GGA + U calculations, the compound becomes half metal when in type I but it still reflects metallic nature when in type II. The compound’s half‐metallic nature in type I under the GGA+ U method suggests that it may be a good fit for spintronics applications in this type I of its atomic arrangement. The calculated total magnetic moment of the compound under GGA + U approach exactly fits with Slater–Pauling rule of half‐metallic nature in its type I atomic arrangement, a result that supports half‐metallic nature of the compound in type I atomic arrangement for electronic properties under GGA + U prediction. Furthermore, the compound might be taken into consideration for optoelectronic applications according to the results of computed optical characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The research and development of traditional perovskite solar cells requires significant time and cost for process parameter optimization. To address this issue, this study collected relevant data on perovskite solar cells efficiency and employed a back propagation (BP) neural network prediction method, selecting seven key process parameters of perovskite solar cells to predict their fill factor and power conversion efficiency. The prediction results demonstrate: the mean absolute error of the predicted value of the filling factor is 0.050, themean relative error is 0.072, and the mean square error is 0.005. The mean absolute error of the predicted value of the efficiency is 1.305, the mean relative error is 0.074, and the mean square error is 2.679. The results show good agreement between the predicted values and real measurements for both the fill factor and power conversion efficiency. This indicates that BP neural networks can effectively predict the fill factor and efficiency of perovskite solar cells, enabling process parameter optimization to ultimately reduce development time and costs.",

Here, we have evaluated the cytotoxicity of ammonia-modified GO (GO-NH 2 ) and pristine GO particles in human lung cancer cells, A549 and embryonic stem cells, Lep3 exposed to different particles concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 20, and 50 μ g/ml) for different times (24 and 48h). Compared with GO, GO-NH 2 particles possessed smaller size, positive surface charge and higher thickness. An increased propensity to aggregation in cell cultures was also found for GO-NH 2 particles. Cytotoxicity evaluation revealed that GO-NH 2 particles are more toxic than pristine GO. Applied at concentrations of 10, 20 and 50 μ g/ml for 24h they affect significantly cell morphology of viable embryonic stem cells whereas human lung cancer A549 cells seem to be relatively more resistant to short-time exposure. After 48h exposure however cell proliferation of A549 cells was strongly suppressed in a dose-dependent manner while the proliferation ability of embryonic stem cells was not affected. These results suggested that both GO particles exert different degree of cytotoxicity which is time, dose and cell dependent. In general, ammonia-modified GO particles are more toxic than the pristine GO which should be taken into account for future biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "The superconductivity in antiperovskite compound MgCNi 3 was discovered in 2001 following the discovery of the superconducting MgB 2 . In spite of its lower superconducting transition temperature (8 K) than MgB 2 (39 K), MgCNi 3 has attracted considerable attention due to its high content of magnetic element Ni and the cubic structure analogous to the perovskite cuprates. After years of extensive investigations both theoretically and experimentally, however, it is still not clear whether the mechanism for superconductivity is conventional or not. The central issue is if and how the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations contribute to the cooper paring. Recently, the experimental results on the single crystals firstly reported in 2007 trend to indicate a conventional s -wave mechanism. Meanwhile many compounds neighboring to MgCNi 3 were synthesized and the physical properties were investigated, which enriches the physics of the Ni-based antiperovskite compounds and help understand the superconductivity in MgCNi 3 . In this paper, we summarize the research progress in these two aspects. Moreover, a universal phase diagram of these compounds is presented, which suggests a phonon-mediated mechanism for the superconductivity, as well as a clue for searching new superconductors with the antiperovskite structure. Finally, a few possible scopes for future research are proposed.",

We speculate that sulfur works as an effective getter for removing the interstitial apical oxygen which impedes the metallic conduction.

A strong correlation between the two annealing processes was observed, leading to a profound effect on the performance of CdS/CdTe thin film solar cells. Atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy show that the iTAP in the optimal processing window produces considerable CdTe grain growth and improves the CdTe crystallinity, which results in significantly improved optoelectronic properties and quantum efficiency of the CdS/CdTe solar cells.

By comparing the adsorption energy, adsorption distance, density of state, Mulliken charge population, charge transfer amount, and molecular orbital energy for adsorbing different decomposition gases, it can be seen that the system structure is the most stable when Mo is doped at the T site of the graphene surface. The adsorption of Mo-doped graphene on gas molecules is significantly stronger than that of intrinsic graphene, and the order of adsorption is: SO2F2 &gt; H2S &gt; SO2 &gt; CF4. The adsorption of H2S gas molecules by intrinsic state and Mo-doped graphene is n-type adsorption, while the adsorption of SO2F2, CF4, and SO2 gas molecules is p-type adsorption.

We obtained mathematical statements for the superconductor Ba1−xKxFe2As2 superconducting (SC) transition temperature, spin-density-wave (SDW), transition temperature, superconductivity order parameter, and SDW order parameter from the Bogoliubov transformation formalism and the model Hamiltonian. Furthermore, an expression for the dependence of the SDW transition temperature on the SDW order parameter and the dependence of the SC transition temperature on the SDW order parameter was obtained for Ba1−xKxFe2As2. By substituting the experimental and theoretical values of the parameters in the derived statements, phase diagrams of the SC transition temperature versus the SDW order parameter and the SDW transition temperature versus the SDW order parameters have been plotted to demonstrate the dependence of the SDW order parameter on transition temperatures. By combining the two-phase diagrams, we depicted the possible coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism for the Ba1−xKxFe2As2 superconductor. The phase diagrams of temperature versus SC order parameter and temperature versus SDW order parameter were also plotted to show the dependence of order parameters on temperature for the Ba1−xKxFe2As2 superconductor.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of a thin film made from topological insulator (TI) material exhibiting structure inversion asymmetry. Our results reveal that the energy obtained by diagonalizing the thin‐film Hamiltonian model is influenced by an external uniform magnetic field, oriented perpendicular to the substrate, as well as by the Rashba field. The resulting Landau level energy spectra are thoroughly analyzed, with a detailed investigation of the effects of hybridization and exchange interactions on these levels. Our findings reveal level crossings for different values of the exchange constant, Rashba coupling strength, and applied potential. Additionally, we explore the variations in the density of states as functions of energy and magnetic field strength. The Fermi energy fluctuations, at a fixed electron concentration, are computed as a function of the applied magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that by tuning the strength of the Rashba coupling, hybridization, and exchange interactions, the thin film can be controlled to exhibit either a conventional insulator or a TI. Employing well‐established statistical physics relations, we determine the partition function, ensure convergence, and calculate the average energy of the material. Notably, the magnetic susceptibility exhibits characteristic oscillatory peaks as a function of the inverse magnetic field, a signature of the de Haas–van Alphen effect in topological thin films under an external perpendicular magnetic field. Depending on the strength of the magnetic field, the material can exhibit either ferromagnetic or paramagnetic behavior. Furthermore, we evaluate the magnetocaloric impact across a range of temperatures and exchange interaction strengths due to the ferromagnetic substrate. Our study provides deeper insights into the interplay between Rashba spin–orbit coupling (RSOC), exchange interactions, and external magnetic fields in governing the electronic, magnetic, and thermal properties of thin film systems. Furthermore, our findings indicate that these thin films have potential applications in a wide range of technological fields, such as spintronics, valleytronics, and magnetocaloric.",

One must refer to the reduced in‐capture rates for electrons compared to holes. The relaxation rates are lower than the capture rates, indicating that the structure is not a loser. The DQD behavior is specified. The importance of the MNP potential in increasing the capture rates is detected. The scattering rates are reduced with increasing MNP radius.

Defect formation energy calculations show that the V atom prefers substituting boron (B) sites over nitrogen (N) sites and the V‐doped G/h‐BN heterostructures are energetically stable. The lattice constant of the V‐doped G/h‐BN increases due to the larger atomic radius of the V atom. The electronic band structure analysis reveals that the band gap of G/h‐BN increases from 0.053 to 1.25 eV with 2.08% V doping. The total density of states (TDOSs) analysis indicates a transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic (FM) behavior upon V doping. Moreover, the magnetic energy ( ∆E ) calculations show that two V dopants in G/h‐BN favor FM interactions, although the energy decreases as the distance between dopants increases. Using mean‐field theory combined with spin‐polarized DFT, we estimate the corrected FM transition temperature ( T c ) to be 457 K for 4.16% V doping in G/h‐BN. Additionally, optical absorption analysis shows a significant enhancement in the absorption coefficient in the visible region due to V doping. This study offers insights into the potential use of V‐doped G/h‐BN for spintronic and optoelectronic applications, subject to further theoretical and experimental validation.",

The inserted Al x Ga 1 − x N layer enhances the inherent structure inversion asymmetry (SIA), increases the effective thickness of the GaN triangular potential well, as well as significantly changes the polarization electric field and the electron probability density. Due to the probability density and electric field around the left well (GaN layer) being rather high, contributions to the Rashba coefficient from the left well and the left interface are dominant. These contributions also increase with the Al concentration ( x ) in the inserted Al x Ga 1 − x N layer.

Na doping significantly alters the electronic and elastic properties of the aBeONTs. The increase in cohesive energy is attributed to Na modifying the electronic structure, creating ionic interactions, and optimizing the nanotube’s geometry and energy state. Na doping also metalizes aBeONTs by introducing charge carriers into the nanotube structure. In addition, despite Na’s paramagnetic properties, there is no difference between spin‐polarized and unpolarized elastic constants in Na‐doped aBeONTs due to weak magnetic interactions. Na doping decreases the elastic moduli due to factors like atomic size, electronegativity, and intrinsic mechanical properties of the elements.

    "abstract": "Topological insulators (TIs) are becoming a great, fascinating compound due to their multidimensional applications in quantum computing, spintronics, and advanced technology. Recently, some half‐Heusler compounds exhibit topologically insulating behaviors and are predicted to be TIs. In this paper, a half‐Heusler compound, PtLuSb, and its properties are studied. This paper demonstrates the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of PtLuSb on different photon energies using density functional theory (DFT). The observed electronic band structure indicates zero bandgap at the G‐point. The total density of states (TDOSs) graph exhibits strong hybridization between atomic orbitals around −26.9 eV. The optical properties, such as absorption coefficient, reflectivity, refractive index, extinction coefficient, optical conductivity, and dielectric function, are analyzed. PtLuSb shows maximum absorption at 32.2 eV. The strong reflectivity phenomena are noticed in the photon energy range between 36 and 43 eV. The optical conductivity graph displays high conductivity, indicating several peaks at the photon energies of 19.9, 21.9, 27.1, and 30.3 eV. The obtained maximum optical conductivity is 9.19 (1/fs). PtLuSb TI highlights a more effective optical response to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photons. It makes PtLuSb more suitable for different EUV applications, such as lithography, optics, advanced spectroscopy, and photonic devices.",

Band structure and density of states (DOS) calculations, performed with and without spin–orbit coupling (SOC), confirm its metallic nature dominated by La‐d and Sb‐p states. To refine the optical response, we complemented projector‐augmented wave (PAW)–Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) calculations in Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) with full‐potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP‐LAPW) simulations in WIEN2k, explicitly incorporating the plasma frequency and Drude term. The resulting spectra reproduce the experimental optical conductivity and reflectivity more accurately than earlier theory, particularly in the low‐energy region, while maintaining robust agreement at higher energies. These findings establish a more consistent and comprehensive picture of LaSb’s electronic and optical behavior compared to previous studies.",

    "abstract": "The phonon-mediated attractive interaction between carriers leads to the Cooper pair formation in conventional superconductors. Despite decades of research, the glue holding Cooper pairs in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is still controversial, and the same is true as for the relative involvement of structural and electronic degrees of freedom. Ultrafast electron crystallography (UEC) offers, through observation of spatio-temporally resolved diffraction, the means for determining structural dynamics and the possible role of electron-lattice interaction. A polarized femtosecond (fs) laser pulse excites the charge carriers, which relax through electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling, and the consequential structural distortion is followed diffracting fs electron pulses. In this review, the recent findings obtained on cuprates are summarized. In particular, we discuss the strength and symmetry of the directional electron-phonon coupling in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\\delta (BSCCO), as well as the c-axis structural instability induced by near-infrared pulses in La2CuO4 (LCO). The theoretical implications of these results are discussed with focus on the possibility of charge stripes being significant in accounting for the polarization anisotropy of BSCCO, and cohesion energy (Madelung) calculations being descriptive of the c-axis instability in LCO.",

However, conventional SPR sensor systems usually require expensive equipment and complicated optics. In this paper, we have demonstrated a rapid prototyping of angle-scanning SPR for bioanalytical investigation. Rapid prototyping was attained by utilizing the FDM (fused deposition modeling) based 3D (three-dimensional) printing technology. Two rotating platforms were employed to drive the laser source and photodiode, respectively. A temperature regulation unit was incorporated to maintain the system temperature in order to reduce the temperature effect. The proposed SPR rapid prototyping yielded a refractive index resolution of 6.4×10 −6 RIU (refractive index unit), and the biotin-avidin system validated the kinetics parameters measurement capability. The obtained results indicated that the FDM 3D printing has great potential for developing rapid-prototyping SPR system.",

Considering the non-Fourier behavior of heat conduction in biological tissue, the traditional Pennes bioheat equation was modified to thermal wave model of bioheat transfer (TWMBT). Consequently, a joint physical model, which combines TWMBT for tissue and energy transport equation for blood vessel, is presented to predict the evolution of temperature and the thermal lesion region. In this study, pulsatile blood flow is first introduced into numerical study of HIFU hyperthermia, and thermal relaxation time, ultrasonic focus location, blood vessel radius, and blood flow velocity are all taken into account. The results show that the thermal relaxation time plays a key role in the temperature and the thermal lesion region. Larger thermal relaxation time results in lower temperature and smaller thermal lesion region, which indicates that TWMBT leads to lower temperature and smaller thermal lesion region compared to Pennes bioheat transfer model. In addition, we found that the ultrasonic focus location and blood vessel radius significantly affected the temperature and thermal lesion region, while the heartbeat frequency and amplitude factor of pulsating blood flow as well as the average velocity of blood flow had only a slight effect.",

To further verify the influence of rough surfaces on microscale liquid flow and heat transfer, a performance test system of heat transfer and liquid flow was designed and built, and a series of experimental examinations are conducted, in which the microchannel material is stainless steel and the working medium is methanol. The results indicate that the surface roughness plays a significant role in the process of laminar flow and heat transfer in microchannels. In microchannels with roughness characteristics, the Poiseuille number of liquid laminar flow relies not only on the cross section shape of the rough microchannels but also on the Reynolds number of liquid flow. The Poiseuille number of liquid laminar flow in rough microchannels increases with increasing Reynolds number. In addition, the Nusselt number of liquid laminar heat transfer is related not only to the cross section shape of a rough microchannel but also to the Reynolds number of liquid flow, and the Nusselt number increases with increasing Reynolds number.",

It was found that, with respect to the raw material, aluminium was uncovered in the course of the plasma deposition process which can be explained by plasma-induced etching of the PMMA matrix. As a result, the wettability of plasma-deposited PMMA/ATH was significantly increased. Even though a uniform coating film could not be realised as ascertained by confocal laser scanning microscopy, the deposited coatings feature notably enhanced characteristics which could be advantageous for further processing.",

Nontrivial shape of the excitation spectrum as a function of the value of uncompensated magnetic moment corresponds completely to the quantum-mechanical calculations earlier performed.

A nanotubes agglomeration has to be avoided to achieve a homogeneous dispersion in a composite matrix. In this research, we report on the synthesis of carbon nanotubes using a variant of the chemical vapor deposition technique known as spray pyrolysis method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies showed that the synthesized products had an aligned structure with low purity degree, high content of catalyst particles, and a smaller amount of amorphous carbon. A secondary method was applied, which involves an acidic treatment that dissolves contaminant particles to enhance the purity of the nanotubes. Microstructural analysis, which includes XRD and SEM, indicates an effective reduction of impurities. Dispersion of the nanotubes was assessed using different surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Finally, Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis, and SEM techniques confirm that better results were obtained with EDTA. For EDTA and SDS surfactants, low concentrations of 0.3 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL were most efficient, respectively.",

These compounds form tetragonal structures where the transition metal ion (Ni or Co) is surrounded by four electrically polar thiourea molecules [SC(NH 2 ) 2 ]. By tracking the magnetic and electric properties of these compounds as a function of magnetic field, we gain insights into the coupling mechanism by observing that, in DTN, the electric polarization tracks the magnetic ordering, whereas in DTC it does not. For DTN, all electrically polar thiourea molecules tilt in the same direction along the c -axis, breaking spatial-inversion symmetry, whereas, for DTC, two thiourea molecules tilt up and two tilt down with respect to c -axis, perfectly canceling the net electrical polarization. Thus, the magnetoelectric coupling mechanism in DTN is likely a magnetostrictive adjustment of the thiourea molecule orientation in response to magnetic order.",

In this work, tin-doped indium oxide (ITO)-TiO 2 core-shell nanostructures are used as the photoanode for DSSCs. High-density, vertically aligned ITO nanowires are grown via a thermal evaporation method and TiO 2 is coated on nanowire surfaces via TiCl 4 treatment. It is found that high TiO 2 annealing temperatures increase the crystallinity of TiO 2 shell and suppress electron recombination in the core-shell nanostructures. High annealing temperatures also decrease dye loading. The highest efficiency of 3.39% is achieved at a TiO 2 annealing temperature of 500°C. When HfO 2 blocking layers are inserted between the core and shell of the nanowire, device efficiency is further increased to 5.83%, which is attributed to further suppression of electron recombination from ITO to the electrolyte. Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements show that the electron lifetime increases by more than an order of magnitude upon HfO 2 insertion. ITO-TiO 2 core-shell nanostructures with HfO 2 blocking layers are promising photoanodes for DSSCs.",

In this work, ordered arrays of Co/Cu multilayered nanowires which can be exploited to develop magnetoresistive sensors were successfully prepared using porous anodic alumina (PAA) templates. The structure and morphology of the multilayered nanowire arrays were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The nanowire arrays are highly ordered and the average diameter is about 50 nm, which is controlled by the pore diameter of the PAA templates. The influences of period number and Cu layer thickness on the magnetic and the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) properties were investigated. The coercivity and remanence ratio increase first and then gradually tend to be stable with the increase of period number and the Cu layer thickness, while the GMR ratio increases first and then decreases with the increase of the period number accompanied by an oscillatory behavior of GMR as the Cu layer thickness changes, which are ascribed to the spin dependence electron scattering in the multilayers. The optimum GMR of −13% appears at Co (50 nm)/Cu (5 nm) with 200 deposition cycles in our experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "The effect of size on the optical properties of gold nanomaterials has been studied using the theoretical Drude–Sommerfield model. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of bulk as a function of wavelength due to free electron contribution and the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of nanogold materials as a function of wavelength due to free electron and bond electron contribution are calculated. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of bulk as a function of wavelength due to the free electron contribution graph and The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of nanogold materials as a function of wavelength due to free electron and bond electron contributions are plotted. As we observed from the graphs, the real dielectric functions of both bulk and nanogold materials are inversely proportional to wavelength. The imaginary part of the dielectric function of bulk gold materials is independent of wavelength. At high wavelengths, the size of the gold nanomaterial is highly influenced by both real and imagined dielectric functions at high waves. As the wavelength increases, the effect of the size on the dielectric function also increases. The size-dependent dielectric function of nanomaterials is highly influenced by their optical properties and electrical structure.",

Calculations of band structure and density of states indicated that they are semiconductors with RhZrAs direct and RhZrSb indirect band gap. Furthermore, the investigation of the optical properties reveals that there is a high absorption coefficient and low electron energy loss in visible and some ultraviolet energy spectrum indicating that these compounds are potential candidates for optoelectronic applications.",

    "abstract": "The Holstein-Hubbard model serves as a useful framework to investigate this interplay between the phonon-induced electron-electron attractive interaction and the direct Coulomb repulsion and can afford interesting phase diagrams due to competition among charge-density wave (CDW), spin-density wave (SDW), and superconductivity. However the detailed nature of the CDW-SDW transition is still not very well known. It is generally believed that the system undergoes a direct insulator to insulator transition from CDW to SDW with the increase of the on-site Coulomb repulsion for a given strength of the electron-phonon coupling and this is the main bottleneck for the polaronic/bipolaronic mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. We have recently made an investigation to study the nature of the transition from SDW phase to CDW phase within the framework of a one-dimensional Holstein-Hubbard model at half-filling using a variational method. We find that an intervening metallic phase may exist at the crossover region of the CDW-SDW transition. We have also observed that if the anharmonicity of the phonons is taken into account, this metallic phase widens and the polarons become more mobile, which is a more favorable situation from the point of view of superconductivity. We shall finally show that an improved variational calculation widens the metallic phase and makes the polarons more mobile, which reconfirms the existence of the intermediate metallic phase at the SDW-CDW crossover region.",

Solutions of bright yellow and blue colors characteristic of both morphologies were observed. UV-vis optical analysis of NPs stabilized with DTC showed a plasmonic absorption band at 393 nm characteristic for spherical morphology, while two bands were observed at 332 nm and 762 nm, and a shoulder around 500 nm for the triangular morphology; with these spectra each morphology was confirmed. In these spectra an absorption band between 250 and 260 nm confirms the presence of DTC ligand. The stability of the NPs was achieved using an 8.69 × 10 -3 mM solution of 4-(ethylaminodithiocarbamate) methylpyridine di- n -butyltin (IV) through a transmetallation reaction. Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with spherical morphology of average diameter of 12.7 ± 1.2 nm and triangular morphology with 28.9 ± 0.8 nm for each side of the triangles were analyzed by high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). UV-vis spectra also showed the stability of NPs with DTC for more than three months. A copolymer derived of 3-hexylthiophene with ( E )-2-(ethyl(4-((4-nitrophenyl) diazenyl) phenyl) amino) ethyl 2-(thiophen-3-yl) acetate (PA) was tested to get polymer NPs by reprecipitation method using THF/water systems. PA Polymer NPs having average diameter of 9.0 ± 1.7 nm were found. By quick and easy procedure, the formation of nanocomposite (NC) of spherical Ag NPs and PA polymer NPs was reached. This NC could be used as imaging agent, electrochemical biosensor, and photonic and optoelectronic device materials.",

The effective mass is calculated to the second perturbative order in any lattice dimensionality for a broad range of (anti)adiabatic regimes and electron-phonon couplings. The crossover from a large to a small polaron state is found in all dimensionalities for adiabatic and intermediate adiabatic regimes. The phonon dispersion largely smoothes such crossover which is signalled by polaron mass enhancement and on-site localization of the correlation function. The notion of self-trapping together with the conditions for the existence of light polarons, mainly in two- and three-dimensions, is discussed. By the imaginary time path integral formalism I show how nonlocal electron-phonon correlations, due to dispersive phonons, renormalize downwards the e-ph coupling justifying the possibility for light and essentially small 2D Holstein polarons.",

It is expected to provide a larger tunability, smaller size, lower power consumption, and higher level of integration than the semiconductor-based oscillators. In our previous work, a circuit-level model of the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) STO was proposed. In this paper, we present a physics-based circuit-level model of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)-based STO. MTJ-STO model includes the effect of perpendicular torque that has been ignored in the GMR-STO model. The variations of three major characteristics, generation frequency, mean oscillation power, and generation linewidth of an MTJ-STO with respect to the amount of perpendicular torque, are investigated, and the results are applied to our model. The operation of the model was verified by HSPICE simulation, and the results show an excellent agreement with the experimental data. The results also prove that a full circuit-level simulation with MJT-STO devices can be made with our proposed model.",

Another feature of the dense-water-part clusters is helical ordering of protons which can realize coherent vibrations.

X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that, at all investigated substrate temperatures, the films were polycrystalline with crystallites’ sizes decreasing with temperature. Besides, the preferred crystal orientation varies with the substrate temperature. The analysis of surface chemical composition and oxidation state was performed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was shown that, at substrate temperature of 200°C, the deposited ZnO films were closest to the stoichiometric ones. In general, the films at 150°C were oxygen-deficient, while at other studied temperatures, the films had excess of oxygen more pronouncedly at 200°C. Spectral ellipsometric measurements confirmed that the structural disorder is the highest at 150°C and improves with temperature. Refractive indexes for films at 200°C and 250°C are almost the same, 1.97 and 1.93, respectively, at wavelength of 600 nm, while for the sample deposited at 150°C, the refractive index is substantially lower, 1.67. The optical band gap is slightly influenced by the substrate temperature: 3.27 eV at 150°C and 3.32 eV at 200°C.",

    "abstract": "Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in the form of hexagonal lattice, has many intriguing optical and electrical properties. However, due to the atomic layer thickness, light-matter interactions in the monolayer graphene are naturally weak when the light is normally incident to the material. To overcome this challenge, waveguide-integrated graphene optoelectronic devices have been proposed and demonstrated. In such coplanar configurations, the propagating light in the waveguide can significantly interact with the graphene layer integrated on the surface of the waveguide. The combination of photonic integrated circuits and graphene also enables the development of graphene devices by using silicon photonic technology, which greatly extends the scope of graphene’s application. Moreover, the waveguide-integrated graphene devices are fully CMOS-compatible, which makes it possible to achieve low-cost and high-density integration in the future. As a result, the area has been attracting more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we introduce basic principles and research advances of waveguide-integrated graphene optoelectronics.",

    "abstract": "Four-terminal transducers can be used to measure the magnetic field via the Hall effect or the mechanical stress via the piezoresistance effect. Both effects are described by an anisotropic conductivity tensor with small offdiagonal elements. This has led other authors to the conclusion that there is some kind of analogy. In both cases the output voltage depends on the geometry of the device and the size of the contacts. For Hall plates this influence is accounted for by the Hall-geometry factor. The alleged analogy proposes that the Hall-geometry factor also applies to four-terminal stress transducers. This paper shows that the analogy holds only for a limited class of devices. Moreover, it is shown that devices of different geometries may have identical magnetic field sensitivity but different mechanical stress sensitivities. Thus, shape optimization makes sense for mechanical stress sensors. In extreme cases the output voltages of vertical Hall-effect devices may have notable magnetic field sensitivity but zero mechanical stress sensitivity. As byproduct, exact analytical formulae for the equivalent resistor circuit of rectangular and circular devices with two perpendicular mirror symmetries are given. They allow for an accurate description of how mechanical stress and deformation affect the output offset voltage and the magnetic sensitivity of Hall-effect devices.",

The proposed model is a surface adaptation of a model developed for bulk recombination in amorphous silicon based on Sah-Shockley statistics which is more appropriate for amphoteric center recombination than classical Shockley-Read-Hall statistics. It is found that the surface recombination via amphoteric centers having capture cross-sections larger for charged centers than for neutral centers is distinguished from Shockley-Read-Hall recombination by exhibiting two peaks rather than one peak when plotted versus surface potential. Expressions are derived for the surface potentials at which the peaks occur. Such a finding provides a firm and plausible interpretation for the double peak surface recombination current measured in gated diodes or gated transistors. Successful fitting is possible between the results of the model and reported experimental curves showing two peaks for surface recombination velocity versus surface potential. On the other hand, if charged and neutral center capture cross-sections are equal or close to equal, surface recombination via amphoteric centers follows the same trend as Shockley-Read-Hall recombination and both models lead to comparable surface recombination velocities.",

    "abstract": "The microscopical analysis of the unconventional and puzzling physics of the underdoped cuprates, as carried out lately by means of the Composite Operator Method (COM) applied to the 2D Hubbard model, is reviewed and systematized. The 2D Hubbard model has been adopted as it has been considered the minimal model capable to describe the most peculiar features of cuprates held responsible for their anomalous behavior. COM is designed to endorse, since its foundations, the systematic emergence in any SCS of new elementary excitations described by composite operators obeying non-canonical algebras. In this case (underdoped cuprates - 2D Hubbard model), the residual interactions - beyond a 2-pole approximation - between the new elementary electronic excitations, dictated by the strong local Coulomb repulsion and well described by the two Hubbard composite operators, have been treated within the Non Crossing Approximation. Given this recipe and exploiting the few unknowns to enforce the Pauli principle content in the solution, it is possible to qualitatively describe some of the anomalous features of high-Tc cuprate superconductors such as large vs. small Fermi surface dichotomy, Fermi surface deconstruction (appearance of Fermi arcs), nodal vs. anti-nodal physics, pseudogap(s), kinks in the electronic dispersion. The resulting scenario envisages a smooth crossover between an ordinary weakly-interacting metal sustaining weak, short-range antiferromagnetic correlations in the overdoped regime to an unconventional poor metal characterized by very strong, long-but-finite-range antiferromagnetic correlations leading to momentum-selective non-Fermi liquid features as well as to the opening of a pseudogap and to the striking differences between the nodal and the anti-nodal dynamics in the underdoped regime.",

When the fusedsilica surface was exposed to the UV laser in vacuum, the laser damage threshold was decreased whereas the concentration of the ODCs was increased. For the fuse silica operated under the high power lasers, creation of ODCs on their surface resulted from the UV laser irradiation, and this is more severe in a high vacuum. The laser fluence and/or laser intensity have significant effects on the increase of the ODCs concentration. The ODCs can be effectively repaired using postoxygen plasma treatment and UV laser irradiation in an excessive oxygen environment. Results also demonstrated that the “gain” and “loss” of oxygen at the silica surface is a reversible and dynamic process.",

Due to the higher melting temperature, Bi3+ ions tend to partially reduce to the low valence state of Bi0, which in turn causes coloration of the glass. In this experiment, the absorption peaks of glass oxidized brown color were observed at about 470 nm at 1,100°C (Bi2O3 = 40, 45 mol%) and 1,000°C (Bi2O3 = 40 mol%) for these three curves. The bismuth glass produced by high-temperature melting is not suitable for optical applications; by adding an oxidant (Sb2O3), which inhibits the reduction reaction of bismuth ions and maintains the ions in the state of Bi3+, the glass becomes more transparent in appearance and the transmittance is also improved and raised to approximately 75%–80%, which proves that appropriate additives are sufficient to greatly improve the application of bismuth glass for optical components. In the research process, the density and molar volume were measured by Archimedes method, Raman analysis was used to explore the influence of its structural changes, UV/Vis spectroscopy was used to measure the transmittance and absorption spectra for analysis and discussion, and TMA was used to observe the thermal properties, in the hope of developing a good optical properties of the glass, and the present experiments have confirmed that the addition of a small amount of Sb2O3 changes the color of the glass from black to a light yellow, which can be better used in the optical glass.",

The dependence of the color, given by 1931 CIE chromaticity coordinates, with the thickness of the crystal was analyzed. The absorbance used in the calculation of these coordinates was given by the sum of Gaussian lines. The parameters of these lines were determined through the decomposition of the optical absorption spectra in the ultraviolet and visible regions. The decomposition revealed several lines, whose assignment was made considering studies in spodumene and beryl crystals and highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations. The transmittance becomes very narrow with increasing thickness, and the CIE chromaticity coordinates converge to the borderline of the CIE Chromaticity Diagram at the wavelength of maximum transmittance. Furthermore, the purity of color increases with increasing thickness, and the dominant wavelength reaches the wavelength of maximum transmittance.",

The structure optimization shows that the lattice parameter of ACCr 3 is basically proportional to the radius of A-site elements. The calculated formation energies show that AlCCr 3 and GaCCr 3 can be synthesized at ambient pressure and are stable with nonmagnetic ground states. Based on the calculation of elastic constants, some elastic, mechanical, and thermal parameters are derived and discussed. AlCCr 3 and GaCCr 3 show ductile natures and may have similar thermal properties. From the analysis of the electronic structures, it was found that there are electron and hole bands that cross the Fermi level for AlCCr 3 and GaCCr 3 , indicating multiple-band natures. The Fermi level locates at the vicinity of the density of states (DOSs) peak, which leads to a large DOS at Fermi level dominated by Cr-3d electrons. The band structures of AlCCr 3 and GaCCr 3 are very similar to those of the superconducting antiperovskite MgCNi 3 . The similarity may make AlCCr 3 and GaCCr 3 behave superconductively, which needs to be further investigated in theoretical and experimental studies.",

The nonlinear nature of persistent current in relativistic regime and its dependence on particle mass and ring radius are analysed thoroughly. For a particular ring radius, we find the existence of a critical mass at which the single ring current does not depend on the flux. In lower mass regime, the total current spectrum shows plateaus at different height which appears periodically. The susceptibility as well shows periodic nature with amplitude depending on particle mass. As we move from higher mass to lower mass regime, we find that the system turns into paramagnetic from diamagnetic. We also show that same behaviour is observed if one vary the radius of the ring for a fixed particle mass. Hence the larger ring will be diamagnetic while the smaller one will be paramagnetic. Finally we propose an experiment to verify our findings.",

Natural zircon sands are the major source of zirconium minerals for industrial applications. In this paper, long, medium, and short range studies were conducted on zirconium minerals originated from Australia, South Africa, and United States of America using conventional and less conventional techniques (i.e., X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS), and Perturbed Angular Correlations (PAC)) in order to reveal the type and the extension of the regions that constitute the metamict state of zircon sands and the modifications therein produced as a consequence of the industrial milling process and the thermal treatment in the production line. Additionally, HPGe gamma-ray spectroscopy confirms the occurrence of significant levels of natural radioactivity responsible for metamictization in the investigated zircon samples. Results from XRD, PALS, and PAC analysis confirm that the metamict state of zircon is a dispersion of submicron disordered domains in a crystalline matrix of zircon.",

Numerical results show that the donor binding energy increases firstly until a maximum value, and then it begins to drop quickly in all the cases with decreasing the dot radius. As the thickness of left dot and right dot decreases, the donor binding energy increases monotonically at first, reaches a maximum value, and then drops rapidly for an impurity ion located at the right dot center and the middle barrier center. Moreover, the donor binding energy for an impurity ion located at the center of the left dot is insensitive to the variation of dot thickness for large dot thickness due to the Stark effect. Meanwhile, the impurity position plays an important role on the change of the donor binding energy under the external electric field. In particular, the impurity position corresponding to the peak value of the donor binding energy is shifted toward the left QD with increasing the external electric field strength.",

It is shown that the parameters of the metal-insulator phase transition in VO 2 thin films depend on the hydrogen implantation dose. Next, we explore the effect of PIII on composition, optical properties, and the internal electrochromic effect (IECE) in V 2 O 5 · n H 2 O films. The variations in the composition and structure caused by the hydrogen insertion, as well as those caused by the electrochromic effect, are studied by nuclear magnetic resonance, thermogravimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray structural analysis. It is shown that the ion implantation-induced hydrogenation can substantially enhance the manifestation and performance of the IECE in V 2 O 5 xerogel films. Finally, the effect of PIII-assisted doping with W on the parameters of electrical switching in Au/V 2 O 5 · n H 2 O/Au sandwich structures is examined. It is shown that implanting small tungsten doses improves the switching parameters after forming. When implanting large doses, switching is observed without electroforming, and if electroforming is applied, the switching effect, on the contrary, disappears.",

The effects of Na2CO3 additive and sintering temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties of as-prepared solids were systematically investigated. XRD results confirmed the vitrified forms can be achieved at 1200°C within 30 min with 20 wt.% Na2CO3 addition. Importantly, the Na2CO3 additive significantly reduced the firing temperature from 1500°C to 1200°C and promoted densification. FT-IR analysis demonstrated that the main characteristic peaks of the sintered samples were attributed to the vibration of Si-O-Si. Microstructural studies presented the homogeneous distribution of glass phases. The results of mechanical properties of the sintered forms show that bulk density and Vickers hardness increased with increasing Na2CO3 content as well as sintering temperature, and the highest bulk density (2.45 ± 0.01 g/cm3) and Vickers hardness (823 ± 25 HV) were obtained at the temperature of 1300°C with 20 wt.% Na2CO3 addition, the heating rate of 20°C/min, and the soaking time of 30 min. It implied that the combination of microwave sintering with the appropriate addition of Na2CO3 would provide an efficient method for the immobilization of radionuclides in uranium tailings.",

We set out to stabilize this metastable perovskite structure by growing NiTiO 3 epitaxially on different substrates and to investigate the dependence of polar and magnetic properties on strain. Epitaxial NiTiO 3 films were deposited on Al 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 , and LiNbO 3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition and characterized using several techniques. The effect of substrate choice on lattice strain, film structure, and physical properties was investigated. Our structural data from X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy shows that substrate-induced strain has a marked effect on the structure and crystalline quality of the films. Physical property measurements reveal a dependence of the weak ferromagnetism and lattice polarization on strain and highlight our ability to control the ferroic properties in NiTiO 3 thin films by the choice of substrate. Our results are also consistent with the theoretical prediction that the ferromagnetism in acentric NiTiO 3 is polarization induced. From the substrates studied here, the perovskite substrate LiNbO 3 proved to be the most promising one for strong multiferroism.",

    "abstract": "Rare Earth- (RE-) doped BiFeO 3 (BFO) thin films were grown on LaAlO 3 substrates by using pulsed laser deposition technique. All of BFO films doped with 10% of RE show a single phase of rhombohedral structure. The saturated magnetization in the Ho- and Sm-doped films is much larger than those reported in literature and was observed at a quite low field as of 0.2 T. As for Pr- and Nd-doped BFO films, Fe 2+ amount is not dominant; thus, ferromagnetism is not favored. As the RE concentration goes up to 20%, all compounds have drastically gone through a structural transition. The RE-doped BFO films have changed from rhombohedral to either pure orthorhombic phase (for Ho, Sm), or a mixed phase of orthorhombic and tetragonal (for Pr, Nd), or pure tetragonal (for Eu). We observed magnetic properties of RE-doped BFO films have significantly changed. While 20% Ho/Sm-doped BFO films have ferromagnetism degraded in comparison with the 10% doping case, the 20% Pr/Nd-doped BFO thin films, whose structure is a mixed phase, have magnetic ordering improved due to the fact that the Fe 2+ amount has become greater. It seems that one can control the magnetic properties of BFO films by using appropriate RE dopants and concentrations.",

Raman spectra and photothermal absorption have also been studied on KDP crystals before and after multiparametric laser conditioning. Photothermal absorption data reveal that absorbance of conditioned KDP crystal decreases with the increase of laser fluence and the damage threshold of low absorption area is higher.

From the results, it was concluded that the dielectric permittivity measured at high frequencies is insensitive to the grain size, while the AC dark conductivity presents a noticeable dependency on this feature.

CdWO 4 monoclinic (wolframite) structure was successfully obtained at 120°C for synthesis times as short as 20 min. This route does not require the use of templates or surfactants and yields self-assembled nanorods with size of around 24 ± 9 nm width and 260 ± 47 nm length.

By changing oxides (MgO and HfO 2 ) and annealing temperature, different annealing dependence of sensitivity was found in MgO-sample and HfO 2 -sample. For the MgO-sample, the anomalous Hall sensitivity reaches 18792 Ω/T in the as-deposited state and significantly reduces as annealing temperature increases. On the contrary, the sensitivity of the as-deposited HfO 2 -sample is only 765 Ω/T, while it remarkably increases with annealing temperature increasing, finally reaching 14741 Ω/T at 240°C. The opposite variation of anomalous sensitivity in two samples originates from the different change of magnetic anisotropy and anomalous Hall resistance during the annealing process. Our study provides a new perspective that both the choice of oxide material and the optimization of annealing treatment are important to the anomalous Hall sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an actively pursuing material of the 2D family due to its semiconducting characteristics, making it a potential candidate for nano and optoelectronics application. MoS2 growth from molybdenum and sulphur precursors by chemical vapor depositions (CVD) is used widely, but molybdates’ conversion into MoS2 via CVD is overlooked previously. Direct growth of MoS2 on the desired pattern not only reduces the interfacial defects but also reduces the complexities in device fabrication. In this work, we combine the wet synthesis and chemical vapor deposition method where sodium molybdate and L-cysteine are used to make a solution. With the dip coating, the mixture is coated on the substrates, and then, chemical vapor deposition is used to convert the chemicals into MoS2.

Comprehensive dielectric studies and charge transportation properties of the grown 3NPTAT crystal are given. The dielectric characteristics of the specimen were carried out in the frequency range of 50 Hz and 5 MHz at different temperatures, namely, 313 K, 333 K, 353 K, and 373 K. From the spectra, it was observed that the slowdown occurs at low temperatures, and the hopping mechanism takes place based on localized charge carriers. The impedance spectroscopic results indicate that there is a single relaxation process that occurs at high frequencies. The variation detected in the material properties of 3NPTAT corresponding to the temperature and frequency has been discussed in detail.",

More precisely, the three-layer optical waveguide structures are considered along with its outermost region being loaded with radially anisotropic liquid crystal material and the inner regions being made of usual silica, as used in conventional optical fibers. In addition to that, LCOF with twists introduced in the form of conducting helical windings at the interface of the silica core and the liquid crystal clad is also taken into account. Emphasis has been put on the power confinements by the lower-order TE modes sustained in the different sections of the LCOF structure. The results demonstrate useful applications of these guides in integrated optics as the power sustained in the liquid crystal section by the excited TE modes remains very high. In the case of twisted clad liquid crystal guides, descriptions are limited to the nature of dispersion relation only under the TE mode excitation, and corresponding to the cases of helix orientations being parallel and perpendicular to the optical axis.",

The cluster full geometrical optimization procedure which is suitable for small nanocrystals and large unit cell that simulates specific parts of larger nanocrystals preferably core part as in the present work. Because of symmetry consideration, large unit cells can reach sizes that are beyond the capabilities of first method. The two methods use ab initio Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, respectively. The results show that both energy gap and lattice constant decrease in their value as the nanocrystals grow in size. The inclusion of surface part in the first method makes valence band width wider than in large unit cell method that simulates the core part only. This is attributed to the broken symmetry and surface passivating atoms that split surface degenerate states and adds new levels inside and around the valence band. Bond length and tetrahedral angle result from full geometrical optimization indicate good convergence to the ideal zincblende structure at the centre of hydrogenated nanocrystal. This convergence supports large unit cell methodology. Existence of oxygen atoms at nanocrystal surface melts down density of states and reduces energy gap.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in cancer treatment is the quantification of biomarkers associated with a specific cancer type. Important biomarkers are the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detached from the main cancer and circulating in the blood. CTCs are very rare and their identification is still an issue. Although CTCs quantification can be estimated by using fluorescent markers, all the fluorescence techniques are strongly limited by the number of emissions (therefore markers) that can be discriminated with one exciting line, by their bleaching characteristics, and by the intrinsic autofluorescence of biological samples. An emerging technique that can overcome these limitations is Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). Signals of vibrational origin with intensity similar to those of fluorescence, but narrower bandwidths, can be easily discriminated even by exciting with a single laser line. We recently showed the benefit of this method with cells fixed on a surface. However, this approach is too demanding to be applied in clinical routine. To effectively increase the throughput of the SERS analysis, microfluidics represents a promising tool. We report two different hydrodynamic strategies, based on device geometry and liquids viscosity, to successfully combine a microfluidic design with SERS.",

The SVM model optimized by the cuckoo search algorithm is abbreviated as CS-SVM. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to decrease the dimension of the spectral data. The top ten principal component factors, whose accumulated variance contribution rate reaches 93.93%, are extracted from the original spectra data and then are applied to CS-SVM. The identification rate of testing sets for CS-SVM is 100%, which is significantly higher than 96.67% identification rate of testing sets for PSO-SVM and Grid search. Experimental results show that CS-SVM can accomplish nondestructive identification for different rubber.

In this work, Si atoms are used to substitute carbon atoms located at the center of the samples. Our calculated results have determined that Si can change the material type by the number of dopants. We found that the transmission spectrum strongly depends on the various widths. The width of eight-zigzag chains exhibits the largest transmission among four- and six-zigzag chains, and the single Si substitution presents larger transmission than the double case. The obtained results are explained in terms of electron localization in the system due to the presence of distortion at edge and impurities. The relationships between the transmission spectrum, the device density of states, and the I-V curves indicate that DZGNRs are the highly potential material for electronic nanodevices.",

    "abstract": "A novel enhancement-mode (E-mode) Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor- (MIS-) HEMT with selective fluorine ion (F − ) treatment is proposed and its mechanism is investigated. The HEMT features the Selective F − treatment both in the AlGaN channel region and in the thick passivation layer between the gate and drain (SFCP-MIS-HEMT). First, the F − in the passivation layer not only extends the depletion region and thus enhances the average electric field (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>-field) between the gate and drain by the assisted depletion effect but also reduces the<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>-field peak at the gate end, leading to a higher breakdown voltage (BV). Second, in the AlGaN channel region, the F − region realizes the E-mode and the region without F − maintains a high drain current (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>).

The length of the critical influence zone is under debate because for some properties, like shear viscosity, the extension is only a few degrees, while for others, such as the density order parameter, the critical influence zone covers up to hundreds of degrees below the critical temperature. Here we show that, for ethane, the experimental critical influence zone covers a wide zone of tens of degrees (below the critical temperature) down to a transition temperature, at which the apparent critical influence zone vanishes, and the transition temperature can be predicted through a pressure analysis of the coexisting bulk liquid phase, using a simple molecular potential. The liquid phases within the apparent critical influence zone show low densities, making them behave internally like their corresponding vapor phases. Therefore, Molecular Dynamics simulations reveal that the experimentally observed wide extension of the critical influence zone is the result of a vapor-like effect due to low bulk liquid phase densities.",

The attention is focused on the band structure fluctuation (BSF) at Fermi level, which is induced by electron-phonon coupling in superconductors, and which is absent in the non-superconducting analogues. The BSF in superconductors results in breakdown of the adiabatic BOA. At these circumstances, chemical potential is substantially reduced and system is stabilized (effect of nuclear dynamics) in the antiadiabatic state at broken symmetry with a gap(s) in one-particle spectrum. Distorted nuclear structure has fluxional character and geometric degeneracy of the antiadiabatic ground state enables formation of mobile bipolarons in real space. It has been shown that an effective attractive e-e interaction (Cooper-pair formation) is in fact correction to electron correlation energy at transition from adiabatic into antiadiabatic ground electronic state. In this respect, Cooper-pair formation is not the primary reason for transition into superconducting state, but it is a consequence of antiadiabatic state formation. It has been shown that thermodynamic properties of system in antiadiabatic state correspond to thermodynamics of superconducting state. Illustrative application of the theory for different types of superconductors is presented.",

X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectrum are employed to characterize the as-prepared sample. Those results indicate that the average size of the as-prepared MgO hollow spheres is about 2 μm. Also, the MgO hollow spheres have the polycrystalline and porous structure, which would provide large specific surface area and plenty active sites for fluoride adsorption. The adsorption properties of the MgO hollow spheres towards fluoride are investigated. The fluoride adsorption kinetics of the MgO hollow spheres fits well the pseudo-second-order model. Also, the kinetic data revealed that the fluoride adsorption was rapid, more than 83% of fluoride could be removed within 40 min. The fluoride adsorption capacity of the hollow MgO spheres is larger than 182.4 mg/g at a pH of 7.0. The as-prepared products maintain excellent adsorption performance in the pH range of 3–11. In addition, the adsorption mechanism also has been discussed. From the FTIR results, a hydroxyl and carbonate coexchange mechanism is proposed. It is believed that the hollow MgO spheres are a potential candidate for fluoride removal.",

Furthermore, we found that the doped Ge atoms in the compound significantly enhance the antiferromagnetic couplings between the nearest neighboring Mn ions, which effectively stabilizes the magnetic ground states. In addition, the nature of the temperature-dependent changes in the volume of the Ge-doped compound was revealed.",

The quality of these diodes determines the output performance of the solar cell. The purpose of this work is to contribute to the investigation of the tunnel electrical resistance of such a multi-junction cell through the analysis of the current-voltage ( J-V ) characteristics under illumination.

Based on Eringen’s theory of nonlocal continuum mechanics, the basic equations of wave motion and laser-induced atomic defect dynamics are derived. Dispersion equation that governs the Rayleigh surface waves in the considered medium is derived and analyzed. Explicit expressions for phase velocity and attenuation (amplification) coefficients which characterize surface waves are obtained. It is shown that if the generation rate is above the critical value, due to concentration-elastic instability, nanometer sized ordered concentration-strain structures on the surface or volume of solids arise. The spatial scale of these structures is proportional to the characteristic length of defect-atom interaction and increases with the increase of the temperature of the medium. The critical value of the pump parameter is directly proportional to recombination rate and inversely proportional to deformational potentials of defects.",

Results of previous micromagnetic simulations and experiments have shown that this field yields an increased value of the Walker breakdown current together with an enlargement of the domain wall width. In order to analytically describe these results, the standard travelling wave ansatz for the steady domain wall motion is here adopted. Results of our investigations reveal the impossibility to reproduce, at the same time, the previous features and suggest the need of a more sophisticated model whose development requires, in turn, additional information to be extracted from ad hoc micromagnetic simulations.",

Both approaches are based upon the so-called dynamical matrix method, a hybrid micromagnetic framework used to investigate the spin-wave normal modes of confined magnetic systems. The approach which was formulated first is the Hamiltonian-based dynamical matrix method. This method, used to investigate dynamic magnetic properties of conservative systems, was originally developed for studying spin excitations in isolated magnetic nanoparticles and it has been recently generalized to study the dynamics of periodic magnetic nanoparticles. The other one, the Lagrangian-based dynamical matrix method, was formulated as an extension of the previous one in order to include also dissipative effects. Such dissipative phenomena are associated not only to intrinsic but also to extrinsic damping caused by injection of a spin current in the form of spin-transfer torque. This method is very accurate in identifying spin modes that become unstable under the action of a spin current. The analytical development of the system of the linearized equations of motion leads to a complex generalized Hermitian eigenvalue problem in the Hamiltonian dynamical matrix method and to a non-Hermitian one in the Lagrangian approach. In both cases, such systems have to be solved numerically.",

With NdFeB layer thickness increasing, both the grain size and the strain firstly reduce and then increase. When NdFeB layer thickness is 750 nm, the strain reaches the minimum value. Meanwhile, both the in-plane and perpendicular coercivities firstly drastically increase and then slowly decrease with NdFeB layer thickness increasing. The highest in-plane and perpendicular coercivities can be obtained at NdFeB layer thickness of 750 nm, which are 21.2 kOe and 19.5 kOe, respectively.

The prediction of transition temperatures can be regarded in several ways, either as an exacting test of theory, or as a tool for identifying theoretical rules for defining new homology models. Popular “first principle” methods for predicting transition temperatures in conventional crystalline superconductors have failed for cuprate HTSC, as have parameterized models based on planes (with or without apical oxygen). Following a path suggested by Bayesian probability, it was found that the glassy, self-organized dopant network percolative model is so successful that it defines a new homology class appropriate to ceramic superconductors. The reasons for this success in an exponentially complex (non-polynomial complete, NPC) problem are discussed, and a critical comparison is made with previous polynomial (PC) theories. The predictions are successful for the superfamily of all ceramics, including new non-cuprates based on FeAs in place of .",

Two pieces of standard single-mode fibers are inserted into the laser cavity and output port to guarantee the truly single-mode output as well as good compatibility with other standard fiber components.

The findings show that the optical group delay in this structure can be enhanced negatively and can be switched from negative to positive due to the excitation of surface plasmon by graphene. It is clear that the negative group delay can be actively tuned through the Fermi energy of the graphene. Furthermore, the delay properties can also be manipulated by changing either the relaxation time of graphene or the distance between the coupling prism and the graphene. These tunable delay characteristics are promising for fabricating grapheme-based optical delay devices and other applications in the terahertz regime.",

The laser annealing by a linear decrease of the CO 2 laser power effectively reduces the residual stress. The residual stress of mitigated sites is characterized by polarimetry, the reduction of the maximum retardance around the mitigated sites with the exposure time of laser annealing fits a stretched exponential equation, and the maximum retardance with optimal laser annealing is reduced (36 ± 3)% compared to that without laser annealing. The residual stress regions are destructively characterized by introducing damage. The critical size of damage leading to fracture propagation for the mitigated sites without laser annealing is in the range of 120~230 μ m, and the corresponding critical size of damage for the mitigated sites with laser annealing is larger than 600 μ m. According to the relationship between maximum damage size and critical stress, the residual stress without laser annealing is in the range of 28–39 MPa and the residual stress with laser annealing is less than 17 MPa.

    "abstract": "The gas-solid compatibility between environmentally friendly insulating gas and copper contacts is worth studying. In this paper, based on density functional theory, the adsorption calculation of CF3I, c-C4F8, five typical decomposition gases, and Cu (1 1 1) surface was carried out. The adsorption energies, transferred charges, charge densities, and densities of states were calculated for different adsorption configurations. Research indicates that there is no obvious charge transfer between the I atom and the Cu atom in the four adsorption sites of Cu (1 1 1) for the CF3I molecule. There is a charge transfer between the F atoms and the Cu top surface. The electrons lost by Cu are transferred to F atoms. In the configurations of different adsorption positions on CF3I and Cu (1 1 1) planes, the top and bridge adsorption energies are −0.835 eV and −0.993 eV, respectively, which are chemical adsorption. Therefore, CF3I is most likely to form adsorption at the top or bridge site of the Cu (1 1 1) surface. The adsorption energy of c-C4F8 gas on Cu (1 1 1) surface is similar to that of CF3I at fcc and hcp sites. The absolute values are all less than 0.8 eV, and the van der Waals force is the main force. The adsorption energies of C2F4 and C3F6 in the five decomposed gases are −1.315 eV and −1.204 eV, respectively. The charge transfer is −0.32 eV and −0.45 eV, respectively. Their values are larger than those of the other gases studied, which belong to chemical adsorption. The smaller values of the remaining three gases belong to physical adsorption. All molecular structures and Cu (1 1 1) planes were not significantly deformed. From a microscopic point of view, the gas can better exist on the copper surface.",

Compared with conventional chemical sensors, the GFCS could discriminate various chemical molecules with selectivity without surface modification. The GFCS system consisted of an unmodified graphene foam chemical sensor, an electrical resistance time domain detection system (ERTDS), and a pattern recognition module. The GFCS has been validated via several chemical molecules discrimination including chloroform, acetone, and ether. The experimental results showed that the discrimination accuracy for each molecule exceeded 97% and a single measurement can be achieved in ten minutes.

Due to the limited modulation bandwidth of the LED, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is particularly preferred in the VLC system to overcome the ISI, which suffers from the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and leads to severe performance loss. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel Zadoff-Chu matrix (ZCM) precoding scheme, which can not only reduce the PAPR, but also provide uniform signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) profile. The theoretical analysis and simulation show that the proposed scheme achieves better PAPR performance compared with the traditional precoding schemes. The experimental demonstration further validates the bit error rate (BER) performance improvement, where the measured BERs are all below the 7% pre-forward error correction (pre-FEC) limit of 3.8 × 10 −3 when the transmitted data rate is 50 Mb/s.",

Moreover, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles are dispersed in the medium with the aim of obtaining a nanocomposite with potential biocide properties. In our case, we use the ZnO particles as tracers to infer from their scattered intensity mechanical information of the suspending medium. We have found that dynamic light scattering experiments provide similar information on the gelling time, about 30 hours, to that obtained from rotational rheology and oscillatory rheology. This result confirms the validity of light scattering, which is a noninvasive technique, to characterize mechanical properties of time evolving hybrid materials through nonperturbative and well-controlled experiments.",

The refilling CLC has different chiral handedness (left or right) and reflection band (at green and red regions). When the wavelength of a probe beam is within the refilled CLC reflection band of the nontemplate region, the device works as an amplitude grating since the sample in the template and nontemplate regions reflects distinct colour region.

Here, a hybrid vanadium dioxide (VO2) metamaterial was designed with switchable properties of band-pass filter and band-stop filter in the frequency range of 0.3–1.6 THz. Simulations demonstrated that under TE polarization, the proposed system acted as band-stop filter with the center frequency of 0.95 THz when VO2 is in the insulating state. Upon the transformation of VO2 into the metallic state, the proposed system behaved as a band-pass filter with a transmittance of &gt;80%. The physical mechanism of the band-pass/band-stop conversion was examined by analyzing the surface current distribution of the designed device. The switchable characteristics of this structure can enable its wide application in tunable THz functional components such as amplitude modulators, polarization control, and intelligent switches.",

    "abstract": "Among different sensing platforms, metamaterials composed of subwavelength or deep subwavelength sized metal resonance elements arrays that are etched on semiconductor substrates or dielectric substrates exhibit excellent characteristics due to the strong localization and enhancement of resonance electromagnetic fields. As a new type of detection method, metamaterial sensors can break through the resolution limit of traditional sensors for a small amount of substance and have the advantages of high sensitivity, fast response, and simple measurement. Significant enhancement of the sensing characteristics of metamaterial sensors was realized by optimizing microstructures (single split-ring, double split-ring, nested split-ring, asymmetric split-ring, three-dimensional split-ring, etc.), using ultrathin substrates or low-index substrate materials, etching away local substrate, and integrating microfluidic channel, etc. This paper mainly reviews the research advance on the improvement of sensing characteristics from optimizing resonance structures and changing substrate materials and morphology. Furthermore, the sensing mechanism and main characteristic parameters of metamaterial sensors are introduced in detail, and the development trend and challenge of metamaterial sensing applications are prospected. It is believed that metamaterial sensors will have potential broader application prospects in environmental monitoring, food safety control, and biosensing in the future.",

In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) combined with the nonequilibrium green’s function (NEGF) formalism to investigate the thermoelectric properties of a ZGNR system by impurity substitution of single and double nitrogen (N) atoms into the edge of the nanoribbon. N-doping changes the electronic transmission probability near the Fermi energy and suppresses the phononic transmission. This results in a modified electrical conductance, thermal conductance, and thermopower. Ultimately, simultaneous increase of the thermopower and suppression of the electron and phonon contributions to the thermal conductance leads to the significant enhancement of the figure of merit in the perturbed (i.e., doped) system compared to the unperturbed (i.e., nondoped) system. Increasing the number of dopants not only changes the nature of transport and the sign of thermopower but also further suppresses the electron and phonon contributions to the thermal conductance, resulting in an enhanced thermoelectric figure of merit. Our results may be relevant for the development of ZGNR devices with enhanced thermoelectric efficiency.",

The position of the corresponding 4f bands relative to the Fermi energy strongly depends on the nuclear charge of Re. In Lu, they lie almost by 0.5 Ryd below and are extremely narrow. In Er, both in LDA and GGA, the 4f bands are found to be very close to the Fermi level . Assuming most of the 4f electrons to be part of the core removes the disagreement almost completely but produces a Fermi surface with a topology markedly different from that proposed in previous investigations. The intersections of the Fermi surface with planes are strongly varying within the Brillouin zone, they do not well match with the sparse experimental results.

Three types of samples with crystallite grain size of &lt;1 μ m (the I-type) and of 2–10 μ m of homogeneous (II-type) and inhomogeneous (III-type) grain distribution have been separated. The simultaneous record of MW-PC and TR-PL responses ensures the same sampling area on the layer under investigation, as both (MW-PC and TR-PL) signals are generated by the same UV laser excitation beam. Two PL bands peaked at 500 and 700 nm were revealed. It has been demonstrated that photoluminescence intensity strongly depends on the properties of the polycrystalline 15–26 μ m thick CdS layers with equilibrium carrier density of about<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mn>1.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>13</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math> cm −3 , which serve as the substrates to form CdS-Cu 2 S junctions.

However, the preparation of gas-sensing materials with a high gas diffusion performance remains a great challenge. Here, through a simple hydrothermal method accompanied with a subsequent thermal treatment, a special porous snowflake-shaped ZnO nanostructure was presented for sensitive detection of VOCs including diethyl ether, methylbenzene, and ethanol. The fabricated gas sensors exhibit a good sensing performance including high responses to VOCs and a short response/recovery time. The responses of the ZnO-based gas sensor to 100 ppm ethanol, methylbenzene, and diethyl ether are about 27, 21, and 11, respectively, while the response times to diethyl ether and methylbenzene are less than 10 seconds. The gas adsorption-desorption kinetics is also investigated, which shows that the gas-sensing behaviors to different target gases are remarkably different, making it possible for target recognition in practical applications.",

In conventional diffusion in SiC, the operating temperature is usually &gt;2050°C while, in this approach, the diffusion temperature is between 1150 and 1300°C. As the conditions of formation of junction in this method essentially differ from conventional diffusion (low temperature and process of diffusion are accompanied by forming structure defects), it is interesting to identify the advantages and disadvantages of a new method of diffusion. Fabricated p-i-n structures have low breakdown voltage between 80 and 140 V (due to the influence of dislocations and micropipes) and are capable of operating at temperatures up to 300°C. Structure has fast switching time and duration of the reverse recovery current less than 10 ns. We believe that because of low diffusion temperature, the concentration of nitrogen related trapping levels is relatively low and as a result the fast switching time is observed in our samples.

The interfacial rheology of three block copolymers was studied by surface pressure isotherm, compression modulus measurements, and compression and expansion hysteresis analysis on the Langmuir trough. The block sequence and ratio play a great role in self-assembly behavior at the interface. Based on surface pressure isotherm analysis, a thin film with low elasticity was achieved for the POSS-PTFEMA 161 -b-PMMA 236 . Moreover, for the block copolymer with same segment sequence (POSS-PMMA 2 - b -PTFEMA), the thin film compression capability is increased with increasing the PMMA ratio. The morphology of the deposited LB thin film was illustrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We observed that a thin film was composed by crater-shaped quasi-2D micelles for POSS-PTFEMA- b -PMMA, while it was proved that only flaky texture was observed for both POSS-PMMA 277 - b -PTFEMA 130 and POSS-PMMA 466 - b -PTFEMA 172 . The thickness and area of flaky aggregates were greatly related to PMMA ratio. The different interface self-assembly structure evolution was proposed based on the interfacial rheology and thin film morphology studies.",

    "abstract": "There has been an explosion of interest in acoustic metamaterial in the last ten years. The tunable negative acoustic metamaterial is an important issue for designing metamaterials. The acoustic metamaterial is restricted by the narrow bandgap of sound waves for the local resonance of metamaterial unit cells. By shifting the sizes of the unit cell, the acoustic metamaterial could potentially overcome the limit of the narrow resonance frequency. In this research, we focus on the resonant behavior of split hollow sphere (SHS) in the waveguide. Firstly, we analyze the resonance characteristics of SHS and get an analytical formula for the effect of geometrical parameters on the resonance frequency. Furthermore, the resonance frequency of SHS is verified with finite-element method analysis based on COMSOL Multiphysics simulation. The results are in good agreement with theory model. It is observed that there is a blue shift of the resonance frequency with the gradual increase of the neck radius of SHS, a V-type response curve with the increase of inner radius of SHS, and a red shift with the increase of outer radius of SHS. Using the method of estimate of resonance, we could get a precisely controllable unit structure with negative effective modulus and offer a way to optimize the realization of double negative acoustic metamaterial.",

The results indicate that the deformation process of the compound droplets in the curved minichannel can be divided into three stages, namely, the initial stage, the turning stage, and the adjustment stage. Both large curved angle and high capillary number of the continuous phase result in the large shear force and high eccentricity of the compound droplet. However, as the radius ratio increases, the influence of the inner droplet on the deformation of the compound droplet transits from enhancing to suppressing.",

In this paper, a novel Zadoff–Chu matrix transform (ZCT) precoding is proposed to improve the performance of the traditional space-time block coding- (STBC-) based multiple-input multiple-output and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system. Compared with the existing orthogonal circulant matrix transform (OCT) precoding scheme, the proposed ZCT precoding achieves a much lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) while maintaining the advantage of the uniform signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which reduces the performance loss caused by LED nonlinearity. To study the system performance further, we set up an experimental demonstration to verify performance improvement under the condition of different driving peak-to-peak voltages (Vpps) and direct current (DC) offsets. Experimental results show that ZCT precoding gains the best bit error rate (BER) performance compared with the traditional and the OCT precoding MIMO-OFDM systems, whose BER is always below the 7% pre-forward error correction (pre-FEC) threshold of 3.8 × 10 −3 .",

    "abstract": "Entanglement can exist not only in the microscopic system (e.g., atom, photon, and ion trap) but also in macroscopic systems. According to recent research, entanglement can be achieved and controlled in superconducting devices. The quantum dynamics and entanglement mechanism of the coupled superconducting phase qubit and a two-level system (TLS) were demonstrated when the bipartite system was under microwave driving. Besides, the results reveal that when the system was experiencing decoherence, entanglement (concurrence) of the coupled superconducting phase qubit and TLS would oscillate damply with microwave driving time, even exhibiting concurrence sudden death and revival. The coupling effect of the superconducting qubit and TLS system and the resonant microwave together help to achieve entanglement, while concurrence death and concurrence revival are dependent on the decoherence source and mechanism, for example, the resonant microwave driving time acting on the bipartite coupling system. Furthermore, the simulation results show the entanglement of the coupled qubit and TLS system also depends on the purity of the initial states of the system. The article carried out a numerical simulation on the entanglement of different initial states, and the results showed that the entanglement of the coupled system changes with different initial states. For different initial states, entanglement, sudden death, and rejuvenation are still visible.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of literature data and our own experimental observations have led to the conclusion that, at high deformation rates, viscoelastic liquids come to behave as rubbery materials, with strong domination by elastic deformations over flow. This can be regarded as a deformation-induced fluid-to-rubbery transition. This transition is accompanied by elastic instability, which can lead to the formation of regular structures. So, a general explanation for these effects requires the treatment of viscoelastic liquids beyond critical deformation rates as rubbery media. Behaviouristic modeling of their behaviour is based on a new concept, which considers the medium as consisting of discrete elastic elements. Such a type of modeling introduces a set of discrete rotators settled on a lattice with two modes of elastic interaction. The first of these is their transformation from spherical to ellipsoidal shapes and orientation in an external field. The second is elastic collisions between rotators. Computer calculations have demonstrated that this discrete model correctly describes the observed structural effects, eventually resulting in a “chaos-to-order” transformation. These predictions correspond to real-world experimental data obtained under different modes of deformation. We presume that the developed concept can play a central role in understanding strong nonlinear effects in the rheology of viscoelastic liquids.",

A weak ferromagnetic behavior was evident which decreased further by adding Cd in the series. Room temperature resistivity measurements performed using four-point probe technique showed that their values lie in the semiconductor range.

In particular, the evolution of depletion layer was investigated by solving Poisson-Boltzmann equation for SnO 2 slab geometry grains. On this basis, the surface energy barrier dependence on layer thickness (30–500 nm) was obtained. The effect of the donor mobility (oxygen vacancies in the bulk) and degree of donor ionization on electric potential inside layer with different thicknesses was discussed. Furthermore, the dependence of per-square conductance on temperature (from 400 K to 700 K) has been computed. It was assumed that the bulk oxygen vacancies (donors) are singly or doubly ionized and mobile. The temperature variations in the carrier mobility were also taken into account.",

Such an approach has given (a) three different contributions to the resulting chemical potential for the superfluid component, (b) a general hydrodynamic equation of superfluid motion, (c) the continuity equation for superfluid flow with a relaxation term involving the phenomenological parameters and , (d) a new version of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation for the modulus of the order parameter which takes into account dissipation effects and reflects the charge conservation property for the superfluid component. The conventional Ginzburg-Landau equation also follows from our continuity equation as a particular case of stationarity. All the results obtained are mutually consistent within the scope of the chosen phenomenological description and, being model-neutral, applicable to both the low- and high- superconductors.",

To enable a quantitative application of the model based on the Debye (exponential) relaxation and the torque driving the Larmor precession, we present analytical solutions for the steady states in presence of circularly and linearly polarized AC magnetic fields. Using the exact analytical solutions, we can confirm the insight that underlies Rosensweig’s introduction of the “chord” susceptibility for an approximate calculation of the losses. As an important consequence, it can also explain experiments, where power dissipation for both fields was found to be identical in “root mean square” sense. We also find that this approximation provides satisfactory numerical accuracy only up to magnetic fields for which the argument of the Langevin function reaches the value 2.8.",

X-ray diffraction patterns showed that all the silicate phosphors have a τ-phase hexagonal unit cell independent of doping. However, d-spacing was reduced for the doped samples, indicating that the interplanar interactions were enhanced. Resultantly, the doped phosphors exhibited relatively larger domains with connectivity than the host, although there were sometimes microscale pores. Photoluminescence spectra stipulated that the optimized doping concentration is x = 0.03 for the silicate Ba1.3Ca0.7-xSiO4:xDy3+ phosphors.

The equilibrium total energy for YbX (X = S, Se, and Te) was calculated as a function of the energy cutoff, k-point grid, and lattice parameter. An optimized lattice parameter of 5.6, 5.66, and 6.136 Å were calculated for YbS, YbSe, and YbTe, respectively. The energy band gaps of YbS, YbSe, and YbTe computed are 1.14, 1.32, and 1.48 eV, respectively. In addition, the low band gap (less than 3 eV) for ytterbium chalcogenides indicated that they may have potential applications in photovoltaic cells and laser diodes. Moreover, the negative dielectric function value for a certain frequency range indicates that these compounds are suitable for specific optical and microwave circuit applications. The result of elastic and thermodynamic property computation reveals that ytterbium chalcogenides are mechanically and thermodynamically stable, which can be useful in a variety of electronic device applications.",

The DFT analysis revealed that the energy bandgap and density of states near the Fermi energy (ɛF) decrease with increasing pressure. Additionally, the influence of pressure on the vibrational properties of YHSe is also examined. The findings of the vibrational properties indicate a stiffening of lattice dynamics under pressure and the identification of negative Gruneisen parameters at certain high symmetry sites. This enhances and deepens the understanding of the vibrational characteristics of YHSe under extreme pressure conditions. Finally, the electron–phonon coupling (EPC) parameter (λ) is examined under different pressures. The examination of EPCs across varying pressures showed a significant increase from 0.826 (0 GPa) to 2.6287 (200 GPa), where an increase in this EPC is found to increase the superconducting critical temperature (Tc). Furthermore, the nonmonotonic relationship between the superconducting critical temperature (Tc) and external pressure (P) in the YHSe compound is observed. Initially, Tc decreases with increasing pressure and then begins to rise again, reaching its peak value at extreme pressure. These findings provide valuable insights into the pressure-dependent properties of YHSe and have important implications for the field of superconductivity in condensed matter physics.",

The specific heat capacity of magnons and the number of magnons are found to decrease in the presence of holes and hole–magnon interaction strength, whereas magnetization and Curie temperature (Tc) increase. Our study also reveals that at a constant finite temperature, an increased number of holes lead to a significant increase in magnetization.

In this work, the efficiency of the cell is increased from 25.93% to 28%, which means a relative increase of 8.2%. The change in impurity density and the length of the layers are employed to achieve maximum efficiency. Increasing the number of layers of the proposed structure does not necessarily lead to an efficiency increment. In this paper, we design a new multijunction solar cell with 9‐layer structure that has higher efficiency as compared to the 5‐layer counterpart.

When the temperature reaches a critical value, the atoms gain a strong ability to diffuse and eventually melt into one liquid sphere.

When the substrate temperature was increased in the range 450°C–750°C, better (011) texturization of VO2(M) films was observed along with an enhancement of their crystallinity. Morphology evolved from small-grained and densely packed VO2(M) grains at 450°C to less packed micro/nanowires at 750°C. Mechanisms behind the crystallinity/morphology evolution were discussed and correlated with the effect of the temperature on the diffusion of the adatoms as well as on the V5+ valence states content in VO2(M) films. Resistivity measurements as a function of temperature revealed that the insulator-to-metal transition features of VO2(M) films (i.e., transition temperature (TIMT), resistivity variation (ΔR), hysteresis width (ΔH), and transition sharpness (ΔT)) are strongly dependent on the processing temperature. In terms of optical properties, it was found that the open (i.e., porous) structure of the films achieved at high temperature induced an improvement of their luminous transmittance. Simultaneously, the enhancement of the films crystallinity with the temperature resulted in better IR modulation ability. The present contribution provides a one-step process to control the morphology of VO2(M) films grown on smooth quartz substrates for applications as switches, memory devices, and smart windows.",

    "abstract": "The critical temperature () of superconductivity in compounds is generally lower smaller with alkali atoms (A). Furthermore decreases with applied pressure. In the BCS model, these trends are explained by the lower density of states at the Fermi level for a decreased lattice constant ( R ). There is more than one counterexample, however, suggesting that BCS does not give the whole truth. The most important one is that the compound with the largest lattice constant, , is not superconducting at all at ambient pressure. In this paper we derive a novel model where a negative lattice contribution to Hubbard U , proportional to 1/R , is taken into account. It is possible to explain why compounds with A = Li, and Na have a low or are not superconducting at all, and why is superconducting only at applied pressure and then with the highest of all alkali fullerides. It is concluded that the density of states mechanism derived in the BCS model is in doubt. Nevertheless superconductivity in depends on electron-phonon coupling. The dominating phonon is the bond stretching phonon, a breathing phonon for the whole fullerene molecular ion.",

Comparing the results with the unusual lattice response in cuprate superconductors, intimate correlation between evolution of local lattice mode and superconductivity is revealed. The results suggest that strong electron-lattice interaction is present as a common ingredient in the microscopic mechanism of superconducting transition. The effect of magnetic impurity atoms in cuprates further indicates that magnetic scattering becomes diluted as long as polaron formation is conserved.

Experimental data are analyzed taking into account possible simple activation and hopping mechanisms of the conductivity in the presence of two impurity bands, the upper and lower Hubbard bands (UHB and LHB, resp.). We demonstrate that the charge transport develops with decreasing temperature from the band edge activation (110–300 K) to the simple activation with much less energy associated with the activation motion in the UHB (28–90 K). Then, the Mott-type variable range hopping (VRH) with spin dependent hops occurs (5–20 K). Finally, the VRH in the presence of the hard gap (HG) between LHB and UHB (2–4 K) takes place.

As annealing proceeded, the precipitates lost coherency to the matrix after reaching a size of 15–20 nm and twin-like structures were consecutively introduced in the particles. The SQUID measurements revealed that the magnetic properties of the specimens correlated with the microstructural evolution. The coercive force initially increased with annealing time but decreased after reaching a peak. Lorentz Microscopy suggested that the initial large increase of magnetization was invoked by a structural transition from fcc to B2 in the precipitates.",

By using the Thomas-Fermi approximation and the method of image charges, we calculate the electrostatic potential and force as a function of the thin film screening length, which is a magnitude related to the amount of free charge in the thin film and is defined as the maximum length that the electric field is able to penetrate in the sample. We show the microscope’s signal on dielectric films can change significantly in the presence of a finite conductivity even in the limit of large screening lengths. This is particularly relevant in determining the effective dielectric constant of thin films from Electrostatic Force Microscopy measurements. According to our model, for example, a small conductivity can induce an error of more than two orders of magnitude in the determination of the dielectric constant of a material. Finally, we suggest a method to discriminate between permittivity and conductivity effects by analyzing the dependence of the signal with the tip-sample distance.",

    "abstract": "Resonant cavity optoelectronic devices, such as vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), resonant cavity enhanced photodetectors (RCEPDs), and electroabsorption modulators (EAMs), show improved performance over their predecessors by placing the active device structure inside a resonant cavity. The effect of the optical cavity, which allows wavelength selectivity and enhancement of the optical field due to resonance, allows the devices to be made thinner and therefore faster, while simultaneously increasing the quantum efficiency at the resonant wavelengths. However, the narrow spectral bandwidth significantly reduces operating tolerances, which leads to severe problems in applications such as optical communication, imaging, and biosensing. Recently, in order to overcome such drawbacks and/or to accomplish multiple functionalities, several approaches for broadening the spectral bandwidth in resonant cavity optoelectronic devices have been extensively studied. This paper reviews the recent progress in techniques for wide spectral bandwidth that include a coupled microcavity, asymmetric tandem quantum wells, and high index contrast distributed Bragg-reflectors. This review will describe design guidelines for specific devices together with experimental considerations in practical applications.",

Using density functional theory with a local density approximation, we simulate the electronic band structure and show the effects of impurity doping (0–3.91%) in graphene on the electron density, refractive index, optical conductivity, and extinction coefficient for each doping percentage. Here, gallium atoms are placed randomly (using a 5-point average) throughout a 128-atom sheet of graphene. These calculations demonstrate the effects of hole doping due to direct atomic substitution, where it is found that a disruption in the electronic structure and electron density for small doping levels is due to impurity scattering of the electrons. However, the system continues to produce metallic or semimetallic behavior with increasing doping levels. These calculations are compared to a purely theoretical 100% Ga sheet for comparison of conductivity. Furthermore, we examine the change in the electronic band structure, where the introduction of gallium electronic bands produces a shift in the electron bands and dissolves the characteristic Dirac cone within graphene, which leads to better electron mobility.",

The high-energy emission is dominant at the regions near the dislocation cores, while the blue emission is enhanced around the dislocation edges.

    "abstract": "Dendritic patterns frequently arise when a crystal grows into its own undercooled melt. Latent heat released at the two-phase boundary is removed by some transport mechanism, and often the problem can be described by a simple diffusion model. Its analytic solution is based on a perturbation expansion about the case without capillary effects. The length scale of the pattern is determined by anisotropic surface tension, which provides the mechanism for stabilizing the dendrite. In the case of liquid crystals, diffusion can be anisotropic too. Growth is faster in the direction of less efficient heat transport (inverted growth). Any physical solution should include this feature. A simple spatial rescaling is used to reduce the bulk equation in 2D to the case of isotropic diffusion. Subsequently, an eigenvalue problem for the growth mode results from the interface conditions. The eigenvalue is calculated numerically and the selection problem of dendritic growth with anisotropic diffusion is solved. The length scale is predicted and a quantitative description of the inverted growth phenomenon is given. It is found that anisotropic diffusion cannot take the stabilizing role of anisotropic surface tension.",

The simulation results clearly indicate that there is a substantial strain applied on both the Au/Ag and Ag/Au core-shell nanoparticles by the Al 2 O 3 matrix. For the Au/Ag nanoparticles, it can be found that the compressive strain existing in the shell is stronger than that on the center of core and reaches the maximum at the interface between the shell and core. In contrast, for the Ag/Au nanoparticles, the compressive strain applied on the core is much stronger than that at the interface and that in the shell. With the shell thickness increasing, both of the strains in the Au/Ag and Ag/Au nanoparticles increase as well. However, the strain gradient in the shell decreases gradually with the increasing of the shell thickness for both of Ag/Au ad Au/Ag nanoparticles. These results provide an effective method to manipulate the strain distributions of the Au/Ag and Ag/Au nanoparticles by tuning the thickness of the shell, which can further have significant influences on the microstructures and physical properties of Au/Ag and Ag/Au nanoparticles.",

It is assumed that the two-species interacting Fermi gas is described by the one-band Hubbard Hamiltonian with an attractive on-site interaction. The discussion is restricted to the BCS side of the Feshbach resonance where the Fermi atoms exhibit superfluidity. The quartic on-site interaction is decoupled via a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation by introducing a four-component boson field which mediates the Hubbard interaction. A functional integral technique and a Legendre transform are used to give a systematic derivation of the Schwinger-Dyson equations for the generalized single-particle Green’s function and the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-particle Green’s function and the associated collective modes. The numerical solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the generalized random phase approximation shows that there exist two distinct sound velocities in the long-wavelength limit. In addition to low-energy (Goldstone) mode, the two-species Fermi gas has a superfluid phase revealed by two roton-like minima in the asymmetric collective-mode energy.",

We investigate the quasi-particle and excitonic properties of type II o-BC2N using many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). The state-of-the-art GW and BSE methods were used to determine the accurate band gap and excited-state characteristics of this material. We simulate the convergence test and structural optimization in DFT, which is the starting point for the GW calculation. We also compute the convergence test of the parameters in GW and BSE. As a result, the bandgap of our system is found to be 2.31 eV and 1.95 eV using the GW approximation and DFT-PBE, respectively. Since the valence and conduction band edges are located at different Brillouin zones, we decide that o-BC2N is an indirect bandgap semiconductor. In addition, by applying the scissor operator, we corrected the quasi-particle bandgap, which shows almost the same result as the GW approximation. Furthermore, using the BSE algorithm, we calculate the optical bandgap of type II o-BC2N to be 4.0 eV with the excitonic effect and 4.4 eV without the excitonic effect. The highest peaks of the imaginary dielectric function with the excitonic effect shift to a lower energy level at 11 eV than without the excitonic effect at 13.5 eV. The electron charge distribution is computed by fixing the hole position. Finally, we suggest that type II o-BC2N is promising for the application of optoelectronic semiconductors.",

The ongoing research on perovskites have shown that these materials are potential light-harvesting mediums. The optical properties of dimethylammonium triiodostanate (II) (DASnI3) a hybrid halide perovskites needs to be studied because it can be a good light absorber material due to the wide band gap exhibited. The real and the imaginary parts of the dielectric is a measure of the extent of light absorption. The GGA+U exchange-correlation implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO was used basing on density functional theory to obtain the optical properties. The DASnI3 has a direct band gap of 2.7 eV with the real part of the dielectric diagram indicating that the maximum value of ε1 (ω) is in the visible range of (3.0–3.5 eV). High absorption peaks were also observed in the visible spectral region at energy of around (3.5–4.5 eV) with several weak peaks observed in the energy range of (4.5–14.0 eV). The band structure and the dielectric functions are important in the study of optical properties. These properties expresses the interaction of light with the material medium and thus the luminescence of the device which are important in the use of DASnI3 as a solar cell material in photovoltaics.",

The results indicated that, after surface modification under the optimal photocatalytic conditions, the surface contact angle of the PI film decreased from 84.4° to 38.8°, and the adhesion strength between the PI film and the electroless copper film reached 0.78 kN/m. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis further demonstrated that carboxyl groups formed on the surface of the PI film after photocatalytic treatment. The surface hydrophilicity and adhesion strength of the surface-modified PI film were enhanced due to the numerous carboxyl groups formed on its surface.

In its original version, the cable was made up of 150 HTS tapes distributed in five slots, twisted along an aluminum core. In this work, taking advantage of a 2D finite element model, able to estimate the cable’s current distribution in the cross-section, a multiobjective optimization procedure was implemented. The aim of optimization was to simultaneously maximize both engineering current density and total current flowing inside the tapes when operating in self-field, by varying the cross-section layout. Since the optimization process involved both integer and real geometrical variables, the choice of an evolutionary search algorithm was strictly necessary. The use of an evolutionary algorithm in the frame of a multiple objective optimization made it an obliged choice to numerically approach the problem using a nonstandard fast-converging optimization algorithm. By means of this algorithm, the Pareto frontiers for the different configurations were calculated, providing a powerful tool for the designer to achieve the desired preliminary operating conditions in terms of engineering current density and/or total current, depending on the specific application field, that is, power transmission cable and bus bar systems.",

It is found that the twinning of the surface bands, observed in photoemission experiment, does not necessarily correspond to the spin-splitting of the surface states caused by the break of the inversion symmetry at the surface. The twinning of the bands of clean Au(111) films can be obtained within nonrelativistic or scalar-relativistic approximation, so that it is not a result of spin-orbit coupling. However, the spin-orbit coupling does not lead to the spin-splitting of the surface bands. This result is explained by Kramers’ degeneracy, which means that the existence of a surface itself does not destroy the inversion symmetry of the system. The inversion symmetry of the Au(111) film can be broken, for example, by means of adsorption, and a hydrogen monolayer deposited on one face of the film indeed leads to the appearance of the spin-splitting of the bands.",

Tapered OMF was fabricated using a high-precision electrically controlled setup, and coatings of HSNs were prepared by meniscus coating method. The transmission loss of three OMFs with different diameters and the same thick coating were tested to determine the relationship between AMC concentrations and transmission loss of coated OMFs. Experimental results showed that the transmission loss increases with increasing concentration of AMCs. The sensitivity for volatile simethicone was 0.0263 dB/mg/m 3 obtained by the coated OMF with diameter of 2.5 μ m, and the sensitivity values of coated OMF with diameters of 5 μ m and 6 μ m were 0.0024 and 0.0018 dB/mg/m 3 , respectively.

The plasmonic features of the Ag NWs were used to assist the ultraviolet (UV) light-induced reduction of the GO coating. The r-GO coatings used to form Ag NWs/r-GO composite structures increased the conductivity of the film by providing more efficient electron conductive pathways. The G/D intensity ratios of the GO and r-GO produced by the UV light-induced method without and with Ag NWs were 0.95, 1.01, and 1.04, respectively. The lowest sheet resistance of the composite films was 7 ohm/sq with approximately 82% transparency in the visible spectrum region. No degradation of the films was observed after 2 months.

In the present computation, the correlation scheme proposed by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof and the exchange scheme of Becke were considered. The hybrid B3PW and Hartree-Fock based profiles were also computed for both compounds. The ionic configurations are performed to estimate the charge transfer on compound formation, and the present study suggests charge transfer from Ba to O and S atoms.

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the growth and physical properties of ZnO thin films on different substrates grown by mist-CVD enhanced with ozone (O3) gas produced by corona discharge plasma using O2. Here, O3 is used to eliminate the defects related to oxygen in ZnO thin films. ZnO thin films are grown on amorphous soda-lime glass (SLG) and single crystals SiO2/Si (100) and c-plane Al2O3 substrates at 350°C of low growth temperature. All ZnO thin films show dominant (0002) diffraction peaks from X-ray diffraction (XRD). As expected, full width at half maximum (FWHM) of (0002) is decreasing in ZnO thin films on single-crystal substrates, especially c-Al2O3 due to similar crystal structure. It is found that the strain in the films is lowest in ZnO/c-Al2O3. The surface morphologies of the thin films are studied with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. Grown ZnO films have a hexagonal and triangular nanostructure with different nanostructure sizes depending on the used substrate types. The calculated surface roughness is dramatically decreased in ZnO/c-Al2O3 compared to the other grown structures. The confocal Raman measurements show the E2(H) peak of ZnO thin films at 437 cm−1. It is suggested that O3 gas produced by corona discharge plasma using O2 can be useful to obtain better crystal quality and physical properties in ZnO thin films.",

Effective refractive index decreases with thickness and frequency increase have been found. Effective refractive index decrease with optical nonlinearity increase and switching to negative values of effective refractive index at a certain value of optical nonlinearity have been found. This meant that the structure behaved like a left-handed material over certain range. We found that the power flow was changing by changing the operating frequency, the dielectric film thickness, and the optical nonlinearity. Also, the effective refractive index and power flow attained constant values over certain values of dielectric constant values.",

This paper conducts experimental tests on a voltage compensation type active superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) prototype and explores the SFCL’s application in a permanent-magnet synchronous generator- (PMSG-) based wind turbine system. The SFCL prototype is composed of a three-phase air-core superconducting transformer and a voltage source converter (VSC) integrated with supercapacitor energy storage. According to the commissioning test and the current-limiting test, the SFCL prototype can automatically suppress the fault current and offer a highly controlled compensation voltage in series with the 132 V electrical test system. To expand the application of the active SFCL in a 10 kW class PMSG-based wind turbine system, digital simulations under different fault cases are performed in MATLAB/Simulink. From the demonstrated simulation results, using the active SFCL can help to maintain the power balance, mitigate the voltage-current fluctuation, and improve the wind energy efficiency. The active SFCL can be regarded as a feasible solution to assist the PMSG-based wind turbine system to achieve low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) operation.",

All the systems considered in this study are structurally stable; however, the stability of defected systems decreases with an increase in defect concentrations. The calculated binding energies of HS used in this study agree with the reported work. Electronic properties of system-I and systems-II reveal that they have metallic characteristics. Our investigation shows that system-I is nonmagnetic and systems-II are magnetic. The magnetic moment in the defected systems (system-IIa, system-IIb, and system-IIc) is developed by unpaired up and down-spins of electrons created in the orbitals of atoms due to vacancy defects in Mo atoms.",

In all approximations, the convergence test of total energy with respect to kinetic energy cutoff, k-point, and lattice constant of CeO2 was performed consequently to increase the accuracy of computations. The O (2p)-Ce (4f) bandgap of CeO2 calculated using DFT + U (3.0 eV) is consistent with experimentally reported value (3.0–3.33 eV) than with LDA (2.2 eV), PBE (2.5 eV), and PBE0 (4.47 eV). Both LDA and PBE underestimated the bandgap of CeO2 while the PBE0 overestimated the bandgap of CeO2 as compared to the experimental value.

In addition, the maximum peak for absorption coefficient was found at about 13 eV for (LDA and PBE) and around 11 eV for DFT + U calculations. Furthermore, the analyses of optical properties support the electronic properties of ceria. The elastic properties such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, Debye temperature, and Debye sound velocity were computed to investigate the mechanical properties of CeO2 and compared with the experimental and theoretical results.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to characterize carefully the as-prepared composites and to confirm the successful preparation of the nanocomposites. The average crystallite size of TiO 2 nanoparticles calculated from XRD pattern using Rietveld analysis is ~35 nm.

Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements were used to investigate the electrical resistive memory properties of GO, GO/TiO 2 , and G/TiO 2 thin films.

Since the deposition of pure PMMA/ATH powder with air as process gas yielded coatings with insufficient abrasion resistance, two modifications of the basic process were investigated. Previous studies showed that replacing air as process gas with forming gas did not enhance the abrasion resistance, but the addition of a phenol-formaldehyde resin (PF) succeeded in stabilising the particle coatings. In this work, results from morphologic and chemical analysis suggested an encasement of the PMMA/ATH particles by plasma-modified PF and thus a fusion of individual particles, explaining the enhanced bonding. Moreover, adhesion tests confirmed an outstanding bonding between the coating and wood as well as glass, which is assumed to result from interactions between the PF’s hydroxyl groups and functional groups on the substrates’ surfaces.

Two types of configurations, a single line coil inductor and a dual line coil inductor, are proposed. Tunable inductance is realized by thermally controlling VO 2 thin film stub to be an insulator or a conductor. The measurements of inductors are taken in the frequencies range from 0.01 GHz to 10 GHz. The electrical model has been developed to derive the corresponding inductance. The results show that the tuning range is about 69% when the temperature changes from room temperature to above the critical temperature of 68°C.",

The near perfect absorption mainly originates from the enhancement of the electric field owing to the excitation of the optical Tamm state (OTS) at the interface between graphene and dielectric Bragg mirror. It has been found that the absorption peak occurs at specific incident angles, which can be employed for realizing the frequency and angular absorbers. Further, we demonstrate that the position of the absorption peak can be tuned by changing the Fermi energy of graphene. Moreover, the behaviors of the near perfect absorption are strongly related to the dielectric constants and thicknesses of the surrounding dielectrics. The tunability of graphene-DBR structure absorption may help to find favorable applications for the realization of high-performance graphene optoelectronic devices.",

Meanwhile, the MIMO mode switches between spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity adapting to the channel correlation, where the modulation order solved by adaptive OFDM modulation is chosen as the switching criterion. Experimental results validate data rates improvement over the pure spatial multiplexing and the pure transmit diversity system, where BERs are all below the 7% preforward error correction (pre-FEC) threshold of 3.8 × 10 −3 in experiments.",

And the insulator-metal transition, charge/orbital ordering transition, and paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition are suppressed by the compressive strain. Consequently, the related electronic and magnetic transition temperatures decrease with an increase in the compressive strain.

    "abstract": "Diffuse scattering from a crystal contains valuable information about the two-body correlations (related to the nanoscale order) in the material. Despite years of development, the detailed analysis of single crystal diffuse scattering (SCDS) has yet to become part of the everyday toolbox of the structural scientist. Recent decades have seen the pair distribution function approach to diffuse scattering (in fact, total scattering) from powders become a relatively routine tool. However, analysing the detailed, complex, and often highly anisotropic three-dimensional distribution of SCDS remains valuable yet rare because there is no routine method for undertaking the analysis. At present, analysis requires significant investment of time to develop specialist expertise, which means that the analysis of diffuse scattering, which has much to offer, is not incorporated thorough studies of many compounds even though it has the potential to be a very useful adjunct to existing techniques. This article endeavours to outline in some detail how the diffuse scattering from a molecular crystal can be modelled relatively quickly and largely using existing software tools. It is hoped this will provide a template for other studies. To enable this, the entire simulation is included as deposited material.",

The goal was to investigate films’ magnetic and superconducting properties, their reciprocal interplay, and the role played by the Fe buffer layer in modifying them. Morphological characterization and Energy Dispersive X-ray analyses on the Fe-buffered sample demonstrate the presence of diffused Fe close to the Co-doped Ba-122 outer surface as well as irregular holes in the overlying superconducting film. These results account for hysteresis loops obtained with magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements and observed at both room and low temperatures. The magnetic pattern was visualized by magneto-optical imaging with an indicator film. Moreover, we investigated the onset of superconductivity through a measure of the superconducting energy gap. The latter is strictly related to the decay time of the excitation produced by an ultrashort laser pulse and has been determined in a pump-probe transient reflectivity experiment. A comparison of results relative to Co-doped Ba-122 thin films with and without Fe buffer layer is finally reported.",

Besides a general review, our own work in this area is described in great depth. Apart from theoretical analysis of the existence and properties of spin vortices and antivortices, the possible experimental consequences and signatures are also highlighted. In particular, the distinguishing features between the even and odd charged topological excitations are brought out through a detailed analysis of the topological term in the quantum action. Moreover, an interesting symmetry property is predicted between the excitations from a ferromagnetic model and an antiferromagnetic model. Through a novel approach of ours, a bridge is established between field theoretical formalism and the well-known statistical mechanical treatment of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition involving these topological excitations. Furthermore, a detailed phenomenological analysis of the experimentally observed static and dynamic magnetic properties of the layered magnetic materials, possessing XY anisotropy in the in-plane spin-spin couplings, is undertaken to test the theoretical predictions regarding the behaviour of these excitations. The importance and the crucial role of quantum spin fluctuations in these studies are also brought out very clearly by our analysis.",

    "abstract": "Coherent states, where a macroscopic system of many quantum particles exhibits properties of a single quantum particle, have been a topic of intense investigations in physics. The formation of such states is usually accompanied by and experimentally indicated by dissipationless transport of mass, charge, or spin. Excitonic condensation occurs when an electron-hole system develops spontaneous coherence between the electron and hole bands. This effect, predicting the coherent state of electron-hole pairs, has led to a deeper theoretical understanding of condensates with metastable particles. Over the past two decades, this field has seen tremendous experimental developments, starting with the development of spatially separated electron and hole quantumwells, which increased the exciton lifetime by orders of magnitude. The increased exciton lifetime, in turn, has led to a detailed exploration of electrical transport, drag, and photoluminescence properties in such double quantum well systems. These systems have been traditionally fabricated using semiconductor heterojunctions; however, recently, graphene and topological insulators have emerged as promising new candidates as well. The goal of this special issue is to review the recent theoretical and experimental developments on coherent states in such systems. With the rapid progress in fabrication techniques, it is possible to study coherent states with multiple broken symmetries. Thus, this issue starts with the state of experimental efforts on excitonic condensation in semiconductor quantum wells that are doped or optically pumped. It is followed by theoretical analyses of excitonic condensation in bilayer quantum Hall systems. The last paper extends the discussion on coherent states in graphene double layers.",

The possibility of the sensor is demonstrated theoretically by using three-dimensional finite-difference time domain (3D-FDTD). The corresponding experiments have also been carried out in order to demonstrate the theoretical results. Microfibers are fabricated by using hydrogen-oxygen flame-heated scanning fiber drawing method and the nanoscale-structured film coated on the surface of microfibers is deposited by using dip coating process. Then an array of microfibers is assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of the device.

In this paper, the analytical expressions based on elastic mechanism are presented to estimate the residual stresses of the restrained mortar ring by considering the comprehensive effects of hydration heat, autogenous and drying shrinkage, creeping, and restraint. In the present analytical method, the stress field of the restrained ring is treated as the superposition of those caused by hydration heat, external restraint, autogenous and drying shrinkage, and creep. The factors including the properties of materials, environmental parameters such as relative humidity and temperature, the geometry effect of specimen, and the relative constraint effects of steel ring to mortar ring, are taken into account to predict the strain development with age of mortar. The temperature of the ring, the elastic modulus, the creep strain, and the split tensile strength are measured to validate the model. The age of cracking is predicted by comparing the estimated maximum tensile stress of the restrained mortar ring with the measured split tensile strength of specimen. The suitability of the present analytical method is assessed by comparing with the restraint ring test and a soundly good agreement is observed.",

The energy splitting of the coupled spin system is found through an approach that computes the noise-averaged frequency. At low magnetic field intensity, the decoherence (or entangled state) of a coupled spin system is dominated by the noise intensity. The effects of the magnetic field pulse and the spin gap antiferromagnetic material used suggest to us that they may be used as tools for the direct observation of the tunneling splitting through the LZ transitions in the sudden limit. We found that the dynamical frequencies display basin-like behavior decay with time, with the birth of entanglement, while the LZ transition probability shows Gaussian shape.",

The considered models of nanotubes below 5 Å diameter are armchair (3,3), zigzag (5,0), and chiral (4,2). The impurity chosen for the study is nitrogen and concentration of impurity atoms is limited to two. The study reveals that (3,3) BNT retains its metallic nature after nitrogen doping. However, metallicity gets increased which is attributed by the excess electrons of nitrogen. Further, it also brings out that (5,0) BNT which is originally metal transforms into semiconductor after nitrogen interaction and the band gap at G point increases with the impurity. Moreover, the band gap of (4,2) BNT reduces significantly and turns into semimetal for nitrogen doping. Thus, the nitrogen impurity has the predominant effect on the electronic properties of BNTs and therefore can be regarded as suitable candidates for nanoelectronic and field emission devices.",

Hence, we should not overlook device effects in measurements as we do by assuming naively that photoluminescence (PL) is bulk emission free from surface effects. By replacing this unjustified assumption with a proper model for GaN surface devices, their yellow band PL becomes surface-assisted luminescence that allows for the prediction of the weak electroluminescence recently observed in n-GaN devices when holes are brought to their surfaces.",

Film composition and deposition parameters were investigated for their bearing on film electrical and optical properties. More than one transport mechanism is indicated.

Theoretical descriptions in terms of quantum Hall ferromagnetism or thin-film superfluidity can be developed to explain these phenomena. In either case, merons can be identified as important low energy excitations. We demonstrate that a model in which puddles of merons induced by disorder, separated by narrow regions of interlayer coherence— a coherence network —can naturally explain many of the imperfect superfluid finite temperature properties that are observed in these systems. The periodic realization of this model shows that there can be low energy excitations beyond the superfluid mode. These are associated with transitions between states of different meron number in the puddles, where we argue that merons should be unbound at any temperature, and which can have important implications for the effect of quantum fluctuations on the system.",

We study the conditions to improve the durability of the stored information by minimizing the repulsive energy among wires with parallel magnetization within the same bar but interacting with attractive energy with wires in the neighboring bar. The following parameters are varied to minimize the energy of the system: relative amount of magnetization orientation within the bar code area in any orientation, width of the bars, and distribution of wider bars to the outside or to the inside of the code. It is found that durability of the code is favored for equal amount of magnetization in each direction, abundance of narrow bars trying to locate a few wider ones towards the center. Three real commercial optical bar codes taken at random were mapped into magnetic bar codes; it is found that the corresponding magnetic energies are similar to those analyzed here which provides a realistic test for this approach.",

Current polarity is a negligible factor in the observed trend. Additionally, the observed change in contact angles is translated into the corresponding change in solid-liquid interfacial tension using the equation of state for liquid interfacial tensions. The solid-liquid interfacial tension decreases under DC. DC-induced promotion of solute diffusion coefficient is likely to play an important role in determining the wettability and solid-liquid interfacial tension under DC.",

Up to date the unique way to treat their anisotropic elastic properties nearby the free surface region is to use the integral formalism, which assumes no dislocation core size and needs numerical double integrations. In a first stage of the work, a new and alternative approach to the integral formalism is developed using double Fourier series and the concept of a finite core size, which is often observed in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. In a second stage, the integral formalism and the Fourier series approaches are applied to the important case of a TD piercing the basal free surface of a hexagonal crystal. For this particular geometry, easy-to-use expressions are derived and compared to a third approach previously known for a plate-like crystal. Finally, the numerical interest and the convergence of these approaches are tested using the basal free surface of the GaN compound, in particular for TDs with Burgers vectors c and ( a + c ).",

Changing the radiation frequency also shifts the spatial position of the resonant region so that high level of absorption may be achieved in wide frequency range.

Numerical results showed that the spatial walk-off effect transferred phase modulation partly to the signal beam as the pump phase was modulated. Moreover, the modulation amplitude became increasingly severe as the nonlinear length extended. In the absence of phase aberration in the initial input signal, the induced phase aberration in the output signal was assumed as the differential form of the pump beam phase. As the pump beam intensity was modulated, the spatial walk-off effect reduced the influence of pump beam noise on beam quality and the angular spectrum but reduced signal gain simultaneously; thus, it may do more harm than good in the OPCPA process.

The effect of the PVA content (0.0–15.0 wt%) on the electrochemical properties and morphology of Li 1.25 Ni 0.2 Co 0.333 Fe 0.133 Mn 0.333 O 2 was investigated. Analysis of Li 1.25 Ni 0.2 Co 0.333 Fe 0.133 Mn 0.333 O 2 X-ray diffraction patterns by RIETAN-FP program confirmed the layered α -NaFeO 2 structure. The discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency of Li 1.25 Ni 0.2 Co 0.333 Fe 0.133 Mn 0.333 O 2 in the first cycle were improved with increasing PVA content. In particular, the best material reached a first discharge capacity of 206.0 mAhg −1 and best rate capability (74.8 mAhg −1 at 5 C). Meanwhile, the highest capacity retention was 87.7% for 50 cycles. Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that as the PVA content increases, the charge-transfer resistance decreases.",

For the main formulations to get the analytical solutions of the thermal stress, displacement, carrier density, and temperature during the nanoscale thermo-photo-electric medium, the Laplace transformation approach in one dimension (1D) of a thin circular plate is utilized. To create the physical fields, mechanical forces and thermal loads are applied to the semiconductor’s free surface. To acquire the full solutions of the research areas in the time-space domains, the inverse of the Laplace transform is applied with several numerical approximation techniques.

The resulting structures exhibit line defects which either connect the facing plates or remain confined within the layers near confining plates. The first structure is stable in relatively thin cells and the latter one in thick cells. We focused on structures at the threshold regime where both structures compete.

The properties studied were optical absorption coefficient (AC) and change in refractive index (CRI) of the quantum wire. In particular, effect of an inverse parabolic potential on the optical properties of CQWs was investigated. This was done by solving the Schrödinger equation within the effective mass approximation to obtain the wave functions. The inverse parabolic potential reduces transition energies and therefore redshifts peaks of the AC, as well as the anomalous dispersion region of the dependence of change in refractive index on the photon energy. The inverse parabolic potential also has effect on the magnitudes of these optical quantities, reducing the AC and enhancing the CRI. These properties of the inverse parabolic confining electric potential can have a wide range of applications in nanodevice technology, some details of which are discussed.",

Further investigation of the longitudinal magnetoresistance for the magnetic field parallel to the electrical current shows a small nonmonotonic magnetoresistance that is attributed to a competition of weak-antilocalization effects and a topological term related to the chiral anomaly.",

    "abstract": "As an indirect band gap semiconductor, germanium (Ge) can be transformed into a direct band gap semiconductor through some specific modified methods, stress, and alloying effect. Direct band gap-modified Ge semiconductors with a high carrier mobility and radiation recombination efficiency can be applied to optoelectronic devices, which can improve the luminous efficiency dramatically, and they also have the potential application advantages in realizing monolithic optoelectronic integration (MOEI) and become a research hotspot in material fields. Among the various implementations of Ge band gap-type conversion, the related methods that are compatible with the Si process are most promising. It is such a method to etch around the Ge epitaxial layer on the Si substrate and introduce the biaxial tensile stress by SiGe selective filling. However, the influence of the width of the epitaxial layer, Ge composition, and Ge mesa region width on strain distribution and intensity is not clear yet. Accordingly, a finite element stress model of the selective epitaxy-induced direct band gap Ge scheme is established to obtain the material physical and geometric parameters of the Si 1− x Ge x growth region. The result of finite element simulation indicates when the Si 1− x Ge x epitaxial layer is 150–250 nm wide and the Ge composition is 0.3∼0.5, Ge mesa with 20–40 nm in width can be transformed into direct band gap semiconductors in the depth of 0–6 nm. The theoretical results can provide an important theoretical basis for the realization of subsequent related processes.",

At zero pressure, the material portrayed a semiconducting property with a direct bandgap of ≈1.7 eV. As we subjected the material to pressure, the band gap was observed to reduce until it disappeared.

The effect of disorder on superconductivity of 2D systems was found analytically using Green’s function formalism. The results of our calculation revealed that disorder induced due to randomly distributed superconducting islands enhances decoherence of Cooper pairs and suppresses superconductivity. We have also determined the critical value of disorder at which the 2D system completely loses its superconducting properties. Below this critical value of disorder, the system acts as a superconductor, a system with zero electrical resistance. Above the critical value, it acts as an insulator, a system with infinite electric resistance. This is a fascinating result because a direct transition from the state of the infinite conductivity to the opposite extreme of infinite resistivity is unexpected in the theory of condensed matter physics.",

    "abstract": "The microstructure evolution of liquid silicon carbide (SiC) during rapid solidification under different pressure values is simulated with the Tersoff potential using molecular dynamics. The structure evolution characteristics of SiC are analyzed by considering the pair distribution function, bond angle distribution, coordination number, and the diagrams of the microstructure during rapid solidification. The results show that the average energy of atoms gradually increases with pressure. When the pressure reaches 100 GPa, the average energy of the atom is greater than the average energy of the atom in the initial liquid state. Under different pressures, the diffusion of atoms tends to remain stable at a temperature of about 3700 K. The application of pressure has a major impact on the arrangement of atoms, except on the third-nearest neighbor, while the impact on the nearest neighbor and the second-nearest neighbor is relatively small. The pressure increases the medium-range order of the system. The coordination numbers of Si and C atoms gradually decrease with the decrease in temperature and increase in pressure. Pressure changes the microstructure of the SiC amorphous system after solidification, and the density can be increased by adjusting the coordination number of atoms. As the pressure increases, the SiC amorphous system exhibits a dense structure with coordination numbers of 4, 5, 6, and 7.",

XRD analysis of 1100°C sintered samples revealed that all the samples were crystallized in a single-phase cubic spinal structure. The microstructural and magnetic properties of slow cooled (furnace-cooled) and fast cooled (quenched) Mg-Cu ferrites have been studied using the scanning electron microscope (SEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and Mössbauer spectroscopy after sintering at 1200°C. Homogeneous coaxial grains did not form for any furnace-cooled samples, while for the quenched sample, homogeneous grains were clearly visible even without doping with Cu. Substantial grain growth was witnessed by the samples with higher copper content for both cooling conditions, whereas quenched samples possessed a smaller grain size compared to furnace-cooled samples. The saturation magnetization experienced a higher value for quenched samples compared to furnace-cooled samples with increasing Cu content except for x = 0.4. The sextet pattern of Mössbauer spectroscopy confirmed all the samples were ferromagnetic in nature. Chemical shift, quadrupole shift, hyperfine field, and site occupancy of Fe3+ were also obtained using Mössbauer spectroscopy.",

Interacting photonic crystals are composed of silicon pillars in air, where their outermost layers facing each other are annular. Surface modes are identified through supercell band structure computations, while their excitation by the electromagnetic waves through a perpendicular insertion waveguide is demonstrated using finite-difference time-domain simulations. Lifting the degeneracy between the surface modes as a consequence of bringing two identical photonic crystal surfaces to a sufficient distance results in evanescent coupling in a beating manner whose beat length linearly varies between 10 and 20 periods up to a frequency at which both surface modes travel with the same group velocity. The surface mode coupling phenomenon could be employed either to enhance sensitivity or to reduce device size in bio/chemical sensor applications since the effective travelling length of surface waves increases by about 3.5 times due to evanescent coupling.",

The research work emphasized the analysis of transition metal atoms, including their valence state and coordination number, in order to better understand the effect of transition metal cations on the color origin. The results showed that the blue color of the crystal is caused by the strong absorption at 725 nm in the red spectrum, which generates a symmetrical and wide absorption band. The absorption band at 725 nm is caused by charge transfer between Fe2+ at the Y site and Fe3+ at the Z site. Other ions in the crystal did not generate absorption lines in the visible spectral range. Besides position, its valence state and coordination number were clarified to reveal color variation and the origin of tourmaline. Most importantly, this spectroscopic analysis method makes the coloration mechanism of charge transfer that is difficult to be uncovered to be clearly revealed, which will provide an available material and chemical method to investigate the structure-property relationship for gems as well as reveal the genesis of beautiful colors.",

We demonstrate that the temperature gradient between the right and the left electrodes can generate spin-up (SU) and spin-down (SD) currents moving in opposite orientations. Moreover, the mentioned currents possess approximately the same magnitudes, indicating a nearly nondissipative spin Seebeck effect. We also find that these currents are significantly dissimilar for the two photochromic isomers at different temperature gradients, demonstrating the excellent system’s switching nature. The obtained results reveal that the light can control the thermal spin transport properties.",

The electronic structure of graphane nanoflakes was calculated by means of the semiempirical tight-binding method. It is found that graphane nanoflakes can be characterized as dielectric. The energy gap of these particles decreases with increasing of the length tending to a certain value. At the same time, the ionization potential of graphane also decreases.

    "abstract": "The temperature-dependent stress state in the AlGaN barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN heterostructure grown on sapphire substrate was investigated by ultraviolet (UV) near-resonant Raman scattering. Strong scattering peak resulting from the A 1 (LO) phonon mode of AlGaN is observed under near-resonance condition, which allows for the accurate measurement of Raman shifts with temperature. The temperature-dependent stress in the AlGaN layer determined by the resonance Raman spectra is consistent with the theoretical calculation result, taking lattice mismatch and thermal mismatch into account together. This good agreement indicates that the UV near-resonant Raman scattering can be a direct and effective method to characterize the stress state in thin AlGaN barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT heterostructures.",

The Cd atom does not by itself modify significantly the electronic structure of the surface, but the defect pairs have important influences. They result in a down shift of valence band maximum and form a hole barrier at the surface, which can prevent holes from reaching the surface and reduce the recombination of carriers.",

    "abstract": "In the past few decades, silicon (Si) complementary metaloxide-semiconductor (CMOS) field-effect transistors have been scaled exponentially over time for the demand of drive current enhancement and cost reduction.As the technology node advances into sub-20 nm regimes, Si CMOS encounters immense challenges from both processing and theoretical perspectives.To maintain or further improve the transistor performance, Ge-based electronic transistors are explored as Ge exhibits higher hole and electron mobilities.As compared with the Si CMOS process, the process for fabricating high performance Ge-based transistors is still under development.This special issue aims to address some of the challenges encountered in the state-of-the-art technology, for both the Si-and Ge-based electronic transistors.For Ge MOSFETs, interface engineering and gate dielectric engineering are necessary to reduce the electrical active defects in the Ge surface and the high-/Ge interface.Other than Ge, SiGe is another possible channel material for the future CMOS technology.SiGe could be obtained by directly growing on Si substrate and therefore it has better compatibility with Si CMOS technologies.Besides the research works on Ge-based transistors, this special issue also includes some papers on the Si lateral diffused MOS (LDMOS).Novel structural designs were demonstrated to improve the performance and reliability of the Si LDMOS.Last but not least, this issue also reports a work on increasing the responsivity of the Si n-MOSFET photodetectors.We hope that readers of this special issue will find not only the accurate and most updated data in the papers, but also important solutions for the existing issues in the theory and fabrication of Si-and Ge-based electronic transistors.",

However, there have been few detailed reports about the polysilicon resistors’ characteristics, like voltage and temperature coefficients and breakdown behaviors which are critical parameters of high voltage applications. In this study, we experimentally find that the resistance of the polysilicon resistor with a relatively low doping concentration shows negative voltage and temperature coefficients, while that of the polysilicon resistor with a high doping concentration has positive voltage and temperature coefficients. Moreover, from the experimental results of breakdown voltages of the polysilicon resistors, it could be deduced that the breakdown of polysilicon resistors is thermally rather than electrically induced. We also proposed to add an N-type well underneath the oxide to increase the breakdown voltage in the vertical direction when the substrate is P-type doped.",

    "abstract": "Intermolecular forces responsible for adhesion and cohesion can be classified according to their origins; interactions between charges, ions, random dipole—random dipole (Keesom), random dipole—induced dipole (Debye) are due to electrostatic effects; covalent bonding, London dispersion forces between fluctuating dipoles, and Lewis acid-base interactions are due to quantum mechanical effects; pressure and osmotic forces are of entropic origin. Of all these interactions, the London dispersion interaction is universal and exists between all types of atoms as well as macroscopic objects. The dispersion force between macroscopic objects is called Casimir/van der Waals force. It results from alteration of the quantum and thermal fluctuations of the electrodynamic field due to the presence of interfaces and plays a significant role in the interaction between macroscopic objects at micrometer and nanometer length scales. This paper discusses how fluctuational electrodynamics can be used to determine the Casimir energy/pressure between planar multilayer objects. Though it is confirmation of the famous work of Dzyaloshinskii, Lifshitz, and Pitaevskii (DLP), we have solved the problem without having to use methods from quantum field theory that DLP resorted to. Because of this new approach, we have been able to clarify the contributions of propagating and evanescent waves to Casimir energy/pressure in dissipative media.",

The structure involves a deviation from hexagonal configurations found in all other known borophene polymorphs. The decagon-shaped hollow is highly related to the anisotropy of the structure, which results in three types of boron atoms with different electronic properties in the structure. In the study, the electronic structure and density of states of this novel structure were investigated with the help of density functional theory calculations. The electronic structure of Ogee-Borophene shows Dirac cone formations near the Fermi level. The discovery of a novel borophene polymorph, Ogee-Borophene, with irregular-shaped hollows represents a different point of view in the 2D materials field. The unique electronic properties of this material suggest that Ogee-Borophene has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, including transistors, and selective sensor applications without the need for additional doping.",

As expected, important contribution to the diffusion in the porous medium is found to be made by the walls of the pores: in SiC, the vacancy surface diffusion coefficient on the walls appears to exceed that in the bulk of the material by an order of magnitude. When thermal treatment transforms pore channels into closed voids, pathways for accelerated diffusion cease to exist and diffusion rates in porous and nonporous SiC become similar.",

Two calculation cells with different surface areas were prepared. In these cells, O atoms were located at the Si–Si bonds in the first layer (A-bonds) and at the Si–Si bonds between the first and second layers (B-bonds). We found that (i) the most stable site of one O atom was the A-bond, and (ii) an O (A-bond) –Si–O (A-bond) was the most stable for two O atoms with a coverage ratio of while an O (A-bond) –Si–O (B-bond) was the most stable for . The stability of O (A-bond) –Si–Si–O (A-bond) was less than the structures obtained in (ii). The other calculations showed that the unoxidized A-bonds should be left when a coverage ratio of is close to 1. These simulations suggest that the O atoms will form clusters in the initial stage of oxidation, and the preferential oxidation will change from the A-bonds to the B-bonds up to the formation of 1 monolayer (ML) oxide.

Specifically, the three-dimensional Gaussian-distribution function was used to construct the Preisach densities for extracting the associated hysteresis loops. In particular, the influences of three key Gaussian Preisach density characteristics (i.e., density sharpness, density center, and splitting densities) on hysteresis behavior were examined. It was found that sharper density induces more harmonized domain switching, so polarization derivative is enhanced at the coercivity, while the density center indicates the range of external field at which most switching occurs. Moreover, the splitting of the density was found to represent pinching in hysteresis loops, where material tends to actively respond in two different ranges of external field. Consequently, based on these results, significant hysteresis behavior can be revealed using minimal parameters via appropriate mathematical function; that is, another step enhances the fundamental understanding in the hysteresis topic using the Preisach framework.",

Besides, the self-made automobile heterodyne interferometer has some much more merits, for example, automobile control, a simple setup, in real-time test, reliability, and so forth. Besides, it is very stable because of its common optical path insensitive to environmental disturbances. And its feasibility is demonstrated.",

Optical film with variable size microlens array embedded with microvoids was designed and manufactured. FRED software was used to simulate optical performance. Microvoids were quantitatively embedded in the PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) optical film. Under the quantitative control of air pressure, those microvoids inside the optical film can cause light diffusion. The compound optical film with embedded microvoids, multiaspect ratio, and variable size microlens array can be fabricated quickly without substrate. Luminance colorimeter BM-7A from TOPCON was used to carry out the optical measurement. According to the measured data, the compound optical film with embedded microvoids can enhance the luminance up to 5% and the uniformity up to 6.5% ~ 8.4%. The optical efficiency can be improved via the compound optical film.",

As the growth in large-scale wafers speeds up, bowing effects are becoming more and more important. Wafer bowing has a direct impact on the yield in modern mass-production compound semiconductor industries. By using finite element analysis software, the bowing deformation of the GaN wafer on sapphire substrate can be studied. This paper summarizes the causes of bowing deformation, builds the mathematical model, and deduces the relation equation of the wafer bowing. The results show that epitaxial wafer bowing has a linear relationship with the square of the diameter of the substrate but has little relationship with the thickness of the substrate. Moreover, the relation equation of the wafer bowing is also simplified finally.",

Specifically we use this approximation to study the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model on a square lattice far from half filling. In this situation, we calculate the specific heat and find that when the filling decreases, that is, antiferromagnetic correlations become less important, the agreement between DMFA and QMC results increases. Our results show that the DMFA can be a valuable technique for studying the thermodynamic properties of the Hubbard model also on a square lattice, but within a parameter range in which the antiferromagnetic correlations are not important.",

Previous study shows that the critical current is affected by the layout of the tapes such as gaps and the current feeding mode. In the stacked tape conductors, the critical current of BSCCO tapes shows strong dependence on the current feeding directions between the tapes. The critical current is improved when the opposite-direction current is applied to them and degraded for the same-direction current feeding mode because of strong magnetic field interaction between them from the transport current in each tape. This paper presents the measurements of the critical currents of a BSCCO tape in the stacked conductors with the ferromagnetic materials. By using the ferromagnetic materials surrounding the tapes, self-field of HTS tapes is affected and their critical currents are improved by more than 10%. Ferromagnetic shunt effects on the critical current of HTS tape are reported through the magnetic field analysis.",

But there are few theoretical studies, especially the theoretical studies of monolayer CaHBr. We use the first-principles method to calculate the structure, elastic properties, and lattice thermal conductivity of the monolayer CaHBr based on the Boltzmann transport equation. We obtain a stable crystal structure by the optimization of monolayer CaHBr. By calculating the elastic constant of monolayer CaHBr, its mechanical stability is proved, and the elastic limit of monolayer CaHBr is obtained by biaxial tensile strain on monolayer CaHBr. And the corresponding phonon spectra show no imaginary frequency, indicating the dynamic stability of the monolayer CaHBr. By the ShengBTE code, we calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of the monolayer CaHBr, the iterative solution of BTE and RTA at 300 K–1200 K is obtained, and the lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature is <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:msubsup> <a:mi>κ</a:mi> <a:mi>ι</a:mi> <a:mrow> <a:mtext>BTE</a:mtext> </a:mrow> </a:msubsup> <a:mo>=</a:mo> <a:mrow> <a:mn>2.469</a:mn> <a:mtext> </a:mtext> <a:mtext>W</a:mtext> </a:mrow> <a:mo>/</a:mo> <a:mrow> <a:mtext>m</a:mtext> <a:mo>⋅</a:mo> <a:mtext>K</a:mtext> </a:mrow> </a:math> and <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <c:msubsup> <c:mi>κ</c:mi> <c:mi>ι</c:mi> <c:mrow> <c:mtext>RTA</c:mtext> </c:mrow> </c:msubsup> <c:mo>=</c:mo> <c:mrow> <c:mn>2.201</c:mn> <c:mtext> </c:mtext> <c:mtext>W</c:mtext> </c:mrow> <c:mo>/</c:mo> <c:mrow> <c:mtext>m</c:mtext> <c:mo>⋅</c:mo> <c:mtext>K</c:mtext> </c:mrow> </c:math> , respectively.

    "abstract": "The electronic structure of GaSe/silicane (GaSe/SiH) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure in response to a vertical electric field and strain was studied via first-principle calculations. The heterostructure had indirect band gap characteristics in the range [−1.0, −0.4] V/Å and direct band gap features in the range [−0.3, 0.2] V/Å. Furthermore, a type-II to type-I band alignment transition appeared at −0.7 and −0.3 V/Å. Additionally, the GaSe/SiH vdW heterostructure had a type-II band alignment under strain, but an indirect to direct band gap semiconductor transition occurred at −3%. These results indicated that the GaSe/SiH vdW heterostructure may have applications in novel nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.",

We represent the solution of the Schrödinger equation in the form of double Bessel-Fourier series expansion. We show that the nonparabolicity of dispersion of the conduction band, given by the Kane formula, conduces to significant lowering of the donor energies and to stronger confinement of the electron within the quantum dot. Calculated results for the energies as functions of the electric and magnetic fields for different quantum dot dimensions were compared with those obtained in the effective mass approximation. Our results exhibit a high sensibility of the probability density of electron distribution in volcano-shaped quantum dot to the variation of the external magnetic and electric fields.",

The results show that the geometries, band structures, and optical properties of the Si‐NWs are affected by the modification of oxygen atoms. The Si─Si bonds adjacent to the region modified by oxygen atoms elongate, the cell volumes decrease, while the energy gaps of Si‐NWs narrow. Evident impurity bands appear on the energy bands of the modified Si‐NWs, forming S═O double bonds. A blue shift of the perpendicular component spectra of the dielectric constant relative to parallel spectra can be observed for Si [100]‐NW, Si [111]‐NW, and Si [112]‐NW. At the same time, the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function spectra of all Si‐NWs are red‐shifted after the modification by oxygen atoms, and the spectra of Si [111]‐NWs forming Si═O double bonds are the most significant red‐shifted.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the structural, electronic, phonon, and optical properties of lanthanum (La)‐doped yttrium hydrogen selenide (YHSe), along with the effects of pressure variations on its optical properties, are investigated using the density functional theory method. Both the La‐doped and YHSe systems are dynamically stable, as indicated by phonon calculations showing no imaginary frequencies in the Brillouin zone (BZ). The influence of pressure on optical properties is examined, revealing that increased pressure enhances these properties, particularly by improving the absorption coefficient in the ultraviolet (UV) range. Moreover, the bandgap energy of both La‐doped YHSe and YHSe compounds is explored. Increasing La concentration reduces the bandgap and enhances the density of states (DOS) at Fermi energy, inducing metallic characteristics in YHSe. Furthermore, the optical properties are examined at various La concentrations, most of which exhibit a nonlinear relationship as the La concentration increases. Doping under extreme conditions significantly enhances the optical properties of La‐doped YHSe, particularly in the UV‐light wavelength range. Specifically, the absorption coefficient reaches its maximum value in the energy range of 6.678 −13.023 eV within the UV region for all concentrations, indicating strong absorption in this range. This suggests the material’s effectiveness in absorbing electromagnetic radiation, particularly in the UV range, making it a promising candidate for photochromic applications. A thorough exploration of the optical properties under doping reveals prominent peaks, particularly in response to the UV spectrum, with a slight shift toward higher energies beyond the UV range. This suggests that the material under study holds promise as a candidate for sustained photochromic performance over time.",

Our enthalpy calculations confirm that these compounds crystallize in a CsCl‐type structure, highlighting their stability in this phase. The lattice constants provide insights into the atomic arrangement and bonding strength within the crystal, influencing the material’s density and overall structural integrity. The bulk modulus reflects the material’s resistance to uniform compression, indicative of its incompressibility, and rigidity, which are essential for applications requiring high strength and durability. By analyzing the density of states (DOSs) and electronic band structure (BS), we further discuss the electronic stability and metallic nature of these materials. Additionally, the electronic properties derived from the DOS and BS analysis suggest good electrical conductivity, making these materials suitable for use in electronic and optoelectronic devices. The calculated equilibrium structural parameters, including bulk modulus, lattice constants, and their derivatives, are found to be in good agreement with available experimental and theoretical data. Understanding these properties is crucial for optimizing the performance of YAg and YCu intermetallics in practical applications, from structural components to advanced electronic systems.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, wireless energy transmission technology has developed rapidly and has received increasing attention in the industry. For microwave wireless energy transfer system applications, Ge Schottky diodes as the core components of the rectifier circuit are commonly used. Compared with Ge semiconductor, strained Ge semiconductor on Si substrate has the advantages of compatibility with Si process, low cost, and high electron mobility. It is an ideal replacement material for Ge semiconductor applications. In view of this, based on the model of the relationship between the performance of strained Ge semiconductor on Si substrate Schottky diodes and the geometric parameters of the device and the physical parameters of the material, Silvaco TCAD and ADS simulation software are jointly used to propose a novel strained Ge semiconductor on Si substrate Schottky diode for microwave rectification circuit. Simulation results show that the strained Ge semiconductor on Si substrate Schottky diode has a rectification efficiency of 70.1% when the input of the rectifier circuit is 20 dBm, the load resistance is R = 1000 Ω, and the load capacitance is C = 100 pF. Compared with traditional Ge Schottky diodes, this optimal operating point is closer to a low energy density, which is beneficial to a wide range of energy absorption. Studies have shown the feasibility of replacing Ge Schottky diodes. The research in this paper can provide valuable reference for the design and development of the core components of the rectifier circuit of the microwave infinite energy transmission system.",

The ground-state energy of the polaron is calculated using the Lee-Low-Pine unitary transformation and linear combination operator method. It is found that the ground-state energy is an increasing function of magnetic field strength, the bound Coulomb potential, and the cutoff wavenumber. Numerical results also reveal that the ground-state energy reduces as the distance between the graphene and the substrate is increased.

Benefitting from the OCT precoding technique, the uniform signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among all the subchannels can be achieved. As a result, only one SNR value is required to be fed back, and the same distribution matcher is employed during probabilistic shaping (PS), which means much lower feedback overhead and system complexity than the conventional entropy loading scheme. Experimental results show that the OCT precoding does not cause the system performance loss where the achievable information rate (AIR) of the proposed system is comparable with the conventional system without precoding. With an available bandwidth of ∼25 MHz, the proposed scheme can realize the AIR of 50.75 Mb/s at the expense of 0.45% average forward error correction (FEC) overhead (OH).",

The results show that the TiO2 with an oxygen defect is not as stable as intrinsic TiO2. The compound formation enthalpy Ef and the oxygen defect formation energy value tend to be larger for a higher defect content, and the oxygen defect gets harder to be formed. The bonds within the TiO6 polyhedron are different and not geometrically symmetrical. The bond strengths show distinct diversity, and the primitive cell of anatase TiO2 show spatial expansion when there are oxygen defects. All bands moved down to the low energy region, and two impurity energy band levels emerged for the anatase TiO2 with oxygen defect. The energy band gap is decreased from 3.085 eV to 1.165 eV, 1.0015 eV, and 0.43 eV. There are generally 7 peaks for the spin density of states function, corresponding to their 5 main bands. For the anatase TiO2 with an oxygen defect content of 12.5%, the spin density of states functions are not horizontal ordinate symmetrical near −1.12 eV and 0.31 eV. They are formed by oxygen defect energy levels, which is the result of the Ti d and O p state electron polarization. Transitions from weak paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic are found for the anatase TiO2 with oxygen defect.",

Different from the single impurity Kondo effect, the resulted new Kondo lattice Hamiltonian only includes the spin-flip scattering processes between conduction electrons and f-electrons, while the normal process of non-spin-flip scattering is absent in this Hamiltonian, under the second order approximation. The new Kondo lattice Hamiltonian may be used to study some anomalous physical properties in some Kondo lattice intermetallic compounds.",

A transition of the europium ion from the valence-stable state of Eu2+ in EuAg2Si2 to the state of intermediate (homogeneous) valence (IV) of the europium ion in EuCu2Si2 with an effective valence ϑeff = 2.41 (300 K) has been initiated by a successive replacement of silver atoms by copper atoms. With appropriate sample compositions, the transition passes through a Kondo-type state. The research subject is the patterns of transformations (when the composition of the sample changes), the electronic state, and, accordingly, the electronic transport properties. The simultaneous coexistence of europium ions in different electronic states is assumed. The substitutional solid solution Eu(Cu1 − xAgx)2Si2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) exhibits properties related to the competition between the state of the Kondo system, intermediate valence (IV), and magnetic ordering.",

The results of electronic property calculation show that the incorporation of scandium (Sc 3+ ) in ZrO 2 has reduced its bandgap due to the formation of scandium 3d states in the conduction band. The analysis of optical properties shows that scandium doping in ZrO 2 improves the real ( ε 1 ) and imaginary dielectric functions ( ε 2 ), extinction coefficient ( k ), refractive index ( n ), reflectivity ( R ), and absorption coefficient ( α ) properties thereby enhancing its photocatalytic and optical activities. The heat capacities of ZrO 2 and Sc‐ZrO 2 calculated at temperature of 800 K are 74.27 and 77.98 J/K/Nmol, respectively. The result of thermodynamic properties calculations show that doping scandium in zirconia enhances its entropy and specific heat capacity thereby allowing it to be thermodynamically stable for a wide range of electronic applications.",

The calculated edge energies for all studied VS 2 nanoribbons are less than 0.9 eV/Å, lower than that of fabricated armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons, indicating the easy formation of ZNRs. The results show N ‐ZNRs terminated with S and V atoms ( N ‐SV‐ZNRs) is a ferrimagnetic metal. The magnetic moments are mainly contributed by d orbitals of V atoms, and the V2 atom exhibits a spin that is antiparallel to the other V atoms due to the increase of through–space interaction. With hydrogen passivation, the magnetic moment of V2 atom in N ‐SV‐ZNRs couples ferromagnetically with other V atoms and N ‐SV‐ZNRs becomes half metallic. The N ‐ZNRs terminated with V atom ( N ‐VV‐ZNRs) is found to be a magnetic metal, and the magnetic moments of V atoms around edges are very sensitive to ribbon width. Furthermore, N ‐ZNRs with S atom terminations ( N ‐SS‐ZNRs) is a ferromagnetic quasi‐semiconductor. Only select bands intersect with the Fermi level near the Γ point, and the magnetic moments of all V atoms couple ferromagnetically. These findings are essential for applications of VS 2 nanoribbons–based low‐dimensional spintronic devices.",

These micro droplet-particle pairs are confined to the surface (liquid-air interface) of the larger host droplet; however, they are free to engage with external forces to promote mobility. This response may find applications for particle pair transport on liquid surfaces.

Thus, investigation of physical properties of nanostructures would be pointless if one cannot assure the exact stoichiometry of the material. We studied the stoichiometry of ZnTe nanowires grown via the vapor-liquid-solid method. Different microscopy and composition analysis methods were exploited to study the stoichiometry of the nanowires. It was observed that nonstoichiometric wires had relatively higher defect concentrations. The temperature profile along the substrate during nanowire growth was found to be the reason for the formation of nanowires with different stoichiometries.",

It is found that there are four types of dispersive waves in these crystals, namely, a quasilongitudinal (QL-mode), two quasitransverse (QT-mode), and a quasidefect concentration (N-mode) wave. The complex secular equations for cubic and transversely isotropic crystals are reduced as special cases. It is demonstrated that when waves propagate in one of the planes of transversely isotropic solid having defect concentration field, only one purely quasitransverse wave decouples from the rest of the motion and is not influenced by defect concentration changes. The other waves are coupled and get modified due to presence of defects. When waves propagate along the axis of the solid, only QT- and N-mode are coupled, whereas the two QT-modes get decoupled from the rest of the motion. The phase velocities and attenuation factors of waves have been obtained. Significant effect of defects and anisotropy on wave characteristics is observed in certain ranges of frequency. It is also shown that there is an appreciable variation in case of QL-mode as compared with QT- and N-mode.",

The determination of the above parameters is suggested based on their effect on maximum drain current, leakage current, saturated voltage, and so forth. It is found that the channel length decreases with the increase of the maximum drain current and leakage current simultaneously. Short channel effects start to appear when the channel length is less than 0.9 μ m and experience sudden sharp increases which make device performance degrade and reach their operating limits when the channel length is further lessened down to 0.5 μ m.

The density of states (DOS) at the FS mainly comes from Bi-6p orbital. For LaO0.5F0.5Bi(Se0.5S0.5)2, using two different models established by different unit-cell model, we find that their FSs are significantly different, indicating the inequivalence of Se1- and Se2-position atoms. Besides, with the increasing of S doing level, the DOS at Fermi energy firstly increases and then decreases. When the concentration of S is x = 0.6, the DOS has a maximum value, which is consistent with the experimental Tc~x phase diagram, indicating that LaO0.5F0.5Bi(Se1−xSx)2 may be an electron-phonon coupling superconductor.",

    "abstract": "While the vibrational thermodynamics of materials with small anharmonicity at low temperatures has been understood well based on the harmonic phonons approximation, at high temperatures, this understanding must accommodate how phonons interact with other phonons or with other excitations. To date the anharmonic lattice dynamics is poorly understood despite its great importance, and most studies still rely on the quasiharmonic approximations. We shall see that the phonon-phonon interactions give rise to interesting coupling problems and essentially modify the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of materials, for example, thermal expansion, thermodynamic stability, heat capacity, optical properties, thermal transport, and other nonlinear properties of materials. The review aims to introduce some recent developements of computational methodologies that are able to efficiently model the strong phonon anharmonicity based on quantum perturbation theory of many-body interactions and first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. The effective potential energy surface of renormalized phonons and structures of the phonon-phonon interaction channels can be derived from these interdependent methods, which provide both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives in analyzing the strong anharmonic phenomena while the traditional harmonic models fail dramatically. These models have been successfully performed in the studies on the temperature-dependent broadenings of Raman and neutron scattering spectra, high temperature phase stability, and negative thermal expansion of rutile and cuprite structures, for example.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the undoped DG-MOSFETs capability for the operation of rectifiers for RFIDs and Wireless Power Transmission (WPT) at microwave frequencies. For this purpose, a large-signal compact model has been developed and implemented in Verilog-A. The model has been numerically validated with a device simulator (Sentaurus). It is found that the number of stages to achieve the optimal rectifier performance is inferior to that required with conventional MOSFETs. In addition, the DC output voltage could be incremented with the use of appropriate mid-gap metals for the gate, as TiN. Minor impact of short channel effects (SCEs) on rectification is also pointed out.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, two models of elastic metamaterial containing one and two resonators are proposed to obtain the bandgaps with the aim of providing broadband vibration suppression. The model with one DOF is built by assembling several unite cells in which each unite cell consists of a rectangular frame as the base structure and a rack-and-pinion mechanism that is joined to the frame with a linear spring on both sides. In the second model with two DOF, a small mass is added while its center is attached to the center of the pinion on one side and the other side is connected to the rectangular frame via a linear spring. In the first mechanism, the pinion is considered as the single resonator, and in the 2DOF model, on the other hand, the pinion and small mass acted as multiple resonators. By obtaining the governing equations of motion for a single cell in each model, the dynamic behavior of two metastructures is thoroughly investigated. Therefore, the equations of motion for the two models are written in matrix form, and then, the dispersion relations are presented to analyze the influences of system parameters on the bandgaps’ starting/ending frequencies. Finally, two models are successfully compared and then numerically simulated via MATLAB-SIMULINK and MSC-ADAMS software. With the aid of closed-form expressions for starting/ending frequencies, the correlation between the system parameters and bandgap intervals can be readily recognized.",

    "abstract": "Low pressure and anoxia are the main characteristics of the environment in the Tibetan Plateau, which means people living there have a large demand for oxygen to reduce the symptoms of altitude sickness. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is a competitive oxygen production technology in plateau areas, which relies on the molecular sieves for the separation of N2 and O2 in industry and portable medical equipment. The adsorption characteristics of the Faujasite-type (FAU) molecular sieves, as one kind of the most widely used adsorbents for O2 production, depend on the properties, amount, and distribution of the skeleton cations and atoms. In this paper, we explore the isomorphic substitution effect on the adsorption properties of N2 in FAU molecular sieves using the computational approaches based on the density functional theory (DFT). The structural analysis and adsorption energy calculated for the Zn, Ca, and Ga substitutions at the Si/Al skeleton sites in the β-cage structure, the basic unit of FAU molecular sieves, prove that the isomorphic substitution effect can strengthen the adsorption of N2. The Bader charge and density of states analysis validate the formation of electron-deficient holes near the Fermi level and hence strengthen the local polarity of the pore structure and enhance the adsorption of N2 molecules. The work about isomorphic substitution on the FAU molecular sieves might provide an insight into heteroatom isomorphic modification mechanisms and designing excellent air separation materials.",

    "abstract": "The contact is the core element of the vacuum interrupter of the mechanical DC circuit breaker. The electrical conductivity and welding resistance of the material directly affect its stability and reliability. AgSnO2 contact material has low resistivity, welding resistance, and so on. This material occupies an important position of the circuit breaker contact material. This research is based on the first-principles analysis method of density functional theory. The article calculated the lattice constant, enthalpy change, energy band, electronic density of state, charge density distribution, population, and conductivity of Ce, C single-doped, and Ce-C codoped SnO2 systems. The results show that Ce, C single doping, and Ce-C codoping all increase the cell volume and lattice constant. When the elements are codoped, the enthalpy change is the largest, and the thermal stability is the best. It has the smallest bandgap, the most impurity energy levels, and the least energy required for electronic transitions. The 4f orbital electrons of the Ce atom and the 2p orbital electrons of C are the sources of impurity energy near the Fermi level. When the elements are codoped, more impurity energy levels are generated at the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band. Its bandgap is reduced so conductivity is improved. From the charge density and population analysis, the number of free electrons of Ce atoms and C atoms is redistributed after codoping. It forms a Ce-C covalent bond to further increase the degree of commonality of electrons and enhance the metallicity. The conductivity analysis shows that both single-doped and codoped conductivity have been improved. When the elements are codoped, the conductivity is the largest, and the conductivity is the best.",

    "abstract": "A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of a nonzero momentum Cooper pair constitutes a composite boson or simply a boson. We demonstrated that the quantum coherence of the two-component BEC (boson and fermion condensates) is controlled by plasmons. It has been proposed that plasmons, observed in both electron-doped and hole-doped cuprates, originates from the long-range Coulomb screening, where the transfer momentum <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mfenced open=\"|\" close=\"|\" separators=\"|\"> <mrow> <mi mathvariant=\"bold\">q</mi> </mrow> </mfenced> <mo>⟶</mo> <mn>0</mn> </math> . We further show that the screening mediates boson-fermion pairing at condensate state. While only about 1 <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mo>%</mo> </math> of plasmon energy mediates the charge pairing, most of the plasmon energy is used to overcome the modes that compete against superconductivity such as phonons, charge density waves, antiferromagnetism, and damping effects. Additionally, the dependence of frequency of plasmons on the material of a superconductor is also explored. This study gives a quantum explanation of the modes that enhance and those that inhibit superconductivity. The study informs the nature of electromagnetic radiations (EMR) that can enhance the critical temperature of such materials.",

Transport properties through them are numerically investigated. The fraction of the current carried by each propagating mode in the collector is computed for transmission currents when each propagating mode is incident. By taking the statistical average in shape, it is shown that a universal frequency distribution is obtained for a sufficiently deformed system even though magnetic fields are so strong that electron waves form edge states. Then, the transmission currents are randomly distributed over all propagating modes. On average, each propagating mode carries the same current as in the absence of a magnetic field. It is also confirmed that a finite size dot cannot be a model of a reservoir even if it is chaotic.",

An electric-field-induced phase transition from metrically cubic to metrically tetragonal, associated with strong domain wall motion, occurs. Such induced phase and domain wall motion are unchanged until the high-temperature phase transition occurs from metrically tetragonal to metrically cubic. All these changes are irrelevant to the observed depolarization temperature (75°C). The depolarization behaviour is thus suggested to be associated with the local structure caused by the octahedral tilt twinning disorder.",

Dynamics of these measurements are solved analytically through the fractional calculus which has been shown to be appropriate mathematical method for the optical systems with non-Markovian dynamics. From these dynamics, we find that the losses of energy, coherence, and information of a QPAB are inhibited.

For , we find Pomeranchuk distortion of FS. We next relate our findings regarding FS to the magneto-quantum oscillations in the electronic specific heat. Since the nodal quasiparticle energy values for are found to be greater than for , the origin of the oscillations for nonzero corresponds to the Fermi pockets around antinodal regions. The oscillations are shown to take place in the weak disorder regime (eV) only.",

    "abstract": "The interest in the nanoscale properties of low-dimensional magnetic systems has grown exponentially during the last decades and has attracted the attention of both experimentalists and theorists. The state of the art of these investigations has indeed allowed to give valuable insights into the underlying physics of complex magnetization dynamics driven by magnetic fields, electric currents and thermal effects. At the same time, such studies have found, in relatively short times, several applications at industrial level in the field of spintronics and magnonics as magnetic memories, microwave oscillators, modulators, sensors, logic gates, diodes and transistors. The goal of this special issue is to offer a variety of recent developments on this topic by gathering contributions arising from several specialists in the field of nanomagnetism. The strength of this issue lies indeed on its “variety”: the properties of these systems are, in fact, investigated from the viewpoint of physicists, engineers and mathematicians. Also, the issue encloses studies carried out at both mesoscopic and atomic scales, as well as results of both theoretical approaches (analytical, numerical and, in some cases, even “hybrid”) and experimental observations. The covered topics range from the micromagnetic modeling of domain wall motion, dynamics of vortex structures, phase-locking phenomena in spintronic oscillators, experimental techniques for realizing heterostructures based on magnon-induced spin transfer torque, band structure and exchange field in the Landau-Lifshitz equation for magnonic crystals, gap and gapless structures in fractional quantum Hall effect, semiclassical description of anisotropic magnets and classical critical behaviour of Heisenberg ferromagnets. More specifically, within the subject dealing with domain walls, for example, the structure of complex cross-tie/vortex wall structures in soft films has been studied in detail by using micromagnetic simulations whereas the influence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling on the current-induced dynamics has been investigated analytically. Regarding the exchange interaction governing the dynamics in magnonic crystals, a full analytical calculation of the exchange field acting on spin-wave dynamics from themicroscopic Heisenbergmodel has been performed. Attention has been also devoted to the study of thermodynamics in the case of classical planar ferromagnets close to the zero-temperature critical point. Two reviews are also included in this special issue. The first one deals with two hybrid micromagnetic tools, based on Hamiltonian and Lagrangian approaches, to model the spin-dynamics in laterally confined magnetic systems. The second one is mostly devoted to the micromagnetic analysis of static and dynamic properties of magnetic domain walls in materials exhibiting perpendicular anisotropy.",

We find the growth of high-quality magnetite on MgO substrates to be straightforward, while using transition metal buffer layers of Fe, Cr, Mo, and Nb can alter the structural and magnetic properties of the magnetite. Additionally, we successfully fabricated and characterized Py/Cr/Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 3 O 4 /Cr/Fe 3 O 4 spin valve structures. For both, we observe a relatively small giant magnetoresistance and confirm an inverse dependence on spacer layer thickness. Thus, we have shown certain materials combinations that may form the heterostructures that are the building blocks necessary to achieve magnon-induced spin transfer torque devices.",

    "abstract": "Coalescence induced by deposition of different Cu clusters on an epitaxial Co cluster supported on a Cu(001) substrate is studied by constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. The degree of epitaxy of the final system increases with increasing separation between the centres of mass of the projectile and target clusters during the collision. Structure, roughness, and epitaxial order of the supported cluster also influence the degree of epitaxy. The effect of energy and temperature is determinant on the epitaxial condition of the coalesced cluster, especially both factors modify the generation, growth and interaction among grains. A higher temperature favours the epitaxial growth for low impact parameters. A higher energy contributes to the epitaxial coalescence for any initial separation between the projectile and target clusters. The influence of projectile energy is notably greater than the influence of temperature since higher energies allow greater and instantaneous atomic reorganizations, so that the number of arisen grains just after the collision becomes smaller. The appearance of grain boundary dislocations is, therefore, a decisive factor in the epitaxial growth of the coalesced cluster.",

We show that dense inelastic granular gas model exhibits deviations from near elastic model even at low dissipation and dilute conditions. The flow physics shows that the strength of convective roll can be related with the differential dissipations on the side walls. The discrepancy between the two models is significant as we reevaluate the scope of near elastic model in the presence of dissipative boundary conditions.",

The investigation is performed for the anomalous high-frequency oxygen bond-stretching modes, which experimentally are known to display a strong softening of the frequencies upon doping in the cuprates. This most likely generic anomalous behaviour of these modes is shown to be due to a strong nonlocal electron-phonon interaction mediated by charge fluctuations on the ions. We demonstrate that the softening of the modes is caused by nonlocally induced dynamic charge inhomogeneities in form of charge stripes along the CuO bonds with different orbital character. The dynamic charge inhomogeneities may in turn be considered as precursors of static charge stripe order as recently observed in in a broad range of doping around . The latter may trigger a reconstruction of the Fermi surface into small pockets with reduced doping. We argue that the incompressibility of the orbital and simultaneously the compressibility of the orbital in the pseudogap state seem to be required to nucleate dynamic stripes.",

The exact solution for the 4-component system consisting of the two different types of 2 inductors and 2 capacitors, randomly placed and connected, was obtained. The obtained solution for investigated system has the two features: (1) the finite dissipation in the nondissipative system of inductors and capacitors; (2) appearance of plateau—the constant value of effective conductivity in a wide range of concentrations of components.

TPBi thin film was printed with a good uniformity and resolution. Effect of deposition conditions on optical and electrical properties and surface roughness of TPBi thin film have been studied under spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, respectively. It is found that characteristic of TPBi thin film is improved via controlled stamp temperature and time. Since TPBi thin film exhibits the surface morphology comparable to that of conventional spin-coating thin film, our findings suggest that PET release film-based stamp printing approach is possible to use as an alternative deposition of the organic thin film as compared with a traditional one.",

In this paper, we calculate current-voltage characteristics in two-dimensional devices with a defective connection to reservoirs by using the nonequilibrium Green’s function method. Results show that the magnitude of resistance change depends on the amplitude of quantized wave functions at the position of the defect.",

The generation of dispersive wave (DW) in the normal group velocity dispersion (GVD) region of PCF is investigated. It is demonstrated that considering the self-steepening (SS) and introducing the chirp of the initial input pulse are two suitable means to control the DW generation. The SS enhances the relative average intensity of blue-shift DW while weakening that of red-shift DW. The required propagation distance of DW emission is markedly varied by introducing the frequency chirp. Manipulating DW generation in gas-filled PCF by the combined effects of either SS or chirp and three-order dispersion (TOD) provides a method for a concentrated transfer of energy into the targeted wavelengths.",

In particular, we investigate the influence of size and shape of obstruction and the coherence of speckle on the speckle’s reconstruction process.

As long as the difference between the gate voltages applied on the left and right ZGNRs (ΔV) remains unchanged, the conductance profiles for different cases are exactly the same, except to a displacement along EF-axis. It is found that the transmission of electrons from the upper/lower edge state of the left ZGNR to the lower/upper edge state of the right ZGNR is forbidden, therefore, the width of the conductance gap increases first and then decreases as |ΔV| increases. The upper/lower edge states and conduction/valence subbands of ZGNR under higher/lower gate voltage (VH/VL) determine step positions of the conductance when EF &gt;VH/EF &lt; VL. But when VL ≤ EF ≤ VH, the conductance profile is mainly determined by the upper and lower edge states, a few lowest conduction subbands/topmost valence subbands of ZGNR under lower/higher gate voltage. These results are helpful to the exploration and application of a new kind of field effect transistor based on ZGNR junctions.",

Thus, the evolutional characteristics of a beam modulated by a local defect propagating through a spatial filter system at an image reply plane and a downstream plane are analyzed in detail. Modulation stripes appear at the image reply plane; these are caused by the pinhole cutoff effect. The modulation degree increases with increasing defect size. The maximum intensification factor can reach 3.2 under certain conditions. Thus, the defect size should be restricted to a reasonable size for safe operation with a specified pinhole size. Moreover, a maximal value appears at the downstream plane, and the intensity enhances with increasing defect size. To ensure beam quality, the maximum allowable defect size and angle of the spatial filter should meet special constraints. The maximum allowable defect size is calculated based on practical configuration parameters.",

However, due to the 4.2% lattice mismatch between Si and Ge, the epitaxial growth of the high-Ge-content SiGe epitaxial layer directly on the Si substrate has a high defect density, which will seriously affect the subsequent device performance. Laser recrystallization technique is a fast and low-cost method to effectively reduce threading dislocation density (TDD) in epitaxial high-Ge-content SiGe films on Si. In this paper, by means of finite element numerical simulation, a 808 nm laser recrystallization thermal physics model of a high-Ge-content SiGe film (for example, Si 0.2 Ge 0.8 ) on a Si substrate was established (temperature distribution physical model of Si 0.2 Ge 0.8 epitaxial layer under different laser power, Si 0.2 Ge 0.8 epitaxial layer thickness, and initial temperature).

We discuss the influence of the graphene sheets on the hysteretic response of the TE-polarized transmitted light. It is demonstrated that the optical tristability in this configuration can be realized due to the giant third-order nonlinear conductivity of graphene and appropriate structure parameters. The tristable behavior of the transmitted light can be controlled via suitably varying the Fermi energy of the graphene. Besides, the optical tristable behavior is strongly dependent on the relaxation time of the graphene and the dispersion characteristics of the surrounding dielectrics. Moreover, the threshold of the optical tristability can be reduced by appropriately increasing the number of graphene layers, making this simple structure a good candidate for dynamic tunable and low threshold optical tristable device in the terahertz (THz) frequencies.",

Vortex dynamics including entrance and exit from the sample was simulated. Magnetization and carrier concentration densities of the sample were studied as a function of external magnetic field variations. Anomalies in carrier concentration density were observed at certain values of the magnetic field which were correlated with the entrance and exit processes of vortices. Area swept by superconductor magnetization with magnetic field was observed to have a hysteresis-like behavior where area representing energy dissipated per cycle. This energy accumulation was suggested to cause instability in superconductor over the number of cycles and may result in thermal quenching. Temporal distribution of energy components showed consistency with the pattern observed for carrier concentration and magnetization under oscillating magnetic field. Rapid phase changes with magnetic oscillations resulted in oscillations in energy components, and irregular peaks and ripples in superconducting energy represent the situation of exit and entry of vortices. While the rise in interaction energy with cycles is referred to vortex relaxation time in a cycle, this energy is expected to accumulate and take other forms (e.g., heat) and is predicted to cause thermal quenching. In the presence of background static magnetic field, this energy dissipation was calculated to increase significantly while superconductor is subjected to oscillating magnetic field.",

SEM, TEM, XRD, BET, and TGA/DTA were applied to study the morphology and structure of the GTNT composites. The results show that a huge number of titanate nanotubes are closely attached to the graphene sheet structure and overlap each other. This hierarchical morphology endows the GTNT composites with not only the high specific surface area of 236.9 m2/g but also abundant porous structure, both of which are benefit for Co(II) adsorption. The batch adsorption experiments demonstrate that the GTNT composites have a high adsorption capacity and rapid kinetics for Co(II) adsorption (10 min for equilibrium). The adsorption capacity of the GTNT composites reaches 211.1 mg/g. The adsorption kinetics of the GTNT composites fits well to the pseudo-second-order model, while the adsorption isotherm of which fits well to the Langmuir model. The adsorption performance of Co(II) ions on the GTNT composites has a great relationship with the pH value, in the pH range of 1–7, the Co(II) adsorption capacity of the GTNT composites greatly increases with the increase of the pH value. In addition, the effect of coexisting anions on fluoride removal is also investigated. Na+, K+, and Mg2+ ions have shown a negligible effect on the Co(II) adsorption efficiency of the GTNT composites. However, the existences of Cu2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ ions would clearly have an effect on the Co(II) adsorption of the GTNT composites. The adsorption mechanism is also discussed. It is believed that the GTNT composites can be considered as a potential functional material for removing the radioactive metals containing wastewater.",

    "abstract": "Ferroelectrics refer to groups of dielectrics having the property of spontaneous polarization. Lead magnesium niobate-potassium bismuth titanate ((1 − x) PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3-(x)K1/2Bi1/2TiO3)) x = 0.15, 0.25, and 0.35 are prepared by solid-state reaction rout technique. The electric modulus of the prepared samples is studied using the complex impedance spectroscopic method at 400°C, 450°C, and 500°C in various frequency ranges. In the lower frequency range, the real modulus (M′ (ω)) decreased with increasing the temperature. Furthermore, the real modulus (M′ (ω)) increased with increasing frequency and the concentration of the doping component. The imaginary modulus (M″ (ω)) increased with increasing the temperature. The significant variations in the real and imaginary coefficients signify the existence of thermally activated dielectric relaxation between the selected components. Moreover, the magnitude of grain capacitance increased with increasing the temperature, confirming the negative temperature coefficient of resistance of the material.",

A hybrid simulation scheme, which contains stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (a well-known Bayesian machine learning algorithm for big data) along with adiabatic quantum annealing, is developed to reproduce the experimentally observed phase transition. By implementing the simulation scheme into a quantum circuit, we successfully verified the phase transition observed in the experiment. Our work demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of hybridizing quantum computation with classical Langevin dynamics for the analysis of carrier dynamics and quantum phase transition of the quantum dot.",

    "abstract": "The AlGaN/GaN Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) working as high-power mixer and multiplier show great potential in millimeter wave (MMW) field owing to their high breakdown voltage. Nevertheless, its further application is severely limited by large reverse leakage current (Jr) since the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel is hard to be pinched off at low voltage. To address this limitation, a graded AlGaN/GaN heterostructure is introduced to extend the 2DEG channel into a quasi-three-dimensional electron slab. By comparing the fixed Al composition AlGaN/GaN SBD, Jr of the graded AlGaN/GaN SBD is significantly reduced due to the extension of channel carriers, confirming the effective Jr suppression effect of this structure. Furthermore, on this basis, a recessed anode structure is utilized to expect a smaller Jr. The results indicated that the graded AlGaN/GaN SBDs with air-bridge structure have achieved a pretty low Jr value (1.6 × 10−13 A at -15 V), and its cutoff frequency is as high as 60.6 GHz. It is expected that such SBDs with low Jr have significant advantages in future applications.",

A method of linear combination operators is used to deal with the position and momentum of a carrier in a magnetic field. The method of Lee-Low-Pines variation with an arbitrary carrier-phonon coupling is adopted to derive the effects of phonons. It is found that the energy gap of n = 0 Landau level opened by carrier-longitudinal acoustic phonons cannot be the main mechanism, whereas both the carrier-surface optical phonon interaction and the carrier-impurity interaction play the main roles in determining the energy splitting.",

The micropyramid UV LED has a high optical output intensity under a small current injection, and the series resistance of unit area is only a quarter of the conventional vertical LEDs, so the micropyramid UV LED would have a high output power under the drive circuit.

The studying results show that the symmetry remains undisturbed; the strain to the stress response is anisotropic. The strain of microarchitecture induced by external stress is also anisotropic. There is stronger covalent binding between Co and O. The binding between Co and O within CdI2 like CoO2 is very much even covalent, and it is weakened under external stress. But the covalent Co-O binding within the rock salt like CaCoO layer is enhanced. The Ca-O binding strength is insensitive to external stress. An energy gap of 0.1 eV below Fermi level for the spin-up electron band disappears, and the two energy gaps are narrowed for the spin-down electron bands. The p orbital electrons form primarily the bands below Fermi level and the d orbital electrons form primarily the bands above Fermi level. The transitions from p orbital electrons to d orbital electrons produce the conduction. The CdI2 like CoO2 layer has been enhanced in terms of participating in the conduction properties with external stress of 1 GPa, and the capability of Co is enhanced while the capability of O is decreased.",

The QD size effect on carrier confinement energies, wave functions, and s-p splitting is studied. The direct Coulomb interaction impact on the calculated s and p states’ transition energies is investigated. The behaviour of the binding energy of neutral and charged excitons (X− and X+) and biexciton XX versus QD height is studied.

Results show that the stable structures of NO2/Mo (110) are MoNO2 (T, μ1-N), MoNO2 (H, μ3-N, O, O′), MoNO2 (S, η2-O, O′), and MoNO2 (L, η2-O, O′). The corresponding adsorption energies for the structures are −3.83 eV, −3.40 eV, −2.81 eV, and −2.60 eV, respectively. Besides, the stable structures of NO/Mo (110) are MoNO (H, μ1-N), MoNO (H, μ2-N, O), and MoNO (H, η1-N) with the corresponding adsorption energies of −3.75 eV, −3.57 eV, and −3.01 eV, respectively. N and O atoms are easily adsorbed at the hollow sites on Mo (110) surfaces, and their adsorption energies reach −7.02 eV and −7.70 eV, respectively. The preferable decomposition process of MoNO2 (H, μ3-N, O, O′) shows that the first and second deoxidation processes need to overcome energy barriers of 0.11 eV and 0.64 eV, respectively. All these findings indicate that NO2 is relatively easy to dissociate on Mo (110) surface.",
