    "abstract": "Protein crystallization was discovered by chance about 150 years ago and was developed in the late 19th century as a powerful purification tool and as a demonstration of chemical purity. The crystallization of proteins, nucleic acids and large biological complexes, such as viruses, depends on the creation of a solution that is supersaturated in the macromolecule but exhibits conditions that do not significantly perturb its natural state. Supersaturation is produced through the addition of mild precipitating agents such as neutral salts or polymers, and by the manipulation of various parameters that include temperature, ionic strength and pH. Also important in the crystallization process are factors that can affect the structural state of the macromolecule, such as metal ions, inhibitors, cofactors or other conventional small molecules. A variety of approaches have been developed that combine the spectrum of factors that effect and promote crystallization, and among the most widely used are vapor diffusion, dialysis, batch and liquid–liquid diffusion. Successes in macromolecular crystallization have multiplied rapidly in recent years owing to the advent of practical, easy-to-use screening kits and the application of laboratory robotics. A brief review will be given here of the most popular methods, some guiding principles and an overview of current technologies.",

    "abstract": "The lipid cubic phase or in meso method is a robust approach for crystallizing membrane proteins for structure determination. The uptake of the method is such that it is experiencing what can only be described as explosive growth. This timely, comprehensive and up-to-date review introduces the reader to the practice of in meso crystallogenesis, to the associated challenges and to their solutions. A model of how crystallization comes about mechanistically is presented for a more rational approach to crystallization. The possible involvement of the lamellar and inverted hexagonal phases in crystallogenesis and the application of the method to water-soluble, monotopic and lipid-anchored proteins are addressed. How to set up trials manually and automatically with a robot is introduced with reference to open-access online videos that provide a practical guide to all aspects of the method. These range from protein reconstitution to crystal harvesting from the hosting mesophase, which is noted for its viscosity and stickiness. The sponge phase, as an alternative medium in which to perform crystallization, is described. The compatibility of the method with additive lipids, detergents, precipitant-screen components and materials carried along with the protein such as denaturants and reducing agents is considered. The powerful host and additive lipid-screening strategies are described along with how samples that have low protein concentration and cell-free expressed protein can be used. Assaying the protein reconstituted in the bilayer of the cubic phase for function is an important element of quality control and is detailed. Host lipid design for crystallization at low temperatures and for large proteins and complexes is outlined. Experimental phasing by heavy-atom derivatization, soaking or co-crystallization is routine and the approaches that have been implemented to date are described. An overview and a breakdown by family and function of the close to 200 published structures that have been obtained using in meso-grown crystals are given. Recommendations for conducting the screening process to give a more productive outcome are summarized. The fact that the in meso method also works with soluble proteins should not be overlooked. Recent applications of the method for in situ serial crystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers and synchrotrons are described. The review ends with a view to the future and to the bright prospects for the method, which continues to contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of some of nature's most valued proteinaceous robots.",

Within five years after its release to the public, Vioxx was withdrawn from the market owing to the adverse cardiovascular effects of the drug. Despite the widespread knowledge of the development and withdrawal of Vioxx, relatively little is known at the molecular level about how the inhibitor binds to COX-2. Vioxx is unique in that the inhibitor contains a methyl sulfone moiety in place of the sulfonamide moiety found in other coxibs such as celecoxib and valdecoxib. Here, new crystallization conditions were identified that allowed the structural determination of human COX-2 in complex with Vioxx and the structure was subsequently determined to 2.7 Å resolution. The crystal structure provides the first atomic level details of the binding of Vioxx to COX-2. As anticipated, Vioxx binds with its methyl sulfone moiety located in the side pocket of the cyclooxygenase channel, providing support for the isoform selectivity of this drug.",

    "abstract": "Protein crystals obtained in initial screens typically require optimization before they are of X-ray diffraction quality. Seeding is one such optimization method. In classical seeding experiments, the seed crystals are put into new, albeit similar, conditions. The past decade has seen the emergence of an alternative seeding strategy: microseed matrix screening (MMS). In this strategy, the seed crystals are transferred into conditions unrelated to the seed source. Examples of MMS applications from in-house projects and the literature include the generation of multiple crystal forms and different space groups, better diffracting crystals and crystallization of previously uncrystallizable targets. MMS can be implemented robotically, making it a viable option for drug-discovery programs. In conclusion, MMS is a simple, time- and cost-efficient optimization method that is applicable to many recalcitrant crystallization problems.",

    "abstract": "For the successful X-ray structure determination of macromolecules, it is first necessary to identify, usually by matrix screening, conditions that yield some sort of crystals. Initial crystals are frequently microcrystals or clusters, and often have unfavorable morphologies or yield poor diffraction intensities. It is therefore generally necessary to improve upon these initial conditions in order to obtain better crystals of sufficient quality for X-ray data collection. Even when the initial samples are suitable, often marginally, refinement of conditions is recommended in order to obtain the highest quality crystals that can be grown. The quality of an X-ray structure determination is directly correlated with the size and the perfection of the crystalline samples; thus, refinement of conditions should always be a primary component of crystal growth. The improvement process is referred to as optimization, and it entails sequential, incremental changes in the chemical parameters that influence crystallization, such as pH, ionic strength and precipitant concentration, as well as physical parameters such as temperature, sample volume and overall methodology. It also includes the application of some unique procedures and approaches, and the addition of novel components such as detergents, ligands or other small molecules that may enhance nucleation or crystal development. Here, an attempt is made to provide guidance on how optimization might best be applied to crystal-growth problems, and what parameters and factors might most profitably be explored to accelerate and achieve success.",

The crystal structure of the full-length ZIKV-NS5 protein has been determined at 3.05 Å resolution from a crystal belonging to space group P 2 1 2 1 2 and containing two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure is similar to that reported for the NS5 protein from Japanese encephalitis virus and suggests opportunities for structure-based drug design targeting either its MTase or RdRp domain.",

    "abstract": "Protein-dense liquid clusters are regions of high protein concentration that have been observed in solutions of several proteins. The typical cluster size varies from several tens to several hundreds of nanometres and their volume fraction remains below 10 −3 of the solution. According to the two-step mechanism of nucleation, the protein-rich clusters serve as locations for and precursors to the nucleation of protein crystals. While the two-step mechanism explained several unusual features of protein crystal nucleation kinetics, a direct observation of its validity for protein crystals has been lacking. Here, two independent observations of crystal nucleation with the proteins lysozyme and glucose isomerase are discussed. Firstly, the evolutions of the protein-rich clusters and nucleating crystals were characterized simultaneously by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and confocal depolarized dynamic light scattering (cDDLS), respectively. It is demonstrated that protein crystals appear following a significant delay after cluster formation. The cDDLS correlation functions follow a Gaussian decay, indicative of nondiffusive motion. A possible explanation is that the crystals are contained inside large clusters and are driven by the elasticity of the cluster surface. Secondly, depolarized oblique illumination dark-field microscopy reveals the evolution from liquid clusters without crystals to newly nucleated crystals contained in the clusters to grown crystals freely diffusing in the solution. Collectively, the observations indicate that the protein-rich clusters in lysozyme and glucose isomerase solutions are locations for crystal nucleation.",

    "abstract": "The invention of the electron microscope has greatly enhanced the view scientists have of small structural details. Since its implementation, this technology has undergone considerable evolution and the resolution that can be obtained for biological objects has been extended. In addition, the latest generation of cryo-electron microscopes equipped with direct electron detectors and software for the automated collection of images, in combination with the use of advanced image-analysis methods, has dramatically improved the performance of this technique in terms of resolution. While calculating a sub-10 Å resolution structure was an accomplishment less than a decade ago, it is now common to generate structures at sub-5 Å resolution and even better. It is becoming possible to relatively quickly obtain high-resolution structures of biological molecules, in particular large ones (>500 kDa) which, in some cases, have resisted more conventional methods such as X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Such newly resolved structures may, for the first time, shed light on the precise mechanisms that are essential for cellular physiological processes. The ability to attain atomic resolution may support the development of new drugs that target these proteins, allowing medicinal chemists to understand the intimacy of the relationship between their molecules and targets. In addition, recent developments in cryo-electron microscopy combined with image analysis can provide unique information on the conformational variability of macromolecular complexes. Conformational flexibility of macromolecular complexes can be investigated using cryo-electron microscopy and multiconformation reconstruction methods. However, the biochemical quality of the sample remains the major bottleneck to routine cryo-electron microscopy-based determination of structures at very high resolution.",

    "abstract": "The infectious disease human monkeypox is spreading rapidly in 2022, causing a global health crisis. The genomics of Monkeypox virus (MPXV) have been extensively analyzed and reported, although little is known about the virus-encoded proteome. In particular, there are no reported experimental MPXV protein structures other than computational models. Here, a 1.52 Å resolution X-ray structure of the MPXV protein A42R, the first MPXV-encoded protein with a known structure, is reported. A42R shows structural similarity to profilins, which are cellular proteins that are known to function in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal assembly. However, structural comparison of A42R with known members of the profilin family reveals critical differences that support prior biochemical findings that A42R only weakly binds actin and does not bind poly(L-proline). In addition, the analysis suggests that A42R may make distinct interactions with phosphatidylinositol lipids. Overall, the data suggest that the role of A42R in the replication of orthopoxviruses may not be readily determined by comparison to cellular profilins. Furthermore, these findings support the need for increased efforts to determine high-resolution structures of other MPXV proteins to inform physiological studies of the poxvirus infection cycle and to reveal potential new strategies to combat human monkeypox should this emerging infectious disease with pandemic potential become more common in the future.",

Today, that perception has changed drastically, and the process is regarded as routine (or nearly so). On the occasion of the International Year of Crystallography 2014, this review presents a snapshot of the current state of the art, with an emphasis on the role of detergents in this process. A survey of membrane-protein crystal structures published since 2012 reveals that the direct crystallization of protein–detergent complexes remains the dominant methodology; in addition, lipidic mesophases have proven immensely useful, particularly in specific niches, and bicelles, while perhaps undervalued, have provided important contributions as well. Evolving trends include the addition of lipids to protein–detergent complexes and the gradual incorporation of new detergents into the standard repertoire. Stability has emerged as a critical parameter controlling how a membrane protein behaves in the presence of detergent, and efforts to enhance stability are discussed. Finally, although discovery-based screening approaches continue to dwarf mechanistic efforts to unravel crystallization, recent technical advances offer hope that future experiments might incorporate the rational manipulation of crystallization behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Protein crystal nucleation is a central problem in biological crystallography and other areas of science, technology and medicine. Recent studies have demonstrated that protein crystal nuclei form within crucial precursors. Here, methods of detection and characterization of the precursors are reviewed: dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy and Brownian microscopy. Data for several proteins provided by these methods have demonstrated that the nucleation precursors are clusters consisting of protein-dense liquid, which are metastable with respect to the host protein solution. The clusters are several hundred nanometres in size, the cluster population occupies from 10(-7) to 10(-3) of the solution volume, and their properties in solutions supersaturated with respect to crystals are similar to those in homogeneous, i.e. undersaturated, solutions. The clusters exist owing to the conformation flexibility of the protein molecules, leading to exposure of hydrophobic surfaces and enhanced intermolecular binding. These results indicate that protein conformational flexibility might be the mechanism behind the metastable mesoscopic clusters and crystal nucleation. Investigations of the cluster properties are still in their infancy. Results on direct imaging of cluster behaviors and characterization of cluster mechanisms with a variety of proteins will soon lead to major breakthroughs in protein biophysics.",

BMN 673 is a novel PARP1/2 inhibitor with substantially increased PARP-mediated tumor cytotoxicity and is now in later-stage clinical development for BRCA-deficient breast cancers. In co-crystal structures, BMN 673 is anchored to the nicotinamide-binding pocket via an extensive network of hydrogen-bonding and π-stacking interactions, including those mediated by active-site water molecules. The novel di-branched scaffold of BMN 673 extends the binding interactions towards the outer edges of the pocket, which exhibit the least sequence homology among PARP enzymes. The crystallographic structural analyses reported here therefore not only provide critical insights into the molecular basis for the exceptionally high potency of the clinical development candidate BMN 673, but also new opportunities for increasing inhibitor selectivity.",

    "abstract": "The harvesting of protein crystals is almost always a necessary step in the determination of a protein structure using X-ray crystallographic techniques. However, protein crystals are usually fragile and susceptible to damage during the harvesting process. For this reason, protein crystal harvesting is the single step that remains entirely dependent on skilled human intervention. Automation has been implemented in the majority of other stages of the structure-determination pipeline, including cloning, expression, purification, crystallization and data collection. The gap in automation between crystallization and data collection results in a bottleneck in throughput and presents unfortunate opportunities for crystal damage. Several automated protein crystal harvesting systems have been developed, including systems utilizing microcapillaries, microtools, microgrippers, acoustic droplet ejection and optical traps. However, these systems have yet to be commonly deployed in the majority of crystallography laboratories owing to a variety of technical and cost-related issues. Automation of protein crystal harvesting remains essential for harnessing the full benefits of fourth-generation synchrotrons, free-electron lasers and microfocus beamlines. Furthermore, automation of protein crystal harvesting offers several benefits when compared with traditional manual approaches, including the ability to harvest microcrystals, improved flash-cooling procedures and increased throughput.",

They regulate a series of cellular processes and their misregulation has been implicated in various diseases, making sirtuins attractive drug targets. To date, only a few sirtuin modulators have been reported that are suitable for cellular research and their development has been hampered by a lack of structural information. In this work, microseed matrix seeding (MMS) was used to obtain crystals of human Sirt3 in its apo form and of human Sirt2 in complex with ADP ribose (ADPR). Crystal formation using MMS was predictable, less error-prone and yielded a higher number of crystals per drop than using conventional crystallization screening methods. The crystals were used to solve the crystal structures of apo Sirt3 and of Sirt2 in complex with ADPR at an improved resolution, as well as the crystal structures of Sirt2 in complex with ADPR and the indoles EX527 and CHIC35. These Sirt2-ADPR-indole complexes unexpectedly contain two indole molecules and provide novel insights into selective Sirt2 inhibition. The MMS approach for Sirt2 and Sirt3 may be used as the basis for structure-based optimization of Sirt2/3 inhibitors in the future.",

    "abstract": "A crystal structure of the lutein-binding domain of human StARD3 (StAR-related lipid-transfer protein 3; also known as MLN64) has been refined to 1.74 Å resolution. A previous structure of the same protein determined to 2.2 Å resolution highlighted homology with StARD1 and shared cholesterol-binding character. StARD3 has since been recognized as a carotenoid-binding protein in the primate retina, where its biochemical function of binding lutein with specificity appears to be well suited to recruit this photoprotective molecule. The current and previous structures correspond closely to each other (r.m.s.d. of 0.25 Å), especially in terms of the helix-grip fold constructed around a solvent-filled cavity. Regions of interest were defined with alternate conformations in the current higher-resolution structure, including Arg351 found within the cavity and Ω1, a loop of four residues found just outside the cavity entrance. Models of the complex with lutein generated by rigid-body docking indicate that one of the ionone rings must protrude outside the cavity, and this insight has implications for molecular interactions with transport proteins and enzymes that act on lutein. Interestingly, models with the ∊-ionone ring characteristic of lutein pointing towards the bottom of the cavity were associated with fewer steric clashes, suggesting that steric complementarity and ligand asymmetry may play a role in discriminating lutein from the other ocular carotenoids zeaxanthin and meso -zeaxanthin, which only have β-ionone rings.",

The novel binding site was about 26 Å away from the T1 binding pocket. Comparison with known structures of other laccases revealed that the hole is a specific feature of CotA. The key residues Arg476 and Ser360 were directly bound to ABTS. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the residues Arg146, Arg429 and Arg476, which are located at the bottom of the novel binding site, are essential for the oxidation of ABTS and syringaldazine. Specially, a Thr480Phe variant was identified to be almost 3.5 times more specific for ABTS than for syringaldazine compared with the wild type.

To enable such experiments in a widespread manner, an affordable 96-compound library has been assembled for fragment screening in both academia and industry. The library is selected from already existing protein–ligand structures and is characterized by a broad ligand diversity, including buffer ingredients, carbohydrates, nucleotides, amino acids, peptide-like fragments and various drug-like organic compounds. When applied to the model protease endothiapepsin in a crystallographic screening experiment, a hit rate of nearly 10% was obtained. In comparison to other fragment libraries and considering that no pre-screening was performed, this hit rate is remarkably high. This demonstrates the general suitability of the selected compounds for an initial fragment-screening campaign. The library composition, experimental considerations and time requirements for a complete crystallographic fragment-screening campaign are discussed as well as the nine fully refined obtained endothiapepsin–fragment structures. While most of the fragments bind close to the catalytic centre of endothiapepsin in poses that have been observed previously, two fragments address new sites on the protein surface. ITC measurements show that the fragments bind to endothiapepsin with millimolar affinity.",

The components of this motor and the actin-regulatory proteins in Apicomplexa have unique features compared with all other eukaryotes.

A promising strategy to treat such resistant pathogens is the co-administration of MBL inhibitors together with β-lactam antibiotics. However, an MBL inhibitor suitable for clinical use has not yet been identified. Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase 2 (VIM-2) is a widespread MBL with a broad substrate spectrum and hence is an interesting drug target for the treatment of β-lactam-resistant infections. In this study, three triazolylthioacetamides were tested as inhibitors of VIM-2. One of the tested compounds showed clear inhibition of VIM-2, with an IC 50 of 20 µ M . The crystal structure of the inhibitor in complex with VIM-2 was obtained by DMSO-free co-crystallization and was solved at a resolution of 1.50 Å. To our knowledge, this is the first structure of a triazolylthioacetamide inhibitor in complex with an MBL. Analysis of the structure shows that the inhibitor binds to the two zinc ions in the active site of VIM-2 and revealed detailed information on the interactions involved. Furthermore, the crystal structure showed that binding of the inhibitor induced a conformational change of the conserved residue Trp87.",

The 1.90 Å resolution crystal structure of L. salivarius BSH was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of Clostridium perfringens BSH as a starting model. It revealed this BSH to be a member of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily. Crystals of apo BSH belonged to space group P21212, with unit-cell parameters a = 90.79, b = 87.35, c = 86.76 Å (PDB entry 5hke). Two BSH molecules packed perfectly as a dimer in one asymmetric unit. Comparative structural analysis of L. salivarius BSH also identified potential residues that contribute to catalysis and substrate specificity.",

Recent data indicate that the Z-ring is composed of small patches of FtsZ protofilaments that travel around the bacterial cell by treadmilling. Treadmilling involves a switch from a relaxed (R) state, favored for monomers, to a tense (T) conformation, which is favored upon association into filaments. The R conformation has been observed in numerous monomeric FtsZ crystal structures and the T conformation in Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ crystallized as assembled filaments. However, while Escherichia coli has served as a main model system for the study of the Z-ring and the associated divisome, a structure has not yet been reported for E. coli FtsZ. To address this gap, structures were determined of the E. coli FtsZ mutant FtsZ(L178E) with GDP and GTP bound to 1.35 and 1.40 Å resolution, respectively. The E. coli FtsZ(L178E) structures both crystallized as straight filaments with subunits in the R conformation. These high-resolution structures can be employed to facilitate experimental cell-division studies and their interpretation in E. coli .",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans , found in the human oral cavity, is a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of dental caries. This bacterium expresses three genetically distinct types of glucosyltransferases named GtfB (GTF-I), GtfC (GTF-SI) and GtfD (GTF-S) that play critical roles in the development of dental plaque. The catalytic domains of GtfB, GtfC and GtfD contain conserved active-site residues for the overall enzymatic activity that relate to hydrolytic glycosidic cleavage of sucrose to glucose and fructose, release of fructose and generation of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate in the reducing end. In a subsequent transglycosylation step, the glucosyl moiety is transferred to the nonreducing end of an acceptor to form a growing glucan polymer chain made up of glucose molecules. It has been proposed that both sucrose breakdown and glucan synthesis occur in the same active site of the catalytic domain, although the active site does not appear to be large enough to accommodate both functions. These three enzymes belong to glycoside hydrolase family 70 (GH70), which shows homology to glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13). GtfC synthesizes both soluble and insoluble glucans (α-1,3 and α-1,6 glycosidic linkages), while GtfB and GtfD synthesize only insoluble or soluble glucans, respectively. Here, crystal structures of the catalytic domains of GtfB and GtfD are reported. These structures are compared with previously determined structures of the catalytic domain of GtfC. With this work, apo structures and inhibitor-complex structures with acarbose are now available for the catalytic domains of GtfC and GtfB. The structure of GtfC with maltose allows further identification and comparison of active-site residues. A model of sucrose binding to GtfB is also included. The new structure of the catalytic domain of GtfD affords a structural comparison of the three S. mutans glycosyltransferases. Unfortunately, the catalytic domain of GtfD is not complete since crystallization resulted in the structure of a truncated protein lacking approximately 200 N-terminal residues of domain IV.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is the primary causative agent of peptic ulcer disease, among other gastrointestinal ailments, and currently affects over half of the global population. Although some treatments exist, growing resistance to these drugs has prompted efforts to develop novel approaches to fighting this pathogen. To generate many of the nucleotides essential to biochemical processes, H. pylori relies exclusively on the de novo biosynthesis of these molecules. Recent drug-discovery efforts have targeted the first committed step of this pathway, catalysed by a class 2 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). However, these initiatives have been limited by the lack of a crystal structure. Here, we detail the crystal structure of H. pylori DHODH ( Hp DHODH) at 2.25 Å resolution (PDB entry 6b8s). We performed a large-scale bioinformatics search to find evolutionary homologs. Our results indicate that Hp DHODH shows high conservation of both sequence and structure in its active site. We identified key polar interactions between the Hp DHODH protein and its requisite flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor, identifying amino-acid residues that are critical to its function. Most notably, we found that Hp DHODH maintains several structural features that allow it to associate with the inner membrane and utilize ubiquinone to achieve catalytic turnover. We discovered a hydrophobic channel that runs from the putative membrane interface on the N-terminal microdomain to the core of the protein. We predict that this channel establishes a connection between the ubiquinone pool in the membrane and the FMN in the active site. These findings provide a structural explanation for the competitive inhibition of ubiquinone by pyrazole-based compounds that was determined biochemically in other studies. Understanding this mechanism may facilitate the development of new drugs targeting this enzyme and push the effort to find a resistance-free treatment for H. pylori .",

Gonorrhea has a significantly high morbidity rate due to the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to rapidly develop antibiotic resistance. In this paper, crystal structures of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) from N. gonorrhoeae ( Ng TrpRS) were determined in both its apo form and in complex with tryptophan. The structures reveal conserved HIGH and KMSKS motifs critical for ATP binding and catalysis, and highlight conformational changes in the active site upon tryptophan binding, including a methionine flip and the rearrangement of hydrogen-bonding residues. Structural alignments with human TrpRS isoforms demonstrate significant differences between the bacterial and human cytosolic forms, particularly in their active sites. While Ng TrpRS and human mitochondrial TrpRS share conserved catalytic residues that are essential for binding tryptophan and indolmycin, the cytosolic TrpRS contains substitutions that introduce steric hindrance, limiting the binding of indolmycin. These results provide insight for the development of inhibitors targeting bacterial TrpRS without affecting the human mitochondrial or cytosolic isoforms, contributing to efforts to combat antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infections.",

A family of S -adenosylmethionine-dependent mycolic acid synthases modify mycolic acids and represent promising drug targets. UmaA is currently the least-understood member of this family. This paper describes the crystal structure of UmaA. UmaA is a monomer composed of two domains: a structurally conserved SAM-binding domain and a variable substrate-binding auxiliary domain. Fortuitously, our structure contains a nitrate in the active site, a structural mimic of carbonate, which is a known general base in cyclopropane-adding synthases. Further investigation indicated that the structure of the N-terminus is highly flexible. Finally, we have identified S -adenosyl- N -decyl-aminoethyl as a promising potential inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "Carboplatin is a second-generation platinum anticancer agent used for the treatment of a variety of cancers. Previous X-ray crystallographic studies of carboplatin binding to histidine (in hen egg-white lysozyme; HEWL) showed the partial conversion of carboplatin to cisplatin owing to the high NaCl concentration used in the crystallization conditions. HEWL co-crystallizations with carboplatin in NaBr conditions have now been carried out to confirm whether carboplatin converts to the bromine form and whether this takes place in a similar way to the partial conversion of carboplatin to cisplatin observed previously in NaCl conditions. Here, it is reported that a partial chemical transformation takes place but to a transplatin form. Thus, to attempt to resolve purely carboplatin binding at histidine, this study utilized co-crystallization of HEWL with carboplatin without NaCl to eliminate the partial chemical conversion of carboplatin. Tetragonal HEWL crystals co-crystallized with carboplatin were successfully obtained in four different conditions, each at a different pH value. The structural results obtained show carboplatin bound to either one or both of the N atoms of His15 of HEWL, and this particular variation was dependent on the concentration of anions in the crystallization mixture and the elapsed time, as well as the pH used. The structural details of the bound carboplatin molecule also differed between them. Overall, the most detailed crystal structure showed the majority of the carboplatin atoms bound to the platinum centre; however, the four-carbon ring structure of the cyclobutanedicarboxylate moiety (CBDC) remained elusive. The potential impact of the results for the administration of carboplatin as an anticancer agent are described.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence can be a powerful tool to aid in the crystallization of proteins. In the trace-labeling approach, the protein is covalently derivatized with a high-quantum-yield visible-wavelength fluorescent probe. The final probe concentration typically labels ≤0.20% of the protein molecules, which has been shown to not affect the crystal nucleation or diffraction quality. The labeled protein is then used in a plate-screening experiment in the usual manner. As the most densely packed state of the protein is the crystalline form, then crystals show as the brightest objects in the well under fluorescent illumination. A study has been carried out on the effects of trace fluorescent labeling on the screening results obtained compared with nonlabeled protein, and it was found that considering the stochastic nature of the crystal nucleation process the presence of the probe did not affect the outcomes obtained. Other effects are realised when using fluorescence. Crystals are clearly seen even when buried in precipitate. This approach also finds `hidden' leads, in the form of bright spots, with ∼30% of the leads found being optimized to crystals in a single-pass optimization trial. The use of visible fluorescence also enables the selection of colors that bypass interfering substances, and the screening materials do not have to be UV-transparent.",

    "abstract": "Crystallization remains the bottleneck in the crystallographic process leading from a gene to a three-dimensional model of the encoded protein or RNA. Automation of the individual steps of a crystallization experiment, from the preparation of crystallization cocktails for initial or optimization screens to the imaging of the experiments, has been the response to address this issue. Today, large high-throughput crystallization facilities, many of them open to the general user community, are capable of setting up thousands of crystallization trials per day. It is thus possible to test multiple constructs of each target for their ability to form crystals on a production-line basis. This has improved success rates and made crystallization much more convenient. High-throughput crystallization, however, cannot relieve users of the task of producing samples of high quality. Moreover, the time gained from eliminating manual preparations must now be invested in the careful evaluation of the increased number of experiments. The latter requires a sophisticated data and laboratory information-management system. A review of the current state of automation at the individual steps of crystallization with specific attention to the automation of optimization is given.",

POZ domains mediate both homodimerization and the heteromeric interactions of different POZ-domain transcription factors with each other. Miz1 is a POZ-domain transcription factor that regulates cell-cycle arrest and DNA-damage responses. The activities of Miz1 are altered by its interaction with the POZ-domain transcriptional repressors BCL6 and NAC1, and these interactions have been implicated in tumourigenesis in B-cell lymphomas and in ovarian serous carcinomas that overexpress BCL6 and NAC1, respectively. A strategy for the purification of tethered POZ domains that form forced heterodimers is described, and crystal structures of the heterodimeric POZ domains of Miz1/BCL6 and of Miz1/NAC1 are reported. These structures will be relevant for the design of therapeutics that target POZ-domain interaction interfaces.",

Here, the crystal structure of the ADP-bound form of human DHX15 is reported at a resolution of 2.0 Å. This is the first structure to be revealed of a member of the mammalian DEAH-box RNA helicase (DEAH/RHA) family in a nearly complete form, including the catalytic core consisting of the two N-terminal RecA domains and the C-terminal regulatory domains (CTD). The ADP-bound form of DHX15 displayed a compact structure, in which the RecA domains made extensive contacts with the CTD. Notably, a potential RNA-binding site was found on the surface of a RecA domain with positive electrostatic potential. Almost all structural features were conserved between the fungal Prp43 and the human DHX15, suggesting that they share a fundamentally common mechanism of action and providing a better understanding of the specific mammalian functions of DHX15.",

Knockout studies have suggested that modulating the activity of AQPs could be beneficial for the treatment of several pathologies. In particular, aquaporin 1 is a key factor in cell migration and angiogenesis, and constitutes a possible target for anticancer compounds and also for the treatment of glaucoma. Here, a preliminary crystallographic analysis at 3.28 Å resolution of crystals of human aquaporin 1 (hAQP1) obtained from protein expressed in Sf9 insect cells is reported. The crystals belonged to the tetragonal space group I422, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 89.28, c = 174.9 Å, and contained one monomer per asymmetric unit. The hAQP1 biological tetramer is generated via the crystallographic fourfold axis. This work extends previous electron crystallographic studies that used material extracted from human red blood cells, in which the resolution was limited to approximately 3.8 Å. It will inform efforts to improve lattice contacts and the diffraction limit for the future structure-based discovery of specific hAQP1 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Detergents are widely used for the isolation and solubilization of membrane proteins to support crystallization and structure determination. Detergents are amphiphilic molecules that form micelles once the characteristic critical micelle concentration (CMC) is achieved and can solubilize membrane proteins by the formation of micelles around them. The results are presented of a study of micelle formation observed by in situ dynamic light-scattering (DLS) analyses performed on selected detergent solutions using a newly designed advanced hardware device. DLS was initially applied in situ to detergent samples with a total volume of approximately 2 µl. When measured with DLS, pure detergents show a monodisperse radial distribution in water at concentrations exceeding the CMC. A series of all-trans n-alkyl-β-D-maltopyranosides, from n-hexyl to n-tetradecyl, were used in the investigations. The results obtained verify that the application of DLS in situ is capable of distinguishing differences in the hydrodynamic radii of micelles formed by detergents differing in length by only a single CH2 group in their aliphatic tails. Subsequently, DLS was applied to investigate the distribution of hydrodynamic radii of membrane proteins and selected water-insoluble proteins in presence of detergent micelles. The results confirm that stable protein-detergent complexes were prepared for (i) bacteriorhodopsin and (ii) FetA in complex with a ligand as examples of transmembrane proteins. A fusion of maltose-binding protein and the Duck hepatitis B virus X protein was added to this investigation as an example of a non-membrane-associated protein with low water solubility. The increased solubility of this protein in the presence of detergent could be monitored, as well as the progress of proteolytic cleavage to separate the fusion partners. This study demonstrates the potential of in situ DLS to optimize solutions of protein-detergent complexes for crystallization applications.",

The extent to which individual family members have been characterized and linked to biological function varies greatly. The role of myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8), as an inhibitor of muscle differentiation is well understood through genetic linkages. In contrast, the role of growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) is much less well understood. In humans, the mature forms of GDF11 and myostatin are over 94% identical. In order to understand the role that the small differences in sequence may play in the differential signaling of these molecules, the crystal structure of GDF11 was determined to a resolution of 1.50 Å. A comparison of the GDF11 structure with those of other family members reveals that the canonical TGF-β domain fold is conserved. A detailed structural comparison of GDF11 and myostatin shows that several of the differences between these proteins are likely to be localized at interfaces that are critical for the interaction with downstream receptors and inhibitors.",

While the mechanisms of macromolecular crystal growth are essentially the same as for conventional crystals, the underlying parameters are vastly different, in some cases orders of magnitude lower, and this produces very different crystallization processes. Numerous physical features of macromolecular crystals are of serious interest to X-ray diffractionists; the resolution limit and mosaicity, for example, reflect the degree of molecular and lattice order. The defect structure of crystals has an impact on their response to flash-cooling, and terminal crystal size is dependent on impurity absorption and incorporation. The variety and extent of these issues are further unique to crystals of biological macromolecules. All of these features are amenable to study using atomic force microscopy, which provides direct images at the nanoscale level. Some of those images are presented here.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens have evolved a range of mechanisms to acquire iron from the host during infection. Several Gram-negative pathogens including members of the genera Neisseria and Moraxella have evolved two-component systems that can extract iron from the host glycoproteins lactoferrin and transferrin. The homologous iron-transport systems consist of a membrane-bound transporter and an accessory lipoprotein. While the mechanism behind iron acquisition from transferrin is well understood, relatively little is known regarding how iron is extracted from lactoferrin. Here, the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (N-lobe) of the accessory lipoprotein lactoferrin-binding protein B (LbpB) from the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis is reported. The structure is highly homologous to the previously determined structures of the accessory lipoprotein transferrin-binding protein B (TbpB) and LbpB from the bovine pathogen Moraxella bovis . Docking the LbpB structure with lactoferrin reveals extensive binding interactions with the N1 subdomain of lactoferrin. The nature of the interaction precludes apolactoferrin from binding LbpB, ensuring the specificity of iron-loaded lactoferrin. The specificity of LbpB safeguards proper delivery of iron-bound lactoferrin to the transporter lactoferrin-binding protein A (LbpA). The structure also reveals a possible secondary role for LbpB in protecting the bacteria from host defences. Following proteolytic digestion of lactoferrin, a cationic peptide derived from the N-terminus is released. This peptide, called lactoferricin, exhibits potent antimicrobial effects. The docked model of LbpB with lactoferrin reveals that LbpB interacts extensively with the N-terminal lactoferricin region. This may provide a venue for preventing the production of the peptide by proteolysis, or directly sequestering the peptide, protecting the bacteria from the toxic effects of lactoferricin.",

In another approach, the `fusion of interacting proteins approach', protein assemblies can be stabilized by covalently linking the interacting partners. The linker connecting the proteins plays different roles in the two applications: in the first approach a rigid linker is required to reduce conformational heterogeneity; in the second, conversely, a flexible linker is required that allows the native interaction between the fused proteins.

    "abstract": "During the last decade, the number of three-dimensional structures solved by X-ray crystallography has increased dramatically. By 2014, it had crossed the landmark of 100 000 biomolecular structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. This tremendous increase in successfully crystallized proteins is primarily owing to improvements in cloning strategies, the automation of the crystallization process and new innovative approaches to monitor crystallization. However, these improvements are mainly restricted to soluble proteins, while the crystallization and structural analysis of membrane proteins or proteins that undergo major post-translational modifications remains challenging. In addition, the need for relatively large crystals for conventional X-ray crystallography usually prevents the analysis of dynamic processes within cells. Thus, the advent of high-brilliance synchrotron and X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources and the establishment of serial crystallography (SFX) have opened new avenues in structural analysis using crystals that were formerly unusable. The successful structure elucidation of cathepsin B, accomplished by the use of microcrystals obtained by in vivo crystallization in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, clearly proved that crystals grown intracellularly are very well suited for X-ray analysis. Here, methods by which in vivo crystals can be obtained, isolated and used for structural analysis by novel highly brilliant XFEL and synchrotron-radiation sources are summarized and discussed.",

The majority of normal functioning cells exhibit low-level expression of CA IX. However, in cancer cells CA IX is upregulated as a consequence of a metabolic transition known as the Warburg effect. The upregulation of CA IX for cancer progression has drawn interest in it being a potential therapeutic target. CA IX is a transmembrane protein, and its purification, yield and crystallization have proven challenging to structure-based drug design, whereas the closely related cytosolic soluble isoform CA II can be expressed and crystallized with ease. Therefore, we have utilized structural alignments and site-directed mutagenesis to engineer a CA II that mimics the active site of CA IX. In this paper, the X-ray crystal structure of this CA IX mimic in complex with sucrose is presented and has been refined to a resolution of 1.5 Å, an R cryst of 18.0% and an R free of 21.2%. The binding of sucrose at the entrance to the active site of the CA IX mimic, and not CA II, in a non-inhibitory mechanism provides a novel carbohydrate moiety binding site that could be further exploited to design isoform-specific inhibitors of CA IX.",

A large number of proteins associated with PCNA have a well characterized sequence termed the PCNA-interacting protein box motif (PIPM). Another PCNA-interacting sequence termed the AlkB homologue 2 PCNA-interacting motif (APIM), comprising the five consensus residues (K/R)-(F/Y/W)-(L/I/V/A)-(L/I/V/A)-(K/R), has also been identified in various proteins. In contrast to that with PIPM, the PCNA–APIM interaction is less well understood. Here, the crystal structure of PCNA bound to a peptide carrying an APIM consensus sequence, RFLVK, was determined and structure-based interaction analysis was performed. The APIM peptide binds to the PIPM-binding pocket on PCNA in a similar way to PIPM. The phenylalanine and leucine residues within the APIM consensus sequence and a hydrophobic residue that precedes the APIM consensus sequence are crucially involved in interactions with the hydrophobic pocket of PCNA. This interaction is essential for overall binding. These results provide a structural basis for regulation of the PCNA interaction and might aid in the development of specific inhibitors of this interaction.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular NMR spectroscopy has limitations in the determination of protein structures: an inherent size limit and the requirement for expensive and potentially difficult isotope labelling pose considerable hurdles. Therefore, structural analysis of larger proteins is almost exclusively performed by crystallography. However, the diversity of biological NMR applications outperforms that of any other structural biology technique. For the characterization of transient complexes formed by proteins and small ligands, notably oligosaccharides, one NMR technique has recently proven to be particularly powerful: saturation-transfer difference NMR (STD-NMR) spectroscopy. STD-NMR experiments are fast and simple to set up, with no general protein size limit and no requirement for isotope labelling. The method performs best in the moderate-to-low affinity range that is of interest in most of glycobiology. With small amounts of unlabelled protein, STD-NMR experiments can identify hits from mixtures of potential ligands, characterize mutant proteins and pinpoint binding epitopes on the ligand side. STD-NMR can thus be employed to complement and improve protein–ligand complex models obtained by other structural biology techniques or by purely computational means. With a set of protein–glycan interactions from our own work, this review provides an introduction to the technique for structural biologists. It exemplifies how crystallography and STD-NMR can be combined to elucidate protein–glycan (and other protein–ligand) interactions in atomic detail, and how the technique can extend structural biology from simplified systems amenable to crystallization to more complex biological entities such as membranes, live viruses or entire cells.",

A novel representative from the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily, dubbed GcL, was isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus caldoxylosilyticus.

Here, we show that GcL is a thermostable enzyme with a half-life at 75°C of 152.5 ± 10 min. Remarkably, it is also shown that GcL is among the most active lactonases characterized to date, with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) against AHLs of greater than 10(6) M(-1) s(-1). The structure of GcL is expected to shed light on the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and the molecular determinants for the substrate specificity in this class of lactonases.

As detectors become more sensitive and X-ray sources more intense, the notion of a crystal is gradually changing from one large enough to embellish expensive jewellery to objects that have external dimensions of the order of the wavelength of visible light. Identifying these crystals is a prerequisite to their study. This paper discusses developments in identifying these crystals during crystallization screening and distinguishing them from other potential outcomes.

This information provides new insight into the design of high-affinity DHODH inhibitors for the treatment of malaria.",

FS14 was solved to a crystallographic R factor of 0.1619 at 1.10 Å resolution. Similar to its homologues, it mainly consists of two domains: an N-terminal catalytic domain and a `parallel β-roll' C-terminal domain. Comparative studies show that the shape of the catalytic active-site cavity is more open owing to the 189-198 loop, with a short 310-helix protruding further from the molecular surface, and that the β-sheets comprising the `parallel β-roll' are longer than those in its homologues. The formation of hydrogen bonds from one of the nonconserved residues (Asn200) to Lys27 may contribute to the thermostability.",

These structures are compared with those previously reported at 2.20 Å resolution to show that the fold is quite resistant to structural deformation in different crystal environments. Unexpectedly, a short peptide is found in the monoclinic crystals at a site remote from the known hyaluronan-binding groove. The peptide with a valine at the carboxy-terminus must have co-purified from the bacterial expression host and binds on the opposite side of the domain from the known hyaluronan-binding groove.

Tankyrase 1 (TNKS1) is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase that regulates the activity of TRF1 through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). PARylation of TRF1 by TNKS1 leads to the release of TRF1 from telomeres and allows telomerase to access telomeres. The interaction between TRF1 and TNKS1 is thus important for telomere stability and the mitotic cell cycle. Here, the crystal structure of a complex between the N-terminal acidic domain of TRF1 (residues 1–55) and a fragment of TNKS1 covering the second and third ankyrin-repeat clusters (ARC2-3) is presented at 2.2 Å resolution. The TNKS1–TRF1 complex crystals were optimized using an `oriented rescreening' strategy, in which the initial crystallization condition was used as a guide for a second round of large-scale sparse-matrix screening. This crystallographic and biochemical analysis provides a better understanding of the TRF1–TNKS1 interaction and the three-dimensional structure of the ankyrin-repeat domain of TNKS.",

In PXS, crystallization plates were automatically set up using the vapor-diffusion method, transferred to incubators and automatically observed according to a pre-set schedule. The captured images of each crystallization drop could be monitored through the internet using a web browser. While the screening throughput of PXS was very high, the demands of users have gradually changed over the ensuing years. To study difficult proteins, it has become important to screen crystallization conditions using small amounts of proteins. Moreover, membrane proteins have become one of the main targets for X-ray crystallography. Therefore, to meet the evolving demands of users, PXS was upgraded to PXS2. In PXS2, the minimum volume of the dispenser is reduced to 0.1 µl to minimize the amount of sample, and the resolution of the captured images is increased to five million pixels in order to observe small crystallization drops in detail. In addition to the 20°C incubators, a 4°C incubator was installed in PXS2 because crystallization results may vary with temperature. To support membrane-protein crystallization, PXS2 includes a procedure for the bicelle method. In addition, the system supports a lipidic cubic phase (LCP) method that uses a film sandwich plate and that was specifically designed for PXS2. These improvements expand the applicability of PXS2, reducing the bottleneck of X-ray protein crystallography.",

This enzyme is able to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of both conjugated (folate) and unconjugated (biopterin) pterins to their tetrahydro forms, starting from oxidized- or dihydro-state substrates. The currently available X-ray structures of Leishmania major PTR1 (LmPTR1) show the enzyme in its unbound, unconjugated substrate-bound (with biopterin derivatives) and inhibitor-bound forms. However, no structure has yet been determined of LmPTR1 bound to a conjugated substrate. Here, the high-resolution crystal structure of LmPTR1 in complex with folic acid is presented and the intermolecular forces that drive the binding of the substrate in the catalytic pocket are described. By expanding the collection of LmPTR1 structures in complex with process intermediates, additional insights into the active-site rearrangements that occur during the catalytic process are provided. In contrast to previous structures with biopterin derivatives, a small but significant difference in the orientation of Asp181 and Tyr194 of the catalytic triad is found. This feature is shared by PTR1 from T. brucei (TbPTR1) in complex with the same substrate molecule and may be informative in deciphering the importance of such residues at the beginning of the catalytic process.",

Serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) helps to address this hurdle by allowing the use of many medium- to small-sized crystals. Here, a recently introduced serial sample-support chip system has been used to obtain the first SSX structure of a human phosphatase, specifically protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in the unliganded (apo) state. In previous apo room-temperature structures, the active site and allosteric sites adopted alternate conformations, including open and closed conformations of the active-site WPD loop and of a distal allosteric site. By contrast, in our SSX structure the active site is best fitted with a single conformation, but the distal allosteric site is best fitted with alternate conformations. This observation argues for additional nuance in interpreting the nature of allosteric coupling in this protein. Overall, our results illustrate the promise of serial methods for room-temperature crystallography, as well as future avant-garde crystallography experiments, for PTP1B and other proteins.",

The structure of the Fab fragment of a naturally paired bovine ultralong antibody (D08), identified by single B-cell sequencing, has been determined to 1.6 Å resolution. By swapping the D08 native light chain with that of an unrelated antigen-unknown ultralong antibody, it is shown that interactions between the CDR3s of the variable domains potentially affect the fine positioning of the ultralong CDR3H; however, comparison with other crystallographic structures shows that crystalline packing is also a major contributor.

Among them, AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) and IFI16 (γ-interferon-inducible protein 16) recognize double-stranded DNA to initiate inflammatory responses. In contrast, p202, a mouse interferon-inducible protein containing two HIN domains (HINa and HINb), has been reported to inhibit Aim2-mediated inflammatory signalling in mouse. To understand the inhibitory mechanism, the crystal structure of the p202 HINa domain in complex with a 20 bp DNA was determined, in which p202 HINa nonspecifically recognizes both strands of DNA through electrostatic attraction. The p202 HINa domain binds DNA more tightly than does AIM2 HIN, and the DNA-binding mode of p202 HINa is different from that of the AIM2 HIN and IFI16 HINb domains. These results, together with the reported data on p202 HINb, lead to an interaction model for full-length p202 and dsDNA which provides a conceivable mechanism for the negative regulation of Aim2 inflammasome activation by p202.",

    "abstract": "Omalizumab is a humanized anti-IgE antibody that inhibits the binding of IgE to its receptors on mast cells and basophils, thus blocking the IgE-mediated release of inflammatory mediators from these cells. Omalizumab binds to the Fc domains of IgE in proximity to the binding site of the high-affinity IgE receptor Fc∊RI, but the epitope and the mechanisms and conformations governing the recognition remain unknown. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of its anti-IgE activity, the aim was to analyse the interaction of omalizumab with human IgE. Therefore, IgE Fc C∊2–4 was recombinantly produced in mammalian HEK-293 cells. Functionality of the IgE Fc was proven by ELISA and mediator-release assays. Omalizumab IgG was cleaved with papain and the resulting Fab was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The complex of IgE Fc with omalizumab was prepared by size-exclusion chromatography. However, crystals containing the complex were not obtained, suggesting that the process of crystallization favoured the dissociation of the two proteins. Instead, two structures of the omalizumab Fab with maximum resolutions of 1.9 and 3.0 Å were obtained. The structures reveal the arrangement of the CDRs and the position of omalizumab residues known from prior functional studies to be involved in IgE binding. Thus, the structure of omalizumab provides the structural basis for understanding the function of omalizumab, allows optimization of the procedure for complex crystallization and poses questions about the conformational requirements for anti-IgE activity.",

In initial screening, diffraction-quality crystals were obtained for only three Fabs, while many Fabs produced hits that required optimization. Application of MMS, using the initial screens and/or refinement screens, resulted in diffraction-quality crystals of these Fabs. Five Fabs that failed to give hits in the initial screen were crystallized by cross-seeding MMS followed by MMS optimization. The crystallization protocols and strategies that resulted in structure determination of all 16 Fabs are presented. These results illustrate the power of MMS and provide a basis for developing future strategies for macromolecular crystallization.",

    "abstract": "Plasmepsin II (PMII) is one of the ten plasmepsins (PMs) identified in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe and deadliest form of malaria. Owing to the emergence of P. falciparum strains that are resistant to current antimalarial agents such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, there is a constant pressure to find new and lasting chemotherapeutic drug therapies. Previously, the crystal structure of PMII in complex with NU655, a potent antimalarial hydroxyethylamine-based inhibitor, and the design of new compounds based on it have been reported. In the current study, two of these newly designed hydroxyethylamine-based inhibitors, PG418 and PG394, were cocrystallized with PMII and their structures were solved, analyzed and compared with that of the PMII-NU655 complex. Structural analysis of the PMII-PG418 complex revealed that the flap loop can adopt a fully closed conformation, stabilized by interactions with the inhibitor, and a fully open conformation, causing an overall expansion in the active-site cavity, which in turn causes unstable binding of the inhibitor. PG418 also stabilizes the flexible loop Gln275-Met286 of another monomer in the asymmetric unit of PMII, which is disordered in the PMII-NU655 complex structure. The crystal structure of PMII in complex with the inhibitor PG418 demonstrates the conformational flexibility of the active-site cavity of the plasmepsins. The interactions of the different moieties in the P1' position of PG418 and PG394 with Thr217 have to be taken into account in the design of new potent plasmepsin inhibitors.",

To establish the structural basis for the recognition of CDE RNA by Roquin, the crystal structure of the ROQ domain of human Roquin-2 was determined in ligand-free and CDE-derived RNA-bound forms. The ROQ domain of Roquin-2 folded into a winged-helix structure in which the wing region showed structural flexibility and acted as a lid for RNA binding. The CDE RNA, forming a stem-loop structure, bound to the positively charged surface of the ROQ domain and was mainly recognized via direct interactions with the phosphate backbone in the 5′ half of the stem-loop and its triloop and via indirect water-mediated interactions. Structural comparison with Roquin-1 revealed conserved features of the RNA-binding mode. Therefore, it is suggested that the Roquin proteins function redundantly in mRNA degradation.",

Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) has an important role in the metabolism of trypanosomatids, catalyzing the first step in the degradation pathway of aromatic amino acids, which are ultimately converted into their corresponding L-2-oxoacids. Unlike the enzyme in Trypanosoma cruzi and mammals, L. infantum TAT (LiTAT) is not able to transaminate ketoglutarate. Here, the structure of LiTAT at 2.35 Å resolution is reported, and it is confirmed that the presence of two Leishmania -specific residues (Gln55 and Asn58) explains, at least in part, this specific reactivity. The difference in substrate specificity between leishmanial and mammalian TAT and the importance of this enzyme in parasite metabolism suggest that it may be a useful target in the development of new drugs against leishmaniasis.",

A diverse set of 252 soluble protein samples was subjected to a standard formulation-screening protocol using DSF. Automated analysis of the DSF results suggest that in over 35% of cases buffer screening significantly increases the stability of the protein sample. Of the 28 standard formulations tested, three stood out as being statistically better than the others: these included a formulation containing the buffer citrate, long known to be `protein friendly'; bis-tris and ADA were also identified as being very useful buffers in protein formulations.",

    "abstract": "Glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 29 consists solely of α-L-fucosidases. These enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds. Here, the structure of GH29_0940, a protein cloned from metagenomic DNA from the rumen of a cow, has been solved, which reveals a multi-domain arrangement that has only recently been identified in bacterial GH29 enzymes. The microbial species that provided the source of this enzyme is unknown. This enzyme contains a second carbohydrate-binding domain at its C-terminal end in addition to the typical N-terminal catalytic domain and carbohydrate-binding domain arrangement of GH29-family proteins. GH29_0940 is a monomer and its overall structure consists of an N-terminal TIM-barrel-like domain, a central β-sandwich domain and a C-terminal β-sandwich domain. The TIM-barrel-like catalytic domain exhibits a (β/α)8/7 arrangement in the core instead of the typical (β/α)8 topology, with the `missing' α-helix replaced by a long meandering loop that `closes' the barrel structure and suggests a high degree of structural flexibility in the catalytic core. This feature was also noted in all six other structures of GH29 enzymes that have been deposited in the PDB. Based on sequence and structural similarity, the residues Asp162 and Glu220 are proposed to serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the proton donor, respectively. Like other GH29 enzymes, the GH29_0940 structure shows five strictly conserved residues in the catalytic pocket. The structure shows two glycerol molecules in the active site, which have also been observed in other GH29 structures, suggesting that the enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of small carbohydrates. The two binding domains are classed as family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM32). These domains have residues involved in ligand binding in the loop regions at the edge of the β-sandwich. The predicted substrate-binding residues differ between the modules, suggesting that different modules bind to different groups on the substrate(s). Enzymes that possess multiple copies of CBMs are thought to have a complex mechanism of ligand recognition. Defined electron density identifying a long 20-amino-acid hydrophilic loop separating the two CBMs was observed. This suggests that the additional C-terminal domain may have a dynamic range of movement enabled by the loop, allowing a unique mode of action for a GH29 enzyme that has not been identified previously.",

Depending on the species, it can be a homodimer or a homotetramer. Oligomerization plays a functional role not only because the active site is at the interface between subunits but also due to the interlocking tail-modulating activity, similar to that of isocitrate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme, which catalyse a similar type of reaction. Since the pioneering crystal structure of sheep liver 6PGDH, which allowed motifs common to the β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase superfamily to be recognized, several other 6PGDH crystal structures have been solved, including those of ternary complexes. These showed that more than one conformation exists, as had been suggested for many years from enzyme studies in solution. It is inferred that an asymmetrical conformation with a rearrangement of one of the two subunits underlies the homotropic cooperativity. There has been particular interest in the presence or absence of sulfate during crystallization. This might be related to the fact that this ion, which is a competitive inhibitor that binds in the active site, can induce the same 6PGDH configuration as in the complexes with physiological ligands. Mutagenesis, inhibitors, kinetic and binding studies, post-translational modifications and research on the enzyme in cancer cells have been complementary to the crystallographic studies. Computational modelling and new structural studies will probably help to refine the understanding of the functioning of this enzyme, which represents a promising therapeutic target in immunity, cancer and infective diseases. 6PGDH also has applied-science potential as a biosensor or a biobattery. To this end, the enzyme has been efficiently immobilized on specific polymers and nanoparticles. This review spans the 6PGDH literature and all of the 6PGDH crystal structure data files held by the Protein Data Bank.",

Alternatively, one can avoid covalent modification and use UV fluorescence, exploiting the intrinsic fluorescent amino acids present in most proteins. By the use of these techniques, crystals that had previously been obscured in the crystallization drop can readily be identified and distinguished from amorphous precipitate or salt crystals. Additionally, lead conditions that may not have been obvious as such under white-light illumination can be identified.

Previous X-ray crystallographic studies of carboplatin binding to histidine in hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) showed a partial chemical conversion of carboplatin to cisplatin owing to the high sodium chloride concentration used in the crystallization conditions. Also, the co-crystallization of HEWL with carboplatin in sodium bromide conditions resulted in the partial conversion of carboplatin to the transbromoplatin form, with a portion of the cyclobutanedicarboxylate (CBDC) moiety still present. The results of the co-crystallization of HEWL with cisplatin or carboplatin in sodium iodide conditions are now reported in order to determine whether the cisplatin and carboplatin converted to the iodo form, and whether this took place in a similar way to the partial conversion of carboplatin to cisplatin in NaCl conditions or to transbromoplatin in NaBr conditions as seen previously. It is reported here that a partial chemical transformation has taken place to a transplatin form for both ligands. The NaI-grown crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group P 2 1 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The chemically transformed cisplatin and carboplatin bind to both His15 residues, i.e. in each asymmetric unit. The binding is only at the N δ atom of His15. A third platinum species is also seen in both conditions bound in a crevice between symmetry-related molecules. Here, the platinum is bound to three I atoms identified based on their anomalous difference electron densities and their refined occupancies, with the fourth bound atom being a Cl atom (in the cisplatin case) or a portion of the CBDC moiety (in the carboplatin case).",

    "abstract": "The human RNA helicase DDX1 in the DEAD-box family plays an important role in RNA processing and has been associated with HIV-1 replication and tumour progression. Whereas previously described DEAD-box proteins have a structurally conserved core, DDX1 shows a unique structural feature: a large SPRY-domain insertion in its RecA-like consensus fold. SPRY domains are known to function as protein–protein interaction platforms. Here, the crystal structure of the SPRY domain of human DDX1 (hDSPRY) is reported at 2.0 Å resolution. The structure reveals two layers of concave, antiparallel β-sheets that stack onto each other and a third β-sheet beneath the β-sandwich. A comparison with SPRY-domain structures from other eukaryotic proteins showed that the general β-sandwich fold is conserved; however, differences were detected in the loop regions, which were identified in other SPRY domains to be essential for interaction with cognate partners. In contrast, in hDSPRY these loop regions are not strictly conserved across species. Interestingly, though, a conserved patch of positive surface charge is found that may replace the connecting loops as a protein–protein interaction surface. The data presented here comprise the first structural information on DDX1 and provide insights into the unique domain architecture of this DEAD-box protein. By providing the structure of a putative interaction domain of DDX1, this work will serve as a basis for further studies of the interaction network within the hetero-oligomeric complexes of DDX1 and of its recruitment to the HIV-1 Rev protein as a viral replication factor.",

    "abstract": "The enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase catalyzes the sixth step of the seven-step shikimate pathway. Chorismate, the product of the pathway, is a precursor for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, siderophores and metabolites such as folate, ubiquinone and vitamin K. The shikimate pathway is present in bacteria, fungi, algae, plants and apicomplexan parasites, but is absent in humans. The EPSP synthase enzyme produces 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate and phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate and shikimate 3-phosphate via a transferase reaction, and is the target of the herbicide glyphosate. The Acinetobacter baumannii gene encoding EPSP synthase, aroA, has previously been demonstrated to be essential during host infection for the growth and survival of this clinically important drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogen. Prephenate dehydrogenase is also encoded by the bifunctional A. baumannii aroA gene, but its activity is dependent upon EPSP synthase since it operates downstream of the shikimate pathway. As part of an effort to evaluate new antimicrobial targets, recombinant A. baumannii EPSP (AbEPSP) synthase, comprising residues Ala301-Gln756 of the aroA gene product, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. The crystal structure, determined to 2.37 Å resolution, is described in the context of a potential antimicrobial target and in comparison to EPSP synthases that are resistant or sensitive to the herbicide glyphosate.",

    "abstract": "Leishmania arginase is a potential drug target for the treatment of leishmaniasis because this binuclear manganese metalloenzyme initiates de novo polyamine biosynthesis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of L-arginine to generate L-ornithine and urea. The product L-ornithine subsequently undergoes decarboxylation to yield putrescine, which in turn is utilized for spermidine biosynthesis. Polyamines such as spermidine are essential for the growth and survival of the parasite, so inhibition of enzymes in the polyamine-biosynthetic pathway comprises an effective strategy for treating parasitic infections. To this end, two X-ray crystal structures of L. mexicana arginase complexed with α,α-disubstituted boronic amino-acid inhibitors based on the molecular scaffold of 2-( S )-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid are now reported. Structural comparisons with human and parasitic arginase complexes reveal interesting differences in the binding modes of the additional α-substituents, i.e. the D side chains, of these inhibitors. Subtle differences in the three-dimensional contours of the outer active-site rims among arginases from different species lead to different conformations of the D side chains and thus different inhibitor-affinity trends. The structures suggest that it is possible to maintain affinity while fine-tuning intermolecular interactions of the D side chain of α,α-disubstituted boronic amino-acid inhibitors in the search for isozyme-specific and species-specific arginase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Mass transport takes place within the mesoscopic to macroscopic scale range and plays a key role in crystal growth that may affect the result of the crystallization experiment. The influence of mass transport is different depending on the crystallization technique employed, essentially because each technique reaches supersaturation in its own unique way. In the case of batch experiments, there are some complex phenomena that take place at the interface between solutions upon mixing. These transport instabilities may drastically affect the reproducibility of crystallization experiments, and different outcomes may be obtained depending on whether or not the drop is homogenized. In diffusion experiments with aqueous solutions, evaporation leads to fascinating transport phenomena. When a drop starts to evaporate, there is an increase in concentration near the interface between the drop and the air until a nucleation event eventually takes place. Upon growth, the weight of the floating crystal overcomes the surface tension and the crystal falls to the bottom of the drop. The very growth of the crystal then triggers convective flow and inhomogeneities in supersaturation values in the drop owing to buoyancy of the lighter concentration-depleted solution surrounding the crystal. Finally, the counter-diffusion technique works if, and only if, diffusive mass transport is assured. The technique relies on the propagation of a supersaturation wave that moves across the elongated protein chamber and is the result of the coupling of reaction (crystallization) and diffusion. The goal of this review is to convince protein crystal growers that in spite of the small volume of the typical protein crystallization setup, transport plays a key role in the crystal quality, size and phase in both screening and optimization experiments.",

This event activates downstream effectors of STING and subsequently leads to activation of the type 1 interferon response. However, a previously solved structure of STING with 3′,3′-c-di-GMP shows Mg atoms mediating the interaction of STING with this CDN.

    "abstract": "Secreted protein components of hookworm species include a number of representatives of the cysteine-rich/antigen 5/pathogenesis-related 1 (CAP) protein family known as Ancylostoma-secreted proteins (ASPs). Some of these have been considered as candidate antigens for the development of vaccines against hookworms. The functions of most CAP superfamily members are poorly understood, but one form, the hookworm platelet inhibitor (HPI), has been isolated as a putative antagonist of the platelet integrins αIIbβ3 and α2β1. Here, the crystal structure of HPI is described and its structural features are examined in relation to its possible function. The HPI structure is similar to those of other ASPs and shows incomplete conservation of the sequence motifs CAP1 and CAP2 that are considered to be diagnostic of CAP superfamily members. The asymmetric unit of the HPI crystal contains a dimer with an extensive interaction interface, but chromatographic measurements indicate that it is primarily monomeric in solution. In the dimeric structure, the putative active-site cleft areas from both monomers are united into a single negatively charged depression. A potential Lys-Gly-Asp disintegrin-like motif was identified in the sequence of HPI, but is not positioned at the apex of a tight turn, making it unlikely that it interacts with the integrin. Recombinant HPI produced in Escherichia coli was found not to inhibit the adhesion of human platelets to collagen or fibrinogen, despite having a native structure as shown by X-ray diffraction. This result corroborates previous analyses of recombinant HPI and suggests that it might require post-translational modification or have a different biological function.",

    "abstract": "The de novo pyrimidine-biosynthesis pathway of Plasmodium falciparum is a promising target for antimalarial drug discovery. The parasite requires a supply of purines and pyrimidines for growth and proliferation and is unable to take up pyrimidines from the host. Direct (or indirect) inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis via dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( Pf DHODH), the fourth enzyme of the pathway, has already been shown to be lethal to the parasite. In the second step of the plasmodial pyrimidine-synthesis pathway, aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate are condensed to N -carbamoyl-L-aspartate and inorganic phosphate by aspartate transcarbamoylase ( Pf ATC). In this paper, the 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of Pf ATC is reported. The space group of the Pf ATC crystals was determined to be monoclinic P 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 87.0, b = 103.8, c = 87.1 Å, α = 90.0, β = 117.7, γ = 90.0°. The presented Pf ATC model shares a high degree of homology with the catalytic domain of Escherichia coli ATC. There is as yet no evidence of the existence of a regulatory domain in Pf ATC. Similarly to E. coli ATC, Pf ATC was modelled as a homotrimer in which each of the three active sites is formed at the oligomeric interface. Each active site comprises residues from two adjacent subunits in the trimer with a high degree of evolutional conservation. Here, the activity loss owing to mutagenesis of the key active-site residues is also described.",

Despite significant research pointing to a function in oxidative stress defence, the exact mechanisms of action of ergothioneine remain elusive. Although both humans and bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis seem to depend on ergothioneine, humans are devoid of the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes. Therefore, its biosynthesis may emerge as potential drug target in the development of novel therapeutics against tuberculosis. The recent identification of ergothioneine-biosynthetic genes in M. smegmatis enables a more systematic study of its biology. The pathway is initiated by EgtD, a SAM-dependent methyltransferase that catalyzes a trimethylation reaction of histidine to give N (α), N (α), N (α)-trimethylhistidine. Here, the recombinant production, purification and crystallization of EgtD are reported. Crystals of native EgtD diffracted to 2.35 Å resolution at a synchrotron beamline, whereas crystals of seleno-L-methionine-labelled protein diffracted to 1.75 Å resolution and produced a significant anomalous signal to 2.77 Å resolution at the K edge.

Regulation of this reaction in response to light controls carbon fixation during photosynthesis. Here, the crystal structure of PRK from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 6301 is presented. The enzyme is dimeric and has an α/β-fold with an 18-stranded β-sheet at its core. Interestingly, a disulfide bond is found between Cys40 and the P-loop residue Cys18, revealing the structural basis for the redox inactivation of PRK activity. A second disulfide bond appears to rigidify the dimer interface and may thereby contribute to regulation by the adaptor protein CP12 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.",

    "abstract": "The human membrane-bound α/β-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) protein modulates endocannabinoid signaling, which controls appetite, pain and learning, as well as being linked to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, through the degradation of the key lipid messenger 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG). This makes ABHD6 an attractive therapeutic target that lacks structural information. In order to better understand the molecular mechanism of 2-AG-hydrolyzing enzymes, the PA2949 protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which has 49% sequence similarity to the ABHD6 protein, was cloned, overexpressed, purified and crystallized. Overexpression of PA2949 in the homologous host yielded the membrane-bound enzyme, which was purified in milligram amounts. Besides their sequence similarity, the enzymes both show specificity for the hydrolysis of 2-AG and esters of medium-length fatty acids. PA2949 in the presence of n -octyl β-D-glucoside showed a higher activity and stability at room temperature than those previously reported for PA2949 overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli . A suitable expression host and stabilizing detergent were crucial for obtaining crystals, which belonged to the tetragonal space group I 4 1 22 and diffracted to a resolution of 2.54 Å. This study provides hints on the functional similarity of ABHD6-like proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and might guide the structural study of these difficult-to-crystallize proteins.",

The first published structure of the apo ligand-binding domain (LBD) of RXRα, which is still used as a reference today, contained inaccuracies. In the present work, these inaccuracies were corrected using modern crystallographic tools. The most important correction concerns the presence of a π-bulge in helix H7, which was originally built as a regular α-helix. The presence of several CHAPS molecules, which are visible for the first time in the electron-density map and which stabilize the H1–H3 loop, which contains helix H2, are also revealed. The apo RXR structure has played an essential role in deciphering the molecular mode of action of NR ligands and is still used in numerous biophysical studies. This refined structure should be used preferentially in the future in interpreting experiments as well as for modelling and structural dynamics studies of the apo RXRα LBD.",

SapA is known to bind lipids and detergents in a pH-dependent manner; this is accompanied by a striking transition from a `closed' to an `open' conformation. However, previous structures were determined at non-lysosomal pH. This work describes a 1.8 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure determined at the physiologically relevant lysosomal pH 4.8. In the absence of lipid or detergent at pH 4.8, SapA is observeed to adopt a conformation closely resembling the previously determined `closed' conformation, showing that pH alone is not sufficient for the transition to the `open' conformation.

Here, two crystal structures of AtNfs2 are reported: a wild-type form with the catalytic cysteine in a persulfide-intermediate state and a C384S variant mimicking the resting state of the enzyme.

The bacterium Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus is a representative of a significant component of this microbial community. It is a xylan-degrading organism whose genome encodes a large number of open reading frames annotated as fibre-degrading enzymes. This suite of enzymes is essential for the organism to utilize the plant material within the rumen as a fuel source, facilitating its survival in this competitive environment. Xsa43E, a GH43 enzyme from B. proteoclasticus , has been structurally and functionally characterized. Here, the structure of selenomethionine-derived Xsa43E determined to 1.3 Å resolution using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction is reported. Xsa43E possesses the characteristic five-bladed β-propeller domain seen in all GH43 enzymes. GH43 enzymes can have a range of functions, and the functional characterization of Xsa43E shows it to be an arabinofuranosidase capable of cleaving arabinose side chains from short segments of xylan. Full functional and structural characterization of xylan-degrading enzymes will aid in creating an enzyme cocktail that can be used to completely degrade plant material into simple sugars. These molecules have a range of applications as starting materials for many industrial processes, including renewable alternatives to fossil fuels.",

The first plant pro-tyrosinase from Malus domestica (MdPPO1) was recombinantly expressed in its latent form (56.4 kDa) and mutated at four positions around the catalytic pocket which are believed to influence the activity of the enzyme. Mutating the amino acids, which are known as activity controllers, yielded the mutants MdPPO1-Ala239Thr and MdPPO1-Leu243Arg, whereas mutation of the so-called water-keeper and gatekeeper residues resulted in the mutants MdPPO1-Glu234Ala and MdPPO1-Phe259Ala, respectively. The wild-type enzyme and two of the mutants, MdPPO1-Ala239Thr and MdPPO1-Phe259Ala, were successfully crystallized, leading to single crystals that diffracted to 1.35, 1.55 and 1.70 Å resolution, respectively.

In crystallo activity tests with the crystals of the wild type and the two mutants were performed by adding the monophenolic substrate tyramine and the diphenolic substrate dopamine to crystal-containing drops. The effects of the mutation on the activity of the enzyme were observed by colour changes of the crystals owing to the conversion of the substrates to dark chromophore products.",

The structure is nearly isomorphous to that of the previously reported crystal structure of the oligonucleotide d(CGTGAATTCACG) alone. The adjustments in crystal packing between the native DNA molecule and the DNA–DAPI complex are described. DAPI lies in the narrow minor groove near the centre of the B-DNA fragment, positioned over the A–T base pairs. It is bound to the DNA by hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions. Comparison of the two structures (with and without ligand) shows that DAPI inserts into the minor groove, displacing the ordered spine waters. Indeed, as DAPI is hydrophobic it confers this behaviour on the DNA and thus restricts the presence of water molecules.",

Mitochondria are the source of up to 90% of cellular ROS generation, and MnSOD performs its necessary bioprotective role by converting superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. This vital catalytic function is conducted via cyclic redox reactions between the substrate and the active-site manganese using proton-coupled electron transfers. Owing to protons being difficult to detect experimentally, the series of proton transfers that compose the catalytic mechanism of MnSOD are unknown. Here, methods are described to discern the proton-based mechanism using chemical treatments to control the redox state of large perdeuterated MnSOD crystals and subsequent neutron diffraction. These methods could be applicable to other crystal systems in which proton information on the molecule in question in specific chemical states is desired.",

Determining which set of chemicals to use in the initial screen is typically agnostic of the protein under investigation; however, crystallization efficiency could potentially be improved if this were not the case. Previous work has assumed that sequence similarity may provide useful information about appropriate crystallization cocktails; however, the authors are not aware of any quantitative verification of this assumption. This research investigates whether, given current information, one can detect any correlation between sequence similarity and crystallization cocktails. BLAST was used to quantitate the similarity between protein sequences in the Protein Data Bank, and this was compared with three estimations of the chemical similarities of the respective crystallization cocktails. No correlation was detected between proteins of similar (but not identical) sequence and their crystallization cocktails, suggesting that methods of determining screens based on this assumption are unlikely to result in screens that are better than those currently in use.",

The allosteric site, as defined by previous structural studies, is located in domain C between the phosphate-binding loop (residues 444–449) and the allosteric loop (residues 527–533). In this study, the X-ray crystal structures of four hLPYK variants were solved to make structural correlations with existing functional data. The variants are D499N, W527H, Δ529/S531G (called GGG here) and S531E. The results revealed a conformational toggle between the open and closed positions of the allosteric loop. In the absence of Fru-1,6-BP the open position is stabilized, in part, by a cation–π bond between Trp527 and Arg538′ (from an adjacent monomer). In the S531E variant glutamate binds in place of the 6′-phosphate of Fru-1,6-BP in the allosteric site, leading to partial allosteric activation. Finally, the structure of the D499N mutant does not provide structural evidence for the previously observed allosteric activation of the D499N variant.",

Commonly found mutations include L702H, W742C, H875Y, F877L and T878A, while the F877L mutation can convert second-generation antagonists such as enzalutamide and apalutamide into agonists. However, pruxelutamide, another second-generation AR antagonist, has no agonist activity with the F877L and F877L/T878A mutants and instead maintains its inhibitory activity against them. Here, it is shown that the quadruple mutation L702H/H875Y/F877L/T878A increases the soluble expression of AR LBD in complex with pruxelutamide in Escherichia coli . The crystal structure of the quadruple mutant in complex with the agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) reveals a partially open conformation of the AR LBD due to conformational changes in the loop connecting helices H11 and H12 (the H11–H12 loop) and Leu881. This partially open conformation creates a larger ligand-binding site for AR. Additional structural studies suggest that both the L702H and F877L mutations are important for conformational changes. This structural variability in the AR LBD could affect ligand binding as well as the resistance to antagonists.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum, a short-day tropical plant, has been adapted for temperate grain production, in particular through the selection of variants at the MATURITY loci ( Ma1 – Ma6 ) that reduce photoperiod sensitivity. Ma3 encodes phytochrome B (phyB), a red/far-red photochromic biliprotein photoreceptor. The multi-domain gene product, comprising 1178 amino acids, autocatalytically binds the phytochromobilin chromophore to form the photoactive holophytochrome (Sb.phyB). This study describes the development of an efficient heterologous overproduction system which allows the production of large quantities of various holoprotein constructs, along with purification and crystallization procedures. Crystals of the Pr (red-light-absorbing) forms of NPGP, PGP and PG (residues 1–655, 114–655 and 114–458, respectively), each C-terminally tagged with His 6 , were successfully produced. While NPGP crystals did not diffract, those of PGP and PG diffracted to 6 and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively. Moving the tag to the N-terminus and replacing phytochromobilin with phycocyanobilin as the ligand produced PG crystals that diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution. These results demonstrate that the diffraction quality of challenging protein crystals can be improved by removing flexible regions, shifting fusion tags and altering small-molecule ligands.",

It is a 40–70 kDa single-subunit monotopic membrane protein that catalyses the oxidation of NADH and the reduction of quinone molecules via the cofactor FAD. NDH-2 is a promising new target for drug development given its essential role in many bacterial species and intracellular parasites. Only two bacterial NDH-2 structures have been reported and these structures are at moderate resolution (2.3–2.5 Å). In this communication, a new crystallization platform is reported that produced high-quality NDH-2 crystals that diffracted to high resolution (2.15 Å). The high-resolution NDH-2 structure was used for in silico quinone substrate-docking studies to investigate the binding poses of menadione and ubiquinone molecules. These studies revealed that a very limited number of molecular interactions occur at the quinone-binding site of NDH-2. Given that the conformation of the active site is well defined, this high-resolution structure is potentially suitable for in silico inhibitor-compound screening and ligand-docking applications.",

To characterize MLP and to gain insight into the potential role of this protein in the evolution of lactation, the crystal structure of duck-billed platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) MLP was determined at 1.82 Å resolution. This is the first structure to be reported for this novel, mammalian antibacterial protein. MLP was expressed as a FLAG epitope-tagged protein in mammalian cells and crystallized readily, with at least three space groups being observed ( P 1, C 2 and P 2 1 ). A 1.82 Å resolution native data set was collected from a crystal in space group P 1, with unit-cell parameters a = 51.2, b = 59.7, c = 63.1 Å, α = 80.15, β = 82.98, γ = 89.27°. The structure was solved by SAD phasing using a protein crystal derivatized with mercury in space group C 2, with unit-cell parameters a = 92.7, b = 73.2, c = 56.5 Å, β = 90.28°. MLP comprises a monomer of 12 helices and two short β-strands, with much of the N-terminus composed of loop regions. The crystal structure of MLP reveals no three-dimensional similarity to any known structures and reveals a heretofore unseen fold, supporting the idea that monotremes may be a rich source for the identification of novel proteins. It is hypothesized that MLP in monotreme milk has evolved to specifically support the unusual lactation strategy of this lineage and may have played a central role in the evolution of these mammals.",

FAS II pathway enzymes are markedly disparate from their mammalian analogs in the FAS I pathway in both structure and mechanism. Enzymes involved in bacterial fatty-acid synthesis represent viable drug targets for Gram-negative pathogens, and historical precedent exists for targeting them in the treatment of diseases of the oral cavity. The Gram-negative organism Porphyromonas gingivalis represents a key causative agent of the costly and highly prevalent disease known as chronic periodontitis, and exclusively expresses FabK as its enoyl reductase enzyme in the FAS-II pathway. Together, these characteristics distinguish P. gingivalis FabK ( Pg FabK) as an attractive and novel narrow-spectrum antibacterial target candidate. Pg FabK is a flavoenzyme that is dependent on FMN and NADPH as cofactors for the enzymatic reaction, which reduces the enoyl substrate via a ping-pong mechanism. Here, the structure of the Pg FabK enzyme as determined using X-ray crystallography is reported to 1.9 Å resolution with endogenous FMN fully resolved and the NADPH cofactor partially resolved. Pg FabK possesses a TIM-barrel motif, and all flexible loops are visible. The determined structure has allowed insight into the structural basis for the NADPH dependence observed in Pg FabK and the role of a monovalent cation that has been observed in previous studies to be stringently required for FabK activity. The Pg FabK structure and the insights gleaned from its analysis will facilitate structure-based drug-discovery efforts towards the prevention and treatment of P. gingivalis infection.",

In the bacterial cell, (p)ppGpp levels are regulated by the concerted opposing activities of RSH (RelA/SpoT homologue) enzymes that can transfer a pyrophosphate group of ATP to the 3' position of GDP (or GTP) or remove the 3' pyrophosphate moiety from (p)ppGpp. Bifunctional Rel enzymes are notoriously difficult to crystallize owing to poor stability and a propensity for aggregation, usually leading to a loss of biological activity after purification. Here, the production, biochemical analysis and crystallization of the bifunctional catalytic region of the Rel stringent factor from Thermus thermophilus (RelTtNTD) in the resting state and bound to nucleotides are described.

The overall fold of CEACAM7 is similar to those of CEACAM1 and CEACAM5; however, there are differences, the most notable of which is an insertion that causes the C'' strand to buckle, leading to the creation of a hydrogen bond in the dimerization interface. The Kdimerization for CEACAM7 determined by sedimentation equilibrium is tenfold tighter than that measured for CEACAM5.

Unlike red algal PE proteins, the hexamers of Phormidium PE do not form higher-order structures in the crystals.

The enzyme binds GlcNAc-1-P and UTP, and catalyzes a uridyltransfer reaction to synthesize UDP-GlcNAc, an important precursor for cell-wall biosynthesis. As many SNTs are known to utilize a broad range of substrates, substrate specificity in GlmU was probed using biochemical and structural studies. The enzymatic assays reported here demonstrate that GlmU is specific for its natural substrates UTP and GlcNAc-1-P. The crystal structure of GlmU bound to ATP and GlcNAc-1-P provides molecular details for the inability of the enzyme to utilize ATP for the nucleotidyltransfer reaction. ATP binding results in an inactive pre-catalytic enzyme-substrate complex, where it adopts an unusual conformation such that the reaction cannot be catalyzed; here, ATP is shown to be bound together with three Mg2+ ions. Overall, this structure represents the binding of an inhibitory molecule at the active site and can potentially be used to develop new inhibitors of the enzyme. Further, similar to DNA/RNA polymerases, GlmU was recently recognized to utilize two metal ions, MgA2+ and MgB2+, to catalyze the uridyltransfer reaction. Interestingly, displacement of MgB2+ from its usual catalytically competent position, as noted in the crystal structure of RNA polymerase in an inactive state, was considered to be a key factor inhibiting the reaction. Surprisingly, in the current structure of GlmU MgB2+ is similarly displaced; this raises the possibility that an analogous inhibitory mechanism may be operative in GlmU.",

The fold of the protein is similar to those of homologous enzymes from Citrobacter freundii, Entamoeba histolytica, Pseudomonas putida and Trichomonas vaginalis.

    "abstract": "Cellulases are produced by microorganisms that grow on cellulose biomass. Here, a cellulase, Cel10, was identified in a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from Chinese bamboo rat gut. Analysis of substrate specificity showed that Cel10 is able to hydrolyze amorphous carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and crystalline forms of cellulose (Avicel and xylan) but is unable to hydrolyze p -nitrophenol β-D-glucopyranoside ( p -NPG), proving that Cel10 is an endoglucanase. A phylogenetic tree analysis indicates that Cel10 belongs to the glycoside hydrolase 8 (GH8) subfamily. In order to further understanding of its substrate specificity, the structure of Cel10 was solved by molecular replacement and refined to 1.76 Å resolution. The overall fold is distinct from those of most other enzymes belonging to the GH8 subfamily. Although it forms the typical (α/α) 6 -barrel motif fold, like Acetobacterxylinum CMCax, one helix is missing. Structural comparisons with Clostridium thermocellum CelA (CtCelA), the best characterized GH8 endoglucanase, revealed that sugar-recognition subsite −3 is completely missing in Cel10. The absence of this subsite correlates to a more open substrate-binding cleft on the cellooligosaccharide reducing-end side.",

Nonetheless, in most cases the mechanism that leads to drastic changes in specific activity after the introduction of an amino-acid substitution distant from the active-site pocket is unclear. Here, two crystal structures of inactive mutants of the P450 vitamin D 3 hydroxylase (Vdh), Vdh-F106V and Vdh-L348M, which were obtained in the course of protein-engineering experiments on Vdh, are reported. The overall structures of these mutants show an open conformation similar to that of wild-type Vdh (Vdh-WT), whereas a rearrangement of the common main-chain hydrogen bonds is observed in the CD-loop (residues 102–106), resulting in a more compactly folded CD-loop relative to that of Vdh-WT. The previously reported structures of Vdh-WT and of the highly active Vdh-T107A and Vdh-K1 mutants have a more stretched CD-loop, with partial formation of 3 10 -helix-type hydrogen bonds, both in the open and closed states. Molecular-dynamics simulations also showed that the frequency of the 3 10 -helix is significantly reduced in Vdh-F106V and Vdh-L348M. The closed conformation is crucial for substrate and ferredoxin binding to initiate the catalytic reaction of Vdh. Therefore, it is implied that the small local structural changes observed in this study might disrupt the conformational transition from the open to the closed state, thereby leading to a complete loss of vitamin D 3 hydroxylase activity.",

The apicomplexan PRSs are validated targets of febrifugine (FF) and its halogenated derivative halofuginone (HF). PRSs are of great interest for drug development against Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii . In this study, structures of apo and FF-bound T. gondii ( Tg PRS) are revealed and the dynamic nature of the conformational changes that occur upon FF binding is unraveled. In addition, this study highlights significant conformational plasticity within two different crystal structures of apo PRSs but not within drug-bound PRSs. The apo PRSs exist in multi-conformational states and manifest pseudo-dimeric structures. In contrast, when FF is bound the PRS dimer adopts a highly symmetrical architecture. It is shown that Tg PRS does not display extant fold switching, in contrast to P. falciparum PRS, despite having over 65% sequence identity. Finally, structure-comparison analyses suggest the utility of r.m.s.d. per residue (r.m.s.d. /res ) as a robust tool to detect structural alterations even when the r.m.s.d. is low. Apo Tg PRS reveals FF/HF-induced rigidity and this work has implications for drug-design studies that rely on the apo structures of target proteins.",

Since this molecule has the potential to be developed as a CDK2 inhibitor for cancer therapy, the potency of CVT-313 to bind and stabilize CDK2 was evaluated, together with its ability to inhibit aberrant cell proliferation. CVT-313 increased the melting temperature of CDK2 by 7°C in thermal stabilization studies, thus indicating its protein-stabilizing effect. CVT-313 inhibited the growth of human lung carcinoma cell line A549 in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC 50 of 1.2 µ M , which is in line with the reported biochemical potency of 0.5 µ M . To support the further chemical modification of CVT-313 and to improve its biochemical and cellular potency, a crystal structure was elucidated in order to understand the molecular interaction of CVT-313 and CDK2. The crystal structure of CDK2 bound to CVT-313 was determined to a resolution of 1.74 Å and clearly demonstrated that CVT-313 binds in the ATP-binding pocket, interacting with Leu83, Asp86 and Asp145 directly, and the binding was further stabilized by a water-mediated interaction with Asn132. Based on the crystal structure, further modifications of CVT-313 are proposed to provide additional interactions with CDK2 in the active site, which may significantly increase the biochemical and cellular potency of CVT-313.",

This series of bicyclic pyrido[2,3- d ]pyrimidines were designed in which there was a transposition of the 5-methyl group of PTX to the N9 position of the pyrido[2,3- d ]pyrimidine. It was hypothesized that the N9-methyl group would preferentially interact with Ile123 of pcDHFR (and Ile123 of pjDHFR), but not with the shorter Val115 in hDHFR. Structure–activity data for this series of antifolates revealed that a trifluoro derivative ( 26 ) was the most selective against pjDHFR compared with mammalian DHFR (h/pj = 35.7). Structural data for the hDHFR– 26 complex revealed that 26 binds in a different conformation from that observed in the pcDHFR– 26 complex. In the hDHFR– 26 complex the trifluorophenyl ring of 26 occupies a position near the cofactor-binding site, with close intermolecular contacts with Asp21, Ser59 and Ile60, whereas this ring in the pcDHFR– 26 complex is positioned away from the cofactor site and near Ile65, with weaker contacts with Ile65, Phe69 and Ile123. Comparison of the intermolecular contacts between the N9-methyl group with Val115/Ile123 validates the hypothesis that the N9-methyl substituent preferentially interacts with Ile123 compared with Val115 of hDHFR, as the weaker contact with Val115 in the hDHFR structure is consistent with its weaker binding affinity compared with pcDHFR. The results for the structures of hDHFR– 22 and pcDHFR– 24 show that their inhibitor-binding orientation is similar to that observed in pcDHFR– 26 and the pcDHFR variant (F69N) reported previously. The naphthyl moiety of 24 makes several intermolecular contacts with the active-site residues in pcDHFR that help to stabilize the binding, resulting in a more potent inhibitor.",

To expand the understanding of the structural basis for specific lipid recognition by NGF, the crystal structure of mNGF complexed with lysophosphatidylinositol (13:0 LysoPI) was solved. Interestingly, in addition to Lys88, which interacts with the head glycerol group and the phosphate group of LysoPI, as seen in the mNGF–LysoPS structure, two additional residues, Tyr52 and Arg50, were found to assist in lipid binding by forming hydrogen bonds to the inositol moiety of the LysoPI molecule.

    "abstract": "A method is described for using plate lids to reduce evaporation in low-volume vapor-diffusion crystallization experiments. The plate lids contain apertures through which the protein and precipitants were added to different crystallization microplates (the reservoir was filled before fitting the lids). Plate lids were designed for each of these commonly used crystallization microplates. This system minimizes the dehydration of crystallization droplets containing just a few nanolitres of protein and precipitant, and results in more reproducible diffraction from the crystals. For each lid design, changes in the weight of the plates were used to deduce the rate of evaporation under different conditions of temperature, air movement, droplet size and precipitant. For comparison, the state of dehydration was also visually assessed throughout the experiment. Finally, X-ray diffraction methods were used to compare the diffraction of protein crystals that were conventionally prepared against those that were prepared on plates with plate lids. The measurements revealed that the plate lids reduced the rate of evaporation by 63–82%. Crystals grown in 5 nl drops that were set up with plate lids diffracted to higher resolution than similar crystals from drops that were set up without plate lids. The results demonstrate that plate lids can be instrumental for improving few-nanolitre crystallizations.",

In this study, the crystal structure of recombinant MtaL is reported at 1.35 Å resolution. Comparison of its structure with that of the truncated and cleaved MtaL present in the complex with tyrosinase directly isolated from mushroom shows that the general β-trefoil fold is conserved. However, differences are detected in the loop regions, particularly in the β2–β3 loop, which is intact and not cleaved in the recombinant MtaL. Furthermore, the N-terminal tail is rotated inwards, covering the tyrosinase-binding interface. Thus, MtaL must undergo conformational changes in order to bind mature mushroom tyrosinase. Very interestingly, the β-trefoil fold has been identified to be essential for carbohydrate interaction in other lectin-like proteins. Comparison of the structures of MtaL and a ricin-B-like lectin with a bound disaccharide shows that MtaL may have a similar carbohydrate-binding site that might be involved in glycoreceptor activity.",

Among the proteins that are required for the final steps in pyoverdine synthesis is PvdN, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes an uncharacterized step in pyoverdine production. This study reports the high-resolution structure of PvdN bound to a PLP cofactor solved by multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD).

GP is a validated pharmaceutical target for the development of antihyperglycaemic agents, and the reported structures may have a significant impact on structure-based drug-design efforts. Comparisons with previously reported structures at lower resolution reveal the detailed conformation of important structural features in the allosteric transition of GP from the T-state to the R-state. The conformation of the N-terminal segment (residues 7–17), the position of which was not located in previous T-state structures, was revealed to form an α-helix (now termed α0). The conformation of this segment (which contains Ser14, phosphorylation of which leads to the activation of GP) is significantly different between the T-state and the R-state, pointing in opposite directions. In the T-state it is packed between helices α4 and α16 (residues 104–115 and 497–508, respectively), while in the R-state it is packed against helix α1 (residues 22′–38′) and towards the loop connecting helices α4′ and α5′ of the neighbouring subunit. The allosteric binding site where AMP and IMP bind is formed by the ordering of a loop (residues 313–326) which is disordered in the free structure, and adopts a conformation dictated mainly by the type of nucleotide that binds at this site.",

Seleno-modification potentially regulates translation efficiency in response to selenium availability.

Robust and well formed SelU–tRNA crystals were obtained after several optimizations, including co-expression with tRNA and additive screening.

Chronic periodontitis is characterized by inflammation of the periodontal pocket caused by dysbiosis. This dysbiosis is coupled with an increase in the population of Treponema denticola, a spirochete bacterium with high mobility and invasivity mediated by a number of virulence factors. One such virulence factor is TDE0362, a multidomain protein with a carboxy-terminal papain-superfamily cysteine protease (C0362). Most papain-superfamily cysteine proteases are produced as proenzymes with a prodomain that interacts with the prosegment binding loop (PBL), requiring proteolytic processing for full activation. Previous studies have indicated that C0362 is not produced as a proenzyme, suggesting an alternative regulatory mechanism. We previously determined the crystal structure of C0362 captured in an inactive conformation with an oxidized catalytic cysteine and a disordered PBL. In this follow-up study, we evaluated the active-site architecture and the PBL in two mutant (Y559A and C412S) structures and an inhibitor-bound (E64) structure to provide insight into the role that the PBL plays in the generation of active enzyme. Our results implicate Tyr559 as playing a critical role in the transition of the enzyme to an active state. We subsequently utilized the structural information to generate models of C0362 bound to human complement factors C3 and C4. Collectively, our results provide insight into the regulatory mechanism and putative substrate-binding interfaces of C0362, highlighting avenues of further research towards inhibition of this essential virulence factor.",

The polyamine known as spermidine is typically made by spermidine synthase, but in many bacterial species, including 70% of human gut microbes, carboxyspermidine decarboxylase (CASDC) performs the terminal step in the production of spermidine. An X-ray crystal structure of CASDC from the human gut microbe Clostridium leptum has been solved by molecular replacement at a resolution of 1.41 Å. CASDC is a homodimer, with each monomer composed of two domains: a β/α-barrel pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-binding domain that forms most of the active site and a β-barrel domain that extends the dimeric interface and contributes to the active site of the opposing monomer. We performed a structural comparison of CASDC enzymes for 15 common genera within the human gut flora. This analysis reveals structural differences occurring in the β6/β7 loop that acts as a `flap' covering the active site and in the α9/β12 loop that is connected to the α9 helix which is thought to select substrates by their chain length. This structural analysis extends our understanding of a key enzyme in spermidine biosynthesis in many bacterial species.",

Several IgA protease (IgAP) families have evolved this ability using both metalloprotease and serine protease chemical mechanisms. One family of metal-dependent IgAPs is the M26 family. This family can be grouped into two subfamilies based upon the presence or absence of a trypsin-like domain found N-terminal to the IgAP domain. The role of this domain in IgAP structure and function is poorly understood. Here, we present the first structural characterization of an M26 IgAP trypsin-like domain from Gemella haemolysans ( Gh Trp). These structural data demonstrate that the Gh Trp domain possesses a trypsin-like fold but contains significant deviations in the surface-loop structure that is known to be coupled to protease selectivity. The lack of observable catalytic function coupled with the structural data suggest that this domain may exist in a pro-enzyme-like state that can potentially be activated when the domain is N-terminally proteolytically excised from the larger M26 IgAP structure.",

    "abstract": "We report structures of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isoprenyl diphosphate synthase Rv2173 in three forms: apo and two substrate-bound forms [isoprenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)]. The protein possesses a canonical all-α-helical trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase fold that is dimeric in each form. There are some differences between the structures: the IPP-bound form shows IPP bound in the DMAPP/allylic substrate-binding site with three divalent metal ions bound around the IPP and the complete C-terminus closing around the active site, while the apo and DMAPP-bound forms are more open, with some of the C-terminal region disordered, supporting suggestions that the C-terminus is important in substrate entry/product exit. In the DMAPP form DMAPP occupies the expected allylic substrate site, but only two metal ions are associated with the binding, with the DMAPP diphosphates adopting a slightly different binding pose compared with IPP in the same site, and the third metal-binding site is unoccupied. In no case is the IPP binding site occupied by IPP. There has been some uncertainty regarding product length for Rv2173, with variable lengths being reported. In the structures reported here, the `capping' residue at the bottom of the binding cavity is tryptophan and comparison with other IPP synthases suggests that the structure of Rv2173 is most consistent with a C10-C15 final product size.",

    "abstract": "Piperine has been investigated for a diverse array of biological effects, including a potential role in modulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. This study conducted a comprehensive co-crystallographic analysis of the complex of piperine with the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (PPARγ-LBD), with the objective of elucidating the precise binding interactions of piperine. The co-crystal structure revealed that piperine binds within the ligand-binding pocket of PPARγ-LBD via hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with residues of the ligand-binding site. Notably, in contrast to conventional full agonists, piperine does not directly stabilize helix H12. This could contribute to the comparatively weaker agonistic activity of piperine. The results of this study also suggest that piperine binding facilitates a role as a partial agonist or even an antagonist under certain physiological conditions. Collectively, these findings contribute to a greater understanding of the manner in which piperine modulates PPARγ function and its potential as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Given its natural origin and relatively minimal side-effect profile, piperine and its derivatives could be promising alternatives to synthetic PPARγ modulators such as thiazolidinediones, which have significant side effects.",

The protein has a β-trefoil fold, which is typical of the ricin B-like-type lectin family. The structure of the recombinant protein has been elucidated, and its specific sugar-binding affinity towards mannose and mannitol has also been reported; therefore, the protein was named A. bisporus mannose-binding protein (Abmb). Although the sugar-binding site of Abmb is predicted to be close to the C-terminus, the sugar-binding site has not yet been determined. In this study, a variant of recombinant Abmb with a longer C-terminal region including a 6×His-tag was constructed and its structure was solved at 1.51 and 2.34 Å resolution in an orthorhombic and a monoclinic space group, respectively. The overall structure showed a β-trefoil fold as previously reported; however, several surface loop regions including the C-terminal region showed high flexibility. In addition, a glycan-search assay of this variant showed weak binding affinity towards β-D-galactose but no affinity towards α-D-mannose. The plasticity of the C-terminal tail could be related to the differences in the carbohydrate-binding affinity of Abmb.",

YcdY was identified as a NarJ subfamily member but was proposed to increase the catalytic activity of the non-CISM enzyme YcdX phosphatase, presumably by inserting a zinc cofactor into YcdX. To elucidate the structural features of YcdY required for its chaperone function, we determined the crystal structure of Enterobacter cloacae YcdY (enYcdY). enYcdY adopts a single-domain, curved helix-bundle structure decorated with α-helices. enYcdY contains an extensive dent on its concave side. The dent in enYcdY generally forms using hydrophobic or conserved residues. Based on comparative structural and sequence analyses, we propose that enYcdY uses the dent to recognize and fold the client protein. Interestingly, enYcdY did not increase the enzymatic activity of E. cloacae YcdX (enYcdX) in the presence or absence of Zn 2+ ions, even for partially denatured enYCdX protein. The same results were obtained for the Escherichia coli counterparts, in contrast to a previous report. These observations suggest that YcdY functions as a chaperone for proteins other than YcdX.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and environmental isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia produce an enterobactin-like siderophore that promotes bacterial growth under low-iron conditions. Although prior mutational and bioinformatic analyses indicated that most of the enzymes encoded by the S. maltophilia entCEBB'FA locus are suitably reminiscent of their counterparts in Escherichia coli and other bacteria, Stenotrophomonas EntB was unusual. In bacteria producing enterobactin-related molecules, EntB and its homologs are usually multi-domain proteins in which the amino portion acts as an isochorismatase and the carboxy domain serves as an aryl carrier protein (ArCP). However, in S. maltophilia the isochorismatase and ArCP functions are encoded by two distinct genes: entB and entB', respectively. Current mutant analysis was used to first confirm that S. maltophilia entB is needed for siderophore activity and bacterial growth in iron-depleted media. A crystal structure of S. maltophilia EntB was then obtained. The structure aligned with the N-terminal portion of EntB from E. coli and VibB from Vibrio cholerae, affirming the protein to be a single-domain isochorismatase. However, S. maltophilia EntB also aligned with the single-domain PhzD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the antimicrobial compound phenazine. BLASTP searches indicated that entB and its neighboring genes are fully conserved amongst S. maltophilia strains but are variably present in other Stenotrophomonas species. The closest homologs to S. maltophilia EntB outside the genus were hypothetical proteins/putative isochorismatases in some Gram-negative bacteria (for example Pseudomonas spp. and Xanthomonas spp.), Gram-positive bacteria (Streptomyces spp. and Bacillus subtilis) and fungi (for example Rhizopus arrhizus and Knufia peltigerae).",

    "abstract": "Unlike humans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of human tuberculosis, has a de novo histidine-biosynthesis pathway. The enzyme imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase (IGPD), which catalyses the conversion of imidazole glycerol phosphate to imidazole acetol phosphate, has been studied extensively from various organisms and has become a major target for the development of antibacterial, antiweed and antifungal small molecules. In our previous studies, we have shown that in crystals IGPD forms a 24-mer oligomeric state in which the monomers are arranged in 432 symmetry. In order to gain insights into the oligomeric state of Mtb IGPD in solution, we determined cryogenic sample electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of apo IGPD at 2.2 and 3.1 Å resolution. In addition, we also determined the cryo-EM structure of IGPD in the presence of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ) to 2.8 Å resolution. The results of this work, which corroborate those from the crystallographic studies, indicate that IGPD forms a homo-oligomeric structure in solution comprising of 24 subunits. ATZ binds in the active-site pocket of the enzyme, which is located at the interface of three monomers and tethers 24 ATZ molecules. The results of this study suggest that cryo-EM, in addition to being a rapidly evolving and complementary imaging technology for elucidating 3D structures of biological macromolecules, can be useful in pinpointing the mode of binding small molecules of low mass (here ∼85 Da) and mapping protein-ligand interactions, which could assist in the design of accurate (high-potency) inhibitors.",

The ThDP-dependent enzyme 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate (SEPHCHC) synthase (MenD) catalyses the first irreversible step in bacterial classical menaquinone biosynthesis via a series of reactions involving covalent ThDP-bound intermediates. We report structures of MenD from the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes ( Lmo MenD) in its ThDP cofactor-bound and in-crystallo captured intermediate I-bound forms. Analysis of the structures revealed that Lmo MenD adopts the typical three-domain ThDP-dependent fold observed for MenD orthologs, while a combination of structure, size-exclusion chromatography, mass photometry and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis showed that the enzyme has a homotetrameric quaternary structure. While both of the ligand-bound structures reported here were very similar, comparison with an apo form from the PDB revealed a closing down of the active site in the ligand-bound forms, with more complete models suggesting lower levels of disorder around key regions of the active site that interface with ThDP or the captured intermediate.

    "abstract": "Hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 2 (HRP-2) is a member of the HDGF-related protein family, which has been linked to multiple malignancies. A defining feature of this protein family is the presence of an N-terminal PWWP domain, which enables binding to nucleosomes carrying a dimethylation or trimethylation marker on residue Lys36 of histone H3. To support the rational design of small-molecule drugs that bind to the PWWP domain, crystallographic fragment screening was chosen. A critical requirement for such screening is the ability to reliably produce large batches of high-quality crystals, ideally grown under low-salt conditions to prevent the precipitation of drug-like fragments during crystal soaking. Initial crystallization of the wild-type (WT) HRP-2 PWWP domain only produced crystals under high-salt conditions and these significantly lost diffraction quality over two weeks. It was hypothesized that these complications were caused by oxidation of the solvent-exposed Cys64 residue. To overcome these difficulties, a Cys64Ser mutant was produced. This mutation revealed a substantially improved crystallization propensity, as eight crystal forms could be obtained and resolved versus two forms for the WT. Moreover, the mutant crystals could be grown in PEG-based low ionic strength conditions which are optimal for fragment soaking. Finally, the crystals did not lose their diffraction quality for up to six months. Importantly, systematic analysis of all obtained X-ray structures revealed that the Cys64/Ser64 residue lies at a key lattice interface which is conserved across all crystal forms. This suggests that even minor chemical changes at this position could disrupt important intermolecular contacts, explaining the demonstrated major benefit of the introduced mutation. The presented data underpin the substitution of surface-exposed cysteines as a general strategy to enhance protein crystallization and diffraction quality. Ultimately, the results presented here were pivotal to the successful execution of the crystallographic fragment-screening campaign with the HRP-2 PWWP domain.",

Electrostatic analysis reveals two distinct charged patches: a positively charged patch on the FHA domain and a negatively charged patch in the cleft between the FHA and BRCT1 domains.

    "abstract": "Ease of access to data, tools and models expedites scientific research. In structural biology there are now numerous open repositories of experimental and simulated data sets. Being able to easily access and utilize these is crucial to allow researchers to make optimal use of their research effort. The tools presented here are useful for collating existing public cryoEM data sets and/or creating new synthetic cryoEM data sets to aid the development of novel data processing and interpretation algorithms. In recent years, structural biology has seen the development of a multitude of machine-learning-based algorithms to aid numerous steps in the processing and reconstruction of experimental data sets and the use of these approaches has become widespread. Developing such techniques in structural biology requires access to large data sets, which can be cumbersome to curate and unwieldy to make use of. In this paper, we present a suite of Python software packages, which we collectively refer to as PERC ( profet , EMPIARreader and CAKED ). These are designed to reduce the burden which data curation places upon structural biology research. The protein structure fetcher ( profet) package allows users to conveniently download and cleave sequences or structures from the Protein Data Bank or AlphaFold databases. EMPIARreader allows lazy loading of Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive data sets in a machine-learning-compatible structure. The Class Aggregator for Key Electron-microscopy Data ( CAKED ) package is designed to seamlessly facilitate the training of machine-learning models on electron microscopy data, including electron-cryo-microscopy-specific data augmentation and labeling. These packages may be utilized independently or as building blocks in workflows. All are available in open-source repositories and designed to be easily extensible to facilitate more advanced workflows if required.",

DegQ promotes the phosphorylation of DegU by DegS, switching the function of DegU from competence to the induction of poly-γ-glutamate production. To elucidate its structural role, we determined the crystal structures of wild-type DegQ and its mutant DegQS25L. Each DegQ monomer folds into a single α-helix, and four monomers assemble into a tetramer characterized by a four-helix coiled-coil structure. Within the tetramer, two adjacent helices are oriented in the same direction, while the other two are oriented oppositely, forming a pseudo-twofold symmetric arrangement. The mutant form displays disrupted symmetry due to altered helix packing, which is caused by shifts in the coiled-coil heptad register induced by the mutation. Structural predictions using AlphaFold 3 suggest that DegQ likely binds to the N-terminal helix bundle of DegS, either as a dimer or as individual monomers. These findings provide structural insight into DegQ oligomerization and its potential role in modulating DegS autophosphorylation and DegU binding.",

    "abstract": "Several cyanobacterial species, including Crocosphaera subtropica ATCC 51142, accumulate cyanobacterial starch instead of glycogen, although nearly all cyanobacteria accumulate glycogen. The glycogen-producing Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 possesses one α-glucan phosphorylase (Pho) isozyme, whereas strain 51142 has three Pho isozymes. Based on their primary structures, these enzymes belong to glycosyl transferase (GT) family 35, with the cyanobacterial GT35-type Phos further subdivided into types I-III. In this study, to elucidate the significance of the coexistence of multiple GT35-type Pho isozymes, those from strain 51142 (type I, cce_1629; type II, cce_1603 and cce_5186) and strain 7942 (type I, Synpcc7942_0244) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and biochemically characterized. All isozymes catalysed the phosphorolysis and reverse phosphorolysis reactions. The type I isozyme from a cyanobacterial starch-producing strain (cce_1629) differed in substrate specificity and specific activity compared with the others. The behaviour towards the effectors (AMP and ATP) of the type I and type II isozymes differed from each other. These findings enhance our understanding of the roles of cyanobacterial Pho isozymes in α-glucan metabolism. Furthermore, recombinant cce_1603 was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Crystals were obtained at 293 K in the presence of 10 mM maltoheptaose, 45%(w/v) PEG 400, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 M lithium sulfate. The crystals belonged to space group R32 (hexagonal setting) with unit-cell parameters a = b = 267.23, c = 204.43 Å, and diffracted to beyond 2.70 Å resolution. Matthews coefficient calculations indicated the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Structural determination is currently under way. The crystal structure of cce_1603 will aid in the understanding of the structural basis of cyanobacterial GT35-type Pho isozymes.",

The device offers a more systematic and labor-saving workflow than current practice both for performing diffraction analysis of macromolecular crystals and for investigating the response of macromolecular crystals to changes in solution composition.",

The crystal structure revealed that the inhibitor binds to the autoinhibited state of Mnk1, stabilizing the Mnk-specific DFD motif in the DFD-out conformation, thus preventing Mnk1 from switching to the active conformation and thereby inhibiting the kinase activity.

    "abstract": "Sialic acids are nine-carbon sugars that are found abundantly on the cell surfaces of mammals as glycoprotein or glycolipid complexes. Several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have the ability to scavenge and catabolize sialic acids to use as a carbon source. This gives them an advantage in colonizing sialic acid-rich environments. The genes of the sialic acid catabolic pathway are generally present as the operon nanAKE . The third gene in the operon encodes the enzyme N -acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase (NanE), which catalyzes the conversion of N -acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate to N -acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate, thus committing it to enter glycolysis. The NanE enzyme belongs to the isomerase class of enzymes possessing the triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel fold. Here, comparative structural and functional characterizations of the NanE epimerases from two pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Vibrio cholerae (Vc), have been carried out. Structures of NanE from Vc (VcNanE) with and without ligand bound have been determined to 1.7 and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively. The structure of NanE from Fn (FnNanE) has been determined to 2.2 Å resolution. The enzymes show kinetic parameters that are consistent with those of Clostridium perfringens NanE. These studies allowed an evaluation of whether NanE may be a good drug target against these pathogenic bacteria.",

Current treatment requires the long-term administration of multiple medicines with substantial side effects. Lack of compliance, together with other factors, has resulted in a worrisome increase in resistance. New treatment options are therefore urgently needed. Here, the crystal structure of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS), an enzyme critical for protein biosynthesis and therefore a drug target, in complex with its catalytic intermediate methionyl adenylate is reported. Phenylalanine 292 of the M. tuberculosis enzyme is in an `out' conformation and barely contacts the adenine ring, in contrast to other MetRS structures where ring stacking occurs between the adenine and a protein side-chain ring in the `in' conformation. A comparison with human cytosolic MetRS reveals substantial differences in the active site as well as regarding the position of the connective peptide subdomain 1 (CP1) near the active site, which bodes well for arriving at selective inhibitors. Comparison with the human mitochondrial enzyme at the amino-acid sequence level suggests that arriving at inhibitors with higher affinity for the mycobacterial enzyme than for the mitochondrial enzyme might be achievable.",

In the monoclinic and orthorhombic asymmetric units one molecule contained iron and an NADP molecule, while the other did not. The tetragonal crystals lacked both iron and NADP. The structure is very similar to that of the FeADH from T. maritima (average r.m.s. difference for C α atoms of 1.8 Å for 341 aligned atoms). The iron, which is internally sequestered, is bound entirely by amino acids from one domain: three histidines and one aspartic acid.

Tim50 and Tim23 then transfer preproteins with N-terminal targeting presequences through the intermembrane space (IMS) across the inner membrane. The crystal structure of the IMS domain of Tim50 [Tim50(164–361)] has previously been determined to 1.83 Å resolution. Here, the crystal structure of Tim50(164–361) at 2.67 Å resolution that was crystallized using a different condition is reported. Compared with the previously determined Tim50(164–361) structure, significant conformational changes occur within the protruding β-hairpin of Tim50 and the nearby helix A2. These findings indicate that the IMS domain of Tim50 exhibits significant structural plasticity within the putative presequence-binding groove, which may play important roles in the function of Tim50 as a receptor protein in the TIM complex that interacts with the presequence and multiple other proteins. More interestingly, the crystal packing indicates that helix A1 from the neighboring monomer docks into the putative presequence-binding groove of Tim50(164–361), which may mimic the scenario of Tim50 and the presequence complex. Tim50 may recognize and bind the presequence helix by utilizing the inner side of the protruding β-hairpin through hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, the protruding β-hairpin of Tim50 may play critical roles in receiving the presequence and recruiting Tim23 for subsequent protein translocations.",

This greatly increases the number of soluble protein structures generated every year by typical structural biology laboratories. Inspired by this success, rMMS has been adapted to the crystallization of membrane proteins, making LCP seed stock by scaling up LCP crystallization conditions without changing the physical and chemical parameters that are critical for crystallization. Seed crystals are grown directly in LCP and, as with conventional rMMS, a seeding experiment is combined with an additive experiment. The new method was used with the bacterial integral membrane protein OmpF, and it was found that it increased the number of crystallization hits by almost an order of magnitude: without microseeding one new hit was found, whereas with LCP-rMMS eight new hits were found. It is anticipated that this new method will lead to better diffracting crystals of membrane proteins. A method of generating seed gradients, which allows the LCP seed stock to be diluted and the number of crystals in each LCP bolus to be reduced, if required for optimization, is also demonstrated.",

This enzyme from mesophiles and thermophiles has been extensively studied; however, there is no report on this enzyme from a psychrophile. In this study, the gene encoding FucA from Glaciozyma antarctica PI12 (GaFucA) was cloned and the enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli , purified and crystallized. The tetrameric structure of GaFucA was determined to 1.34 Å resolution. The overall architecture of GaFucA and its catalytically essential histidine triad are highly conserved among other fuculose aldolases. Comparisons of structural features between GaFucA and its mesophilic and thermophilic homologues revealed that the enzyme has typical psychrophilic attributes, indicated by the presence of a high number of nonpolar residues at the surface and a lower number of arginine residues.",

    "abstract": "μNS is a 70 kDa major nonstructural protein of avian reoviruses, which cause significant economic losses in the poultry industry. They replicate inside viral factories in host cells, and the μNS protein has been suggested to be the minimal viral factor required for factory formation. Thus, determining the structure of μNS is of great importance for understanding its role in viral infection. In the study presented here, a fragment consisting of residues 448–605 of μNS was expressed as an EGFP fusion protein in Sf9 insect cells. EGFP-μNS (448–605) crystallization in Sf9 cells was monitored and verified by several imaging techniques. Cells infected with the EGFP-μNS (448–605) baculovirus formed rod-shaped microcrystals (5–15 µm in length) which were reconstituted in high-viscosity media (LCP and agarose) and investigated by serial femtosecond X-ray diffraction using viscous jets at an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). The crystals diffracted to 4.5 Å resolution. A total of 4227 diffraction snapshots were successfully indexed into a hexagonal lattice with unit-cell parameters a = 109.29, b = 110.29, c = 324.97 Å. The final data set was merged and refined to 7.0 Å resolution. Preliminary electron-density maps were obtained. While more diffraction data are required to solve the structure of μNS (448–605) , the current experimental strategy, which couples high-viscosity crystal delivery at an XFEL with in cellulo crystallization, paves the way towards structure determination of the μNS protein.",

Among these exported components is a single heat-shock 70 kDa class protein, PfHsp70-x, that supports the virulence and growth rate of the parasite during febrile episodes. The ATP-binding domain of PfHsp70-x has previously been resolved and showed the presence of potentially druggable epitopes that differ from those on human Hsp70 chaperones. Here, the crystallographic structure of the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of PfHsp70-x is presented in complex with a hydrophobic peptide. The PfHsp70-x SBD is shown to be highly similar to the counterpart from a human erythrocytic Hsp70 chaperone. The binding of substrate at the interface between β-sandwich and α-helical subdomains of this chaperone segment is also conserved between the malaria parasite and humans. It is hypothesized that the parasite may partly exploit human chaperones for intra-erythrocytic trafficking and maintenance of its exported proteome.",

    "abstract": "Benzophenone synthase (BPS) catalyzes the production of 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone via the condensation of benzoyl-CoA and three units of malonyl-CoA. The biosynthetic pathway proceeds with the formation of the prenylated xanthone α-mangostin from 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone. Structural elucidation was performed to gain a better understanding of the structural basis of the function of Garcinia mangostana L. (mangosteen) BPS (GmBPS). The structure reveals the common core consisting of a five-layer αβαβα fold as found in other type III polyketide synthase enzymes. The three residues Met264, Tyr266 and Gly339 are proposed to have a significant impact on the substrate-binding specificity of the active site. Crystallographic and docking studies indicate why benzoyl-CoA is preferred over 4-coumaroyl-CoA as the substrate for GmBPS. Met264 and Tyr266 in GmBPS are properly oriented for accommodation of the 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone product but not of naringenin. Gly339 offers a minimal steric hindrance to accommodate the extended substrate. Moreover, the structural arrangement of Thr133 provides the elongation activity and consequently facilitates extension of the polyketide chain. In addition to its impact on the substrate selectivity, Ala257 expands the horizontal cavity and might serve to facilitate the initiation/cyclization reaction. The detailed structure of GmBPS explains its catalytic function, facilitating further structure-based engineering to alter its substrate specificity and obtain the desired products.",

In humans, the activating natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp30 plays a major role in NK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis. NKp30 recognizes the cell-surface protein B7-H6, which is expressed on tumor, but not healthy, cells. A mouse monoclonal antibody (17B1.3) against human B7-H6 has been developed ( K d = 0.2 µ M ) to investigate NKp30-mediated NK cell activation and to target tumors expressing B7-H6. Surprisingly, 17B1.3 blocks NK cell activation without interfering with the binding of B7-H6 to NKp30. Understanding the inhibitory mechanism of this antibody will require knowing the structure of 17B1.3 bound to B7-H6. The antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of 17B1.3 was expressed by in vitro folding from bacterial inclusion bodies. The extracellular domain of B7-H6 was produced by secretion from baculovirus-infected insect cells.

Four genes coding for thiolases or thiolase-like proteins are found in the Escherichia coli genome. In this communication, the successful cloning, purification, crystallization and structure determination at 1.8 Å resolution of a homotetrameric E. coli thiolase are reported. The structure of E. coli thiolase co-crystallized with acetyl-CoA at 1.9 Å resolution is also reported. As observed in other tetrameric thiolases, the present E. coli thiolase is a dimer of two tight dimers and probably functions as a biodegradative enzyme. Comparison of the structure and biochemical properties of the E. coli enzyme with those of other well studied thiolases reveals certain novel features of this enzyme, such as the modification of a lysine in the dimeric interface, the possible oxidation of the catalytic Cys88 in the structure of the enzyme obtained in the presence of CoA and active-site hydration. The tetrameric enzyme also displays an interesting departure from exact 222 symmetry, which is probably related to the deformation of the tetramerization domain that stabilizes the oligomeric structure of the protein. The current study allows the identification of substrate-binding amino-acid residues and water networks at the active site and provides the structural framework required for understanding the biochemical properties as well as the physiological function of this E. coli thiolase.",

Protective immune responses to several bacterial diseases are obtained by coupling CRM 197 to glycans from these pathogens. Wild-type DT has been described in two oligomeric forms: a monomer and a domain-swapped dimer. Their proportions depend on the chemical conditions and especially the pH, with a large kinetic barrier to interconversion. A similar situation occurs in CRM 197 , where the monomer is preferred for vaccine synthesis. Despite 30 years of research and the increasing application of CRM 197 in conjugate vaccines, until now all of its available crystal structures have been dimeric. Here, CRM 197 was expressed as a soluble, intracellular protein in an Escherichia coli strain engineered to have an oxidative cytoplasm. The purified product, called EcoCRM, remained monomeric throughout crystallization. The structure of monomeric EcoCRM is reported at 2.0 Å resolution with the domain-swapping hinge loop (residues 379–387) in an extended, exposed conformation, similar to monomeric wild-type DT. The structure enables comparisons across expression systems and across oligomeric states, with implications for monomer–dimer interconversion and for the optimization of conjugation.",

Since nucleic acid duplexes have chemical, structural and crystallographic characteristics that differ from those of globular proteins, such as intermolecular repulsion due to negative charge and molecular and crystallographic anisotropies, it is interesting to investigate whether microgravity crystallization improves the crystal growth of nucleic acids. However, to our knowledge there has been only one report on nucleic acid crystallization in a microgravity environment, and there have been no reports of successful structural analysis. Here, we conducted the crystallization of a DNA/RNA heteroduplex in space.

High-throughput crystallography has been of extensive use in recent years, especially to obtain crystallographic complexes of synthetic ligands and fragments. However, the process of discovering novel bioactive natural products has experienced limitations that have long prevented large drug-discovery programs using this outstanding source of molecules. Recent technologies have contributed to the re-emergence of natural products in modern drug discovery. We present the use of high-throughput protein crystallography to directly capture bioactive natural products from unpurified biota chemical samples using protein crystals. These routines, which are currently in use at the Brazilian Centre for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM), are introduced with a description of crystal preparation, automated data collection and processing at the MANACÁ beamline (Sirius, LNLS, CNPEM), along with case examples of bioactive natural product capture using protein crystals. The usefulness of this pipeline, which accelerates the discovery and structural elucidation of both known and previously unknown bioactive natural products, paves the way for the development of innovative therapeutic agents, thus contributing to the new era of natural product-based drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Collagen lysyl hydroxylases catalyze the hydroxylation of collagen lysine residues during collagen synthesis in animals and mimiviruses. Lysyl hydroxylation is crucial for collagen fibrogenesis and function. We previously demonstrated that recombinant mimiviral and human collagen lysyl hydroxylases, isolated from bacterial and mammalian cells, have Fe 2+ in their active sites, suggesting that lysyl hydroxylases have a high affinity for Fe 2+ . We found that Fe 2+ binding stabilizes lysyl hydroxylase dimers, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Crystal structure analysis of mimiviral lysyl hydroxylase revealed that Fe 2+ is coordinated by a 2His–1Asp (His825/His877/Asp827) triad, with a nearby highly conserved histidine residue (His869) involved in an alternative 2His–1Asp triad (His869/His877/Asp827). This unique structural architecture suggests that the alternative 2His–1Asp triad may also bind Fe 2+ . To investigate whether the alternative 2His–1Asp triad binds Fe 2+ and how Fe 2+ binding regulates lysyl hydroxylase dimerization, we crystallized the mimiviral lysyl hydroxylase mutant His825Ala, which lacks one 2His–1Asp (His825/His877/Asp827) triad but retains the alternative triad (His869/His877/Asp827). Despite providing Fe 2+ during crystallization, we found no electron density near the alternative 2His–1Asp triad in the His825Ala mutant, indicating that the alternative 2His–1Asp triad does not bind Fe 2+ with high affinity. Although the His825Ala mutant forms a dimer similar to the wild-type enzyme, conformational changes occur in residues near Ala825, including Leu873, which is critical for dimerization. These structural findings provide new insights into the function and regulation of collagen lysyl hydroxylases.",

Vorinostat (SAHA), a hydroxamate-based HDACi, has been shown to lack isoform selectivity, potentially leading to unintended interactions with other metalloenzymes. Here, we report high-resolution crystal structures of SAHA bound to human carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) and a carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) active-site mimic. Structures determined at room temperature and 100 K revealed two distinct SAHA conformers in both CA II and the CA IX mimic, with the hydroxamate moiety displacing the zinc-bound water and adopting either a tetrahedral or pentahedral coordination to Zn2+. Differences in hydrophobic interactions were observed between CA II and the CA IX mimic due to the F131V amino-acid difference between the two enzymes. SwissDock modeling accurately predicted the SAHA binding orientations observed in crystallography. Thermal shift assays using nanoDSF showed minimal stabilization of either CA by SAHA, in contrast to the potent CA inhibitor acetazolamide. Binding-energy calculations suggest that SAHA may bind carbonic anhydrases with affinities comparable to its HDAC targets. These findings highlight potential off-target binding of SAHA to carbonic anhydrases, which may contribute to its clinical side effects. The results also suggest that hydroxamates may serve as a nonsulfonamide scaffold for novel CA inhibitors, although isoform selectivity remains a challenge.",

Given its central role in metabolic pathways, KHK has emerged as a target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and obesity. KHK exists as two isoforms, A and C, which arise from alternative splicing of exon 3, resulting in a differing 45-amino-acid sequence within the 298-amino-acid primary structure of the enzyme. KHK is a biological homodimer, with each subunit adopting an α/β-fold architecture that interlocks with a β-clasp domain. In the case of KHK-C at least two distinct conformations of the β-clasp domain have been identified, whereas this conformational flexibility had not been observed in KHK-A. Here, X-ray crystallographic structural investigations of unliganded murine KHK-A refined to 1.37 Å resolution revealed the adoption of two conformations similar to those adopted by the human ortholog, suggesting that this structural feature is conserved across species. The functional significance of these conformational changes in KHK-A is of particular interest as this isoform has been implicated in cancer metastasis through a `moonlighting' protein kinase activity. Understanding the mechanistic role of conformational shifts in KHK-A may provide insights into its broader physiological functions and therapeutic potential.",

Due to its abundance in marine ecosystems, many marine bacteria have evolved diverse and specialized enzymatic systems to degrade fucoidan, although the functions and structures of many of these enzymes remain uncharacterized. Here, we describe the structure of a newly identified fucosidase, FucWf4, which cleaves terminal, unsulfated fucose residues from linear, sulfated fucoidan. FucWf4 does not belong to any known glycoside hydrolase (GH) family, but shows the greatest similarity to GH29 fucosidases. We present the first crystal structure of FucWf4 in complex with fucose, revealing a unique C-terminal domain that resembles a carbohydrate-binding module, although it may have lost its carbohydrate-binding capacity and is absent from canonical GH29 enzymes. Docking experiments suggest the presence of a −1 subsite containing a potential sulfate-binding pocket, which may underlie the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Furthermore, sequence analysis of FucWf4 homologs reveals two distinct clades, likely corresponding to functionally divergent groups. Together, these findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of fucoidan recognition and degradation by this novel enzyme subfamily, laying the groundwork for future functional and structural studies.",

The amino-terminal phenylalanine residue in samarosporin I is exchanged to a valine residue in bergofungin A. According to agar diffusion tests, this results in a nearly inactive antibiotic peptide compared with the moderately active samarosporin I. Crystals were obtained from methanol solutions of purified bergofungin mixed with water. Although there are differences in the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding scheme of samarosporin I, the overall folding is very similar for both peptaibols, namely 3 10 -helical at the termini and α-helical in the middle of the molecules. Bergofungin A and samarosporin I molecules are arranged in a similar way in both lattices. However, the packing of bergofungin A exhibits a second solvent channel along the twofold axis.

Current practice is to collect large volumes of data, hoping to reach high-resolution maps through sheer numbers. However, adding more particles from a specific data set eventually leads to diminishing improvements in resolution. Understanding what these resolution limits are and how to deal with them are important in optimization and automation of SPA. This study revisits the theory of 3D reconstruction and demonstrates how the associated statistics can provide a diagnostic tool to improve SPA. Small numbers of images already give sufficient information on micrograph quality and the amount of data required to reach high resolution. Such feedback allows the microscopist to improve sample-preparation and imaging parameters before committing to extensive data collection. Once a larger data set is available, a B factor can be determined describing the suppression of the signal owing to one or more causes, such as specimen movement, radiation damage, alignment inaccuracy and structural variation. Insight into the causes of signal suppression can then guide the user to consider appropriate actions to obtain better reconstructions.",

The interest in the biochemical characterization and structural analysis of these proteins originates mainly from the wide range of their potential biotechnological applications. Studying the different hemicellulolytic utilization systems in G. stearothermophilus T1, a new galactan-utilization gene cluster was recently identified, which encodes a number of proteins, one of which is a GH1 putative 6-phospho-β-galactosidase (Gan1D).

The asymmetric unit consisted of only one subunit of the catalase-peroxidase molecule, including a protoporphyrin IX haem moiety and two sodium ions. A typical KatG covalent adduct was formed, Met248–Tyr222–Trp94, which is a key structural element for catalase activity. The crystallographic equivalent subunit was created by a twofold symmetry operation to form the functional dimer. The overall structure of the dimer was quite similar to other KatGs. One sodium ion was located close to the proximal Trp314. The location and configuration of the proximal cation site were very similar to those of typical peroxidases such as ascorbate peroxidase. These features may provide a structural basis for the behaviour of the radical localization/delocalization during the course of the enzymatic reaction.",

Xanthomonas spp. possess two different isoforms of XPD (48 and 43 kDa) which share ∼24% sequence identity. The XPD of 43 kDa in size (XPD43) from Xanthomonas spp. is unusual as it lacks the strictly conserved tyrosine residue (equivalent to Tyr387 in Escherichia coli aminopeptidase P) that is suggested to be important in the proton-shuttle transfer required for catalysis in the M24B (MEROPS) family. Here, the crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of XPD43 from X. campestris (GenBank accession No. NP_637763) are reported. Recombinant XPD43 was crystallized using the microbatch-under-oil technique.

In the crystal, the monomer of APDkam589 and its symmetry-related monomers are densely packed to form a 12-subunit complex. Single-particle electron-microscopy analysis confirms that APDkam589 is present as a compact dodecamer in solution. The APDkam589 molecule is built similarly to the molecules of the PhTET peptidases, which have the highest sequence identity to APDkam589 among known structures and were isolated from the more thermostable archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii . A comparison of the interactions of the subunits in APDkam589 with those in PhTET1, PhTET2 and PhTET3 reveals that APDkam589 has a much lower total number of salt bridges, which correlates with the lower thermostability of APDkam589. The monomer of APDkam589 has six Trp residues, five of which are on the external surface of the dodecamer. A superposition of the structure of APDkam589 with those having a high sequence similarity to APDkam589 reveals that, although the positions of Trp45, Trp252 and Trp358 are not conserved in the sequences, the spatial locations of the Trp residues in these models are similar.",

Crystals were grown in a form belonging to the same space group, P 4 1 2 1 2, as the uncomplexed enzyme. X-ray data were collected to a resolution of 1.25 Å. The molecule was refined and the positions of non-H atoms of the inhibitor and water molecules were defined using difference Fourier maps. The enzyme–inhibitor complex and 329 water molecules were further refined to a crystallographic R factor of 0.159. The differences in conformation between the complexed and uncomplexed forms of carboxypeptidase B are shown. The inhibitor is bound in a curved conformation in the active-site cleft, and the sulfamide group is bound to the Zn ion in an asymmetric bidentate fashion. The complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the N1/N2 guanidine group of the inhibitor and the Asp255 carboxyl of the enzyme. The side-chain CH 2 groups of the inhibitor are in van der Waals contact with Leu203 and Ile247 in the enzyme. This study provides useful clues concerning how the transition state of arginine may bind to carboxypeptidase B and therefore provides an insight into the structural basis of carboxypeptidase B selectivity, which is useful for the rational design of a carboxypeptidase with improved selectivity for industrial recombinant pro-insulin processing.",

The starch-binding domain (SBD) of glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger is a small globular protein containing a disulfide bond. The structure of A. niger SBD has been determined by NMR, but the conformation surrounding the disulfide bond was unclear. Therefore, X-ray crystal structural analysis was used to attempt to clarify the conformation of this region. The SBD was purified from an Escherichia coli-based expression system and crystallized at 293 K. The initial phase was determined by the molecular-replacement method, and the asymmetric unit of the crystal contained four protomers, two of which were related by a noncrystallographic twofold axis. Finally, the structure was solved at 2.0 Å resolution. The SBD consisted of seven β-strands and eight loops, and the conformation surrounding the disulfide bond was determined from a clear electron-density map. Comparison of X-ray- and NMR-determined structures of the free SBD showed no significant difference in the conformation of each β-strand, but the conformations of the loops containing the disulfide bond and the L5 loop were different. In particular, the difference in the position of the Cα atom of Cys509 between the X-ray- and NMR-determined structures was 13.3 Å. In addition, the B factors of the amino-acid residues surrounding the disulfide bond are higher than those of other residues. Therefore, the conformation surrounding the disulfide bond is suggested to be highly flexible.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces glycogen (also known as α-glucan) to help evade human immunity. This pathogen uses the GlgE pathway to generate glycogen rather than the more well known glycogen synthase GlgA pathway, which is absent in this bacterium. Thus, the building block for this glucose polymer is α-maltose-1-phosphate rather than an NDP-glucose donor. One of the routes to α-maltose-1-phosphate is now known to involve the GlgA homologue GlgM, which uses ADP-glucose as a donor and α-glucose-1-phosphate as an acceptor. To help compare GlgA (a GT5 family member) with GlgM enzymes (GT4 family members), the X-ray crystal structure of GlgM from Mycobacterium smegmatis was solved to 1.9 Å resolution. While the enzymes shared a GT-B fold and several residues responsible for binding the donor substrate, they differed in some secondary-structural details, particularly in the N-terminal domain, which would be expected to be largely responsible for their different acceptor-substrate specificities.",

Tc Xyn30C has a modular structure consisting of a catalytic domain and a C-terminal cellulose-binding module 1 (CBM1). In this study, the crystal structure of a Tc Xyn30C mutant which lacks the CBM1 domain was determined at 1.65 Å resolution. The structure of the active site of Tc Xyn30C was compared with that of the bifunctional GH30-7 xylanase B from T. cellulolyticus ( Tc Xyn30B), which exhibits glucuronoxylanase and xylobiohydrolase activities. The results revealed that Tc Xyn30C has a conserved structural feature for recognizing the 4- O -methyl-α-D-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) substituent in subsite −2b. Additionally, the results demonstrated that Phe47 contributes significantly to catalysis by Tc Xyn30C. Phe47 is located in subsite −2b and also near the C-3 hydroxyl group of a xylose residue in subsite −2a. Substitution of Phe47 with an arginine residue caused a remarkable decrease in the catalytic efficiency towards arabinoxylan, suggesting the importance of Phe47 in arabinoxylan hydrolysis. These findings indicate that subsite −2b of Tc Xyn30C has unique structural features that interact with arabinofuranose and MeGlcA substituents.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between a protein and a peptide motif of its protein partner are prevalent in nature. Often, a protein also has multiple interaction partners. X-ray protein crystallography is commonly used to examine these interactions in terms of bond distances and angles as well as to describe hotspots within protein complexes. However, the crystallization process presents a significant bottleneck in structure determination since it often requires notably time-consuming screening procedures, which involve testing a broad range of crystallization conditions via a trial-and-error approach. This difficulty is also increased as each protein-peptide complex does not necessarily crystallize under the same conditions. Here, a new co-crystallization/peptide-soaking method is presented which circumvents the need to return to the initial lengthy crystal screening and optimization processes for each consequent new complex. The 14-3-3σ protein, which has multiple interacting partners with specific peptidic motifs, was used as a case study. It was found that co-crystals of 14-3-3σ and a low-affinity peptide from one of its partners, c-Jun, could easily be soaked with another interacting peptide to quickly and easily generate new structures at high resolution. Not only does this significantly reduce the production time, but new 14-3-3-peptide structures that were previously not accessible with the 14-3-3σ isoform, despite screening hundreds of other different conditions, were now also able to be resolved. The findings achieved in this study may be considered as a supporting and practical guide to potentially enable the acceleration of the crystallization process of any protein-peptide system.",

Here, the crystallization and the first structure of human IMPase covalently complexed with ebselen, a 1.47 Å resolution crystal structure (PDB entry 6zk0), are presented. In the complex with human IMPase, ebselen in a ring-opened conformation is covalently attached to Cys141, a residue located away from the active site. IMPase is a dimeric enzyme and in the crystal structure two adjacent dimers share four ebselen molecules, creating a tetramer with approximate 222 symmetry.

Cryotrapping ligands for neutron protein crystallography combines two powerful tools that offer the advantage of directly identifying hydrogen positions in redox-enzyme intermediates without radiolytic perturbation of metal-containing active sites. However, translating cryogenic techniques from X-ray to neutron crystallography is not straightforward due to the large crystal volumes and long data-collection times. Here, methods have been developed to visualize the evasive peroxo complex of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) so that all atoms, including H atoms, could be visualized. The subsequent cryocooling and ligand-trapping methods resulted in neutron data collection to 2.30 Å resolution. The P 6 1 22 crystal form of MnSOD is challenging because it has some of the largest unit-cell dimensions ( a = b = 77.8, c = 236.8 Å) ever studied using high-resolution cryo-neutron crystallography. The resulting neutron diffraction data permitted the visualization of a dioxygen species bound to the MnSOD active-site metal that was indicative of successful cryotrapping.",

Modeling of a complex of BbKI with plasma kallikrein indicates that changes in the local structure of the reactive loop that includes the specificity-determining Arg64 are necessary in order to explain the tight binding.

CDI systems encode large surface-exposed CdiA effector proteins that carry a variety of C-terminal toxin domains (CdiA-CTs). All CDI(+) bacteria also produce CdiI immunity proteins that specifically bind to the cognate CdiA-CT and neutralize its toxin activity to prevent auto-inhibition. Here, the X-ray crystal structure of a CdiI immunity protein from Neisseria meningitidis MC58 is presented at 1.45 Å resolution. The CdiI protein has structural homology to the Whirly family of RNA-binding proteins, but appears to lack the characteristic nucleic acid-binding motif of this family. Sequence homology suggests that the cognate CdiA-CT is related to the eukaryotic EndoU family of RNA-processing enzymes. A homology model is presented of the CdiA-CT based on the structure of the XendoU nuclease from Xenopus laevis. Molecular-docking simulations predict that the CdiA-CT toxin active site is occluded upon binding to the CdiI immunity protein. Together, these observations suggest that the immunity protein neutralizes toxin activity by preventing access to RNA substrates.",

The overall structures of Mtb Eis and Msm Eis are highly similar to each other, reflecting the high level (58%) of amino-acid sequence identity between them.

The enzyme has been well established as the molecular target of the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs), which are best known for their antiresorptive effects in bone but are also known for their anticancer properties. Crystal structures of hFPPS in ternary complexes with a novel bisphosphonate, YS0470, and the secondary ligands inorganic phosphate (Pi), inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) have recently been reported. Only the co-binding of the bisphosphonate with either PPi or IPP resulted in the full closure of the C-­terminal tail of the enzyme, a conformational change that is required for catalysis and that is also responsible for the potent in vivo efficacy of N-BPs. In the present communication, a co-crystal structure of hFPPS in complex with YS0470 and two molecules of Pi is reported. The unusually close proximity between these ligands, which was confirmed by anomalous diffraction data, suggests that they interact with one another, with their anionic charges neutralized in their bound state. The structure also showed the tail of the enzyme to be fully disordered, indicating that simultaneous binding of two Pi molecules with a bisphosphonate cannot induce the tail-closing conformational change in hFPPS. Examination of homologous FPPSs suggested that this ligand-dependent tail closure is only conserved in the mammalian proteins. The prevalence of Pi-bound hFPPS structures in the PDB raises a question regarding the in vivo relevance of Pi binding to the function of the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Xylans are polymeric sugars constituting a significant part of the plant cell wall. They are usually substituted with acetyl side groups attached at positions 2 or 3 of the xylose backbone units. Acetylxylan esterases are part of the hemicellulolytic system of many microorganisms which utilize plant biomass for growth. These enzymes hydrolyze the ester linkages of the xylan acetyl groups and thus improve the accessibility of main-chain-hydrolyzing enzymes and their ability to break down the sugar backbone units. The acetylxylan esterases are therefore critically important for those microorganisms and as such could be used for a wide range of biotechnological applications. The structure of an acetylxylan esterase (Axe2) isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus stearothermophilus T6 has been determined, and it has been demonstrated that the wild-type enzyme is present as a unique torus-shaped octamer in the crystal and in solution. In order to understand the functional origin of this unique oligomeric structure, a series of rational noncatalytic, site-specific mutations have been made on Axe2. Some of these mutations led to a different dimeric form of the protein, which showed a significant reduction in catalytic activity. One of these double mutants, Axe2-Y184F-W190P, has recently been overexpressed, purified and crystallized.

Various Rab GTPases, which are the key regulators of vesicular trafficking pathways, play a vital role in the survival and virulence of the enteric parasite Entamoeba histolytica. The Rab GTPases act as binary molecular switches that utilize the conformational changes associated with the GTP/GDP cycle to elicit responses from target proteins and thereby regulate a broad spectrum of cellular processes including cell proliferation, cytoskeletal assembly, nuclear transport and intracellular membrane trafficking in eukaryotes. Entamoeba histolytica RabX3 (EhRabX3) is a unique GTPase in the amoebic genome, the only member in the eukaryotic Ras superfamily that harbours tandem G-domains and shares only 8-16% sequence identity with other GTPases. Recent studies suggested that EhRabX3 binds to a single guanine nucleotide through its N-terminal G-domain (NTD), while the C-terminal G-domain (CTD) plays a potential role in binding of the nucleotide to the NTD. Thus, understanding the intermolecular regulation between the two GTPase domains is expected to reveal valuable information on the overall action of EhRabX3. To provide structural insights into the inclusive action of this unique GTPase, EhRabX3 was crystallized by successive micro-seeding using the vapour-diffusion method. A complete data set was collected to 3.3 Å resolution using a single native EhRabX3 crystal at 100 K on BM14 at the ESRF, Grenoble, France. The crystal belonged to monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a=198.6, b=119.3, c=89.2 Å, β=103.1°.

    "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus polymerase (HBV Pol) is an important target for anti-HBV drug development; however, its low solubility and stability in vitro has hindered detailed structural studies. Certain nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTIs) such as tenofovir and lamivudine can inhibit both HBV Pol and Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) RT, leading to speculation on structural and mechanistic analogies between the deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)-binding sites of these enzymes. The Q151M mutation in HIV-1 RT, located at the dNTP-binding site, confers resistance to various NRTIs, while maintaining sensitivity to tenofovir and lamivudine. The residue corresponding to Gln151 is strictly conserved as a methionine in HBV Pol. Therefore, the structure of the dNTP-binding pocket of the HIV-1 RT Q151M mutant may reflect that of HBV Pol. Here, the crystal structure of HIV-1 RT Q151M, determined at 2.6 Å resolution, in a new crystal form with space group P 321 is presented. Although the structure of HIV-1 RT Q151M superimposes well onto that of HIV-1 RT in a closed conformation, a slight movement of the β-strands (β2–β3) that partially create the dNTP-binding pocket was observed. This movement might be caused by the introduction of the bulky thioether group of Met151. The structure also highlighted the possibility that the hydrogen-bonding network among amino acids and NRTIs is rearranged by the Q151M mutation, leading to a difference in the affinity of NRTIs for HIV-1 RT and HBV Pol.",

A MetR homodimer binds to a 24-base-pair operator region of the met genes and specifically recognizes the interrupted palindromic sequence 5′-TGAA-N 5 -TTCA-3′. Mechanistic details underlying the interaction of MetR with its target DNA at the molecular level remain unknown. In this work, the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of MetR was determined at 2.16 Å resolution. MetR-DBD adopts a winged-helix–turn–helix (wHTH) motif and shares significant fold similarity with the DBD of the LTTR protein BenM. Furthermore, a data-driven macromolecular-docking strategy was used to model the structure of MetR-DBD bound to DNA, which revealed that a bent conformation of DNA is required for the recognition helix α3 and the wing loop of the wHTH motif to interact with the major and minor grooves, respectively. Comparison of the MetR-DBD–DNA complex with the crystal structures of other LTTR-DBD–DNA complexes revealed residues that may confer operator-sequence binding specificity for MetR. Taken together, the results show that MetR-DBD uses a combination of direct base-specific interactions and indirect shape recognition of the promoter to regulate the transcription of met genes.",

At GSA1 forms an asymmetric dimer and displays asymmetry in cofactor binding as well as in the gating-loop orientation, which is consistent with previously reported Synechococcus GSAM structures. While one monomer binds PMP with the gating loop fixed in the open state, the other monomer binds either PMP or PLP and the gating loop is ready to close. The data also reveal the mobility of residues Gly163, Ser164 and Gly165, which are important for reorientation of the gating loop.

In attempts to phase the data, a molecular-replacement solution based upon PDB entry 4nbu (33% identical in sequence to the target) was found.

In a search for the features that determine the thermostability of the enzyme, the Tm for the orthologue from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, for which the structure was already known, was also determined, and this enzyme proved to be considerably less thermostable.

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis can reside and persist in deep tissues; latent tuberculosis can evade immune detection and has a unique mechanism to convert it into active disease through reactivation. M. tuberculosis Rv1421 (MtRv1421) is a hypothetical protein that has been proposed to be involved in nucleotide binding-related metabolism in cell-growth and cell-division processes. However, due to a lack of structural information, the detailed function of MtRv1421 remains unclear. In this study, a truncated N-terminal domain (NTD) of MtRv1421, which contains a Walker A/B-like motif, was purified and crystallized using PEG 400 as a precipitant. The crystal of MtRv1421-NTD diffracted to a resolution of 1.7 Å and was considered to belong to either the C -centered monoclinic space group C 2 or the I -centered orthorhombic space group I 222, with unit-cell parameters a = 124.01, b = 58.55, c = 84.87 Å, β = 133.12° or a = 58.53, b = 84.86, c = 90.52 Å, respectively. The asymmetric units of the C 2 or I 222 crystals contained two or one monomers, respectively. In terms of the binding ability of MtRv1421-NTD to various ligands, uridine diphosphate (UDP) and UDP- N -acetylglucosamine significantly increased the melting temperature of MtRv1421-NTD, which indicates structural stabilization through the binding of these ligands. Altogether, the results reveal that a UDP moiety may be required for the interaction of MtRv1421-NTD as a nucleotide-binding protein with its ligand.",

The crystal structure showed that this domain harbors canonical FERM folding and consists of three subdomains that are tightly packed via highly conserved intramolecular hydrophobic interactions. Consistent with this, the PTPN21 FERM domain shares high structural homology with several other FERM domains. Moreover, structural superimposition demonstrated two putative protein-binding sites of the PTPN21 FERM domain, which are presumed to be associated with interaction with its binding partner, kinesin family member 1C.

The enzyme CdaA, which synthesizes an essential second messenger cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) in many pathogenic bacteria, has emerged as a promising candidate for the development of novel antibiotics. To identify crystals suitable for fragment screening, CdaA enzymes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecium were purified and crystallized. Crystals of B. subtilis CdaA, which diffracted to the highest resolution of 1.1 Å, were used to perform the screening of 96 fragments, yielding data sets with resolutions spanning from 1.08 to 1.87 Å. A total of 24 structural hits across eight different sites were identified. Four fragments bind to regions that are highly conserved among pathogenic bacteria, specifically the active site (three fragments) and the dimerization interface (one fragment). The coordinates of the three active-site fragments were used to perform an in silico drug-repurposing screen using the OpenEye suite and the DrugBank database. This screen identified tenofovir, an approved drug, that is predicted to interact with the ATP-binding region of CdaA. Its inhibitory potential against pathogenic E. faecium CdaA has been confirmed by ITC measurements. These findings not only demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for identifying lead compounds for the design of novel antibacterial agents, but also pave the way for further fragment-based lead-optimization efforts targeting CdaA.",

Primaquine, the preferred treatment for P. vivax malaria, is contraindicated in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a common genetic cause of hemolytic anemia, that affects ∼2.5% of the world's population and ∼8% of the population in areas of the world where P. vivax malaria is endemic. The Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (SSGCID) conducted a structure–function analysis of P. vivax N -myristoyltransferase ( Pv NMT) as part of efforts to develop alternative malaria drugs. Pv NMT catalyzes the attachment of myristate to the N-terminal glycine of many proteins, and this critical post-translational modification is required for the survival of P. vivax . The first step is the formation of a Pv NMT–myristoyl–CoA binary complex that can bind to peptides. Understanding how inhibitors prevent protein binding will facilitate the development of Pv NMT as a viable drug target. NMTs are secreted in all life stages of malarial parasites, making them attractive targets, unlike current antimalarials that are only effective during the plasmodial erythrocytic stages. The 2.3 Å resolution crystal structure of the ternary complex of Pv NMT with myristoyl-CoA and a novel inhibitor is reported. One asymmetric unit contains two monomers. The structure reveals notable differences between the Pv NMT and human enzymes and similarities to other plasmodial NMTs that can be exploited to develop new antimalarials.",

The structure reveals a unique binding site of mAb 2177 at the edge of the receptor molecule, which allows the mAb to sterically block the cell-bound form of CD70 from reaching CD27 while leaving the ligand epitope clear. This mode of action suggests a potential dual use of mAb 2177 either as an antagonist or as an agonist.",

Some human commensals and bacterial pathogens can scavenge sialic acids from their environment and degrade them for use as a carbon and nitrogen source. The enzyme N -acetylmannosamine kinase (NanK; EC 2.7.1.60) belongs to the transcriptional repressors, uncharacterized open reading frames and sugar kinases (ROK) superfamily. NanK catalyzes the second step of the sialic acid catabolic pathway, transferring a phosphate group from adenosine 5′-triphosphate to the C6 position of N -acetylmannosamine to generate N -acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate. The structure of NanK from Fusobacterium nucleatum was determined to 2.23 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. Unlike other NanK enzymes and ROK family members, F. nucleatum NanK does not have a conserved zinc-binding site. In spite of the absence of the zinc-binding site, all of the major structural features of enzymatic activity are conserved.",

The 2-Cys PRX from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrPRX1) is a chloroplast-localized protein that is critical for clearing reactive oxygen species in chloroplasts. CrPRX1 is reduced by thioredoxins or calredoxin (CrCRX), a recently identified calcium-dependent redox protein. The molecular interaction between PRXs and thioredoxin/CrCRX is functionally important, but discussion has been limited owing to a lack of structural information on CrPRX1, especially regarding its oligomeric state. In this study, high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) images of CrPRX1 and an X-ray crystallographic analysis have enabled examination of the oligomeric state of CrPRX1. Diffraction data from a crystal of the Cys174Ser mutant of CrPRX1 indicate the existence of noncrystallographic fivefold symmetry. HS-AFM images of CrPRX1 further show that CrPRX1 particles form rings with pentagonal rotational symmetry. On the basis of these findings, the oligomeric state of CrPRX1 is discussed and it is concluded that this PRX exists in a ring-shaped decameric form comprising a pentamer of dimers.",

This conformational change involves the transition of an α-helix to a 3 10 -helix, which causes the adjacent loop to close the active site following coenzyme and substrate binding.

    "abstract": "Alisporivir (ALV) is an 11-amino-acid hydrophobic cyclic peptide with N -methyl-D-alanine and N -ethyl-L-valine (NEV) residues at positions 3 and 4, respectively. ALV is a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin A (CsA) derivative. This inhibitor targets cyclophilins (Cyps), a family of proteins with peptidyl-prolyl cis / trans isomerase enzymatic activity. Cyps act as protein chaperones and are involved in numerous cellular functions. Moreover, Cyps have been shown to be an essential cofactor for the replication of many viruses, including Hepatitis C virus and Human immunodeficiency virus , and have also been shown to be involved in mitochondrial diseases. For these reasons, cyclophilins represent an attractive drug target. The structure of ALV in complex with cyclophilin A (CypA), the most abundant Cyp in humans, has been determined at 1.5 Å resolution. This first structure of the CypA–ALV complex shows that the binding of ALV is highly similar to that of CsA. The high resolution allowed the unambiguous determination of the conformations of residues 3 and 4 in ALV when bound to its target. In particular, the side-chain conformation of NEV4 precludes the interaction of the CypA–ALV complex with calcineurin, a cellular protein phosphatase involved in the immune response, which explains the non-immunosuppressive property of ALV. This study provides detailed molecular insights into the CypA–ALV interaction.",

The protein was expressed and purified to homogeneity using a simple combination of heat-shock and chromatographic methods. The high yield of the protein (∼250 mg per litre of culture) allows large-scale production for potential industrial applications. Purified GldA exhibited a homogeneous tetrameric state (∼161 kDa) in solution and relatively high thermostability ( T m = 65.6°C). Sitting-drop sparse-matrix screens were used for protein crystallization. An optimized condition with ammonium sulfate (2 M ) provided crystals suitable for diffraction, and a binary structure containing glycerol in the active site was solved at 2.8 Å resolution. Each GldA monomer consists of nine β-strands, thirteen α-helices, two 3 10 -helices and several loops organized into two domains, the N- and C-terminal domains; the active site is located in a deep cleft between the two domains. The N-terminal domain contains a classic Rossmann fold for NAD + binding. The O 1 and O 2 atoms of glycerol serve as ligands for the tetrahedrally coordinated Zn 2+ ion. The orientation of the glycerol within the active site is mainly stabilized by van der Waals and electrostatic interactions with the benzyl ring of Phe245. Computer modeling suggests that the glycerol molecule is sandwiched by the Zn 2+ and NAD + ions. Based on this, the mechanism for the relaxed substrate specificity of this enzyme is also discussed.",

To gain insight into the molecular details of its structure that are important for binding cocaine and cocaine metabolites, the Fab fragment was generated and crystallized with and without ligand. Structures of the unliganded Fab and the Fab fragment bound to benzoylecgonine were determined, and were compared with each other and with other crystallized anti-cocaine antibodies. The affinity of the h2E2 antibody for cocaine is 4 n M , while that of the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine is 20 n M . Both are higher than the reported affinity for cocaine of the two previously crystallized anti-cocaine antibodies. Consistent with cocaine fluorescent quenching binding studies for the h2E2 mAb, four aromatic residues in the CDR regions of the Fab (TyrL32, TyrL96, TrpL91 and TrpH33) were found to be involved in ligand binding. The aromatic side chains surround and trap the tropane moiety of the ligand in the complex structure, forming significant van der Waals interactions which may account for the higher affinity observed for the h2E2 antibody. A water molecule mediates hydrogen bonding between the antibody and the carbonyl group of the benzoyl ester. The affinity of binding to h2E2 of benzoylecgonine differs only by a factor of five compared with that of cocaine; therefore, it is suggested that h2E2 would bind cocaine in the same way as observed in the Fab–benzoylecgonine complex, with minor rearrangements of some hypervariable segments of the antibody.",

The high-affinity interaction between IgE and FcεRI is a long-standing target for therapeutic intervention in allergic disease. Omalizumab is a clinically approved anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that binds to free IgE, also with high affinity, preventing its interaction with FcεRI. All attempts to crystallize the pre-formed complex between the omalizumab Fab and the Fc region of IgE (IgE-Fc), to understand the structural basis for its mechanism of action, surprisingly failed. Instead, the Fab alone selectively crystallized in different crystal forms, but their structures revealed intermolecular Fab/Fab interactions that were clearly strong enough to disrupt the Fab/IgE-Fc complexes. Some of these interactions were common to other Fab crystal structures. Mutations were therefore designed to disrupt two recurring packing interactions observed in the omalizumab Fab crystal structures without interfering with the ability of the omalizumab Fab to recognize IgE-Fc; this led to the successful crystallization and subsequent structure determination of the Fab/IgE-Fc complex. The mutagenesis strategy adopted to achieve this result is applicable to other intractable Fab/antigen complexes or systems in which Fabs are used as crystallization chaperones.",

The structure of Ec GAPDH1 contains four subunits, each of which includes an N-terminal NAD + -binding domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain.

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, the removal of nuclear noncoding sequences (pre-mRNA splicing) is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which consists of five ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs, each with a respective snRNA) and a plethora of protein factors that aid spliceosomal maturation, assembly, activation and disassembly. Recently, the U5 snRNP maturation factor Aar2p from baker's yeast has been characterized structurally and biochemically. Aar2p binds to the RNaseH (RH) and Jab1/MPN domains of the highly conserved U5-specific Prp8p, which forms a framework for the spliceosomal catalytic centre. Thereby, Aar2p sterically excludes Brr2p, a helicase essential for the catalytic activation of the spliceosome, from Prp8p binding. At the same time, Aar2p blocks U4/U6 di-snRNA binding to Prp8p. Aar2p therefore prevents premature spliceosome activation and its functions are regulated by reversible phosphorylation. To date, little is known about the hypothetical human Aar2 (hsAar2) orthologue C20ORF4. This study identifies C20ORF4 (i) as part of the HeLa proteome by Western blotting and (ii) as a true Aar2 orthologue which binds to the RH domain (hsRH) of Prp8 and corroborates an evolutionary link between yeast and human Aar2 function. An elaborate strategy was devised to crystallize hsAar2 in complex with hsRH. The analysis of initial weakly diffracting crystals obtained by in situ proteolysis and homology modelling guided the design of an hsAar2 construct in which an internal loop was replaced by three serines (hsAar2 Δloop ). A complex of hsAar2 Δloop and hsRH crystallized in space group C 2; the crystals diffracted to 2.35 Å resolution and were suitable for structure determination by molecular-replacement approaches. The study presented here suggests a connection between Aar2 and the spliceosome in human cells and paves the way for structural studies of human Aar2.",

Here, the crystal structure of the LGN TPR domain in complex with human Frmpd4 is described at 1.5 Å resolution. In the complex, the LGN-binding region of Frmpd4 (amino-acid residues 990-1011) adopts an extended structure that runs antiparallel to LGN along the concave surface of the superhelix formed by the TPR motifs. Comparison with the previously determined structures of the LGN-Frmpd1, LGN-mInsc and LGN-NuMA complexes reveals that these partner proteins interact with LGN TPR1-6 via a common core binding region with consensus sequence (E/Q)XEX4-5(E/D/Q)X1-2(K/R)X0-1(V/I). In contrast to Frmpd1, Frmpd4 makes additional contacts with LGN via regions N- and C-terminal to the core sequence. The N-terminal extension is replaced by a specific α-helix in mInsc, which drastically increases the direct contacts with LGN TPR7/8, consistent with the higher affinity of mInsc for LGN. A crystal structure of Frmpd4-bound LGN in an oxidized form is also reported, although oxidation does not appear to strongly affect the interaction with Frmpd4.",

They are responsible for tremendous mortality and morbidity in the least-developed areas of the world. Presented here is an overview of the evolution over the last three to four decades of structure-guided design of inhibitors, leads and drug candidates aiming at targets from parasitic protozoa. Target selection is a crucial and multi-faceted aspect of structure-guided drug design. The major impact of advances in molecular biology, genome sequencing and high-throughput screening is touched upon. The most advanced crystallographic techniques, including XFEL, have already been applied to structure determinations of drug targets from parasitic protozoa. Even cryo-electron microscopy is contributing to our understanding of the mode of binding of inhibitors to parasite ribosomes. A number of projects have been selected to illustrate how structural information has assisted in arriving at promising compounds that are currently being evaluated by pharmacological, pharmacodynamic and safety tests to assess their suitability as pharmaceutical agents. Structure-guided approaches are also applied to incorporate properties into compounds such that they are less likely to become the victim of resistance mechanisms. A great increase in the number of novel antiparasitic compounds will be needed in the future. These should then be combined into various multi-compound therapeutics to circumvent the diverse resistance mechanisms that render single-compound, or even multi-compound, drugs ineffective. The future should also see (i) an increase in the number of projects with a tight integration of structural biology, medicinal chemistry, parasitology and pharmaceutical sciences; (ii) the education of more `medicinal structural biologists' who are familiar with the properties that compounds need to have for a high probability of success in the later steps of the drug-development process; and (iii) the expansion of drug-development capabilities in middle- and low-income countries.",

This gene encodes the only glycoside hydrolase of family 43 (GH43) produced by H. orenii . The crystal structure of the H. orenii glycosidase was determined by molecular replacement and refined at 1.10 Å resolution. As for other GH43 members, the enzyme folds as a five-bladed β-propeller. The structure features a metal-binding site on the propeller axis, near the active site. Based on thermal denaturation data, the H. orenii glycosidase depends on divalent cations in combination with high salt for optimal thermal stability against unfolding. A maximum melting temperature of 76°C was observed in the presence of 4 M NaCl and Mn 2+ at pH 6.5. The gene encoding the H. orenii GH43 enzyme has previously been annotated as a putative α-L-arabinofuranosidase. Activity was detected with p -nitrophenyl-α-L-arabinofuranoside as a substrate, and therefore the name Ho Araf43 was suggested for the enzyme. In agreement with the conditions for optimal thermal stability against unfolding, the highest arabinofuranosidase activity was obtained in the presence of 4 M NaCl and Mn 2+ at pH 6.5, giving a specific activity of 20–36 µmol min −1 mg −1 . The active site is structurally distinct from those of other GH43 members, including arabinanases, arabinofuranosidases and xylanases. This probably reflects the special requirements for degrading the unique biomass available in highly saline aqueous ecosystems, such as halophilic algae and halophytes. The amino-acid distribution of Ho Araf43 has similarities to those of mesophiles, thermophiles and halophiles, but also has unique features, for example more hydrophobic amino acids on the surface and fewer buried charged residues.",

    "abstract": "The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a machine evolved by Gram-negative bacteria to deliver toxin effectors into target bacterial or eukaryotic cells. The T6SS is functionally and structurally similar to the contractile tail of the Myoviridae family of bacteriophages and can be viewed as a syringe anchored to the bacterial membrane by a transenvelope complex. The membrane complex is composed of three proteins: the TssM and TssL inner membrane components and the TssJ outer membrane lipoprotein. The TssM protein is central as it interacts with both TssL and TssJ, therefore linking the membranes. Using controlled trypsinolysis, a 32.4 kDa C-terminal fragment of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli TssM (TssM 32Ct ) was purified. A nanobody obtained from llama immunization, nb25, exhibited subnanomolar affinity for TssM 32Ct . Crystals of the TssM 32Ct –nb25 complex were obtained and diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution. The crystals belonged to space group P 6 4 , with unit-cell parameters a = b = 95.23, c = 172.95 Å. Molecular replacement with a model nanobody indicated the presence of a dimer of TssM 32Ct –nb25 in the asymmetric unit.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian haem peroxidase superfamily consists of myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoperoxidase (LPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). These enzymes catalyze a number of oxidative reactions of inorganic substrates such as Cl − , Br − , I − and SCN − as well as of various organic aromatic compounds. To date, only structures of MPO and LPO are known. The substrate-binding sites in these enzymes are located on the distal haem side. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is a potent antithyroid drug that acts by inhibiting the function of TPO. It has also been shown to inhibit the action of LPO. However, its mode of binding to mammalian haem peroxidases is not yet known. In order to determine the mode of its binding to peroxidases, the structure of the complex of LPO with PTU has been determined. It showed that PTU binds to LPO in the substrate-binding site on the distal haem side. The IC 50 values for the inhibition of LPO and TPO by PTU are 47 and 30 µ M , respectively. A comparision of the residues surrounding the substrate-binding site on the distal haem side in LPO with those in TPO showed that all of the residues were identical except for Ala114 (LPO numbering scheme), which is replaced by Thr205 (TPO numbering scheme) in TPO. A threonine residue in place of alanine in the substrate-binding site may affect the affinity of PTU for peroxidases.",

GlcNAc oligomers prepared from chitin have useful biological activities, such as immunostimulation and the induction of plant defence responses. Microbial chitinolytic enzymes have been investigated extensively for their potential use in the eco-friendly enzymatic production of GlcNAc and its oligomers.

The chitinolytic enzymes from this strain are potentially useful for the efficient production of GlcNAc and its oligomers from chitin.

Previously, the crystal structure of ARF6 bound to JIP4 revealed LZII in a parallel coiled-coil arrangement. Here, the crystal structure of an N-terminally truncated form of LZII of JIP3 alone shows an unexpected antiparallel arrangement. Using molecular dynamics and modelling, the stability of this antiparallel LZII arrangement, as well as its specificity for ARF6, were investigated. This study highlights that N-terminal truncation of LZII can change its coiled-coil orientation without affecting its overall stability. Further, a conserved buried asparagine residue was pinpointed as a possible structural determinant for this dramatic structural rearrangement. Thus, LZII of JIP3/4 is a versatile structural motif, modifications of which can impact partner recognition and thus biological function.",

These processes are manipulated by the binding of c-di-GMP to its receptors. XC_3703 from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris , which belongs to the YajQ family of proteins, has recently been identified as a potential c-di-GMP receptor. XC_3703, together with XC_2801, functions as a transcription factor activating virulence-related genes, which can be reversed by the binding of c-di-GMP to XC_3703. However, the structural basis of how c-di-GMP regulates XC_3703 remains elusive. In this study, the structure of XC_3703 was determined to 2.1 Å resolution using the molecular-replacement method. The structure of XC_3703 consists of two domains adopting the same topology, which is similar to that of the RNA-recognition motif (RRM). Arg65, which is conserved among the c-di-GMP-binding subfamily of the YajQ family of proteins, together with Phe80 in domain II, forms a putative c-di-GMP binding site.",

    "abstract": "Herein, multiple crystal structures of meditope peptide derivatives incorporating natural and unnatural amino acids bound to the cetuximab Fab domain are presented. The affinity of each derivative was determined by surface plasmon resonance and correlated to the atomic structure. Overall, it was observed that the hydrophobic residues in the meditope peptide, Phe3, Leu5 and Leu10, could accommodate a number of moderate substitutions, but these invariably reduced the overall affinity and half-life of the interaction. In one case, the substitution of Phe3 by histidine led to a change in the rotamer conformation, in which the imidazole ring flipped to a solvent-exposed position. Based on this observation, Phe3 was substituted by diphenylalanine and it was found that the phenyl rings in this variant mimic the superposition of the Phe3 and His3 structures, producing a moderate increase, of 1.4-fold, in the half-life of the complex. In addition, it was observed that substitution of Leu5 by tyrosine and glutamate strongly reduced the affinity, whereas the substitution of Leu5 by diphenylalanine moderately reduced the half-life (by approximately fivefold). Finally, it was observed that substitution of Arg8 and Arg9 by citrulline dramatically reduced the overall affinity, presumably owing to lost electrostatic interactions. Taken together, these studies provide insight into the meditope–cetuximab interaction at the atomic level.",

Aggregation-prone, unstructured subunits cross the periplasm and are secreted through the outer membrane, after which they self-assemble. Here, significant progress is presented towards solving the high-resolution crystal structure of the novel amyloid transporter FapF from Pseudomonas, which facilitates the secretion of the amyloid-forming polypeptide FapC across the bacterial outer membrane. This represents the first step towards obtaining structural insight into the products of the Pseudomonas fap operon. Initial attempts at crystallizing full-length and N-terminally truncated constructs by refolding techniques were not successful; however, after preparing FapF106-430 from the membrane fraction, reproducible crystals were obtained using the sitting-drop method of vapour diffusion. Diffraction data have been processed to 2.5 Å resolution.

It was found that the switch to complete detergent exchange into C8E4 was crucial for forming well diffracting crystals, and it is suggested that this combined with limited proteolysis is a potentially useful protocol for membrane β-barrel protein crystallography. The three-dimensional structure of FapF will provide invaluable information on the mechanistic differences of biogenesis between the curli and Fap functional amyloid systems.",

Paracoccus denitrificans is a member of the α-proteobacteria and is related to the extinct protomitochondrion that became engulfed by the ancestor of eukaryotic cells. The P. denitrificans F-ATPase is an example of a eubacterial F-ATPase that can carry out ATP synthesis only, whereas many others can catalyse both the synthesis and the hydrolysis of ATP. Inhibition of the ATP hydrolytic activity of the P. denitrificans F-ATPase involves the ζ inhibitor protein, an α-helical protein that binds to the catalytic F 1 domain of the enzyme. This domain is a complex of three α-subunits and three β-subunits, and one copy of each of the γ-, δ- and ∊-subunits. Attempts to crystallize the F 1 –ζ inhibitor complex yielded crystals of a subcomplex of the catalytic domain containing the α- and β-subunits only. Its structure was determined to 2.3 Å resolution and consists of a heterodimer of one α-subunit and one β-subunit. It has no bound nucleotides, and it corresponds to the `open' or `empty' catalytic interface found in other F-ATPases. The main significance of this structure is that it aids in the determination of the structure of the intact membrane-bound F-ATPase, which has been crystallized.",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome c ′-β is a heme protein that belongs to the cytochrome P460 family and consists of homodimeric subunits with a predominantly antiparallel β-sheet fold. Here, the crystal structure of cytochrome c ′-β from the thermophilic Thermus thermophilus (TTCP-β) is reported at 1.74 Å resolution. TTCP-β has a typical antiparallel β-sheet fold similar to that of cytochrome c ′-β from the moderately thermophilic Methylococcus capsulatus (MCCP-β). The phenylalanine cap structure around the distal side of the heme is also similar in TTCP-β and MCCP-β, indicating that both proteins similarly bind nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, as observed spectroscopically. Notably, TTCP-β exhibits a denaturation temperature of 117°C, which is higher than that of MCCP-β. Mutational analysis reveals that the increased homodimeric interface area of TTCP-β contributes to its high thermal stability. Furthermore, 14 proline residues, which are mostly located in the TTCP-β loop regions, possibly contribute to the rigid loop structure compared with MCCP-β, which has only six proline residues. These findings, together with those from phylogenetic analysis, suggest that the structures of Thermus cytochromes c ′-β, including TTCP-β, are optimized for function under the high-temperature conditions in which the source organisms live.",

    "abstract": "KAMO and BLEND provide particularly effective tools to automatically manage the merging of large numbers of data sets from serial crystallography. The requirement for manual intervention in the process can be reduced by extending BLEND to support additional clustering options such as the use of more accurate cell distance metrics and the use of reflection-intensity correlation coefficients to infer `distances' among sets of reflections. This increases the sensitivity to differences in unit-cell parameters and allows clustering to assemble nearly complete data sets on the basis of intensity or amplitude differences. If the data sets are already sufficiently complete to permit it, one applies KAMO once and clusters the data using intensities only. When starting from incomplete data sets, one applies KAMO twice, first using unit-cell parameters. In this step, either the simple cell vector distance of the original BLEND or the more sensitive NCDist is used. This step tends to find clusters of sufficient size such that, when merged, each cluster is sufficiently complete to allow reflection intensities or amplitudes to be compared. One then uses KAMO again using the correlation between reflections with a common hkl to merge clusters in a way that is sensitive to structural differences that may not have perturbed the unit-cell parameters sufficiently to make meaningful clusters. Many groups have developed effective clustering algorithms that use a measurable physical parameter from each diffraction still or wedge to cluster the data into categories which then can be merged, one hopes, to yield the electron density from a single protein form. Since these physical parameters are often largely independent of one another, it should be possible to greatly improve the efficacy of data-clustering software by using a multi-stage partitioning strategy. Here, one possible approach to multi-stage data clustering is demonstrated. The strategy is to use unit-cell clustering until the merged data are sufficiently complete and then to use intensity-based clustering. Using this strategy, it is demonstrated that it is possible to accurately cluster data sets from crystals that have subtle differences.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) plays important roles in cellular homeostasis and is a highly validated therapeutic target for multiple human ailments, including diabetes, obesity and breast cancer. However, much remains to be learned about how conformational changes may convey information through the structure of PTP1B to enable allosteric regulation by ligands or functional responses to mutations. High-resolution X-ray crystallography can offer unique windows into protein conformational ensembles, but comparison of even high-resolution structures is often complicated by differences between data sets, including non-isomorphism. Here, the highest resolution crystal structure of apo wild-type (WT) PTP1B to date is presented out of a total of ∼350 PTP1B structures in the PDB. This structure is in a crystal form that is rare for PTP1B, with two unique copies of the protein that exhibit distinct patterns of conformational heterogeneity, allowing a controlled comparison of local disorder across the two chains within the same asymmetric unit. The conformational differences between these chains are interrogated in the apo structure and between several recently reported high-resolution ligand-bound structures. Electron-density maps in a high-resolution structure of a recently reported activating double mutant are also examined, and unmodeled alternate conformations in the mutant structure are discovered that coincide with regions of enhanced conformational heterogeneity in the new WT structure. These results validate the notion that these mutations operate by enhancing local dynamics, and suggest a latent susceptibility to such changes in the WT enzyme. Together, these new data and analysis provide a detailed view of the conformational ensemble of PTP1B and highlight the utility of high-resolution crystallography for elucidating conformational heterogeneity with potential relevance for function.",

An H. pylori type IV secretion (T4S) system encoded by the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island ( cag PAI) is responsible for communication with host cells. As a component of the cag PAI T4S system core complex, CagX plays an important role in virulence-protein translocation into the host cells. In this work, the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of CagX (CagXct), which is a homologue of the VirB9 protein from the VirB/D4 T4S system, is presented. CagXct is only the second three-dimensional structure to be elucidated of a VirB9-like protein. Another homologue, TraO, which is encoded on the Escherichia coli conjugative plasmid pKM101, shares only 19% sequence identity with CagXct; however, there is a remarkable similarity in tertiary structure between these two β-sandwich protein domains. Most of the residues that are conserved between CagXct and TraO are located within the protein core and appear to be responsible for the preservation of this domain fold. The studies presented here will contribute to our understanding of different bacterial T4S systems.",

The interaction between RGA5A_S and AVR1-CO39 relieves the repression of RGA4, leading to effector-independent cell death. To determine the structure of the complex of RGA5A_S and AVR1-CO39 and to understand the details of this interaction, the complex was prepared by fusing the proteins together, by mixing them in vitro or by co-expressing them in one host cell. Samples purified via the first two strategies were crystallized under two different conditions. A mixture of AVR1-CO39 and RGA5A_S (complex I) crystallized in 1.1 M ammonium tartrate dibasic, 0.1 M sodium acetate–HCl pH 4.6, while crystals of the fusion complex RGA5A_S-TEV-AVR1-CO39 (complex II) were grown in 2 M NaCl. The crystal of complex I belonged to space group P 3 1 21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 66.2, c = 108.8 Å, α = β = 90, γ = 120°. The crystals diffracted to a Bragg spacing of 2.4 Å, and one molecule each of RGA5A_S and AVR1-CO39 were present in the asymmetric unit of the initial model. The crystal of complex II belonged to space group I 4, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 137.4, c = 66.2 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. The crystals diffracted to a Bragg spacing of 2.72 Å, and there were two molecules of RGA5A_S and two molecules of AVR1-CO39 in the asymmetric unit of the initial model. Further structural characterization of the interaction between RGA5A_S and AVR1-CO39 will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism underlying effector recognition by R proteins.",

    "abstract": "The process of producing suitable crystals for X-ray diffraction analysis most often involves the setting up of hundreds (or thousands) of individual crystallization trials, each of which must be repeatedly examined for crystals or hints of crystallinity. Currently, the only real way to address this bottleneck is to use an automated imager to capture images of the trials. However, the images still need to be assessed for crystals or other outcomes. Ideally, there would exist some rapid and reliable machine-analysis tool to translate the images into a quantitative result. However, as yet no such tool exists in wide usage, despite this being a well recognized problem. One of the issues in creating robust automatic image-analysis software is the lack of reliable data for training machine-learning algorithms. Here, a mobile application, Cinder , has been developed which allows crystallization images to be scored quickly on a smartphone or tablet. The Cinder scores are inserted into the appropriate table in a crystallization database and are immediately available to the user through a more sophisticated web interface, allowing more detailed analyses. A sharp increase in the number of scored images was observed after Cinder was released, which in turn provides more data for training machine-learning tools.",

Here, the expression, purification and crystallization of Lb ADH to generate large, single crystals with a volume of up to 1 mm 3 suitable for neutron diffraction studies are described. Neutron diffraction data were collected from an H/D-exchanged Lb ADH crystal using the BIODIFF instrument at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ), Garching, Germany to a resolution d min of 2.15 Å in 16 days. This allowed the first neutron crystal structure of Lb ADH to be determined. The neutron structure revealed new details of the hydrogen-bonding network originating from the ion-binding site of Lb ADH and provided new insights into the reasons why divalent magnesium (Mg 2+ ) or manganese (Mn 2+ ) ions are necessary for its activity. X-ray diffraction data were obtained from the same crystal at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France to a resolution d min of 1.48 Å. The high-resolution X-ray structure suggested partial occupancy of Mn 2+ and Mg 2+ at the ion-binding site.

Here, the structural analysis of the haloalkane dehalogenase DpcA isolated from the psychrophilic bacterium Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5 is presented at the atomic resolution of 1.05 Å.

To shed light on the structural factors that contribute to this dual functional behaviour, a recombinant form of the L. rhamnosus GG SpaB pilin was produced and purified for crystallization and X-ray diffraction experiments. The crystallization of SpaB remained particularly challenging until the implementation of a three-pronged crystallization approach involving C-terminal tail truncation, surface lysine methylation and magnesium additives. Ultimately, hexagonal crystals of SpaB were produced and were able to diffract to a resolution of 2.4 Å.

PAS polymers are strongly hydrophilic and highly soluble in water, where they exhibit a natively disordered conformation without any detectable secondary or tertiary structure, similar to polyethylene glycol (PEG), which constitutes the most widely applied precipitant for protein crystallization to date. To investigate the potential of PAS polymers for structural studies by X-ray crystallography, two proteins that were successfully crystallized using PEG in the past, hen egg-white lysozyme and the Fragaria × ananassa O-methyltransferase, were subjected to crystallization screens with a 200-residue PAS polypeptide. The PAS polymer was applied as a precipitant using a vapor-diffusion setup that allowed individual optimization of the precipitant concentration in the droplet in the reservoir. As a result, crystals of both proteins showing high diffraction quality were obtained using the PAS precipitant. The genetic definition and precise macromolecular composition of PAS polymers, both in sequence and in length, distinguish them from all natural and synthetic polymers that have been utilized for protein crystallization so far, including PEG, and facilitate their adaptation for future applications. Thus, PAS polymers offer potential as novel precipitants for biomolecular crystallography.",

SdrC, an S. aureus surface protein, can act as an adhesin to promote cell attachment and aggregation by an unknown mechanism. Here, structural studies demonstrate that SdrC forms a unique dimer through intermolecular interaction. It is proposed that the dimerization of SdrC enhances the efficiency of bacteria–host attachment and therefore contributes to the pathogenicity of S. aureus .",

    "abstract": "Acyltransferases are responsible for the selection and loading of acyl units onto carrier proteins in polyketide and fatty-acid biosynthesis. Despite the importance of protein–protein interactions between the acyltransferase and the carrier protein, structural information on acyltransferase–carrier protein interactions is limited because of the transient interactions between them. In the biosynthesis of the polyketide vicenistatin, the acyltransferase VinK recognizes the carrier protein VinL for the transfer of a dipeptidyl unit. The crystal structure of a VinK–VinL covalent complex formed with a 1,2-bismaleimidoethane cross-linking reagent has been determined previously. Here, the crystal structure of a VinK–VinL covalent complex formed with a pantetheine cross-linking probe is reported at 1.95 Å resolution. In the structure of the VinK–VinL–probe complex, the pantetheine probe that is attached to VinL is covalently connected to the side chain of the mutated Cys106 of VinK. The interaction interface between VinK and VinL is essentially the same in the two VinK–VinL complex structures, although the position of the pantetheine linker slightly differs. This structural observation suggests that interface interactions are not affected by the cross-linking strategy used.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic protein kinases contain an Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif, the conformation of which is involved in controlling the catalytic activity, at the N-terminus of the activation segment. The motif can be switched between active-state (DFG-in) and inactive-state (DFG-out) conformations: however, the mechanism of conformational change is poorly understood, partly because there are few reports of the DFG-out conformation. Here, a novel crystal structure of nonphosphorylated human mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1; amino acids 38–381) complexed with ATP-γS is reported in which MEK1 adopts the DFG-out conformation. The crystal structure revealed that the structural elements (the αC helix and HRD motif) surrounding the active site are involved in the formation/stabilization of the DFG-out conformation. The ATP-γS molecule was bound to the canonical ATP-binding site in a different binding mode that has never been found in previously determined crystal structures of MEK1. This novel ATP-γS binding mode provides a starting point for the design of high-affinity inhibitors of nonphosphorylated inactive MEK1 that adopts the DFG-out conformation.",

Pa RecR crystallizes in space group P 6 1 22, with two monomers per asymmetric unit. Analytical ultracentrifugation data show that Pa RecR forms a stable dimer, but can exist as a tetramer in solution. The crystal structure shows that dimeric Pa RecR forms a ring-like tetramer architecture via crystal symmetry.

It plays crucial roles in cell signalling, cell-cycle control and in maintaining proteome integrity and protein homeostasis. In plants, Hsp90s are required for normal plant growth and development. Hsp90s are observed to be upregulated in response to various abiotic and biotic stresses and are also involved in immune responses in plants. Although there are several studies elucidating the physiological role of Hsp90s in plants, their molecular mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, biochemical characterization of an Hsp90 protein from rice ( Oryza sativa ; OsHsp90) has been performed and the crystal structure of its N-terminal domain (OsHsp90-NTD) was determined. The binding of OsHsp90 to its substrate ATP and the inhibitor 17-AAG was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. The protein also exhibited a weak ATPase activity. The crystal structure of OsHsp90-NTD was solved in complex with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPCP at 3.1 Å resolution. The domain was crystallized by cross-seeding with crystals of the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 from Dictyostelium discoideum , which shares 70% sequence identity with OsHsp90-NTD. This is the second reported structure of a domain of Hsp90 from a plant source.",

The CS reaction comprises two half-reactions: a Claisen aldol condensation of acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) and oxaloacetate (OAA) that forms citryl-CoA (CitCoA), and CitCoA hydrolysis. Protein conformational changes that `close' the active site play an important role in the assembly of a catalytically competent condensation active site. CS from the thermoacidophile Thermoplasma acidophilum (TpCS) possesses an endogenous Trp fluorophore that can be used to monitor the condensation reaction. The 2.2 Å resolution crystal structure of TpCS fused to a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (TpCSH6) reported here is an `open' structure that, when compared with several liganded TpCS structures, helps to define a complete path for active-site closure. One active site in each dimer binds a neighboring His tag, the first nonsubstrate ligand known to occupy both the AcCoA and OAA binding sites. Solution data collectively suggest that this fortuitous interaction is stabilized by the crystalline lattice. As a polar but almost neutral ligand, the active site–tail interaction provides a new starting point for the design of bisubstrate-analog inhibitors of CS.",

The four crystal structures fell into three different crystal-packing groups, with the cadmium-free Pf-Dac and Se-Pf-Dac belonging to the same space group, with homologous unit-cell parameters. The crystal structures in the presence of cadmium contained distorted octahedral cadmium complexes coordinated by three chlorides, two O atoms and an S or Se atom from the N-terminal methionine or selenomethionine, respectively. The N-terminal cadmium complex was involved in crystal contacts between symmetry-related molecules through hydrogen bonding to the N-termini. While all six N-termini of Se-Pf-Dac were involved in cadmium-complex formation, only two of the Pf-Dac N-termini participated in complex formation in the Cd-containing crystal, resulting in different crystal forms. These differences are discussed in light of the higher stability of the Cd—Se bond than the Cd—S bond. This work provides an example of the contribution of cadmium towards determining protein crystal quality and packing depending on the use of the native protein or the selenomethionine derivative.",

The present paper provides evidence in support of the approach for understanding protein crystallization as a process dependent on multiple factors, each with its relative contribution, rather than a phenomenon driven by a few dominant physicochemical characteristics.

    "abstract": "The enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a flavoenzyme that catalyses the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate in the de novo pyrimidine-biosynthesis pathway. In this study, a reproducible protocol for the heterologous expression of active dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis (LbDHODH) was developed and its crystal structure was determined at 2.12 Å resolution. L. (V.) braziliensis is the species responsible for the mucosal form of leishmaniasis, a neglected disease for which no cure or effective therapy is available. Analyses of sequence, structural and kinetic features classify LbDHODH as a member of the class 1A DHODHs and reveal a very high degree of structural conservation with the previously reported structures of orthologous trypanosomatid enzymes. The relevance of nucleotide-biosynthetic pathways for cell metabolism together with structural and functional differences from the respective host enzyme suggests that inhibition of LbDHODH could be exploited for antileishmanicidal drug development. The present work provides the framework for further integrated in vitro, in silico and in vivo studies as a new tool to evaluate DHODH as a drug target against trypanosomatid-related diseases.",

When crystallized in space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 DLH has either phosphates or sulfates bound to the protein in crucial locations, one of which is located in the active site, preventing substrate/inhibitor binding. Another is located on the surface of the enzyme coordinated by side chains from two different molecules. Crystallization in space group C 2 from a sodium citrate buffer results in new crystallographic protein–protein interfaces. The protein backbone is highly similar, but new crystal contacts cause changes in side-chain orientations and in loop positioning. In regions not involved in crystal contacts, there is little change in backbone or side-chain configuration. The flexibility of surface loops and the adaptability of side chains are important factors enabling DLH to adapt and form different crystal lattices.",

In Escherichia coli it is implicated in divalent metal tolerance, while the mammalian CutA1 homologue has been proposed to mediate brain enzyme acetylcholinesterase activity and copper homeostasis. The X-ray structures of CutA1 from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus (TtCutA1) with and without bound Na(+) at 1.7 and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively, and from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii (PhCutA1) in complex with Na(+) at 1.8 Å resolution have been determined. Both are short and rigid proteins of about 12 kDa that form intertwined compact trimers in the crystal and solution. The main difference in the structures is a wide-type β-bulge on top of the TtCutA1 trimer. It affords a mechanism for lodging a single-residue insertion in the middle of β2 while preserving the interprotomer main-chain hydrogen-bonding network. The liganded forms of the proteins provide new structural information about the metal-binding sites and CutA1 assembly. The Na(+)-TtCutA1 structure unveils a dodecameric assembly with metal ions in the trimer-trimer interfaces and the lateral clefts of the trimer. For Na(+)-PhCutA1, the metal ion associated with six waters in an octahedral geometry. The structures suggest that CutA1 may contribute to regulating intracellular metal homeostasis through various binding modes.",

    "abstract": "Sialic acids are one of the most important carbohydrate classes in biology. Some bacterial pathogens can scavenge sialic acids from their surrounding environment and degrade them as a source of carbon, nitrogen and energy. This sequestration and subsequent catabolism of sialic acid require a cluster of genes known as the `Nan-Nag' cluster. The enzymes coded by these genes are important for pathogen colonization and persistence. Importantly, the Nan-Nag genes have proven to be essential for Staphylococcus aureus growth on sialic acids, suggesting that the pathway is a viable antibiotic drug target. The enzyme N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase is involved in the catabolism of sialic acid; specifically, the enzyme converts N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate into N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate. The gene was cloned into an appropriate expression vector, and recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified via a three-step procedure.

A number of research groups are interested in redirecting this biomass waste stream for the production of fuel and bulk chemicals. The primary monomeric subunit of this polysaccharide is D-galacturonate, a six-carbon acid sugar that is degraded in a five-step pathway to central metabolic intermediates by some bacteria, including Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In the third step of the pathway, D-galactaro-1,4-lactone is converted to 2-keto-3-deoxy-L-threo-hexarate by a member of the mandelate racemase subgroup of the enolase superfamily with a novel activity for the superfamily. The 1.6 Å resolution structure of this enzyme was determined, revealing an overall modified (β/α)7β TIM-barrel domain, a hallmark of the superfamily. D-Galactaro-1,4-lactone was manually docked into the active site located at the interface between the N-terminal lid domain and the C-terminal barrel domain. On the basis of the position of the lactone in the active site, Lys166 is predicted to be the active-site base responsible for abstraction of the α proton. His296 on the opposite side of the active site is predicted to be the general acid that donates a proton to the β carbon as the lactone ring opens. The lactone ring appears to be oriented within the active site by stacking interactions with Trp298.",

Thymidine phosphorylases do not catalyze the phosphorolysis of uridine, in contrast to nonspecific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases and uridine phosphorylases. Understanding the mechanism of substrate specificity on the basis of the nucleoside is essential to support rational drug-discovery investigations of new antitumour and anti-infective drugs which are metabolized by thymidine phosphorylases. For this reason, X-ray structures of the thymidine phosphorylase from Salmonella typhimurium were solved and refined: the unliganded structure at 2.05 Å resolution (PDB entry 4xr5), the structure of the complex with thymidine at 2.55 Å resolution (PDB entry 4yek) and that of the complex with uridine at 2.43 Å resolution (PDB entry 4yyy). The various structural features of the enzyme which might be responsible for the specificity for thymidine and not for uridine were identified. The presence of the 2′-hydroxyl group in uridine results in a different position of the uridine furanose moiety compared with that of thymidine. This feature may be the key element of the substrate specificity. The specificity might also be associated with the opening/closure mechanism of the two-domain subunit structure of the enzyme.",

Crystals of PPE were grown overnight using sodium sulfate and sodium acetate at acidic pH. Cross-linking the crystals with glutaraldehyde was needed to resist the soaking procedure with a diethyl N-(methyl)pyridinyl-substituted oxo-β-lactam inhibitor. Crystals of PPE bound to the inhibitor belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2₁2₁2₁, with unit-cell parameters a = 51.0, b = 58.3, c = 74.9 Å, and diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution using an in-house X-ray source.",

In order to better understand the interactions that drive this unique complex, a number of variants including the residues within the meditope peptide and the antibody, as well as the cyclization region of the meditope peptide, were created. Here, multiple crystal structures of meditope peptides incorporating different cyclization strategies bound to the central cavity of the cetuximab Fab domain are presented. The affinity of each cyclic derivative for the Fab was determined by surface plasmon resonance and correlated to structural differences. Overall, it was observed that the disulfide bond used to cyclize the peptide favorably packs against a hydrophobic `pocket' and that amidation and acetylation of the original disulfide meditope increased the overall affinity ∼2.3-fold. Conversely, replacing the terminal cysteines with serines and thus creating a linear peptide reduced the affinity over 50-fold, with much of this difference being reflected in a decrease in the on-rate. Other cyclization methods, including the formation of a lactam, reduced the affinity but not to the extent of the linear peptide. Collectively, the structural and kinetic data presented here indicate that small perturbations introduced by different cyclization strategies can significantly affect the affinity of the meditope–Fab complex.",

The crystal structure refined to 3.0 Å resolution showed that the protein is composed of a β-barrel domain with extended loops and can form hexameric rings as observed in known Hcp homologues. Mutation of the extended loop was found to partly destabilize the hexameric conformation into monomers or cause the production of inclusion bodies, suggesting it has an important role in hexameric ring formation.",

This pathogen forms biofilms on hospital surfaces and medical devices using Csu pili assembled via the archaic chaperone–usher pathway. To uncover the mechanism of bacterial attachment to abiotic surfaces, it was aimed to determine the crystal structure of the pilus tip adhesin CsuE. The CsuC–CsuE chaperone–subunit pre-assembly complex was purified from the periplasm of Escherichia coli overexpressing CsuC and CsuE. Despite the high purity of the complex, no crystals could be obtained. This challenge was solved by the methylation of lysine residues. The complex was crystallized in 0.1 M bis-tris pH 5.5, 17% PEG 3350 using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.31 Å and belonged to the triclinic space group P 1, with unit-cell parameters a = 53.84, b = 63.85, c = 89.25 Å, α = 74.65, β = 79.65, γ = 69.07°.

    "abstract": "The enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) is one of the key enzymes in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. It catalyses the formation of a linear tetrapyrrole from four molecules of the substrate porphobilinogen (PBG). It has a dipyrromethane cofactor (DPM) in the active site which is covalently linked to a conserved cysteine residue through a thioether bridge. The substrate molecules are linked to the cofactor in a stepwise head-to-tail manner during the reaction, which is catalysed by a conserved aspartate residue: Asp82 in the B. megaterium enzyme. Three mutations have been made affecting Asp82 (D82A, D82E and D82N) and their crystal structures have been determined at resolutions of 2.7, 1.8 and 1.9 Å, respectively. These structures reveal that whilst the D82E mutant possesses the DPM cofactor, in the D82N and D82A mutants the cofactor is likely to be missing, incompletely assembled or disordered. Comparison of the mutant PBGD structures with that of the wild-type enzyme shows that there are significant domain movements and suggests that the enzyme adopts `open' and `closed' conformations, potentially in response to substrate binding.",

Recently, a chemoreceptor named PscF was identified from the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae that is predicted to contain a periplasmic NIT domain. The PscF sensor domain (PscF-SD; residues 42–332) was cloned into an appropriate expression vector, recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli BL21-Gold(DE3) cells and purified via immobilized metal-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Purified PscF-SD was screened for crystallization; the best crystal diffracted to a maximum resolution of 1.46 Å in space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 . However, the data could not be phased using the only available NIT-domain structure ( Klebsiella oxytoca NasR; PDB entry 4akk) as the search model.

Interestingly, Bacillus subtilis MnSOD does not have the same stability, despite having a closely similar primary structure and thus presumably also tertiary structure. Here, the crystal structure of S. equorum MnSOD at 1.4 Å resolution is reported that may explain these differences. The crystal belonged to space group P 3 2 21, with unit-cell parameters a = 57.36, b = 57.36, c = 105.76 Å, and contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The symmetry operation indicates that the enzyme has a dimeric structure, as found in nature and in B. subtilis MnSOD. As expected, their overall structures are nearly identical. However, the loop connecting the helical and α/β domains of S. equorum MnSOD is shorter than that in B. subtilis MnSOD, and adopts a conformation that allows more direct water-mediated hydrogen-bond interactions between the amino-acid side chains of the first and last α-helices in the latter domain. Furthermore, S. equorum MnSOD has a slightly larger buried area compared with the dimer surface area than that in B. subtilis MnSOD, while the residues that form the interaction in the dimer-interface region are highly conserved. Thus, the stability of S. equorum MnSOD may not originate from the dimeric form alone. Furthermore, an additional water molecule was found in the active site. This allows an alternative geometry for the coordination of the Mn atom in the active site of the apo form. This is the first structure of MnSOD from the genus Staphylococcus and may provide a template for the structural study of other MnSODs from this genus.",

PDCs are thiamine pyrophosphate- and Mg 2+ ion-dependent enzymes that catalyse the non-oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. As this enzyme class is rare in bacteria, current knowledge of bacterial PDCs is extremely limited. One approach to further the understanding of bacterial PDCs is to exploit the diversity provided by evolution. Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is a method of computational molecular evolution to infer extinct ancestral protein sequences, which can then be synthesized and experimentally characterized. Through ASR a novel PDC was generated, designated ANC27, that shares only 78% amino-acid sequence identity with its closest extant homologue ( Komagataeibacter medellinensis PDC, GenBank accession No. WP_014105323.1), yet is fully functional. Crystals of this PDC diffracted to 3.5 Å resolution. The data were merged in space group P 3 2 21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 108.33, c = 322.65 Å, and contained two dimers (two tetramer halves) in the asymmetric unit.

The inhibitor also induces the formation of crystalline HLE dimers that block access to the active sites and that are also predicted to be stable in solution. Neither such HLE dimers nor the corresponding crystal packing have been observed in previous HLE crystal structures.

The duplex shows regular hydration patterns in the narrow minor groove, on the convex surface and around sugar–phosphate backbones. Therefore, Z-DNA offers an ideal case to test the benefits of low-temperature neutron diffraction data collection to potentially determine the donor–acceptor patterns of first- and second-shell water molecules. Nucleic acid fragments pose challenges for neutron crystallography because water molecules are located on the surface rather than inside sequestered spaces such as protein active sites or channels. Water molecules can be expected to display dynamic behavior, particularly in cases where water is not part of an inner shell and directly coordinated to DNA atoms. Thus, nuclear density maps based on room-temperature diffraction data with a resolution of 1.6 Å did not allow an unequivocal determination of the orientations of water molecules. Here, cryo-neutron diffraction data collection for a Z-DNA crystal on the Macromolecular Neutron Diffractometer at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the outcome of an initial refinement of the structure are reported. A total of 12 diffraction images were recorded with an exposure time of 3.5 h per image, whereby the crystal was static for each diffraction image with a 10° φ rotation between images. Initial refinements using these neutron data indicated the positions and orientations of 30 water molecules within the first hydration shell of the DNA molecule. This experiment constitutes a state-of-the-art approach and is the first attempt to our knowledge to determine the low-temperature neutron structure of a DNA crystal.",

    "abstract": "Experiments were carried out on 15 different protein crystals with the objective of estimating the rates of penetration of dye molecules into the crystals. The dyes were in the molecular-weight range 250–1000 Da and the protein crystals were of dimensions of 0.7 mm or greater. Experiments were also conducted on protein crystals grown between glass cover slips (separation 200 µm) that restricted the direction of diffusion. The rate of penetration of dyes into protein crystals depends very much on the degree of association between the dye and protein molecules. Dye penetration was not consistent with pure diffusion when the affinity of the protein for the dye was significant, and this was frequent. Penetration rates were less dependent on factors such as the molecular weight of the dye or the diffusion direction. For weakly interacting protein crystal/dye combinations, penetration was a fair measure of diffusivity and the observed rates were in the range 60–100 µm h −1 . For strongly interacting combinations, the rates of penetration were of the order of 15–30 µm h −1 .",

Here, the crystal structure of the 1-Cys peroxiredoxin from Sulfolobus islandicus , named 1-Cys SiPrx, is presented. A 2.75 Å resolution data set was collected from a crystal belonging to space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 86.8, b = 159.1, c = 189.3 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the homologous Aeropyrum pernix peroxiredoxin (ApPrx) structure as a search model. In the crystal structure, 1-Cys SiPrx assembles into a ring-shaped decamer composed of five homodimers. This quaternary structure corresponds to the oligomeric state of the protein in solution, as observed by size-exclusion chromatography. 1-Cys SiPrx harbors only a single cysteine, which is the peroxidatic cysteine, and lacks both of the cysteines that are highly conserved in the C-terminal arm domain in other archaeal Prx6-subfamily proteins such as ApPrx and that are involved in the association of dimers into higher-molecular-weight decamers and dodecamers. It is thus concluded that the Sulfolobus Prx6-subfamily protein undergoes decamerization independently of arm-domain cysteines.",

    "abstract": "Tau proteins play an important role in the proper assembly and function of neurons. Hyperphosphorylation of tau by kinases such as tau tubulin kinase (TTBK) has been hypothesized to cause the aggregation of tau and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that lead to the destabilization of microtubules, thereby contributing to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are two TTBK isoforms with highly homologous catalytic sites but with distinct tissue distributions, tau phosphorylation patterns and loss-of-function effects. Inhibition of TTBK1 reduces the levels of NFT formation involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, whereas inhibition of TTBK2 may lead to the movement disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11). Hence, it is critical to obtain isoform-selective inhibitors. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) has been used to design highly potent and exquisitely selective inhibitors. While structures of TTBK1 have been reported in the literature, TTBK2 has evaded structural characterization. Here, the first crystal structure of the TTBK2 kinase domain is described. Furthermore, the crystal structure of human TTBK2 in complex with a small-molecule inhibitor has successfully been determined to elucidate the structural differences in protein conformations between the two TTBK isoforms that could aid in SBDD for the design of inhibitors that selectively target TTBK1 over TTBK2.",

Both crystal structures were solved; they contained three and six molecules per asymmetric unit and were refined to 1.7 and 2.25 Å resolution, respectively. To date, the structure of native cytochrome c6 from T. elongatus has only been reported as a monomer using NMR spectroscopy, i.e. without addressing putative oligomerization, and related structures have only previously been solved using X-ray crystallography after recombinant gene overexpression in Escherichia coli. The reported space groups of related cyanobacterial cytochrome c6 structures differ from those reported here. Interestingly, the protein-protein interfaces that were observed utilizing X-ray crystallography could also explain homo-oligomerization in solution; specifically, trimerization is indicated by infra-red dynamic light scattering and blue native gel electrophoresis in solution. Trimers were also detected by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, there is an indication of post-translational methylation in the crystal structure. Additionally, the possibility of modifying the crystal size and the redox activity in the context of photosynthesis is shaping the investigated cytochrome as a highly suitable model protein for advanced serial crystallography at highly brilliant X-ray free-electron laser sources.",

    "abstract": "The zinc hydrolase histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is unique among vertebrate deacetylases in that it contains two catalytic domains, designated CD1 and CD2. Both domains are fully functional as lysine deacetylases in vitro . However, the in vivo function of only the CD2 domain is well defined, whereas that of the CD1 domain is more enigmatic. Three X-ray crystal structures of HDAC6 CD1–inhibitor complexes are now reported to broaden the understanding of affinity determinants in the active site. Notably, cocrystallization with inhibitors was facilitated by using active-site mutants of zebrafish HDAC6 CD1. The first mutant studied, H82F/F202Y HDAC6 CD1, was designed to mimic the active site of human HDAC6 CD1. The structure of its complex with trichostatin A was generally identical to that with the wild-type zebrafish enzyme. The second mutant studied, K330L HDAC6 CD1, was prepared to mimic the active site of HDAC6 CD2. It has previously been demonstrated that this substitution does not perturb inhibitor binding conformations in HDAC6 CD1; here, this mutant facilitated cocrystallization with derivatives of the cancer chemotherapy drug suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). These crystal structures allow the mapping of inhibitor-binding regions in the outer active-site cleft, where one HDAC isozyme typically differs from another. It is expected that these structures will help to guide the structure-based design of inhibitors with selectivity against HDAC6 CD1, which in turn will enable new chemical biology approaches to probe its cellular function.",

The multistep biosynthesis pathway of Moco and its function in molybdenum-dependent enzymes are already well understood. The mechanisms of Moco transfer, storage and insertion, on the other hand, are not. In the cell, Moco is usually not found in its free form and remains bound to proteins because of its sensitivity to oxidation. The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii harbors a Moco carrier protein (MCP) that binds and protects Moco but is devoid of enzymatic function. It has been speculated that this MCP acts as a means of Moco storage and transport. Here, the search for potential MCPs has been extended to the prokaryotes, and many MCPs were found in cyanobacteria. A putative MCP from Rippkaea orientalis (RoMCP) was selected for recombinant production, crystallization and structure determination. RoMCP has a Rossmann-fold topology that is characteristic of nucleotide-binding proteins and a homotetrameric quaternary structure similar to that of the MCP from C. reinhardtii . In each protomer, a positively charged crevice was identified that accommodates up to three chloride ions, hinting at a potential Moco-binding site. Computational docking experiments supported this notion and gave an impression of the RoMCP–Moco complex.",

    "abstract": "SUMOylation is a post-translational modification in which a small ubiquitin-like molecule (SUMO) is appended to substrate proteins and is known to influence myriads of biological processes. A delicate interplay between several families of SUMOylation proteins and their substrates ensures the proper level of SUMOylation required for normal cell function. Among the SUMO proteins, SUMO2 is known to form mono-SUMOylated proteins and engage in poly-SUMO chain formation, while sentrin-specific protease 1 (SENP1) is a key enzyme in regulating both events. Determination of the SENP1–SUMO2 interaction is therefore necessary to better understand SUMOylation. In this regard, the current paper reports the noncovalent structure of SENP1 in complex with SUMO2, which was refined to a resolution of 2.62 Å with R and R free values of 22.92% and 27.66%, respectively. The structure shows that SENP1–SUMO2 complex formation is driven largely by polar interactions and limited hydrophobic contacts. The essential C-terminal motif (QQTGG) of SUMO2 is stabilized by a number of specific bonding interactions that enable it to protrude into the catalytic triad of SENP1 and provide the arrangement necessary for maturation of SUMO and deSUMOylation activity. Overall, the structure shows a number of structural details that pinpoint the basis of SENP1–SUMO2 complex formation.",

Both RpBphP2 and RpBphP3 are photosensory histidine kinases coupled to the same response regulator RPA3017.

To address these issues, neutron crystallographic studies were initiated on one experimentally engineered CBM derived from a xylanase, X-2 L110F, a protein that is able to bind several different plant carbohydrates such as xylan, β-glucan and xyloglucan. This protein evolved from a CBM present in xylanase Xyn10A of Rhodothermus marinus. The protein was complexed with a branched xyloglucan heptasaccharide. Large single crystals of hydrogenous protein (∼1.6 mm(3)) were grown at room temperature and subjected to H/D exchange.

Joint neutron and X-ray refinement using phenix.refine showed significant density for residues involved in carbohydrate binding and revealed the details of a hydrogen-bonded water network around the binding site.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infections pose a serious threat to human health. PA is a leading cause of fatal lung infections in cystic fibrosis and immune-suppressed patients, of sepsis in burn victims and of nosocomial infections. An important element in PA virulence is its ability to establish biofilms that evade suppression by the host's immune system and antibiotics. PstS, a periplasmic subunit of the Pst phosphate-transport system of PA, plays a critical role in the establishment of biofilms. In some drug-resistant PA strains, PstS is secreted in large quantities from the bacteria, where it participates in the assembly of adhesion fibres that enhance bacterial virulence. In order to understand the dual function of PstS in biofilm formation and phosphate transport, the crystal structure of PA PstS was determined. Here, the overexpression in Escherichia coli and purification of PA PstS in the presence of phosphate are described. Two crystal forms were obtained using the vapour-diffusion method at 20°C and X-ray diffraction data were collected. The first crystal form belonged to the centred orthorhombic space group C 222 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 67.5, b = 151.3, c = 108.9 Å. Assuming the presence of a dimer in the asymmetric unit gives a crystal volume per protein weight ( V M ) of 2.09 Å 3 Da −1 and a solvent content of 41%. The second crystal form belonged to the primitive orthorhombic space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 35.4, b = 148.3, c = 216.7 Å. Assuming the presence of a tetramer in the asymmetric unit gives a crystal volume per protein weight ( V M ) of 2.14 Å 3 Da −1 and a solvent content of 42.65%. A pseudo-translational symmetry is present in the P 2 1 2 1 2 1 crystal form which is consistent with a filamentous arrangement of PstS in the crystal lattice.",

Here, the crystal structure of the human RIG-I superfamily 2 ATPase domain crystallized in an unusually elongated and open conformation is reported.

    "abstract": "The L-arabinan utilization system of Geobacillus stearothermophilus T6 is composed of five transcriptional units that are clustered within a 38 kb DNA segment. One of the transcriptional units contains 11 genes, the last gene of which ( araN ) encodes a protein, Ara127N, that belongs to the newly established GH127 family. Ara127N shares 44% sequence identity with the recently characterized HypBA1 protein from Bifidobacterium longum and thus is likely to function similarly as a β-L-arabinofuranosidase. β-L-Arabinofuranosidases are enzymes that hydrolyze β-L-arabinofuranoside linkages, the less common form of such linkages, a unique enzymatic activity that has been identified only recently. The interest in the structure and mode of action of Ara127N therefore stems from its special catalytic activity as well as its membership of the new GH127 family, the structure and mechanism of which are only starting to be resolved. Ara127N has recently been cloned, overexpressed, purified and crystallized. Two suitable crystal forms have been obtained: one (CTP form) belongs to the monoclinic space group P 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 104.0, b = 131.2, c = 107.6 Å, β = 112.0°, and the other (RB form) belongs to the orthorhombic space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 65.5, b = 118.1, c = 175.0 Å. A complete X-ray diffraction data set has been collected to 2.3 Å resolution from flash-cooled crystals of the wild-type enzyme (RB form) at −173°C using synchrotron radiation. A selenomethionine derivative of Ara127N has also been prepared and crystallized for multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) experiments. Crystals of selenomethionine Ara127N appeared to be isomorphous to those of the wild type (CTP form) and enabled the measurement of a three-wavelength MAD diffraction data set at the selenium absorption edge. These data are currently being used for detailed three-dimensional structure determination of the Ara127N protein.",

    "abstract": "The inhibition of urate oxidase (UOX) by azide was investigated by X-ray diffraction techniques and compared with cyanide inhibition. Two well characterized sites for reagents are present in the enzyme: the dioxygen site and the substrate-binding site. To examine the selectivity of these sites towards azide inhibition, several crystallization conditions were developed. UOX was co-crystallized with azide (N3) in the presence or absence of either uric acid (UA, the natural substrate) or 8-azaxanthine (8AZA, a competitive inhibitor). In a second set of experiments, previously grown orthorhombic crystals of the UOX-UA or UOX-8AZA complexes were soaked in sodium azide solutions. In a third set of experiments, orthorhombic crystals of UOX with the exchangeable ligand 8-nitroxanthine (8NXN) were soaked in a solution containing uric acid and azide simultaneously (competitive soaking). In all assays, the soaking periods were either short (a few hours) or long (one or two months). These different experimental conditions showed that one or other of the sites, or the two sites together, could be inhibited. This also demonstrated that azide not only competes with dioxygen as cyanide does but also competes with the substrate for its enzymatic site. A model in agreement with experimental data would be an azide in equilibrium between two sites, kinetically in favour of the dioxygen site and thermodynamically in favour of the substrate-binding site.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial infections remain a serious health concern, in particular causing life-threatening infections of hospitalized and immunocompromised patients. The situation is exacerbated by the rise in antibacterial drug resistance, and new treatments are urgently sought. In this endeavour, accurate structures of molecular targets can support early-stage drug discovery. Here, crystal structures, in three distinct forms, of recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa β-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase II (FabF) are presented. This enzyme, which is involved in fatty-acid biosynthesis, has been validated by genetic and chemical means as an antibiotic target in Gram-positive bacteria and represents a potential target in Gram-negative bacteria. The structures of apo FabF, of a C164Q mutant in which the binding site is altered to resemble the substrate-bound state and of a complex with 3-(benzoylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid are reported. This compound mimics aspects of a known natural product inhibitor, platensimycin, and surprisingly was observed binding outside the active site, interacting with a symmetry-related molecule. An unusual feature is a completely buried potassium-binding site that was identified in all three structures. Comparisons suggest that this may represent a conserved structural feature of FabF relevant to fold stability. The new structures provide templates for structure-based ligand design and, together with the protocols and reagents, may underpin a target-based drug-discovery project for urgently needed antibacterials.",

Whilst both conditions are characterized by anaemia of variable severity, other details of their pathophysiology are different, in part owing to the greater stability of the β chains that is conferred through β self-association. In contrast, α subunits interact weakly, and in the absence of stabilizing quaternary interactions the α chain (α) is prone to haem loss and denaturation. The molecular contacts that confer weak self-association of α have not been determined previously. Here, the first structure of an α2 homodimer is reported in complex with one domain of the Hb receptor from Staphylococcus aureus. The α2 dimer interface has a highly unusual, approximately linear, arrangement of four His side chains within hydrogen-bonding distance of each other. Some interactions present in the α1β1 dimer interface of native Hb are preserved in the α2 dimer. However, a marked asymmetry is observed in the α2 interface, suggesting that steric factors limit the number of stabilizing interactions that can form simultaneously across the interface.",

The crystal structure of A. baumannii alanine racemase (Alr Aba ) from the highly antibiotic-resistant NCTC13302 strain has been solved to 1.9 Å resolution. Comparison of Alr Aba with alanine racemases from closely related bacteria demonstrates a conserved overall fold.

In the biosynthesis of plant polyketides, the construction of the carbocyclic scaffold is a key step in diversifying the polyketide structure. Olivetolic acid cyclase (OAC) from Cannabis sativa L. is the only known plant polyketide cyclase that catalyzes the C2-C7 intramolecular aldol cyclization of linear pentyl tetra-β-ketide-CoA to generate olivetolic acid in the biosynthesis of cannabinoids. The enzyme is also thought to belong to the dimeric α+β barrel (DABB) protein family. However, because of a lack of functional analysis of other plant DABB proteins and low sequence identity with the functionally distinct bacterial DABB proteins, the catalytic mechanism of OAC has remained unclear. To clarify the intimate catalytic mechanism of OAC, the enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffracted X-rays to 1.40 Å resolution and belonged to space group P3121 or P3221, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 47.3, c = 176.0 Å.

Expression of the NDK from Litopenaeus vannamei ( Lv NDK) is known to be regulated under viral infection. Also, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry, Lv NDK binds both purine and pyrimidine deoxynucleoside diphosphates with high binding affinity for dGDP and dADP and with no heat of binding interaction for dCDP [Quintero-Reyes et al.

In order to investigate the differences in selectivity, Lv NDK was crystallized as binary complexes with both acceptor (dADP and dCDP) and donor (ADP) phosphate-group nucleoside diphosphate substrates and their structures were determined. The three structures with purine or pyrimidine nucleotide ligands are all hexameric. Also, the binding of deoxy or ribonucleotides is similar, as in the former a water molecule replaces the hydrogen bond made by Lys11 to the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety. This allows Lys11 to maintain a catalytically favourable conformation independently of the kind of sugar found in the nucleotide. Because of this, shrimp NDK may phosphorylate nucleotide analogues to inhibit the viral infections that attack this organism.",

In order to clarify the structural mechanisms of the catalytic reaction with the cognate substrate D-3-hydroxybutyrate and of the inhibition of the reaction by inhibitors, the enzyme from Alcaligenes faecalis has been analyzed by X-ray crystallography in liganded states with the substrate and with two types of inhibitor: malonate and methylmalonate. In each subunit of the tetrameric enzyme, the substrate is trapped on the nicotinamide plane of the bound NAD + . An OMIT map definitively shows that the bound ligand is D-3-hydroxybutyrate and not acetoacetate. The two carboxylate O atoms form four hydrogen bonds to four conserved amino-acid residues. The methyl group is accommodated in the nearby hydrophobic pocket so that the formation of a hydrogen bond from the OH group of the substrate to the hydroxy group of Tyr155 at the active centre is facilitated. In this geometry, the H atom attached to the C 3 atom of the substrate in the sp 3 configuration is positioned at a distance of 3.1 Å from the nicotinamide C 4 atom in the direction normal to the plane. In addition, the donor–acceptor relationship of the hydrogen bonds suggests that the Tyr155 OH group is allowed to ionize by the two donations from the Ser142 OH group and the ribose OH group. A comparison of the protein structures with and without ligands indicates that the Gln196 residue of the small movable domain participates in the formation of additional hydrogen bonds. It is likely that this situation can facilitate H-atom movements as the trigger of the catalytic reaction. In the complexes with inhibitors, however, their principal carboxylate groups interact with the enzyme in a similar way, while the interactions of other groups are changed. The crucial determinant for inhibition is that the inhibitors have no active H atom at C 3 . A second determinant is the Tyr155 OH group, which is perturbed by the inhibitors to donate its H atom for hydrogen-bond formation, losing its nucleophilicity.",

Xyloglucan (XyG), which is the main hemicellulosic component of dicotyledonous plants, has attracted much attention for its role in plant development and for its many industrial applications. The XyG-specific fucosyltransferase (FUT1) adds a fucose residue from GDP-fucose to the 2-O position of the terminal galactosyl residues on XyG side chains. Recombinant FUT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana was crystallized in two different crystal forms, with the best diffracting crystals (up to 1.95 Å resolution) belonging to the monoclinic space group P 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 87.6, b = 84.5, c = 150.3 Å, β = 96.3°. Ab initio phases were determined using a two-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment on a tantalum bromide-derivatized crystal with data collected at the rising and descending inflection points of the Ta white line. An interpretable electron-density map was obtained after elaborate density modification. Model completion and structural analysis are currently under way.",

For this reason, AKAP18γ/δ presents an interesting drug target with therapeutic potential in cardiovascular disease. The crystal structure of the central domain of human AKAP18γ has been determined at the atomic resolution of 1.25 Å. This first structure of human AKAP18γ is trapped in a novel conformation by a malonate molecule bridging the important R-loop with the 2H phosphoesterase motif. Although the physiological substrate of AKAP18γ is currently unknown, a potential proton wire deep in the central binding crevice has been indentified, leading to bulk solvent below the R-loop. Malonate complexed with AKAP18γ at atomic resolution provides an excellent starting point for structure-guided drug design.",

The structural results are complemented with biophysical characterization using circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering. The data reveal the phosphoprotein to assemble into a stable tetramer, with the regions outside the oligomerization domain remaining highly flexible. A helix-breaking motif is observed between the α-helices at the midpoint of the oligomerization domain that appears to be conserved across the Bornaviridae .

Although the mechanism is unknown, a protective role of TLDc proteins against oxidative stress, notably in the brain, has been demonstrated. Neurobiological disorders caused by mutations in the TLDc domain have also been reported. The human NCOA7 gene encodes several mRNA isoforms; among these, isoform 4, named NCOA7-AS, is up-regulated by type 1 interferon in response to viral infection. NCOA7 and NCOA7-AS both interact with several subunits of the vacuolar proton pump V-ATPase, which leads to increased acidification of the endolysosomal system and consequently impairs infection by viruses that enter their host cells through the endosomal pathway, such as influenza A virus and hepatitis C virus. Similarly to full-length NCOA7, NCOA7-AS possesses a TLDc domain in its C-terminus. Structures of TLDc domains have been reported from zebrafish and fly but not from humans. Here, the expression, purification and crystallization of the TLDc domain from NCOA7 and NCOA7-AS is reported.

The combination of 3D structural techniques, seeking accuracy, has also been a feature of this research effort. Thus, SAXS, NMR and computational molecular dynamics have also been applied. The general framework is also a considerable chemistry research effort to understand the function of the enzyme and its medical pathologies in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). Mutational studies and their impact on the catalytic reaction provide insight into the basis of AIP and are also invaluable for guiding the understanding of the crystal structure results. Future directions for research on HMBS are described, including the need to determine the protonation states of key amino-acid residues identified as being catalytically important.

    "abstract": "Norovirus is a major causative pathogen of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis. Despite the sequence similarity among various strains, noroviruses of different genotypes show different antigenicities and different binding profiles to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). To reveal the relationships between the structure of the capsid and the diversity in antigenicity and the HBGA-binding profile, virus-like particles (VLPs) of the Chiba strain that belongs to genogroup I, genotype 4 were crystallized for X-ray structural analysis. Diffraction data were collected and processed at 3.2 Å resolution. The crystal belonged to space group I 222, with unit-cell parameters a = 290.0, b = 310.4 c = 350.4 Å. The possible packing model indicated that the diameter of the particle was 280 Å, which was much smaller than the 38 nm VLPs of Norovirus Norwalk strain (NV) with T = 3 icosahedral symmetry and composed of 180 VP1 proteins. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the VP1 pentamer of NV 38 nm VLPs as a search model, revealing that the VLPs were smaller particles: 23 nm VLPs with T = 1 icosahedral symmetry, the structure of which has not yet been analyzed at high resolution. The structure of 23 nm VLPs will enable the two different VLPs of Norovirus to be compared, which will provide important information for understanding the structural basis of capsid formation.",

    "abstract": "A wide variety of crystallization solutions are screened to establish conditions that promote the growth of a diffraction-quality crystal. Screening these conditions requires the assessment of many crystallization plates for the presence of crystals. Automated systems for screening and imaging are very expensive. A simple approach to imaging trace fluorescently labeled protein crystals in crystallization plates has been devised, and can be implemented at a cost as low as $50. The proteins β-lactoglobulin B, trypsin and purified concanavalin A (ConA) were trace fluorescently labeled using three different fluorescent probes: Cascade Yellow (CY), Carboxyrhodamine 6G (CR) and Pacific Blue (PB). A crystallization screening plate was set up using β-lactoglobulin B labeled with CR, trypsin labeled with CY, ConA labeled with each probe, and a mixture consisting of 50% PB-labeled ConA and 50% CR-labeled ConA. The wells of these plates were imaged using a commercially available macro-imaging lens attachment for smart devices that have a camera. Several types of macro lens attachments were tested with smartphones and tablets. Images with the highest quality were obtained with an iPhone 6S and an AUKEY Ora 10× macro lens. Depending upon the fluorescent probe employed and its Stokes shift, a light-emitting diode or a laser diode was used for excitation. An emission filter was used for the imaging of protein crystals labeled with CR and crystals with two-color fluorescence. This approach can also be used with microscopy systems commonly used to observe crystallization plates.",

The results of standard protein BLAST suggest that the FN3 repeats might contribute to collagen α1 type XX acting as a cytokine receptor. To date, solution NMR structures of the FN#3, FN#4 and FN#6 domains have been determined. To obtain further structural evidence to understand the relationship between the structure and function of the FN3 repeats from collagen α1 type XX, the crystal structure of the FN#2 domain from human collagen α1 type XX (residues Pro386–Pro466; referred to as FN2-HCXX) was solved at 2.5 Å resolution. The crystal structure of FN2-HCXX shows an immunoglobulin-like fold containing a β-sandwich structure, which is formed by a three-stranded β-sheet (β1, β2 and β5) packed onto a four-stranded β-sheet (β3, β4, β6 and β7). Two consensus domains, tencon and fibcon, are structural analogues of FN2-HCXX. Fn8, an FN3 domain from human oncofoetal fibronectin, is the closest structural analogue of FN2-HCXX derived from a naturally occurring sequence. Based solely on the structural similarity of FN2-HCXX to other FN3 domains, the detailed functions of FN2-HCXX and the FN3 repeats in collagen α1 type XX cannot be identified.",

    "abstract": "Human syncytial respiratory virus is a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus with serious implications for respiratory disease in infants, and has recently been reclassified into a new family, Pneumoviridae. One of the main reasons for this classification is the unique presence of a transcriptional antiterminator, called M2-1. The puzzling mechanism of action of M2-1, which is a rarity among antiterminators in viruses and is part of the RNA polymerase complex, relies on dissecting the structure and function of this multidomain tetramer. The RNA-binding activity is located in a monomeric globular `core' domain, a high-resolution crystal structure of which is now presented. The structure reveals a compact domain which is superimposable on the full-length M2-1 tetramer, with additional electron density for the C-terminal tail that was not observed in the previous models. Moreover, its folding stability was determined through chemical denaturation, which shows that the secondary and tertiary structure unfold concomitantly, which is indicative of a two-state equilibrium. These results constitute a further step in the understanding of this unique RNA-binding domain, for which there is no sequence or structural counterpart outside this virus family, in addition to its implications in transcription regulation and its likeliness as an antiviral target.",

    "abstract": "Thioredoxins are small ubiquitous proteins that participate in a diverse variety of redox reactions via the reversible oxidation of two cysteine thiol groups in a structurally conserved active site. Here, the NMR solution structures of a reduced and oxidized thioredoxin from Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Ec-Trx, ECH_0218), the etiological agent responsible for human monocytic ehrlichiosis, are described. The overall topology of the calculated structures is similar in both redox states and is similar to those of other thioredoxins: a five-stranded, mixed β-sheet (β1-β3-β2-β4-β5) surrounded by four α-helices. Unlike other thioredoxins studied by NMR in both redox states, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of reduced Ec-Trx was missing eight additional amide cross peaks relative to the spectrum of oxidized Ec-Trx. These missing amides correspond to residues Cys35-Glu39 in the active-site-containing helix (α2) and Ser72-Ile75 in a loop near the active site, and suggest a change in backbone dynamics on the millisecond-to-microsecond timescale associated with the breakage of an intramolecular Cys32-Cys35 disulfide bond in a thioredoxin. A consequence of the missing amide resonances is the absence of observable or unambiguous NOEs to provide the distance restraints necessary to define the N-terminal end of the α-helix containing the CPGC active site in the reduced state. This region adopts a well defined α-helical structure in other reported reduced thioredoxin structures, is mostly helical in oxidized Ec-Trx and CD studies of Ec-Trx in both redox states suggests there is no significant difference in the secondary structure of the protein. The NMR solution structure of reduced Ec-Trx illustrates that the absence of canonical structure in a region of a protein may be owing to unfavorable dynamics prohibiting NOE observations or unambiguous NOE assignments.",

Two different ligands were bound in the protein structure: pyrophosphate in the active site of one monomer and dTDP in the other monomer.

A greater understanding of this antibiotic-resistant bacterium, particularly with respect to how it interacts with the host, is required for the development of novel strategies for fighting C. difficile infections. The surface layer (S-layer) of C. difficile is likely to be of significant importance to host–pathogen interactions. The mature S-layer is formed by a proteinaceous array consisting of multiple copies of a high-molecular-weight and a low-molecular-weight S-layer protein. These components result from the cleavage of SlpA by Cwp84, a cysteine protease. The structure of a truncated Cwp84 active-site mutant has recently been reported and the key features have been identified, providing the first structural insights into the role of Cwp84 in the formation of the S-layer. Here, two structures of Cwp84 after propeptide cleavage are presented and the three conformational changes that are observed are discussed.

An anion of interest is cyanate, for which contrasting binding modes have been reported in the literature. Previous spectroscopic data have shown cyanate behaving as an inhibitor, directly binding to the zinc, in contrast to previous crystallographic data that implied that cyanate acts as a substrate mimic that is not directly bound to the zinc but overlaps with the binding site of the substrate CO2. Wild-type and the V207I variant of CA II have been expressed and X-ray crystal structures of their cyanate complexes have been determined to 1.7 and 1.5 Å resolution, respectively. The rationale for the V207I CA II variant was its close proximity to the CO2-binding site. Both structures clearly show that the cyanate binds directly to the zinc. In addition, inhibition constants (∼40 µM) were measured using (18)O-exchange mass spectrometry for wild-type and V207I CA II and were similar to those determined previously (Supuran et al., 1997). Hence, it is concluded that under the conditions of these experiments the binding of cyanate to CA II is directly to the zinc, displacing the zinc-bound solvent molecule, and not in a site that overlaps with the CO2 substrate-binding site.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus infections are becoming increasingly difficult to treat as they rapidly develop resistance to existing antibiotics. Bacterial type I signal peptidases are membrane-associated, cell-surface serine proteases with a unique catalytic mechanism that differs from that of eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidases. They are thus potential antimicrobial targets. S. aureus has a catalytically active type I signal peptidase, SpsB, that is essential for cell viability. To elucidate its structure, the spsB gene from S. aureus Newman strain was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. After exploring many different protein-modification constructs, SpsB was expressed as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein and crystallized by hanging-drop vapour diffusion. The crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group P2(1) and diffracted to 2.05 Å resolution. The crystal structure of SpsB is anticipated to provide structural insight into Gram-positive signal peptidases and to aid in the development of antibacterial agents that target type I signal peptidases.",

    "abstract": "Protozoa of the genus Plasmodium are responsible for malaria, which is perhaps the most important parasitic disease to infect mankind. The emergence of Plasmodium strains resistant to current therapeutics and prophylactics makes the development of new treatment strategies urgent. Among the potential targets for new antimalarial drugs is the BolA-like protein PFE0790c from Plasmodium falciparum (Pf-BolA). While the function of BolA is unknown, it has been linked to cell morphology by regulating transcription in response to stress. Using an NMR-based method, an ensemble of 20 structures of Pf-BolA was determined and deposited in the PDB (PDB entry 2kdn). The overall topology of the Pf-BolA structure, α1-β1-β2-η1-α2/η2-β3-α3, with the β-strands forming a mixed β-sheet, is similar to the fold observed in other BolA structures. A helix-turn-helix motif similar to the class II KH fold associated with nucleic acid-binding proteins is present, but contains an FXGXXXL signature sequence that differs from the GXXG signature sequence present in class II KH folds, suggesting that the BolA family of proteins may use a novel protein-nucleic acid interface. A well conserved arginine residue, Arg50, hypothesized to play a role in governing the formation of the C-terminal α-helix in the BolA family of proteins, is too distant to form polar contacts with any side chains in this α-helix in Pf-BolA, suggesting that this conserved arginine may only serve a role in guiding the orientation of this C-terminal helix in some BolA proteins. A survey of BolA structures suggests that the C-terminal helix may not have a functional role and that the third helix (α2/η2) has a `kink' that appears to be conserved among the BolA protein structures. Circular dichroism spectroscopy shows that Pf-BolA is fairly robust, partially unfolding when heated to 353 K and refolding upon cooling to 298 K.",

    "abstract": "Influenza viruses remain a persistent challenge to human health owing to their inherent ability to evade the immune response by antigenic drift. However, the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against divergent viruses has sparked renewed interest in a universal influenza vaccine and novel therapeutic opportunities. Here, a crystal structure at 1.70 Å resolution is presented of the Fab of the human antibody CH65, which has broad neutralizing activity against a range of seasonal H1 isolates. Previous studies proposed that affinity maturation of this antibody lineage pre-organizes the complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops into an energetically favorable HA-bound conformation. Indeed, from the structural comparisons of free and HA-bound CH65 presented here, the CDR loops, and in particular the heavy-chain CDR3, adopt the same conformations in the free and bound forms. Thus, these findings support the notion that affinity maturation of the CH65 lineage favorably preconfigures the CDR loops for high-affinity binding to influenza hemagglutinin.",

    "abstract": "Inorganic phosphate is an essential molecule for all known life. Organisms have developed many mechanisms to ensure an adequate supply, even in low-phosphate conditions. In prokaryotes phosphate transport is instigated by the phosphate-binding protein (PBP), the initial receptor for the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) phosphate transporter. In the crystal structure of the PBP-phosphate complex, the phosphate is completely desolvated and sequestered in a deep cleft and is bound by 13 hydrogen bonds: 12 to protein NH and OH donor groups and one to a carboxylate acceptor group. The carboxylate plays a key recognition role by accepting a phosphate hydrogen. PBP phosphate affinity is relatively consistent across a broad pH range, indicating the capacity to bind monobasic (H2PO4-) and dibasic (HPO4(2-)) phosphate; however, the mechanism by which it might accommodate the second hydrogen of monobasic phosphate is unclear. To answer this question, neutron diffraction studies were initiated. Large single crystals with a volume of 8 mm3 were grown and subjected to hydrogen/deuterium exchange. A 2.5 Å resolution data set was collected on the Protein Crystallography Station at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center. Initial refinement of the neutron data shows significant nuclear density, and refinement is ongoing. This is the first report of a neutron study from this superfamily.",

This enzyme is a very unusual dioxygenase in that it cleaves a C—C bond in a substituent of the aromatic ring rather than within the ring itself. Whilst it has been shown that DAD is a tetramer in solution, the recently solved crystal structure of the Alcaligenes sp. 4HAP enzyme was in fact dimeric rather than tetrameric. Since the use of limited chymotrypsinolysis, which apparently results in removal of the first 20 or so N-terminal residues of DAD, was necessary for crystallization of the protein, it was investigated whether this was responsible for the change in its oligomerization state. Gel-filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation studies were conducted, which confirmed that chymotrypsinolysed DAD has an apparent molecular weight of around 40 kDa, corresponding to a dimer. In contrast, the native enzyme has a molecular weight in the 70–80 kDa region, as expected for the tetramer. The structural basis for tetramerization has been investigated by the use of several docking servers, and the results are remarkably consistent with the tetrameric structure of a homologous cupin protein from Ralstonia eutropha (PDB entry 3ebr).",

    "abstract": "Hemihedral twinning is a crystal-growth anomaly in which a specimen is composed of two crystal domains that coincide with each other in three dimensions. However, the orientations of the crystal lattices in the two domains differ in a specific way. In diffraction data collected from hemihedrally twinned crystals, each observed intensity contains contributions from both of the domains. With perfect hemihedral twinning, the two domains have the same volumes and the observed intensities do not contain sufficient information to detwin the data. Here, the use of molecular replacement and of noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging to detwin a 2.1 Å resolution data set for Aichi virus 1 affected by perfect hemihedral twinning is described. The NCS averaging enabled the correction of errors in the detwinning introduced by the differences between the molecular-replacement model and the crystallized structure. The procedure permitted the structure to be determined from a molecular-replacement model that had 16% sequence identity and a 1.6 Å r.m.s.d. for C α atoms in comparison to the crystallized structure. The same approach could be used to solve other data sets affected by perfect hemihedral twinning from crystals with NCS.",

    "abstract": "Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR; EC 1.6.5.4) is a key enzyme in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification system of plants. The participation of MDHAR in ascorbate (AsA) recycling in the ascorbate–glutathione cycle is important in the acquired tolerance of crop plants to abiotic environmental stresses. Thus, MDHAR represents a strategic target protein for the improvement of crop yields. Although physiological studies have intensively characterized MDHAR, a structure-based functional analysis is not available. Here, a cytosolic MDHAR (OsMDHAR) derived from Oryza sativa L. japonica was expressed using Escherichia coli strain NiCo21 (DE3) and purified. The purified OsMDHAR showed specific enzyme activity (approximately 380 U per milligram of protein) and was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at pH 8.0 and 298 K. The crystal diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution and contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit (the Matthews coefficient V M is 1.98 Å 3 Da −1 , corresponding to a solvent content of 38.06%) in space group P 4 1 2 1 2 with unit-cell parameters a = b = 81.89, c = 120.4 Å.

While some glycoside hydrolase families have been exhaustively described, others remain poorly characterized, especially with regard to structural information. The family 43 glycoside hydrolases are a diverse group of inverting enzymes; the available structure information on these enzymes is mainly from xylosidases and arabinofuranosidase. Currently, only one structure of an exo-β-1,3-galactanase is available. Here, the production, crystallization and structure determination of a putative exo-β-1,3-galactanase from Bifidobacterium bifidum S17 ( Bb Gal43A) are described. Bb Gal43A was successfully produced and showed activity towards synthetic galactosides. Bb Gal43A was subsequently crystallized and data were collected to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows a single-domain molecule, differing from known homologues, and crystal contact analysis predicts the formation of a dimer in solution. Further biochemical studies are necessary to elucidate the differences between Bb Gal43A and its characterized homologues.",

    "abstract": "Cells respond to various proteotoxic stimuli and maintain protein homeostasis through a conserved mechanism called the heat-shock response, which is characterized by the enhanced synthesis of heat-shock proteins. This response is mediated by heat-shock factors (HSFs). Four genes encoding HSF1–HSF4 exist in the genome of mammals. In this protein family, HSF1 is the orthologue of the single HSF in lower eukaryotic organisms and is the major regulator of the heat-shock response, while HSF2, which shows low sequence homology to HSF1, serves as a developmental regulator. Increasing evidence has revealed biochemical properties and functional roles that are unique to HSF2, such as its DNA-binding preference and sumoylation patterns, which are distinct from those of HSF1. The structural basis for such differences, however, is poorly understood owing to the lack of available mammalian HSF structures. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) is the most conserved functional module and is the only crystallizable domain in HSFs. To date, only HSF1 homologue structures from yeast and fruit fly have been determined. Along with extensive studies of the HSF family, more structural information, particularly from members with a remoter phylogenic relationship to the reported structures, e.g. HSF2, is needed in order to better understand the detailed mechanisms of HSF biology. In this work, the recombinant DBD (residues 7–112) from human HSF2 was produced in Escherichia coli and crystallized. An X-ray diffraction data set was collected to 1.32 Å resolution from a crystal belonging to space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 with unit cell-parameters a = 65.66, b = 67.26, c = 93.25 Å. The data-evaluation statistics revealed good quality of the collected data, thus establishing a solid basis for the determination of the first structure at atomic resolution in this protein family.",

In the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis, ketopantoate reductase (KPR), which catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of 2-oxopantoate, is a target of feedback inhibition by CoA. The crystal structure of KPR from T. kodakarensis (Tk-KPR) complexed with CoA and 2-oxopantoate has previously been reported. The structure provided an explanation for the competitive inhibition mechanism. Here, further biochemical analyses of Tk-KPR and the crystal structure of Tk-KPR in complex with NADP(+) are reported. A mutational analysis implies that the residues in the binding pocket cooperatively contribute to the recognition of CoA. The structure reveals the same dimer architecture as the Tk-KPR-CoA-2-oxopantoate complex. Moreover, the positions of the residues involved in the dimer interaction are not changed by the binding of CoA and 2-oxopantoate, suggesting individual conformational changes of Tk-KPR monomers.",

Several dehydration methods have been developed, but no single one of them is suitable for all crystals. Here, a new convenient and effective dehydration method is reported that makes use of a dehydrating solution that will not dry out in air for several hours.

Its specific role in the anthracycline biosynthetic pathway involves the synthesis of the seven-carbon acetal moiety attached to C4 of L-daunosamine observed in the anthracycline baumycin. Here, X-ray crystallography was used to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of DnmZ. Two crystal structures of DnmZ were yielded: that of the enzyme alone, solved to 3.00 Å resolution, and that of the enzyme in complex with thymidine diphosphate, the nucleotide carrier portion of the substrate, solved to 2.74 Å resolution. These models add insights into the structural features involved in substrate specificity and conformational changes involved in thymidine diphosphate binding by the nitrososynthases.",

In the ground state a tightly bound chloride ion occupies the primary chloride-binding site (CBS I) close to the protonated Schiff base that links the retinal chromophore to the protein. The light-triggered trans – cis isomerization of retinal causes structural changes in the protein associated with movement of the chloride ion. In reverse, chemical depletion of CBS I in Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin ( Np HR) through deprotonation of the Schiff base results in conformational changes of the protein: a state thought to mimic late stages of the photocycle. Here, crystals of Halobacterium salinarum halorhodopsin ( Hs HR) were soaked at high pH to provoke deprotonation of the Schiff base and loss of chloride. The crystals changed colour from purple to yellow and the occupancy of CBS I was reduced from 1 to about 0.5. In contrast to Np HR, this chloride depletion did not cause substantial conformational changes in the protein. Nevertheless, two observations indicate that chloride depletion could eventually result in structural changes similar to those found in Np HR. Firstly, the partially chloride-depleted form of Hs HR has increased normalized B factors in the region of helix C that is close to CBS I and changes its conformation in Np HR. Secondly, prolonged soaking of Hs HR crystals at high pH resulted in loss of diffraction. In conclusion, the conformation of the chloride-free protein may not be compatible with this crystal form of Hs HR despite a packing arrangement that hardly restrains helices E and F that presumably move during ion transport.",

Although the chimeric fusion protein SETMAR is no longer active as a transposase, it contains both the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and catalytic domain of the Hsmar1 transposase. The amino-acid sequence of the DBD has been virtually unchanged in 50 million years and, as a consequence, SETMAR retains its sequence-specific binding to the ancestral Hsmar1 terminal inverted repeat (TIR) sequence. Thus, the DNA-binding activity of SETMAR is likely to have an important biological function. To determine the structural basis for the recognition of TIR DNA by SETMAR, the design of TIR-containing oligonucleotides and SETMAR DBD variants, crystallization of DBD–DNA complexes, phasing strategies and initial phasing experiments are reported here. An unexpected finding was that oligonucleotides containing two BrdUs in place of thymidines produced better quality crystals in complex with SETMAR than their natural counterparts.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial transcription factor IclR (isocitrate lyase regulator) is a member of a one-component signal transduction system, which shares the common motif of a helix-turn-helix (HTH)-type DNA-binding domain (DBD) connected to a substrate-binding domain (SBD). Here, the crystal structure of an IclR homologue (Mi-IclR) from Microbacterium sp. strain HM58-2, which catabolizes acylhydrazide as the sole carbon source, is reported. Mi-IclR is expected to regulate an operon responsible for acylhydrazide degradation as an initial step. Native single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) experiments were performed in combination with molecular replacement. CRANK2 from the CCP4 suite successfully phased and modelled the complete structure of a homotetramer composed of 1000 residues in an asymmetric unit, and the model was refined to 2.1 Å resolution. The overall structure of Mi-IclR shared the same domain combination as other known IclR structures, but the relative geometry between the DBD and SBD differs. Accordingly, the geometry of the Mi-IclR tetramer was unique: the putative substrate-binding site in each subunit is accessible from the outside of the tetramer, as opposed to buried inside as in the previously known IclR structures. These differences in the domain geometry may contribute to the transcriptional regulation of IclRs.",

    "abstract": "Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) catalyzes a three-step reaction in the citric acid cycle with succinyl-phosphate proposed as a catalytic intermediate. However, there are no structural data to show the binding of succinyl-phosphate to SCS. Recently, the catalytic mechanism underlying acetyl-CoA production by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) has been debated. The enzyme belongs to the family of acyl-CoA synthetases (nucleoside diphosphate-forming) for which SCS is the prototype. It was postulated that the amino-terminal portion catalyzes the full reaction and the carboxy-terminal portion plays only an allosteric role. This interpretation was based on the partial loss of the catalytic activity of ACLY when Glu599 was mutated to Gln or Ala, and on the interpretation that the phospho-citryl-CoA intermediate was trapped in the 2.85 Å resolution structure from cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). To better resolve the structure of the intermediate bound to the E599Q mutant, the equivalent mutation, E105αQ, was made in human GTP-specific SCS. The structure of the E105αQ mutant shows succinyl-phosphate bound to the enzyme at 1.58 Å resolution when the mutant, after phosphorylation in solution by Mg 2+ -ATP, was crystallized in the presence of magnesium ions, succinate and desulfo-CoA. The E105αQ mutant is still active but has a specific activity that is 120-fold less than that of the wild-type enzyme, with apparent Michaelis constants for succinate and CoA that are 50-fold and 11-fold higher, respectively. Based on this high-resolution structure, the cryo-EM maps of the E599Q ACLY complex reported previously should have revealed the binding of citryl-phosphate and CoA and not phospho-citryl-CoA.",

    "abstract": "Methanobactins (MBs) are ribosomally produced and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that are used by methanotrophs for copper acquisition. The signature post-translational modification of MBs is the formation of two heterocyclic groups, either an oxazolone, pyrazinedione or imidazolone group, with an associated thioamide from an X -Cys dipeptide. The precursor peptide (MbnA) for MB formation is found in a gene cluster of MB-associated genes. The exact biosynthetic pathway of MB formation is not yet fully understood, and there are still uncharacterized proteins in some MB gene clusters, particularly those that produce pyrazinedione or imidazolone rings. One such protein is MbnF, which is proposed to be a flavin monooxygenase (FMO) based on homology. To help to elucidate its possible function, MbnF from Methylocystis sp. strain SB2 was recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli and its X-ray crystal structure was resolved to 2.6 Å resolution. Based on its structural features, MbnF appears to be a type A FMO, most of which catalyze hydroxylation reactions. Preliminary functional characterization shows that MbnF preferentially oxidizes NADPH over NADH, supporting NAD(P)H-mediated flavin reduction, which is the initial step in the reaction cycle of several type A FMO enzymes. It is also shown that MbnF binds the precursor peptide for MB, with subsequent loss of the leader peptide sequence as well as the last three C-terminal amino acids, suggesting that MbnF might be needed for this process to occur. Finally, molecular-dynamics simulations revealed a channel in MbnF that is capable of accommodating the core MbnA fragment minus the three C-terminal amino acids.",

In this study, the use of a fusion-protein approach with T4 lysozyme (T4L) to determine the structure of this hitherto noncrystallizable enzyme by X-ray crystallography is described. A set of four different hmARC-T4L fusion proteins were designed. Two of them contained either an N-terminal or a C-terminal T4L moiety fused to hmARC, while the other two contained T4L as an internal fusion partner tethered to the hmARC enzyme between two predicted secondary-structure elements. One of these internal fusion constructs could be expressed and crystallized successfully. The hmARC-T4L crystals diffracted to 1.7 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation and belonged to space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Initial attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement using T4L did not result in electron-density distributions that were sufficient for model building and interpretation of the hmARC moiety. However, this study emphasizes the utility of the T4L fusion-protein approach, which can be used for the crystallization and structure determination of membrane-bound proteins as well as soluble proteins.",

Many, if not most, of the stained protein crystals retained the dyes almost indefinitely when placed in large volumes of dye-free mother liquor. Dialysis experiments showed that most of the dyes that were retained in crystals also bound to the protein when free in solution; less frequently, some dyes bound only in the crystal. The experiments indicated a strong association of the dyes with the proteins. Four protein crystals were investigated by X-ray diffraction to ascertain the mode of binding. These were crystals of lysozyme, thaumatin, trypsin inhibited with benzamidine and satellite tobacco mosaic virus. In 30 X-ray analyses of protein crystal–dye complexes, in only three difference Fourier maps was any difference electron density present that was consistent with the binding of dye molecules, and even in these three cases (thaumatin plus thioflavin T, xylene cyanol and m -cresol purple) the amount of dye observed was inadequate to explain the intense color of the crystals. It was concluded that the dye molecules, which are clearly inside the crystals, are disordered but are paradoxically tightly bound to the protein. It is speculated that the dyes, which exhibit large hydrophobic cores and peripheral charged groups, may interact with the crystalline proteins in the manner of conventional detergents.",

    "abstract": "Biological samples are radiation-sensitive and require imaging under low-dose conditions to minimize damage. As a result, images contain a high level of noise and exhibit signal-to-noise ratios that are typically significantly smaller than 1. Averaging techniques, either implicit or explicit, are used to overcome the limitations imposed by the high level of noise. Averaging of 2D images showing the same molecule in the same orientation results in highly significant projections. A high-resolution structure can be obtained by combining the information from many single-particle images to determine a 3D structure. Similarly, averaging of multiple copies of macromolecular assembly subvolumes extracted from tomographic reconstructions can lead to a virtually noise-free high-resolution structure. Cross-correlation methods are often used in the alignment and classification steps of averaging processes for both 2D images and 3D volumes. However, the high noise level can bias alignment and certain classification results. While other approaches may be implicitly affected, sensitivity to noise is most apparent in multireference alignments, 3D reference-based projection alignments and projection-based volume alignments. Here, the influence of the image signal-to-noise ratio on the value of the cross-correlation coefficient is analyzed and a method for compensating for this effect is provided.",

This is demonstrated here for four unique domains of a 1.5 MDa calcium-dependent adhesion protein using the anomalous diffraction of the chelated calcium ions. In all cases, low anomalous multiplicity X-ray data were collected on a home-source diffractometer equipped with a chromium rotating anode (λ = 2.2909 Å). In all but one case, calcium SAD phasing alone was sufficient to allow automated model building and refinement of the protein model after the calcium substructure had been determined.

Central to the capacity of T. pallidum to establish infection is the ability of the pathogen to attach to a diversity of host cells. Many pathogenic bacteria employ leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain-containing proteins to mediate protein-protein interactions, including attachment to host components and establishment of infection. Intriguingly, T. pallidum expresses only one putative LRR domain-containing protein (Tp0225) with an unknown function. In an effort to ascribe a function to Tp0225, a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis was first performed; this investigation revealed that Tp0225 clusters with the pathogenic clade of treponemes. Its crystal structure was then determined to 2.0 Å resolution using Pt SAD phasing, which revealed a noncanonical architecture containing a hexameric LRR core with a discontinuous β-sheet bridged by solvent molecules. Furthermore, a surface-exposed, hydrophobic pocket, which was found in Tp0225 but is largely absent in canonical LRR domains from other pathogenic bacteria, may serve to coordinate a hydrophobic ligand. Overall, this study provides the first structural characterization of the sole LRR domain-containing protein from T. pallidum and offers insight into the unique molecular landscape of this important human pathogen.",

Upon binding TO1-biotin, the i Mango-III aptamer achieves the largest fluorescence enhancement reported for turn-on aptamers (over 5000-fold). This aptamer was generated by structure-guided engineering and functional reselection of the parental aptamer Mango-III. Structures of both Mango-III and i Mango-III have previously been determined by conventional cryocrystallography using synchrotron X-radiation. Using an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL), the room-temperature i Mango-III–TO1-biotin co-crystal structure has now been determined at 3.0 Å resolution. This structural model, which was refined against a data set of ∼1300 diffraction images (each from a single crystal), is largely consistent with the structures determined from single-crystal data sets collected at 100 K. This constitutes a technical benchmark on the way to XFEL pump–probe experiments on fluorescent RNA–small molecule complexes.",

One of its advantages is the significant reduction in radiation damage, which is especially useful in synchrotron experiments. Another advantage is that cryopreservation provides simple storage of crystals and easy transportation to a synchrotron. However, this technique sometimes results in the undesirable adhesion of frost to mounted crystals. The frost produces noisy diffraction images and reduces the optical visibility of crystals, which is crucial for aligning the crystal position with the incident X-ray position. To resolve these issues, a computer-controlled device has been developed that drizzles liquid nitrogen over a crystal to remove frost. It was confirmed that the device works properly, reduces noise from ice rings in diffraction images and enables the centering of crystals with low visibility owing to frost adhesion.",

    "abstract": "A novel member of the family 3 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM3s) is encoded by a gene (Cthe_0271) in Clostridium thermocellum which is the most highly expressed gene in the bacterium during its growth on several types of biomass substrates. Surprisingly, CtCBM3-0271 binds to at least two different types of xylan, instead of the common binding of CBM3s to cellulosic substrates. CtCBM3-0271 was crystallized and its three-dimensional structure was solved and refined to a resolution of 1.8 Å. In order to learn more about the role of this type of CBM3, a comparative study with its orthologue from Clostridium clariflavum (encoded by the Clocl_1192 gene) was performed, and the three-dimensional structure of CcCBM3-1192 was determined to 1.6 Å resolution. Carbohydrate binding by CcCBM3-1192 was found to be similar to that by CtCBM3-0271; both exhibited binding to xylan rather than to cellulose. Comparative structural analysis of the two CBM3s provided a clear functional correlation of structure and binding, in which the two CBM3s lack the required number of binding residues in their cellulose-binding strips and thus lack cellulose-binding capabilities. This is an enigma, as CtCBM3-0271 was reported to be a highly expressed protein when the bacterium was grown on cellulose. An additional unexpected finding was that CcCBM3-1192 does not contain the calcium ion that was considered to play a structural stabilizing role in the CBM3 family. Despite the lack of calcium, the five residues that form the calcium-binding site are conserved. The absence of calcium results in conformational changes in two loops of the CcCBM3-1192 structure. In this context, superposition of the non-calcium-binding CcCBM3-1192 with CtCBM3-0271 and other calcium-binding CBM3s reveals a much broader two-loop region in the former compared with CtCBM3-0271.",

    "abstract": "Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) utilizing anomalous signal from native S atoms, or other atoms with Z ≤ 20, generally requires highly redundant data collected using relatively long-wavelength X-rays. Here, the results from two proteins are presented where the anomalous signal from serendipitously acquired surface-bound Ca atoms with an anomalous data multiplicity of around 10 was utilized to drive de novo structure determination. In both cases, the Ca atoms were acquired from the crystallization solution, and the data-collection strategy was not optimized to exploit the anomalous signal from these scatterers. The X-ray data were collected at 0.98 Å wavelength in one case and at 1.74 Å in the other (the wavelength was optimized for sulfur, but the anomalous signal from calcium was exploited for structure solution). Similarly, using a test case, it is shown that data collected at ∼1.0 Å wavelength, where the f'' value for sulfur is 0.28 e, are sufficient for structure determination using intrinsic S atoms from a strongly diffracting crystal. Interestingly, it was also observed that SHELXD was capable of generating a substructure solution from high-exposure data with a completeness of 70% for low-resolution reflections extending to 3.5 Å resolution with relatively low anomalous multiplicity. Considering the fact that many crystallization conditions contain anomalous scatterers such as Cl, Ca, Mn etc., checking for the presence of fortuitous anomalous signal in data from well diffracting crystals could prove useful in either determining the structure de novo or in accurately assigning surface-bound atoms.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a leading cause of disease in dogs, and zoonosis causes human infections. Methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius strains are emerging, resembling the global health threat of S. aureus . Therefore, it is increasingly important to characterize potential targets for intervention against S. pseudintermedius . Here, FhuD, an S. pseudintermedius surface lipoprotein implicated in iron uptake, was characterized. It was found that FhuD bound ferrichrome in an iron-dependent manner, which increased the thermostability of FhuD by &gt;15°C. The crystal structure of ferrichrome-free FhuD was determined via molecular replacement at 1.6 Å resolution. FhuD exhibits the class III solute-binding protein (SBP) fold, with a ligand-binding cavity between the N- and C-terminal lobes, which is here occupied by a PEG molecule. The two lobes of FhuD were oriented in a closed conformation. These results provide the first detailed structural characterization of FhuD, a potential therapeutic target of S. pseudintermedius .",

In these junctions, β-catenin binds to cadherins and to the N-terminal domain of α-catenin, which in turn binds to actin filaments via its C-terminal domain. The middle (M) domain of α-catenin plays an important role in responding to mechanical tension. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains α- and β-catenin homologues called HMP-1 and HMP-2, respectively, but HMP-1 behaves differently from its mammalian homologue. Thus, structural and biochemical studies of HMP-1 have been initiated to understand the mechanism of HMP-1 and the evolution of α-catenin. The N-terminal domain of HMP-1 in complex with the minimal HMP-1-binding region of HMP-2 was purified and crystallized.

In addition to architectural roles, some NAPs also play regulatory roles in DNA replication and repair, and act as global transcriptional regulators in many bacteria. Bacteria encode multiple NAPs and some of them are even essential for survival. Streptococcus mutans , a dental pathogen, encodes one such essential NAP called histone-like protein (HLP). Here, the three-dimensional structure of S. mutans HLP has been determined to 1.9 Å resolution. The HLP structure is a dimer and shares a high degree of similarity with other bacterial NAPs, including HU.

In a previous study, EccB1 structures were determined in two different conformations. Here, two new conformations are identified and described. These four conformations present snapshots of the swinging movement of the membrane-distal domain A2. The movement of this domain involves conformational changes in two flexible loops (loop A, residues 243-264, and loop B, residues 324-341) which are rich in proline and glycine residues and connect domain A2 to domains C1 and B2. It is proposed that the movement of this domain is related to the ATPase activity of EccB1 and its homologues, as well as to the substrate transport of ESX secretion systems.",

    "abstract": "The ataRT operon from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli encodes a toxin–antitoxin (TA) module with a recently discovered novel toxin activity. This new type II TA module targets translation initiation for cell-growth arrest. Virtually nothing is known regarding the molecular mechanisms of neutralization, toxin catalytic action or translation autoregulation. Here, the production, biochemical analysis and crystallization of the intrinsically disordered antitoxin AtaR, the toxin AtaT, the AtaR–AtaT complex and the complex of AtaR–AtaT with a double-stranded DNA fragment of the operator region of the promoter are reported. Because they contain large regions that are intrinsically disordered, TA antitoxins are notoriously difficult to crystallize. AtaR forms a homodimer in solution and crystallizes in space group P 6 1 22, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 56.3, c = 160.8 Å. The crystals are likely to contain an AtaR monomer in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to 3.8 Å resolution. The Y144F catalytic mutant of AtaT (AtaT Y144F ) bound to the cofactor acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and the C-terminal neutralization domain of AtaR (AtaR 44–86 ) were also crystallized. The crystals of the AtaT Y144F –AcCoA complex diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution and the crystals of AtaR 44–86 diffracted to 2.2 Å resolution. Analysis of these structures should reveal the full scope of the neutralization of the toxin AtaT by AtaR. The crystals belonged to space groups P 6 5 22 and P 3 1 21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 58.1, c = 216.7 Å and a = b = 87.6, c = 125.5 Å, respectively. The AtaR–AtaT–DNA complex contains a 22 bp DNA duplex that was optimized to obtain high-resolution data based on the sequence of two inverted repeats detected in the operator region. It crystallizes in space group C 222 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 75.6, b = 87.9, c = 190.5 Å. These crystals diffracted to 3.5 Å resolution.",

    "abstract": "The enzymatic hydrolysis of complex plant biomass is a major societal goal of the 21st century in order to deliver renewable energy from nonpetroleum and nonfood sources. One of the major problems in many industrial processes, including the production of second-generation biofuels from lignocellulose, is the presence of `hemicelluloses' such as xylans which block access to the cellulosic biomass. Xylans, with a polymeric β-1,4-xylose backbone, are frequently decorated with acetyl, glucuronyl and arabinofuranosyl `side-chain' substituents, all of which need to be removed for complete degradation of the xylan. As such, there is interest in side-chain-cleaving enzymes and their action on polymeric substrates. Here, the 1.25 Å resolution structure of the Talaromyces pinophilus arabinofuranosidase in complex with the inhibitor AraDNJ, which binds with a K d of 24 ± 0.4 µ M , is reported. Positively charged iminosugars are generally considered to be potent inhibitors of retaining glycosidases by virtue of their ability to interact with both acid/base and nucleophilic carboxylates. Here, AraDNJ shows good inhibition of an inverting enzyme, allowing further insight into the structural basis for arabinoxylan recognition and degradation.",

Here, it is shown that the GH9 enzyme from the pathogen Vibrio cholerae (hereafter referred to as VC0615) is active on both chitosan-derived and β-glucoside substrates. The structure of VC0615 at 3.17 Å resolution is reported from a crystal form with poor diffraction and lattice disorder. VC0615 was highly refractory to crystallization efforts, with crystals only appearing using a high protein concentration under conditions containing the precipitant poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA). The structure is highly mobile within the crystal lattice, which is likely to reflect steric clashes between symmetry molecules which destabilize crystal packing. The overall tertiary structure of VC0615 is well resolved even at 3.17 Å resolution, which has allowed the structural basis for the exo-glucosidase/glucosaminidase activity of this enzyme to be investigated.",

    "abstract": "(S)-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (HBD) has been gaining increased attention recently as it is a key enzyme in the enantiomeric formation of (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA [(S)-3HB-CoA]. It converts acetoacetyl-CoA to (S)-3HB-CoA in the synthetic metabolic pathway. (S)-3HB-CoA is further modified to form (S)-3-hydroxybutyrate, which is a source of biodegradable polymers. During the course of a study to develop biodegradable polymers, attempts were made to determine the crystal structure of HBD from Clostridium acetobutylicum (CacHBD), and the crystal structures of both apo and NAD+-bound forms of CacHBD were determined. The crystals belonged to different space groups: P212121 and P21. However, both structures adopted a hexamer composed of three dimers in the asymmetric unit, and this oligomerization was additionally confirmed by gel-filtration column chromatography. Furthermore, to investigate the catalytic residues of CacHBD, the enzymatic activities of the wild type and of three single-amino-acid mutants were analyzed, in which the Ser, His and Asn residues that are conserved in the HBDs from C. acetobutylicum, C. butyricum and Ralstonia eutropha, as well as in the L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases from Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli, were substituted by alanines. The S117A and N188A mutants abolished the activity, while the H138A mutant showed a slightly lower Km value and a significantly lower kcat value than the wild type. Therefore, in combination with the crystal structures, it was shown that His138 is involved in catalysis and that Ser117 and Asn188 may be important for substrate recognition to place the keto group of the substrate in the correct position for reaction.",

One of the most ancient PP1 regulators is SDS22, a protein that is conserved from yeast to mammals. Sequence analysis of SDS22 revealed that it is a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein, suggesting that SDS22, unlike nearly every other known PP1 regulator, is not an IDP but instead is fully structured. Here, the 2.9 Å resolution crystal structure of human SDS22 in space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 is reported. SDS22 adopts an LRR fold with the horseshoe-like curvature typical for this family of proteins.

XPA 98–219 (residues 98–219) has been identified as a DNA-binding domain and has been extensively studied in the last two decades. However, the most recent studies have redefined the DNA-binding domain as XPA 98–239 (residues 98–239); it exerts a remarkably higher DNA-binding affinity than XPA 98–219 and has a binding affinity that is quite similar to that of the full-length protein. Here, the production, crystallization and structure solution of human XPA 98–239 are described. Crystals were obtained using a precipitant composed of 1.8 M ammonium citrate tribasic pH 7.0. Native X-ray diffraction data and zinc single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data were collected to 1.93 and 2.06 Å resolution, respectively. The crystals belonged to space group P 3, with unit-cell parameters a = 67.1, b = 67.1, c = 35.6 Å, γ = 120.0°. Crystal-content analysis showed the presence of one molecule in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a Matthews coefficient of 2.65 Å 3 Da −1 and a solvent content of 53.6%. The initial phases were solved and the structure model was automatically built by zinc SAD using the AutoSol program. The initial structure model covered 119 of 142 residues in the asymmetric unit, with an R work of 22.15% and an R free of 25.82%. Compared with a previously obtained truncated solution NMR structure of XPA (residues 98–210), a 19-residue C-terminal extension (residues 211–229, corresponding to 10 of the 20 extra C-terminal residues in the redefined domain for enhanced DNA binding) was contained in this initial model.

Additional refinement was carried out with the deposited data, seeking to improve the models and to then validate the complex structures or correct the record. In one case, the inclusion of the inhibitor in the structure was supported and alterations to the model allowed details of enzyme–ligand interactions to be described that had not previously been discussed. For one weak inhibitor, the data suggested that the ligand may adopt two poses in the binding site, both with few interactions with the enzyme. In the third case, that of a potent inhibitor, inconsistencies were noted in the assignment of the chemical structure and there was no evidence to support the inclusion of the ligand in the active site.",

    "abstract": "A putative open reading frame encoding GTP cyclohydrolase I from Listeria monocytogenes was expressed in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. The recombinant protein was purified and was confirmed to convert GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate ( K m = 53 µ M ; v max = 180 nmol mg −1 min −1 ). The protein was crystallized from 1.3 M sodium citrate pH 7.3 and the crystal structure was solved at a resolution of 2.4 Å ( R free = 0.226) by molecular replacement using human GTP cyclohydrolase I as a template. The protein is a D 5 -symmetric decamer with ten topologically equivalent active sites. Screening a small library of about 9000 compounds afforded several inhibitors with IC 50 values in the low-micromolar range. Several inhibitors had significant selectivity with regard to human GTP cyclohydrolase I. Hence, GTP cyclohydrolase I may be a potential target for novel drugs directed at microbial infections, including listeriosis, a rare disease with high mortality.",

    "abstract": "Domain swapping is a widespread oligomerization process that is observed in a large variety of protein families. In the large superfamily of substrate-binding proteins, non-monomeric members have rarely been reported. The arginine-binding protein from Thermotoga maritima (TmArgBP), a protein endowed with a number of unusual properties, presents a domain-swapped structure in its dimeric native state in which the two polypeptide chains mutually exchange their C-terminal helices. It has previously been shown that mutations in the region connecting the last two helices of the TmArgBP structure lead to the formation of a variety of oligomeric states (monomers, dimers, trimers and larger aggregates). With the aim of defining the structural determinants of domain swapping in TmArgBP, the monomeric form of the P235GK mutant has been structurally characterized. Analysis of this arginine-bound structure indicates that it consists of a closed monomer with its C-terminal helix folded against the rest of the protein, as typically observed for substrate-binding proteins. Notably, the two terminal helices are joined by a single nonhelical residue (Gly235). Collectively, the present findings indicate that extending the hinge region and conferring it with more conformational freedom makes the formation of a closed TmArgBP monomer possible. On the other hand, the short connection between the helices may explain the tendency of the protein to also adopt alternative oligomeric states (dimers, trimers and larger aggregates). The data reported here highlight the importance of evolutionary control to avoid the uncontrolled formation of heterogeneous and potentially harmful oligomeric species through domain swapping.",

The C-terminal region of MUL1 faces the cytoplasm and contains the RING domain (MUL1-RING) where the Ub~E2 thioester binds. Unlike most RING-type E3 enzymes, MUL1-RING alone does not have an additional region that recruits a substrate protein, yet is still able to ubiquitylate the substrate, the p53 protein. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of the ubiquitylation of p53 by MUL1-RING has not yet been elucidated. In order to understand this novel ubiquitylation mechanism, it is necessary to determine the three-dimensional structures of MUL1-RING and of its complex with the cognate E2 enzyme. Here, Ube2D2 was validated as a functional E2 enzyme for the ubiquitylation of the p53 transactivation domain (p53-TAD) by MUL1-RING, and purification and crystallization processes for MUL1-RING and the MUL1-RING–Ube2D2 complex are reported.",

    "abstract": "Serine racemase (SR) is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-containing enzyme that converts L-serine to D-serine, an endogenous co-agonist for the N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subtype of glutamate ion channels. SR regulates D-serine levels by the reversible racemization of L-serine to D-serine, as well as the catabolism of serine by α,β-elimination to produce pyruvate. The modulation of SR activity is therefore an attractive therapeutic approach to disorders associated with abnormal glutamatergic signalling since it allows an indirect modulation of NMDAR function. In the present study, a 1.89 Å resolution crystal structure of the human SR holoenzyme (including the PLP cofactor) with four subunits in the asymmetric unit is described. Comparison of this new structure with the crystal structure of human SR with malonate (PDB entry 3l6b) shows an interdomain cleft that is open in the holo structure but which disappears when the inhibitor malonate binds and is enclosed. This is owing to a shift of the small domain (residues 78–155) in human SR similar to that previously described for the rat enzyme. This domain movement is accompanied by changes within the twist of the central four-stranded β-sheet of the small domain, including changes in the φ–ψ angles of all three residues in the C-terminal β-strand (residues 149–151). In the malonate-bound structure, Ser84 (a catalytic residue) points its side chain at the malonate and is preceded by a six-residue β-strand (residues 78–83), but in the holoenzyme the β-strand is only four residues (78–81) and His82 has φ–ψ values in the α-helical region of the Ramachandran plot. These data therefore represent a crystallographic platform that enables the structure-guided design of small-molecule modulators for this important but to date undrugged target.",

In a multistep reaction, DapA converts pyruvate and L-aspartate-4-semialdehyde to 4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinic acid. In many organisms, lysine binds allosterically to DapA, causing negative feedback, thus making the enzyme an important regulatory component of the pathway. Here, the 2.1 Å resolution crystal structure of DapA from the thermoacidophilic methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV is reported. The enzyme crystallized as a contaminant of a protein preparation from native biomass. Genome analysis reveals that M. fumariolicum SolV utilizes the recently discovered aminotransferase pathway for lysine biosynthesis. Phylogenetic analyses of the genes involved in this pathway shed new light on the distribution of this pathway across the three domains of life.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin is the complex assembly of nucleic acids and proteins that makes up the physiological form of the eukaryotic genome. The nucleosome is the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, and is composed of ∼147 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer formed by two copies of each core histone: H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Prior to nucleosome assembly, and during histone eviction, histones are typically assembled into soluble H2A/H2B dimers and H3/H4 dimers and tetramers. A multitude of factors interact with soluble histone dimers and tetramers, including chaperones, importins, histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin-remodeling enzymes. It is still unclear how many of these proteins recognize soluble histones; therefore, there is a need for new structural tools to study non-nucleosomal histones. Here, a single-chain, tailless Xenopus H2A/H2B dimer was created by directly fusing the C-terminus of H2B to the N-terminus of H2A. It is shown that this construct (termed scH2BH2A) is readily expressed in bacteria and can be purified under non-denaturing conditions. A 1.31 Å resolution crystal structure of scH2BH2A shows that it adopts a conformation that is nearly identical to that of nucleosomal H2A/H2B. This new tool is likely to facilitate future structural studies of many H2A/H2B-interacting proteins.",

UDP-ManNAc is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of certain cell-surface polysaccharides, including those in some pathogenic bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae . Many of these epimerases are allosterically regulated by UDP-GlcNAc, which binds adjacent to the active site and is required to initiate UDP-ManNAc epimerization. Here, two crystal structures of UDP- N -acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase from Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (NmSacA) are presented. One crystal structure is of the substrate-free enzyme, while the other structure contains UDP-GlcNAc substrate bound to the active site. Both structures form dimers as seen in similar epimerases, and substrate binding to the active site induces a large conformational change in which two Rossmann-like domains clamp down on the substrate. Unlike other epimerases, NmSacA does not require UDP-GlcNAc to instigate the epimerization of UDP-ManNAc, although UDP-GlcNAc was found to enhance the rate of epimerization. In spite of the conservation of residues involved in binding the allosteric UDP-GlcNAc observed in similar UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases, the structures presented here do not contain UDP-GlcNAc bound in the allosteric site. These structural results provide additional insight into the mechanism and regulation of this critical enzyme and improve the structural understanding of the ability of NmSacA to epimerize modified substrates.",

Some proteins, such as the Arabidopsis thaliana thylakoid lumen protein AtTLP18.3, can be overexpressed in an Escherichia coli system and high-quality protein crystals can be obtained. However, AtTLP18.3 contains no methionine residues, and site-directed mutagenesis was required in order to introduce methionine residues into the protein. A criterion for the mutated residues is that they should avoid affecting the structure and function. In this study, several leucine and isoleucine residues were selected for methionine substitution by combining secondary-structure and solvent-accessibility predictions. From the secondary-structure prediction, mutated residues were first determined in the coil or loop regions at the junction of two secondary structures. Since leucine and isoleucine residues are hydrophobic and are normally buried within the protein core, these residues should have a higher solvent-accessibility prediction so that they would be partially buried or exposed in the protein. In addition, five residues (Leu107, Leu202, Ile133, Leu128 and Ile159) of AtTLP18.3 were mutated to methionine residues. After overexpression and purification, only two single-mutant lines, L128M and I159M, could be crystallized. Finally, a double-mutation line of truncated AtTLP18.3 with L128M and I159M mutations was constructed. The structure of the double mutant AtTLP18.3 protein was resolved using the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method at 2.6 Å resolution. The results indicated that a combination of secondary-structure and solvent-accessibility prediction for methionine substitution is a useful method in SAD and MAD phasing.",

However, ubiquitin contains a high surface density of lysine residues and the doctrine of surface-entropy reduction suggests that these lysines will resist participating in packing interactions and thereby impede crystallization. To assess the contributions of these residues to crystallization behavior, each of the seven lysines of ubiquitin was mutated to serine and the corresponding single-site mutant proteins were expressed and purified. The behavior of these seven mutants was then compared with that of the wild-type protein in a 384-condition crystallization screen. The likelihood of obtaining crystals varied by two orders of magnitude within this set of eight proteins. Some mutants crystallized much more readily than the wild type, while others crystallized less readily. X-ray crystal structures were determined for three readily crystallized variants: K11S, K33S and the K11S/K63S double mutant. These structures revealed that the mutant serine residues can directly promote crystallization by participating in favorable packing interactions; the mutations can also exert permissive effects, wherein crystallization appears to be driven by removal of the lysine rather than by addition of a serine. Presumably, such permissive effects reflect the elimination of steric and electrostatic barriers to crystallization.",

To properly understand this distinctive GluRS-tRNA interaction it is important to pursue detailed structure-function studies; however, because of the fact that tRNA-GluRS interaction in bacteria is also associated with phylum-specific idiosyncrasies, the structure-function correlation studies must also be phylum-specific. GluRS from Thermus thermophilus and Escherichia coli, which belong to evolutionarily distant phyla, are the biochemically best characterized. Of these, only the structure of T. thermophilus GluRS is available. To fully unravel the subtleties of tRNAGlu-GluRS interaction in E. coli, a model bacterium that can also be pathogenic, determination of the E. coli GluRS structure is essential. However, previous attempts have failed to crystallize E. coli GluRS. By mapping crystal contacts of a homologous GluRS onto the E. coli GluRS sequence, two surface residues were identified that might have been hindering crystallization attempts. Accordingly, these two residues were mutated and crystallization of the double mutant was attempted. Here, the design, expression, purification and crystallization of an engineered E. coli GluRS in which two surface residues were mutated to optimize crystal contacts are reported.",

It is now recognized that Grb7 is an emerging therapeutic target in specific cancer subtypes. Recently, the discovery of a bicyclic peptide inhibitor that targets the Grb7 SH2 domain, named G7-B1, was reported. In an attempt to probe the foundation of its interaction with Grb7, the crystallization and preliminary data collection of both the apo and G7-B1-bound forms of the Grb7 SH2 domain are reported here. Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. After several rounds of microseeding, crystals of the apo Grb7 SH2 domain were obtained that diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution, while those of the G7-B1-Grb7 SH2 domain complex diffracted to 2.2 Å resolution. The apo Grb7 SH2 domain crystallized in the trigonal space group P63, whereas the G7-B1-Grb7 SH2 domain complex crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21. The experimental aspects of crystallization, crystal optimization and data collection and the preliminary data are reported.",

Interestingly, some human commensals and bacterial pathogens can scavenge sialic acids from their surrounding environment and degrade them as a source of carbon, nitrogen and energy. This process requires a cluster of genes known as the `Nan-Nag cluster', which have proven to be essential for S. aureus growth on sialic acids, suggesting that the pathway is a viable antimicrobial drug target. The enzyme N -acetylmannosamine kinase is involved in the catabolism of sialic acid, transferring a phosphate group from adenosine-5′-triphosphate to the C6 position of N -acetylmannosamine to generate N -acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate. The gene was cloned into an appropriate expression vector; recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified via anion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. Purified N -acetylmannosamine kinase was screened for crystallization. The best crystal diffracted to a resolution of beyond 2.6 Å in space group P 2.

    "abstract": "Pax genes belong to a family of metazoan transcription factors that are known to play a critical role in eye, ear, kidney and neural development. The mammalian Pax family of transcription factors is characterized by a ∼128-amino-acid DNA-binding paired domain that makes sequence-specific contacts with DNA. The diversity in Pax gene activities emerges from complex modes of interaction with enhancer regions and heterodimerization with multiple interaction partners. Based on in vitro optimal binding-site selection studies and enhancer identification assays, it has been suggested that Pax proteins may recognize and bind their target DNA elements with different binding modes/topologies, however this hypothesis has not yet been structurally explored. One of the most extensively studied DNA target elements of the Pax6 paired domain is the eye-lens specific DC5 (δ-crystallin) enhancer element. In order to shed light on Pax6-DC5 DNA interactions, the related paired-domain prototype Pax9 was crystallized with the minimal δ-crystallin DC5 enhancer element and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis was attempted. A 3.0 Å resolution native data set was collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven from crystals grown in a solution consisting of 10%(w/v) PEG 20K, 20%(v/v) PEG 550 MME, 0.03 M NaNO3, 0.03 M Na2HPO4, 0.03 M NH2SO4, 0.1 M MES/imidazole pH 6.5.

    "abstract": "The Gram-negative bacterium Erwinia amylovora is a destructive pathogen of plants belonging to the Rosaceae family. Amongst its pathogenicity factors, E. amylovora produces the exopolysaccharide amylovoran, which contributes to the occlusion of plant vessels, causing wilting of shoots and eventually resulting in plant death. Amylovoran biosynthesis requires the presence of 12 genes (from ams A to ams L) clustered in the ams region of the E. amylovora genome. They mostly encode glycosyl transferases (AmsG, AmsB, AmsD, AmsE, AmsJ and AmsK), proteins involved in amylovoran translocation and assembly (AmsH, AmsL and AmsC), and also a tyrosine kinase (AmsA) and a tyrosine phosphatase (AmsI), which are both involved in the regulation of amylovoran biosynthesis. The low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase AmsI was overexpressed as a His 6 -tagged protein in Escherichia coli , purified and crystallized. X-ray diffraction data were collected to a maximum resolution of 1.57 Å in space group P 3 1 21.",

    "abstract": "Pili are key cell-surface components that allow the attachment of bacteria to both biological and abiotic solid surfaces, whilst also mediating interactions between themselves. In Escherichia coli, the common pilus (Ecp) belongs to an alternative chaperone-usher (CU) pathway that plays a major role in both early biofilm formation and host-cell adhesion. The chaperone EcpB is involved in the biogenesis of the filament, which is composed of EcpA and EcpD. Initial attempts at crystallizing EcpB using natively purified protein from the bacterial periplasm were not successful; however, after the isolation of EcpB under denaturing conditions and subsequent refolding, crystals were obtained at pH 8.0 using the sitting-drop method of vapour diffusion. Diffraction data have been processed to 2.4 Å resolution. These crystals belonged to the trigonal space group P3(1)21 or P3(2)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 62.65, c = 121.14 Å and one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement was unsuccessful, but selenomethionine-substituted protein and heavy-atom derivatives are being prepared for phasing. The three-dimensional structure of EcpB will provide invaluable information on the subtle mechanistic differences in biogenesis between the alternative and classical CU pathways. Furthermore, this is the first time that this refolding strategy has been used to purify CU chaperones, and it could be implemented in similar systems where it has not been possible to obtain highly ordered crystals.",

This enzyme has been isolated and studied from a few organisms that belong to the betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria, predominantly Pseudomonas putida . Furthermore, there is only one crystal structure of this enzyme, which was obtained from P. putida G7. Here, crystallographic studies and analysis of the crystal structure of an Alpine soil metagenome-derived SALD (SALD AP ) from an alphaproteobacterium are presented. The SALD AP gene was discovered using gene-targeted sequence assembly and it was cloned into a pLATE51 vector. The recombinant protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and the soluble protein was purified to homogeneity. The protein crystallized at 20°C and diffraction data from the crystals were collected at a resolution of 1.9 Å. The crystal belonged to the orthorhombic space group C 222 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 116.8, b = 121.7, c = 318.0 Å. Analysis of the crystal structure revealed its conformation to be similar to the organization of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily with three domains: the catalytic, NAD + -binding and bridging domains. The crystal structure of NahF from P. putida G7 was found to be the best structural homologue of SALD AP , even though the enzymes share only 48% amino-acid identity. Interestingly, a carboxylic acid (protocatechuic acid) was found to be a putative ligand of the enzyme and differential scanning fluorimetry was employed to confirm ligand binding. These findings open up the possibility of studying the mechanism(s) of product inhibition and biocatalysis of carboxylic acids using this enzyme and other related aldehyde dehydrogenases.",

    "abstract": "Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32A (PP32A) is a tumour suppressor whose expression is altered in many cancers. It is an apoptotic enhancer that stimulates apoptosome-mediated caspase activation and also forms part of a complex involved in caspase-independent apoptosis (the SET complex). Crystals of a fragment of human PP32A corresponding to the leucine-rich repeat domain, a widespread motif suitable for protein–protein interactions, have been obtained. The structure has been refined to 1.56 Å resolution. This domain was previously solved at 2.4 and 2.69 Å resolution (PDB entries 2je0 and 2je1, respectively). The new high-resolution structure shows some differences from previous models: there is a small displacement in the turn connecting the first α-helix (α1) to the first β-strand (β1), which slightly changes the position of α1 in the structure. The shift in the turn is observed in the context of a new crystal packing unrelated to those of previous structures.",

    "abstract": "Conjugation is the process by which plasmids, including those that carry antibiotic-resistance genes, are mobilized from one bacterium (the donor) to another (the recipient). The conjugation efficiency of IncF-like plasmids relies on the formation of mating-pair stabilization via intimate interactions between outer membrane proteins on the donor (a plasmid-encoded TraN isoform) and recipient bacteria. Conjugation of the R100-1 plasmid into Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) recipients relies on pairing between the plasmid-encoded TraNα in the donor and OmpW in the recipient. Here, the crystal structure of K. pneumoniae OmpW (OmpW KP ) is reported at 3.2 Å resolution. OmpW KP forms an eight-stranded β-barrel flanked by extracellular loops.

    "abstract": "The rise in antimicrobial resistance is a global health crisis and necessitates the development of novel strategies to treat infections. For example, in 2022 tuberculosis (TB) was the second leading infectious killer after COVID-19, with multi-drug-resistant strains of TB having an ∼40% fatality rate. Targeting essential biosynthetic pathways in pathogens has proven to be successful for the development of novel antimicrobial treatments. Fatty-acid synthesis (FAS) in bacteria proceeds via the type II pathway, which is substantially different from the type I pathway utilized in animals. This makes bacterial fatty-acid biosynthesis (Fab) enzymes appealing as drug targets. FabG is an essential FASII enzyme, and some bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB, harbor multiple homologs. FabG4 is a conserved, high-molecular-weight FabG (HMwFabG) that was first identified in M. tuberculosis and is distinct from the canonical low-molecular-weight FabG. Here, structural and functional analyses of Mycolicibacterium smegmatis FabG4, the third HMwFabG studied to date, are reported. Crystal structures of NAD",

The RSF complex participates in nucleosome spacing and assembly, and subsequently promotes nucleosome maturation. Although SNF2h has been extensively studied in the last few years, the structural and functional properties of the remodeler RSF1 still remain vague. Here, a cryo-EM structure of the RSF-nucleosome complex is reported. The 3D model shows a two-lobe architecture of RSF, and the structure of the RSF-nucleosome (flanked with linker DNA) complex shows that the RSF complex moves the DNA away from the histone octamer surface at the DNA-entry point. Additionally, a nucleosome-sliding assay and a restriction-enzyme accessibility assay show that the RSF1 subunit may cause changes in the chromatin-remodeling properties of SNF2h. As a `nucleosome ruler', the results of an RSF-dinucleosome binding affinity test led to the proposal that the critical distance that RSF `measures' between two nucleosomes is about 24 base pairs.",

The 2.2 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of Pf PL1 reveals the compact parallel β-helix fold of the PL1 family. The back side of the core parallel β-helix opposite to the active site is a meandering set of five α-helices joined by lengthy loops. A comparison of the active site with those of other PL1 enzymes suggests a catalytic mechanism that is independent of metal ions, such as Ca 2+ , but that substrate recognition may require metal ions.

Furthermore, the wealth of structures generated are effective tools for teaching scientific communication, structural science and biochemistry. One of these structures, B. ovis leucine-, isoleucine-, valine-, threonine- and alanine-binding protein ( Bo LBP), is a putative periplasmic amino acid-binding protein. Bo LBP shares less than 29% sequence identity with any other structure in the Protein Data Bank. The production, crystallization and high-resolution structures of Bo LBP are reported. Bo LBP is a prototypical bacterial periplasmic amino acid-binding protein with the characteristic Venus flytrap topology of two globular domains encapsulating a large central cavity containing the peptide-binding region. The central cavity contains small molecules usurped from the crystallization milieu. The reported structures reveal the conformational flexibility of the central cavity in the absence of bound peptides.

While an essential β-sandwich fold is maintained, considerable structural variations exist and are critical for functional diversity. The Rib-domain family, primarily found as tandem-repeat modules in the surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria, represents another significant structural variant of the Ig-like fold. However, limited structural and functional exploration of this family has been conducted, which significantly restricts the understanding of its evolution and significance within the Ig superclass. In this work, a high-resolution crystal structure of a Rib domain derived from the probiotic bacterium Limosilactobacillus reuteri is presented. This protein, while sharing significant structural similarity with homologous domains from other bacteria, exhibits a significantly increased thermal resistance. The potential structural features contributing to this stability are discussed. Moreover, the presence of two copper-binding sites, with one positioned on the interface, suggests potential functional roles that warrant further investigation.",

The production, crystallization and three structures of N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged Tv MIF reveal a prototypical MIF trimer with a topology similar to that of human homologs (hMIF-1 and hMIF-2).

This protein has the conserved Rossmann fold of the SDR superfamily and the characteristic TG xxx G x G motif of the classical SDR subfamily. However, unlike classical SDRs, the active site of BcSDR has a leucine residue in place of the highly conserved and catalytically important tyrosine residue. Sequence analysis confirms that this leucine residue is conserved in this SDR across the Burkholderiales order.

    "abstract": "Adherence to host cells is a crucial step in the process of bacterial infection, which is usually mediated by a number of outer membrane proteins identified as adhesins. Helicobacter pylori adhesin A (HpaA) is a member of the adhesin family that mediates the adherence of Helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells, and consequently assists the bacteria in becoming a life-long colonizer of the human stomach. In this study, two constructs were made for the production of truncated HpaA proteins comprising residues 31–260 and 53–260, respectively. The products of both constructs were crystallized, but only the protein from the shorter construct (residues 53–260) formed crystals that were capable of diffraction. In the subsequent optimization trials, crystals in different forms were unexpectedly obtained by using lithium sulfate and ammonium sulfate as the precipitant. An X-ray data set was collected to 1.95 Å resolution on beamline BL18U1 at SSRF using a crystal grown with 1.92 M lithium sulfate, which belonged to space group P 6 5 with unit-cell parameters a = b = 95.42, c = 54.72 Å, γ = 120°, while another crystal grown with 1.9 M ammonium sulfate diffracted to 2.60 Å resolution and the collected data set was indexed in space group P 2 1 2 1 2, with unit-cell parameters a = 121.01, b = 190.56, c = 106.31 Å. The collection of diffraction data has established a solid basis for structure determination.",

    "abstract": "ATG16L1 plays a major role in autophagy. It acts as a molecular scaffold which mediates protein–protein interactions essential for autophagosome formation. The ATG12~ATG5–ATG16L1 complex is one of the key complexes involved in autophagosome formation. Human ATG16L1 comprises 607 amino acids with three functional domains named ATG5BD, CCD and WD40, where the C-terminal WD40 domain represents approximately 50% of the full-length protein. Previously, structures of the C-terminal WD40 domain of human ATG16L1 as well as of human ATG12~ATG5 in complex with the ATG5BD of ATG16L1 have been reported. However, apart from the ATG5BD, no structural information for the N-terminal half, including the CCD, of human ATG16L1 is available. In this study, the authors aimed to structurally characterize the N-terminal half of ATG16L1. ATG16L1 11–307 in complex with ATG5 has been purified and crystallized in two crystal forms. However, both crystal structures revealed degradation of ATG16L1, resulting in crystals comprising only full-length ATG5 and the ATG5BD of ATG16L1. The structures of ATG5–ATG5BD in two novel crystal forms are presented, further supporting the previously observed dimerization of ATG5–ATG16L1. The reported degradation points towards a high instability at the linker region between the ATG5BD and the CCD in ATG16L1. Based on this observation and further biochemical analysis of ATG16L1, a stable 236-amino-acid subfragment comprising residues 72–307 of the N-terminal half of ATG16L1, covering the residual, so far structurally uncharacterized region of human ATG16L1, was identified. Here, the identification, purification, biochemical characterization and crystallization of the proteolytically stable ATG16L1 72–307 subfragment are reported.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report an X-ray crystal structure of a PLP-dependent AspR, which was resolved at 1.90 Å resolution. The AspR derived from the bivalve mollusc Scapharca broughtonii (SbAspR) is a type II PLP-dependent enzyme that is similar to serine racemase (SR) in that SbAspR catalyzes both racemization and dehydration. Structural comparison of SbAspR and SR shows a similar arrangement of the active-site residues and nucleotide-binding site, but a different orientation of the metal-binding site. Superposition of the structures of SbAspR and of rat SR bound to the inhibitor malonate reveals that Arg140 recognizes the β-carboxyl group of the substrate aspartate in SbAspR. It is hypothesized that the aromatic proline interaction between the domains, which favours the closed form of SbAspR, influences the arrangement of Arg140 at the active site.",

VLR-based reagents may be particularly useful when traditional antibodies are not available. An anti-idiotype lamprey VLR, VLR39, has previously been identified that recognizes the heavy-chain CDR3 of the B-cell receptor (BCR) of a leukemic clone from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). VLR39 was used successfully to track the re-emergence of this clone in the patient following chemotherapy. Here, the crystal structure of VLR39 is presented at 1.5 Å resolution and compared with those of other protein-specific VLRs. VLR39 adopts a curved solenoid fold and exhibits substantial structural similarity to other protein-binding VLRs. VLR39 has a short LRRCT loop that protrudes outwards away from the concave face and is similar to those of its protein-specific VLR counterparts. Analysis of the VLR39–BCR interaction by size-exclusion chromatography and biolayer interferometry using the scFv version of the BCR confirms that VLR39 recognizes the BCR Fv region. Such VLR-based reagents may be useful for identifying and monitoring leukemia in CLL patients and in other clinical diagnostic assays.",

Thus, the diaminopimelate pathway represents an attractive target for antimicrobial and herbicide treatments and has received considerable attention from both a mechanistic and a structural viewpoint. Diaminopimelate decarboxylase has only been characterized in prokaryotic species. This communication describes the first structural studies of two diaminopimelate decarboxylase isoforms from a plant. The Arabidopsis thaliana diaminopimelate decarboxylase cDNAs At3g14390 (encoding DapDc1) and At5g11880 (encoding DapDc2) were cloned from genomic DNA and the recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells. The crystals of DapDc1 and DapDc2 diffracted to beyond 2.00 and 2.27 Å resolution, respectively. Understanding the structural biology of diaminopimelate decarboxylase from a eukaryotic species will provide insights for the development of future herbicide treatments, in particular.",

The crystal structure of the His170Tyr mutant was then determined at 2.0 Å resolution in the presence of a sodium ion and a sulfate ion in the active site. The cap domain of chain B shows a half-closed conformation. The hydrophobic side chain of the mutated residue, the hydroxyphenyl group, forms a hydrophobic contact with the methyl group of Ala166. This hydrophobic interaction was found using the Protein Interactions Calculator (PIC) web server with an interaction distance of 4.6 Å, and might be a key factor in the thermostabilization of the His170Tyr mutant. This study potentially offers a molecular basis for both investigation of the catalytic mechanism and thermostable protein engineering.",

However, the cost-effective production of biofuels from plant biomass is still a challenge.

Aiming at the structural and functional characterization of novel CBMs involved in plant polysaccharide deconstruction, an analysis of the CAZy database was performed and CBM family 64 was chosen owing to its capacity to bind with high specificity to microcrystalline cellulose and to the fact that is found in thermophilic microorganisms.

The asymmetric unit contained two homologous subunits, and the dimer was generated by twofold symmetry. The overall fold of the subunit proved to be similar to those of the D-tagatose 3-epimerase from Pseudomonas cichorii and the D-psicose 3-epimerases from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Clostridium cellulolyticum. However, the situation at the subunit-subunit interface differed substantially from that in D-tagatose 3-epimerase family enzymes. In MJ1311p, Glu125, Leu126 and Trp127 from one subunit were found to be located over the metal-ion-binding site of the other subunit and appeared to contribute to the active site, narrowing the substrate-binding cleft. Moreover, the nine residues comprising a trinuclear zinc centre in endonuclease IV were found to be strictly conserved in MJ1311p, although a distinct groove involved in DNA binding was not present. These findings indicate that the active-site architecture of MJ1311p is quite unique and is substantially different from those of D-tagatose 3-epimerase family enzymes and endonuclease IV.",

However, the detailed mechanisms of this important enzyme are not yet clear and need to be further elucidated. In this study, it was found that the V47S single mutation resulted in a loss of FMN binding, resulting in the production of FMN-free CpsUbiX protein. This mutation is likely to destabilize FMN-protein interactions without affecting the overall structural folding. To fully characterize the conformational changes upon FMN binding and the enzymatic mechanism at the molecular level, the wild-type (FMN-bound) and V47S mutant (FMN-free) CpsUbiX proteins were purified and crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method. Furthermore, complete diffraction data sets for FMN-bound (space group C222(1)) and FMN-free (space group P23) forms were obtained to 2.0 and 1.76 Å resolution, respectively.",

Detailed structural information for the enzyme has been reported from two thermophilic archaea; both of the archaeal APHs share a similar monomeric structure.

    "abstract": "Geobacillus stearothermophilus T6 is a thermophilic bacterium that possesses an extensive hemicellulolytic system, including over 40 specific genes that are dedicated to this purpose. For the utilization of xylan, the bacterium uses an extracellular xylanase which degrades xylan to decorated xylo-oligomers that are imported into the cell. These oligomers are hydrolyzed by side-chain-cleaving enzymes such as arabinofuranosidases, acetylesterases and a glucuronidase, and finally by an intracellular xylanase and a number of β-xylosidases. One of these β-xylosidases is Xyn52B2, a GH52 enzyme that has already proved to be useful for various glycosynthesis applications. In addition to its demonstrated glycosynthase properties, interest in the structural aspects of Xyn52B2 stems from its special glycoside hydrolase family, GH52, the structures and mechanisms of which are only starting to be resolved. Here, the cloning, overexpression, purification and crystallization of Xyn52B2 are reported.

Despite the emerging biological and physiopathological significance of Caprin-1, no structural information is available for this protein. Moreover, Caprin-1 does not have sequence similarity to any other protein with a known structure. It is therefore expected that structural studies will play a particularly crucial role in revealing the functional mechanisms of Caprin-1. Here, a protein fragment of human Caprin-1 consisting of residues 112-260 was expressed, purified and crystallized.

    "abstract": "Glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyse the sequential addition of monosaccharides to specific acceptor molecules and play major roles in key biological processes. GTs are classified into two main families depending on the inverted or retained stereochemistry of the glycosidic bond formed during the reaction. While the mechanism of inverting enzymes is well characterized, the precise nature of retaining GTs is still a matter of much debate. In an attempt to clarify this issue, studies were initiated to identify reaction-intermediate states by using a crystallographic approach based on caged substrates. In this paper, two distinct structures of AA(Gly)B, a dual-specificity blood group synthase, are described in complex with a UDP-galactose derivative in which the O6′′ atom is protected by a 2-nitrobenzyl group. The distinct conformations of the caged substrate in both structures of the enzyme illustrate the highly dynamic nature of its active site. An attempt was also made to photolyse the caged compound at low temperature, which unfortunately is not possible without damaging the uracil group as well. These results pave the way for kinetic crystallography experiments aiming at trapping and characterizing reaction-intermediate states in the mechanism of enzymatic glycosyl transfer.",

While little is known about the functions of Spo0M, a recent phylogenetic study suggests that, based on its amino-acid sequence, Spo0M might belong to the arrestin clan. The crystal structure of the Spo0M protein was determined at a resolution of 2.3 Å. Ten amino acids at the end of the N-terminus were removed to improve the thermal stability of the purified Spo0M protein and the crystal structure of Spo0M was determined by SAD. Spo0M has a well conserved N-terminal domain with an arrestin-like fold, which consists of a β-strand sandwich structure. Surprisingly, the C-terminal domain of Spo0M, which has no structural homology to arrestin-clan proteins, bears significant structural similarity to the FP domain of the human PI31 protein. In addition, Spo0M harbours a potential polar-core structure connecting the N- and C-terminal domains with several salt bridges, as seen in the crystal structures of arrestin and VPS26. The structure reported here constitutes the first structural information on a bacterial protein that shares significant structural homology to members of the arrestin clan and the FP domain.",

Five different branches of this superfamily are known to exist. Defects in these proteins in humans are linked to many diseases such as ataxia, diseases of RNA metabolism and cell-cycle regulation, and various types of cancer. The histidine triad nucleotide protein (HINT) is nearly identical to proteins that have been classified as protein kinase C-interacting proteins (PKCIs), which also have the ability to bind and inhibit protein kinase C. The structure of HINT, which exists as a homodimer, is highly conserved from humans to bacteria and shares homology with the product of fragile histidine triad protein (FHit), a tumour suppressor gene of this superfamily. Here, the structure of HINT from Helicobacter pylori (HpHINT) in complex with AMP is reported at a resolution of 3 Å. The final model has R and Rfree values of 26 and 28%, respectively, with good electron density. Structural comparison with previously reported homologues and phylogenetic analysis shows H. pylori HINT to be the smallest among them, and suggests that it branched out separately during the course of evolution. Overall, this structure has contributed to a better understanding of this protein across the animal kingdom.",

The bacterial Sec pathway post-translationally exports unfolded proteins out of the cytoplasm, and the core of the Sec pathway is composed of a heterotrimeric membrane-embedded channel, SecYEG, and two cytosolic components, SecA and SecB. SecB functions by stabilizing unfolded proteins, maintaining them in an export-competent state. Although SecB is mainly found in Proteobacteria, a SecB-like protein, Rv1957, that controls a stress-response toxin–antitoxin system, is found in M. tuberculosis . Rv1957 can also functionally replace the Escherichia coli SecB chaperone both in vivo and in vitro . In this work, the production, crystallization and X-ray crystallographic analysis of Rv1957 are reported. Notably, diffraction-quality crystals were obtained only at high concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide, i.e. about 12%( v / v ). The crystals of Rv1957 belonged to space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 64.5, b = 92.0, c = 115.4 Å.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) was derived from Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein ( av GFP), notably with S65T/Y66W mutations. Its chromophore consists of a tripeptide comprised of Thr65, Trp66 and Gly67 (TWG) residues, while that of av GFP consists of a Ser65, Tyr66 and Gly67 (SYG) tripeptide. Cerulean and SCFP3A were derived from ECFP-S72A/H148D (a double mutation) with additional Y145A and S175G mutations, respectively, while Cerulean-S175G has both mutations (Y145A and S175G). The crystal structures of these ECFP variants at neutral pH were reported to adopt two distinct major conformations called ECFP and Cerulean . In this study, Cerulean-S175G was revealed to adopt only the Cerulean conformation, while Cerulean has been reported to adopt both the ECFP and the Cerulean conformations in its crystal structures. Sharing the same S175G mutation with SCFP3A, Cerulean-S175G showed a slightly increased quantum yield, like SCFP3A, but did not adopt the ECFP conformation adopted by SCFP3A. Detailed comparison of Cerulean-S175G and other ECFP variants revealed that the notable conformational changes in ECFP variants can be understood mainly in terms of the interaction between the Trp66 residue of the chromophore and residues 145–148 of β-strand 7.",

    "abstract": "In most organisms, Cys-tRNA Cys is directly synthesized by cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS). Many methanogenic archaea, however, use a two-step, indirect pathway to synthesize Cys-tRNA Cys owing to a lack of CysRS and cysteine-biosynthesis systems. This reaction is catalyzed by O -phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS), Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase (SepCysS) and SepRS/SepCysS pathway enhancer (SepCysE) as the transsulfursome, in which SepCysE connects both SepRS and SepCysS. On the transsulfursome, SepRS first ligates an O -phosphoserine to tRNA Cys , and the mischarged intermediate Sep-tRNA Cys is then transferred to SepCysS, where it is further modified to Cys-tRNA Cys . In this study, a subcomplex of the transsulfursome with tRNA Cys (SepCysS–SepCysE–tRNA Cys ), which is involved in the second reaction step of the indirect pathway, was constructed and then crystallized. The crystals diffracted X-rays to a resolution of 2.6 Å and belonged to space group P 6 5 22, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 107.2, c = 551.1 Å. The structure determined by molecular replacement showed that the complex consists of a SepCysS dimer, a SepCysE dimer and one tRNA Cys in the asymmetric unit.",

A few residues were conserved among PurSs and these are located at the interaction site with PurL and PurQ, the other subunits of the formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase.

    "abstract": "Multicopper oxidases oxidize various phenolic and nonphenolic compounds by using molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor to produce water. A multicopper oxidase protein, CueO, from Escherichia coli is involved in copper homeostasis in the bacterial cell. Although X-ray crystallographic studies have been conducted, the reduction mechanism of oxygen and the proton-transfer pathway remain unclear owing to the difficulty in identifying H atoms from X-ray diffraction data alone. To elucidate the reaction mechanism using neutron crystallography, a preparation system for obtaining large, high-quality single crystals of deuterated CueO was developed. Tiny crystals were obtained from the deuterated CueO initially prepared from the original construct. The X-ray crystal structure of the deuterated CueO showed that the protein contained an incompletely truncated signal sequence at the N-terminus, which resulted in the heterogeneity of the protein sample for crystallization. Here, a new CueO expression system that had an HRV3C cleavage site just after the signal sequence was constructed. Deuterated CueO from the new construct was expressed in cells cultured in deuterated algae-extract medium and the signal sequence was completely eliminated by HRV3C protease. The deuteration level of the purified protein was estimated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to be at least 83.2% compared with nondeuterated protein. Nondeuterated CueO crystallized in space group P 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 49.51, b = 88.79, c = 53.95 Å, β = 94.24°, and deuterated CueO crystallized in space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 49.91, b = 106.92, c = 262.89 Å. The crystallographic parameters for the crystals of the new construct were different from those previously reported for nondeuterated crystals. The nondeuterated and deuterated CueO from the new construct had similar UV–Vis spectra, enzymatic activities and overall structure and geometry of the ligands of the Cu atoms in the active site to those of previously reported CueO structures. These results indicate that the CueO protein prepared using the new construct is suitable for further neutron diffraction studies.",

The crystal structure of A. gambiae SRPN18 was determined to a resolution of 1.45 Å, including nearly the entire RCL in one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that the SRPN18 RCL is extremely short and constricted, a feature associated with noncanonical inhibitors or non-inhibitory serpin superfamily members. Furthermore, the SRPN18 RCL does not contain a suitable protease target site and contains a large number of prolines. The SRPN18 structure therefore reveals a unique RCL architecture among the highly conserved serpin fold.",

A previous study reported that CmnB and CmnK are two enzymes that are involved in the formation of L-Dap in the biosynthesis of capreomycin. CmnB catalyzes the condensation reaction of O -phospho-L-serine and L-glutamic acid to generate N -(1-amino-1-carboxyl-2-ethyl)glutamic acid, which subsequently undergoes oxidative hydrolysis via CmnK to generate the product L-Dap. Here, the crystal structure of CmnB in complex with the reaction intermediate PLP-α-aminoacrylate is reported at 2.2 Å resolution. Notably, CmnB is the second known example of a PLP-dependent enzyme that forms a monomeric structure in crystal packing. The crystal structure of CmnB also provides insights into the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and supports the biosynthetic pathway of L-Dap reported in previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal oxidase in cellular respiration, couples proton pumping to O 2 reduction. Mammalian CcO resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Previously, a model of H-pathway proton pumping was proposed based on various CcO crystal structures. However, all previously determined structures were solved using crystals obtained at pH 5.7, which differs from the environmental pH of CcO in the inner membrane. The structures of fully oxidized and ligand-free reduced CcO at pH 7.3 have now been determined. Structural comparison between the oxidized and reduced states revealed that the structural alterations that occurred upon redox change at pH 5.7 in Asp51, the magnesium-containing cluster, haem groups and helix X, which provide important structural evidence for the H-pathway proton-pumping proposal, also occur at pH 7.3. These structural alterations were restricted to a local region of CcO; no domain movement was detected, nor were significant structural alterations detected in peripheral regions at either pH value. These observations indicate that the small and precise structural alterations that occur over the course of the reaction cycle are not affected by pH change, and that isolated CcO precisely performs proton pumping via the H-pathway over a wide pH range. Because the pH is not uniform across the molecular surface of CcO, the fact that the overall structure of CcO is not affected by pH changes ensures the high enzymatic efficiency of this protein in the mitochondria.",

They play a critical role in storing iron(III) within the complex at concentrations much higher than the feasible solubility limits of iron(III), thus maintaining iron homeostasis within cells. Here, the crystal structure of bacterioferritin from Achromobacter ( Ach Bfr) that crystallized serendipitously during a crystallization attempt of an unrelated mycobacterial protein is reported at 1.95 Å resolution. Notably, Fe atoms were bound to the structure along with a porphyrin ring sandwiched between the subunits of a dimer. Furthermore, the dinuclear ferroxidase center of Ach Bfr has only a single iron bound, in contrast to the two Fe atoms in other Bfrs. The structure of Ach Bfr clearly demonstrates the substitution of a glutamate residue, which is involved in the interaction with the second Fe atom, by a threonine and the consequent absence of another Fe atom there. The iron at the dinuclear center has a tetravalent coordination, while a second iron with a hexavalent coordination was found within the porphyrin ring, generating a heme moiety. Achromobacter spp. are known opportunistic pathogens; this structure enhances the current understanding of their iron metabolism and regulation, and importantly will be useful in the design of small-molecule inhibitors against this protein through a structure-guided approach.",

Previous structures of the amino-terminal (N) domain of LpoA showed it to consist entirely of helices and loops, with at least four tetratricopeptide-like repeats. Although the previously determined orthorhombic crystal structure of the N domain of Haemophilus influenzae LpoA showed a typical curved structure with a concave groove, an NMR structure of the same domain from Escherichia coli was relatively flat. Here, a crystal structure of the N domain of E. coli LpoA was determined to a resolution of 2.1 Å and was found to be more similar to the H. influenzae crystal structure than to the E. coli NMR structure. To provide a quantitative description for these comparisons, the various structures were superimposed pairwise by fitting the first half of each structure to its pairwise partner and then calculating the rotation axis that would optimally superimpose the second half. Differences in both the magnitude of the rotation and the direction of the rotation axis were observed between different pairs of structures. A 1.35 Å resolution structure of a monoclinic crystal form of the N domain of H. influenzae LpoA was also determined. In this structure, the subdomains rotate 10° relative to those in the original orthorhombic H. influenzae crystal structure to further narrow the groove between the subdomains. To accommodate this, a bound chloride ion (in place of sulfate) allowed the closer approach of a helix that forms one side of the groove.",

    "abstract": "Hygromycin B (HygB) is one of the aminoglycoside antibiotics, and it is widely used as a reagent in molecular-biology experiments. Two kinases are known to inactivate HygB through phosphorylation: aminoglycoside 7′′-phosphotransferase-Ia [APH(7′′)-Ia] from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and aminoglycoside 4-phosphotransferase-Ia [APH(4)-Ia] from Escherichia coli . They phosphorylate the hydroxyl groups at positions 7′′ and 4 of the HygB molecule, respectively. Previously, the crystal structure of APH(4)-Ia was reported as a ternary complex with HygB and 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). To investigate the differences in the substrate-recognition mechanism between APH(7′′)-Ia and APH(4)-Ia, the crystal structure of APH(7′′)-Ia complexed with HygB is reported. The overall structure of APH(7′′)-Ia is similar to those of other aminoglycoside phosphotransferases, including APH(4)-Ia, and consists of an N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and a C-terminal lobe (C-lobe). The latter also comprises a core and a helical domain. Accordingly, the APH(7′′)-Ia and APH(4)-Ia structures fit globally when the structures are superposed at three catalytically important conserved residues, His, Asp and Asn, in the Brenner motif, which is conserved in aminoglycoside phosphotransferases as well as in eukaryotic protein kinases. On the other hand, the phosphorylated hydroxyl groups of HygB in both structures come close to the Asp residue, and the HygB molecules in each structure lie in opposite directions. These molecules were held by the helical domain in the C-lobe, which exhibited structural differences between the two kinases. Furthermore, based on the crystal structures of APH(7′′)-Ia and APH(4)-Ia, some mutated residues in their thermostable mutants reported previously were located at the same positions in the two enzymes.",

This region of the structure is significantly different from previously observed structures that share the same sequence and neighboring base pairs.

The lysozyme structure obtained from these crystals does not show the typical overall fold. Instead, major conformational changes take place in some elements of the secondary structure and in the hydrophobic core of the protein. At the end of the central α-helix (α2), Glu35 is usually buried in the catalytic site and shows an abnormally high p K a value, which is key to the activity of the enzyme. The high p K a value of this glutamate residue is favoured by the hydrophobic environment, particularly by its neighbour Trp108, which is important for structural stability and saccharide binding. In this new structure, Trp108 shows a 90° rotation of its side chain, which results in the rearrangement of the hydrophobic core. Conformational changes also result in the exposure of Glu35 to the solvent, which impairs the catalytic site by increasing the distance between Glu35 and Asp52 and lowering the p K a value of the glutamate. Altogether, this new lysozyme structure reveals major conformational changes in the hydrophobic core and catalytic site that might play a role in the folding and bactericidal function of the protein.",

Human branched-chain aminotransferase (hBCAT) catalyzes the transamination of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, valine and isoleucine and α-ketoglutarate to their respective α-keto acids and glutamate. hBCAT activity is regulated by a C XX C center located approximately 10 Å from the active site. This redox-active center facilitates recycling between the reduced and oxidized states, representing hBCAT in its active and inactive forms, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of the redox sensor (Cys315) results in a significant loss of activity, with no loss of activity reported on the mutation of the resolving cysteine (Cys318), which allows the reversible formation of a disulfide bond between Cys315 and Cys318. The crystal structure of the oxidized form of the C318A variant was used to better understand the contributions of the individual cysteines and their oxidation states. The structure reveals the modified C XX C center in a conformation similar to that in the oxidized wild type, supporting the notion that its regulatory mechanism depends on switching the Cys315 side chain between active and inactive conformations. Moreover, the structure reveals conformational differences in the N-terminal and inter-domain region that may correlate with the inactivated state of the C XX C center.",

In plants, enzymes called invertases split sucrose into glucose and fructose, contributing to the regulation of metabolic fluxes. Invertases differ in their localization and pH optimum. Acidic invertases present in plant cell walls and vacuoles belong to glycoside hydrolase family 32 (GH32) and have an all-β structure. In contrast, neutral invertases are located in the cytosol and organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria. These poorly understood enzymes are classified into a separate GH100 family. Recent crystal structures of the closely related neutral invertases InvA and InvB from the cyanobacterium Anabaena revealed a predominantly α-helical fold with unique features compared with other sucrose-metabolizing enzymes. Here, a neutral invertase (AtNIN2) from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was heterologously expressed, purified and crystallized. As a result, the first neutral invertase structure from a higher plant has been obtained at 3.4 Å resolution. The hexameric AtNIN2 structure is highly similar to that of InvA, pointing to high evolutionary conservation of neutral invertases.",

The plant-beneficial fungi Trichoderma spp. are in use worldwide as biocontrol agents and protect the host plant from soil-borne as well as foliar pathogens. Recently, a novel SSCP, Tsp1, has been identified in the secreted protein pool of T. virens and is overinduced upon its interaction with the roots of the maize plant. The protein was observed to be well conserved in the Ascomycota division of fungi, and its homologs are present in many plant-pathogenic fungi such as Fusarium oxysporum and Magnaporthe oryzae . However, none of these homologs have yet been characterized. Recombinant Tsp1 protein has been expressed and purified using an Escherichia coli expression system. The protein, with four conserved cysteines, forms a dimer in solution as observed by size-exclusion chromatography. The dimerization, however, does not involve disulfide bonds. Circular-dichroism data suggested that the protein has a β-strand-rich secondary structure that matched well with the secondary structure predicted using bioinformatics methods. The protein was crystallized using sodium malonate as a precipitant. The crystals diffracted X-rays to 1.7 Å resolution and belonged to the orthorhombic space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 ( R meas = 5.4%), with unit-cell parameters a = 46.3, b = 67.0, c = 173.2 Å. The Matthews coefficient ( V M ) of the crystal is 2.32 Å 3 Da −1 , which corresponds to nearly 47% solvent content with four subunits of Tsp1 protein in the asymmetric unit. This is the first report of the structural study of any homolog of the novel Tsp1 protein. These structural studies will help in understanding the classification and function of the protein.",

They bind specific carbohydrates containing acetamido groups, such as N -acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), in a Ca 2+ -independent manner. Unlike ordinary C-type lectins, which require Ca 2+ ions for carbohydrate recognition, these lectins recognize specific carbohydrates mainly through interactions with the acetamido group without Ca 2+ ions, even though Ca 2+ enhances the binding affinity of these lectins, especially SPL-1. In the present study, the crystal structure of the SPL-1–GlcNAc complex in the presence of Ca 2+ revealed that the binding of SPL-1 to GlcNAc is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the water molecule(s) coordinating Ca 2+ , whereas in ordinary C-type lectins Ca 2+ directly forms coordinate bonds to the hydroxy groups of carbohydrates. These differences may also allow SPL-1 and SPL-2 to recognize both GlcNAc and GalNAc, which have different orientations of the 4-hydroxy group.",

    "abstract": "The crystal structure of the class II fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPaseII) from the important pathogen Francisella tularensis is presented at 2.4 Å resolution. Its structural and functional relationships to the closely related phosphatases from Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mt FBPaseII) and Escherichia coli ( Ec FBPaseII) and to the dual phosphatase from Synechocystis strain 6803 are discussed. FBPaseII from F. tularensis ( Ft FBPaseII) was crystallized in a monoclinic crystal form (space group P 2 1 , unit-cell parameters a = 76.30, b = 100.17, c = 92.02 Å, β = 90.003°) with four chains in the asymmetric unit. Chain A had two coordinated Mg 2+ ions in its active center, which is distinct from previous findings, and is presumably deactivated by their presence. The structure revealed an approximate 222 ( D 2 ) symmetry homotetramer analogous to that previously described for Mt FBPaseII, which is formed by a crystallographic dyad and which differs from the exact tetramer found in Ec FBPaseII at a 222 symmetry site in the crystal. Instead, the approximate homotetramer is very similar to that found in the dual phosphatase from Synechocystis , even though no allosteric effector was found in Ft FBPase. The amino-acid sequence and folding of the active site of Ft FBPaseII result in structural characteristics that are more similar to those of the previously published Ec FBPaseII than to those of Mt FBPaseII. The kinetic parameters of native Ft FBPaseII were found to be in agreement with published studies. Kinetic analyses of the Thr89Ser and Thr89Ala mutations in the active site of the enzyme are consistent with the previously proposed mechanism for other class II bisphosphatases. The Thr89Ala variant enzyme was inactive but the Thr89Ser variant was partially active, with an approximately fourfold lower K m and V max than the native enzyme. The structural and functional insights derived from the structure of Ft FBPaseII will provide valuable information for the design of specific inhibitors.",

Influenza A virus causes severe pneumonia and its RNA polymerase is an important target for drug design. The influenza A (H1N1) virus has eight ribonucleoprotein complexes, which are composed of viral RNA, RNA polymerases and nucleoproteins. PB2 forms part of the RNA polymerase complex and plays an important role in binding to the cap structure of host mRNA. The middle domain of PB2 includes a cap-binding site. The structure of PB2 from H1N1 complexed with m7GTP has not been reported. Plate-like crystals of the middle domain of PB2 from H1N1 were obtained, but the quality of these crystals was not good. An attempt was made to crystallize the middle domain of PB2 complexed with m7GTP using a soaking method; however, electron density for m7GTP was not observed on preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis. This protein has hydrophobic residues on its surface and is stable in the presence of high salt concentrations. To improve the solubility, a surface double mutant (P453H and I471T) was prepared. These mutations change the surface electrostatic potential drastically. The protein was successfully prepared at a lower salt concentration and good cube-shaped crystals were obtained using this protein. Here, the crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of this mutant of the middle domain of PB2 are reported.",

All members of the superfamily feature at least a pair of extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats with calcium-binding sites in the EC linker region. The EC repeats across family members form distinct complexes that mediate cellular adhesion. For instance, classical cadherins (five EC repeats) strand-swap their N-termini and exchange tryptophan residues in EC1, while the clustered protocadherins (six EC repeats) use an extended antiparallel `forearm handshake' involving repeats EC1–EC4. The 7D-cadherins, cadherin-16 (CDH16) and cadherin-17 (CDH17), are the most similar to classical cadherins and have seven EC repeats, two of which are likely to have arisen from gene duplication of EC1–2 from a classical ancestor. However, CDH16 and CDH17 lack the EC1 tryptophan residue used by classical cadherins to mediate adhesion. The structure of human CDH17 EC1–2 presented here reveals features that are not seen in classical cadherins and that are incompatible with the EC1 strand-swap mechanism for adhesion. Analyses of crystal contacts, predicted glycosylation and disease-related mutations are presented along with sequence alignments suggesting that the novel features in the CDH17 EC1–2 structure are well conserved. These results hint at distinct adhesive properties for 7D-cadherins.",

Given the sensitivity of metalloproteins to radiation damage, neutron protein crystallography provides a nondestructive technique for structural characterization while also informing on the positions of H atoms. Neutron cryo-crystallography permits the trapping of catalytic intermediates, thereby providing insight into the protonation states and chemical nature of otherwise short-lived species in the reaction mechanism. To characterize the reaction-mechanism intermediates of LPMO9D from Neurospora crassa , a cryo-neutron diffraction data set was collected from an ascorbate-reduced crystal.

The LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs of autophagy receptors and adaptors bind Atg8 proteins to promote autophagosome formation, cargo recruitment, and autophagosome closure and fusion to lysosomes. A crystal structure of human GABARAPL2 has been published [PDB entry 4co7; Ma et al. (2015), Biochemistry , 54 , 5469–5479]. This was crystallized in space group P 2 1 with a monoclinic angle of 90° and shows a pseudomerohedral twinning pathology. This article reports a new, untwinned GABARAPL2 crystal form, also in space group P 2 1 , but with a 98° monoclinic angle. No major conformational differences were observed between the structures. In the structure described here, the C-terminal Phe117 binds into the LIR docking site (LDS) of a neighbouring molecule within the asymmetric unit, as observed in the previously reported structure. This crystal contact blocks the LDS for co-crystallization with ligands. Phe117 of GABARAPL2 is normally removed during biological processing by Atg4 family proteases. These data indicate that to establish interactions with the LIR, Phe117 should be removed to eliminate the crystal contact and liberate the LDS for co-crystallization with LIR peptides.",

    "abstract": "The members of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family are among the most intensely studied oncological targets. HER3 (ErbB3), which had long been neglected, has emerged as a key oncogene, regulating the activity of other receptors and being involved in progression and tumor escape in multiple types of cancer. Designed ankyrin-repeat proteins (DARPins) serve as antibody mimetics that have proven to be useful in the clinic, in diagnostics and in research. DARPins have previously been selected against EGFR (HER1), HER2 and HER4. In particular, their combination into bivalent binders that separate or lock receptors in their inactive conformation has proved to be a promising strategy for the design of potent anticancer therapeutics. Here, the selection of DARPins targeting extracellular domain 4 of HER3 (HER3d4) is described. One of the selected DARPins, D5, in complex with HER3d4 crystallized in two closely related crystal forms that diffracted to 2.3 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. The DARPin D5 epitope comprises HER3d4 residues 568–577. These residues also contribute to interactions within the tethered (inactive) and extended (active) conformations of the extracellular domain of HER3.",

All Vaps share a conserved core of about 105 amino acids that folds into a compact eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel with a unique topology. At the top of the barrel, four loops connect the eight β-strands. Previous Vap structures did not show concave surfaces that might serve as a ligand-binding site. Here, the structure of VapB in a new crystal form was determined at 1.71 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules. In one of them, the loop regions at the top of the barrel adopt a different conformation from other Vap structures. An outward movement of the loops results in the formation of a hydrophobic cavity that might act as a ligand-binding site. This lends further support to the hypothesis that the structural similarity between Vaps and avidins suggests a potential binding function for Vaps.",

The AI-2 molecule is imported into the cell by the LsrACB transporter and is subsequently phosphorylated (to AI-2-P) by LsrK. AI-2-P binds to the repressor protein of the lsr operon (LsrR) and triggers various cellular responses related to QS by dissociating LsrR from the DNA. Although a large amount of purified LsrK is required for structural studies, recombinant GST-LsrK was mostly expressed in an insoluble form. To enhance the soluble expression of LsrK, an attempt was made to increase the expression of the cellular chaperone proteins that are well known to support proper protein folding. Transformed E. coli was cultured in high-salt LB medium and heat shock was applied prior to subsequent IPTG induction at 20°C. These procedures increased the yield of purified LsrK by about tenfold compared with standard IPTG induction at 20°C. The expressed LsrK was readily purified by GST-affinity chromatography. Crystals of LsrK were grown by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The X-ray diffraction data of the crystal were processed in a primitive hexagonal space group to 2.9 Å resolution.",

Myelin-gene regulatory factor (MRF) is a recently identified transcription factor that is required for myelin-sheath formation. Loss of MRF leads to demyelinating diseases and motor learning deficiency. MRF is a membrane-bound transcription factor that undergoes autocleavage from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

In this study, the MRF DBD was cloned, purified and crystallized in order to understand the molecular mechanism that regulates the transcription of myelin genes. Selenomethionine was subsequently introduced into the crystals to obtain the phases for the MRF DBD structure. The native and selenomethionine-labelled crystals exhibited diffraction to 2.50 and 2.51 Å resolution, respectively.

This is the first reported thymidylyltransferase structure from a Gram-positive bacterium. RfbA shares overall structural characteristics with known RmlA homologs. However, RfbA exhibits a shorter sequence at its C-terminus, which results in the absence of three α-helices involved in allosteric site formation. Consequently, RfbA was observed to exhibit a quaternary structure that is unique among currently reported glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase bacterial homologs. These structural analyses suggest that RfbA may not be allosterically regulated in some organisms and is structurally distinct from other RmlA homologs.",

    "abstract": "The Gram-negative bacterium Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 is notable for its ability to metabolize a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons. Not surprisingly, the S. wittichii genome contains a number of putative aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading gene clusters. One of these includes an enzyme of unknown function, Swit_4259, which belongs to the acetoacetate decarboxylase-like superfamily (ADCSF). Here, it is reported that Swit_4259 is a small (28.8 kDa) tetrameric ADCSF enzyme that, unlike the prototypical members of the superfamily, does not have acetoacetate decarboxylase activity. Structural characterization shows that the tertiary structure of Swit_4259 is nearly identical to that of the true decarboxylases, but there are important differences in the fine structure of the Swit_4259 active site that lead to a divergence in function. In addition, it is shown that while it is a poor substrate, Swit_4259 can catalyze the hydration of 2-oxo-hex-3-enedioate to yield 2-oxo-4-hydroxyhexanedioate. It is also demonstrated that Swit_4259 has pyruvate aldolase-dehydratase activity, a feature that is common to all of the family V ADCSF enzymes studied to date. The enzymatic activity, together with the genomic context, suggests that Swit_4259 may be a hydratase with a role in the metabolism of an as-yet-unknown hydrocarbon. These data have implications for engineering bioremediation pathways to degrade specific pollutants, as well as structure–function relationships within the ADCSF in general.",

    "abstract": "Chlortetracycline (CTC), a derivative of tetracycline (TC), is a broadly used antibiotic that inhibits the synthesis of bacterial proteins by competing with the A-site tRNA on ribosomes. A recent study showed that during the biosynthesis of CTC in Streptomyces aureofaciens, the halogenase CtcP catalyzes the final chlorination reaction and transforms TC into CTC. However, the structure of this fundamental enzyme is still lacking. Here, selenomethionine-derivatized CtcP from S. aureofaciens was overexpressed and purified and its structure was determined at 2.7 Å resolution. The structure of CtcP reveals the conserved monooxygenase domain shared by all flavin-dependent halogenases and a unique C-terminal domain. Although FAD was not observed in the structure, the monooxygenase domain has a conserved FAD-binding pocket and active center. The C-terminal domain displays an α-helical bundle fold, which could contribute to substrate specificity. This work provides a molecular basis for enzyme engineering to improve the industrial production of CTC.",

The crystal structures of their complexes with acetylcholine-binding protein from Aplysia californica (AcAChBP) were determined and reveal details of molecular recognition in the orthosteric binding site. Comparisons treating AcAChBP as a surrogate for human α4β2 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) suggest that the molecular features involved in ligand recognition and affinity for the protein targets are conserved. The ligands exploit interactions with similar residues as the archetypal nAChR agonist nicotine, but with greater affinity. (-)-Hosieine-A in particular has a high affinity for AcAChBP driven by a favorable entropic contribution to binding. The ligand affinities help to rationalize the potent biological activity of these alkaloids. The structural data, together with comparisons with related molecules, suggest that there may be opportunities to extend the hosieine-A scaffold to incorporate new interactions with the complementary side of the orthosteric binding site. Such a strategy may guide the design of new entities to target human α4β2 nAChR that may have therapeutic benefit.",

CK2α is in itself a very promising therapeutic target for a range of conditions and has recently been put forward as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Belumosudil presents a promising starting point for the development of future CK2α inhibitors as it provides a safe, potent and orally bioavailable scaffold. Therefore, several of the major hurdles in drug development have already been overcome. Here, the crystal structure of belumosudil bound to the ATP site of CK2α is presented.

    "abstract": "Peroxisomes are a major cellular compartment of eukaryotic cells, and are involved in a variety of metabolic functions and pathways according to species, cell type and environmental conditions. Their biogenesis relies on conserved genes known as PEX genes that encode peroxin proteins. Peroxisomal membrane proteins and peroxisomal matrix proteins are generated in the cytosol and are subsequently imported into the peroxisome post-translationally. Matrix proteins containing a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) are recognized by the cycling receptor Pex5p and transported to the peroxisomal lumen. Pex5p docking, release of the cargo into the lumen and recycling involve a number of peroxins, but a key player is the Pex4p-Pex22p complex described in this manuscript. Pex4p from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that is anchored on the cytosolic side of the peroxisomal membrane through its binding partner Pex22p, which acts as both a docking site and a co-activator of Pex4p. As Pex5p undergoes recycling and release, the Pex4p-Pex22p complex is essential for monoubiquitination at the conserved cysteine residue of Pex5p. The absence of Pex4p-Pex22p inhibits Pex5p recycling and hence PTS1 protein import. This article reports the crystallization of Pex4p and of the Pex4p-Pex22p complex from the yeast Hansenula polymorpha, and data collection from their crystals to 2.0 and 2.85 Å resolution, respectively. The resulting structures are likely to provide important insights to understand the molecular mechanism of the Pex4p-Pex22p complex and its role in peroxisome biogenesis.",

Structural genomics efforts include characterizing the structures of enzymes from pathways that can be targeted for drug development. As part of these efforts, chorismate mutase from B. phymatum was produced and crystallized, and a 1.95 Å resolution structure is reported. This enzyme shares less than 33% sequence identity with other homologs of known structure. There are two classes of chorismate mutase: AroQ and AroH. The bacterial subclass AroQγ has reported roles in virulence. Chorismate mutase from B. phymatum has the prototypical AroQγ topology and retains the characteristic chorismate mutase active site. This suggests that substrate-based chorismate mutase inhibitors will not be specific and are likely to affect beneficial bacteria such as B. phymatum .",

Although the crystal structures of several subtypes have been determined, the molecular mechanisms underlying subtype specificity remain unclear. Here, mouse claudin-3 (mCldn3) was crystallized in complex with the C-terminal region of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE) for the structural analysis of an additional claudin subtype. mCldn3 alone was difficult to crystallize, but complex formation with C-CPE enhanced the thermostability of mCldn3 and facilitated its crystallization. The introduction of an S313A mutation into C-CPE further improved its thermostability, and the resolution limits of the diffraction data sets improved from 8 Å for the wild-type complex to 4.7 Å for the S313A mutant complex.",

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of `lytic' polysaccharide monooxygenases, copper-dependent enzymes for biomass degradation, has provided new impetus for the analysis of unusual metal-ion sites in carbohydrate-active enzymes. In this context, the CAZY family GH124 endoglucanase from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum contains an unusual metal-ion site, which was originally modelled as a Ca 2+ site but features aspartic acid, asparagine and two histidine imidazoles as coordinating residues, which are more consistent with a transition-metal binding environment. It was sought to analyse whether the GH124 metal-ion site might accommodate other metals. It is demonstrated through thermal unfolding experiments that this metal-ion site can accommodate a range of transition metals (Fe 2+ , Cu 2+ , Mn 2+ and Ni 2+ ), whilst the three-dimensional structure and mass spectrometry show that one of the histidines is partially covalently modified and is present as a 2-oxohistidine residue; a feature that is rarely observed but that is believed to be involved in an `off-switch' to transition-metal binding. Atomic resolution (&lt;1.1 Å) complexes define the metal-ion site and also reveal the binding of an unusual fructosylated oligosaccharide, which was presumably present as a contaminant in the cellohexaose used for crystallization. Although it has not been possible to detect a biological role for the unusual metal-ion site, this work highlights the need to study some of the many metal-ion sites in carbohydrate-active enzymes that have long been overlooked or previously mis-assigned.",

    "abstract": "Neutron protein crystallography (NPC) reveals the three-dimensional structures of proteins, including the positions of H atoms. The technique is particularly suited to elucidate ambiguous catalytic steps in complex biochemical reactions. While NPC uniquely complements biochemical assays and X-ray structural analyses by revealing the protonation states of ionizable groups at and around the active site of enzymes, the technique suffers from a major drawback: large single crystals must be grown to compensate for the relatively low flux of neutron beams. However, in addition to revealing the positions of hydrogens involved in enzyme catalysis, NPC has the advantage over X-ray crystallography that the crystals do not suffer radiation damage. The lack of radiation damage can be exploited to conduct in crystallo parametric studies. Here, the use of a single crystal of the small GTPase Ras to collect three neutron data sets at pD 8.4, 9.0 and 9.4 is reported, enabling an in crystallo titration study using NPC. In addition to revealing the behavior of titratable groups in the active site, the data sets will allow the analysis of allosteric water-mediated communication networks across the molecule, particularly regarding Cys118 and three tyrosine residues central to these networks, Tyr32, Tyr96 and Tyr137, with p K a values expected to be in the range sampled in our experiments.",

    "abstract": "Heterotrimeric glutamine amidotransferase CAB (GatCAB) possesses an ammonia-self-sufficient mechanism in which ammonia is produced and used in the inner complex by GatA and GatB, respectively. The X-ray structure of GatCAB revealed that the two identified active sites of GatA and GatB are markedly distant, but are connected in the complex by a channel of 30 Å in length. In order to clarify whether ammonia is transferred through this channel in GatCAB by visualizing ammonia, neutron diffraction studies are indispensable. Here, GatCAB crystals were grown to approximate dimensions of 2.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 mm (a volume of 1.8 mm 3 ) with the aid of a polymer using microseeding and macroseeding processes. Monochromatic neutron diffraction data were collected using the neutron single-crystal diffractometer BIODIFF at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum, Germany. The GatCAB crystals belonged to space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 74.6, b = 94.5, c = 182.5 Å and with one GatCAB complex (molecular mass 119 kDa) in the asymmetric unit.

    "abstract": "The SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein 2 (SPSB2) is one of four mammalian SPSB proteins that are characterized by a C-terminal SOCS box and a central SPRY/B30.2 domain. SPSB2 interacts with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) via the SPRY domain and polyubiquitinates iNOS, resulting in its proteasomal degradation. Inhibitors that can disrupt SPSB2–iNOS interaction and augment NO production may serve as novel anti-infective and anticancer agents. The previously determined murine SPSB2 structure may not reflect the true apo conformation of the iNOS-binding site. Here, the crystal structure of human SPSB2 SPRY domain in the apo state is reported at a resolution of 1.9 Å. Comparison of the apo and ligand-bound structures reveals that the iNOS-binding site is highly preformed and that major conformational changes do not occur upon ligand binding. Moreover, the C-terminal His 6 tag of the recombinant protein binds to a shallow pocket adjacent to the iNOS-binding site on a crystallographically related SPSB2 molecule. These findings may help in structure-based and fragment-based SPSB2 inhibitor design in the future.",

Here, a case of contamination from a Serratia bacterial strain that occurred while attempting to crystallize an unrelated protein from Burkholderia pseudomallei (overexpressed in E. coli ) is presented. The contamination led to the unintended crystallization and structure analysis of a cyanate hydratase from a bacterial strain of the Serratia genus, an opportunistic enterobacterium that grows under conditions similar to those of E. coli and that is found in a variety of habitats, including the laboratory environment. In this context, the procedures that were adopted to identify the contaminant based on crystallographic data only are presented and the crystal structure of Serrata spp. cyanate hydratase is briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "The human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium is responsible for urethritis in men, and for cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. The adherence of M. genitalium to host target epithelial cells is mediated through an adhesion complex called Nap, which is essential for infectivity. Nap is a transmembrane dimer of heterodimers of the immunodominant proteins P110 and P140. The M. genitalium genome contains multiple copies of portions that share homology with the extracellular regions of P140 and P110 encoded by the genes mg191 and mg192 , respectively. Homologous recombination between the genes and the copies allows the generation of a large diversity of P140 and P110 variants to overcome surveillance by the host immune system. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain (C-domain) of the extracellular region of P140, which is essential for the function of Nap by acting as a flexible stalk anchoring the protein to the mycoplasma membrane, presents a low degree of sequence variability. In the present work, the X-ray crystal structures of two crystal forms of a construct of the P140 C-domain are reported. In both crystal forms, the construct forms a compact octamer with D 4 point-group symmetry. The structure of the C-domain determined in this work presents significant differences with respect to the structure of the C-domain found recently in intact P140. The structural plasticity of the C-domain appears to be a possible mechanism that may help in the functioning of the mycoplasma adhesion complex.",

These complexes (or their homologues) regulate gene expression in eukaryotic organisms, affecting a large number of genes both positively and negatively. The downstream effects are seen in development, and in humans have implications for disease such as cancer. The chromatin structure is altered by modifying the DNA–histone contacts, thus opening up or closing down sections of DNA to specific transcription factors that regulate the transcription of genes. The Ssr4 sequence has little homology to other sequences in the Protein Data Bank, so the structure was solved using an iodine derivative with SAD phasing. The structure of the N-terminal domain is an antiparallel β-sheet of seven strands with α-helices on one side and random coil on the other. The structure is significantly different to deposited structures and was used as a target in the most recent Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP; https://predictioncenter.org/) competition.",

    "abstract": "FANCM is involved in eukaryotic DNA-damage recognition and activates the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway through complex formation. MHF is one of the FANCM-associating components and contains a histone-fold DNA-binding domain. Loss of the FANCM-MHF interaction compromises the activation of the FA pathway, resulting in chromosomal instability. Thus, formation of the FANCM-MHF complex is important for function, but its nature largely remains elusive. Here, the aim was to reveal the molecular and structural basis for the stability of the FANCM-MHF complex. A recombinant tripartite complex containing chicken FANCM (MHF interaction region), MHF1 and MHF2 was expressed and purified. The purified tripartite complex was crystallized under various conditions and three different crystals were obtained from similar crystallization conditions. Unexpectedly, structure determination revealed that one of the crystals contained the FANCM-MHF complex but that the other two contained the MHF complex without FANCM. How FANCM dissociates from MHF was further investigated and it was found that the presence of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) and an oxidative environment may have promoted its release. However, under these conditions MHF retained its complexed form. FANCM-MHF interaction involves a mixture of hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, and chicken FANCM contains several nonconserved cysteines within this region which may lead to aggregation with other FANCM-MHF molecules. These results indicate an unexpected nature of the FANCM-MHF complex and the data can be used to improve the stability of the complex for biochemical and structural analyses.",

Therefore, it is necessary to understand their pathogenicity for proper diagnosis and therapeutics. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli, the major causative agents of UTIs, contain several genes that are absent in nonpathogenic strains and are therefore considered to be relevant to UTI pathogenicity. c4763 is one of the uropathogenic E. coli-specific proteins, but its function is unknown. To investigate the function of c4763 and its possible role in UTI pathogenicity, its crystal structure was determined at a resolution of 1.45 Å by a multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction method. c4763 is a homodimer with 129 residues in one subunit that contains a GGCT-like domain with five α-helices and seven β-strands. c4763 shows structural similarity to the C-terminal domain of allophanate hydrolase from Kluyveromyces lactis, which is involved in the degradation of urea. These results suggest that c4763 might be involved in the utilization of urea, which is necessary for bacterial survival in the urinary tract. Further biochemical and physiological investigation will elucidate its functional relevance in UTIs.",

Since iron is poorly available in an oxidizing environment, bacterial growth may be restricted by iron limitation, and this has led to the evolution of a huge variety of iron-uptake systems. Among pathogens, iron scavenging from the haemoglobin of an animal host is a common means of acquiring sufficient iron for growth. The Isd system of Staphylococcus aureus is a well studied example; the bacterium devotes considerable resources to the construction of surface proteins that deftly remove haem from haemoglobin and pass it along a chain of related proteins, eventually delivering the haem to the cytoplasm, where it can be utilized or degraded. All organisms, however, must deal with haem and related molecules, which are by their nature hydrophobic and prone to precipitate, and which tend to promote the formation of reactive oxygen species. Chaperones are an obvious solution to the problem of maintaining a pool of haem for insertion into cytochromes without allowing naked haem to cause damage. YdiE is a very small protein from Escherichia coli of only 63 residues which may play a role in haem trafficking.

    "abstract": "This issue of Acta Crystallographica Section F is dedicated towards structural investigations on proteins associated with molecular parasitology, specifically research linked to protozoan pathogens. It is in line with the previous special sections or issues contributed by the RIKEN-UK structural genomics consortium (December 2009), the Joint Center for Structural Genomics in October 2010 (Weiss & Einspahr, 2010 ▶) and the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Diseases in September 2011 (Weiss & Einspahr, 2011 ▶). In contrast to the previous issues however, it is thematically much more focused on protozoan pathogens. Interest in these primitive eukaryotic organisms is often to exploit them as model systems and many significant advances have resulted from such research. As examples there are the fundamentally important discoveries relating to RNA editing, antigenic variation and the occurrence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol tags that anchor proteins on the cell surface, all accrued from research with the African trypanosome. However, a major impetus to study protists is the drastic toll they take on human life. The World Health Organization provide documentation and sobering statistics on the diseases and their impact on human health. For example http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs375/en/ is their recently updated information sheet on Leishmaniasis. Researchers have sought to understand the processes that allow pathogens to exist, to invade a host, to evade the immune response, and to cause debilitating and often fatal diseases. Extending from such investigations and alongside drug discovery efforts enter structural biology, in particular crystallography and the high quality chemical information it can provide.\r\n\r\nRemember that most drugs are smallish organic molecules that exert their beneficial effect by interacting with certain macromolecules. The discovery of such molecules has transformed human existence. Indeed the emergence of the modern pharmaceutical industry, founded as it was on the basis of antimicrobial and analgesic agents, might be considered one of the major developments of the last 100 years. Different disciplines contribute to drug discovery, and increasingly the search is on for new targets, better technologies and model systems to assist the process. Structural studies contribute a key role by providing accurate chemical information to guide assessment of targets, the development of reliable structure–activity relationships or templates for computational design projects in the search for lead compounds. There are numerous excellent studies published in which specific parasite systems have been targeted and dissected. In addition structural genomics efforts have involved cohorts of protist proteins and the Protein Data Bank has been greatly enriched in this area with both NMR and crystal structures.\r\n\r\nWe now present an issue of fundamental studies in molecular parasitology and also research directed toward protozoan drug target characterization. To set the scene there is an overview and perspective from Professor Wim Hol. In this he also details a few of his favourite examples where structural information contributes to the search for improved therapies. We commissioned Wim for an overview because of his outstanding contributions and infectious enthusiasm for the area; he continues to be an inspirational champion for the role of crystallography in drug discovery. There is also a short review from Professor Inari Kursula on cytoskeletal proteins related to the infection process. We thought it relevant to address this aspect and would highlight this as one in which there may be opportunities in future drug discovery work. We are pleased to also have a number of communications from structural genomics efforts which sit comfortably alongside more focused projects.\r\n\r\nSection F’s mandate is to allow the structural biology community to efficiently publish their data and we hope this special issue will serve to inform our community and perhaps others in the life sciences or medicinal chemistry areas, generate interest and provide encouragement to consider the journal as a natural home for results in molecular parasitology. We look forward to seeing more structural information on parasite proteins, more advances in basic biology and results to support future efforts in early stage drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "The exponential increase in protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has resulted in the elucidation of most, if not all, protein folds, thus making molecular replacement (MR) the most frequently used method for structure determination. A survey of the PDB shows that most of the structures determined by molecular replacement contain less than ten molecules in the asymmetric unit and that it is predominantly virus and ribosome structures that contain more than 20 molecules in the asymmetric unit. While the success of the MR method depends on several factors, such as the homology and the size of an input model, it is also a well known fact that this method can become significantly difficult in cases with a large number of molecules in the asymmetric unit, higher crystallographic symmetry and tight packing. In this paper, five representative structures containing 16–18 homomeric molecules in the asymmetric unit and the strategies that have been used to solve these structures are described. The difficulties faced and the lessons learned from these structure-determination efforts will be useful for selected and similar future situations with a large number of molecules in the asymmetric unit.",

    "abstract": "Plant β-galactosidases play important roles in carbohydrate-reserve mobilization, cell-wall expansion and degradation, and turnover of signalling molecules during ripening. Tomato β-galactosidase 4 (TBG4) not only has β-galactosidase activity but also has exo-β-(1,4)-galactanase activity, and prefers β-(1,4)-galactans longer than pentamers as its substrates; most other β-galactosidases only have the former activity. Recombinant TBG4 protein expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris was crystallized by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method using PEG 10,000 as a precipitant. The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit-parameters a = 92.82, b = 96.30, c = 159.26 Å, and diffracted to 1.65 Å resolution. Calculation of the Matthews coefficient suggested the presence of two monomers per asymmetric unit (VM = 2.2 Å(3) Da(-1)), with a solvent content of 45%.",

    "abstract": "Cellulosomes are massive cell-bound multienzyme complexes tethered by macromolecular scaffolds that coordinate the efforts of many anaerobic bacteria to hydrolyze plant cell-wall polysaccharides, which are a major untapped source of carbon and energy. Integration of cellulosomal components occurs via highly ordered protein-protein interactions between cohesin modules, located in the scaffold, and dockerin modules, found in the enzymes and other cellulosomal proteins. The proposed cellulosomal architecture for Ruminococcus flavefaciens strain FD-1 consists of a major scaffoldin (ScaB) that acts as the backbone to which other components attach. It has nine cohesins and a dockerin with a fused X-module that binds to the cohesin on ScaE, which in turn is covalently attached to the cell wall. The ScaA dockerin binds to ScaB cohesins allowing more carbohydrate-active modules to be assembled. ScaC acts as an adaptor that binds to both ScaA and selected ScaB cohesins, thereby increasing the repertoire of dockerin-bearing proteins that integrate into the complex. In previous studies, a screen for novel cohesin-dockerin complexes was performed which led to the identification of a total of 58 probable cohesin-dockerin pairs. Four were selected for subsequent structural and biochemical characterization based on the quality of their expression and the diversity in their specificities. One of these is C12D22, which comprises the cohesin from the adaptor ScaC protein bound to the dockerin of a CBM-containing protein. This complex has been purified and crystallized, and data were collected to resolutions of 2.5 Å (hexagonal, P65), 2.16 Å (orthorhombic, P212121) and 2.4 Å (orthorhombic, P21212) from three different crystalline forms.",

In the present study, pyridoxal kinase from Salmonella typhimurium was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and crystallized.

The data quality obtained by routine processing was poor owing to the presence of strong diffraction rings caused by a polycrystalline material of an unknown small molecule in all oscillation images. Excluding the reflections close to powder/polycrystalline rings provided data of sufficient quality for structure determination. A preliminary structure solution has been obtained by molecular replacement with the Phaser program in the CCP4 suite using E. coli pyridoxal kinase (PDB entry 2ddm) as the phasing model. Further refinement and analysis of the structure are likely to provide valuable insights into catalysis by pyridoxal kinases.",

    "abstract": "The CarD protein is highly expressed in mycobacterial strains under basal conditions and is transcriptionally induced during multiple types of genotoxic stress and starvation. The CarD protein binds the β subunit of RNA polymerase and influences gene expression. The disruption of interactions between CarD and the β subunit of RNA polymerase has a significant effect on mycobacterial survival, resistance to stress and pathogenesis. To understand the structure of CarD and its interaction with the β subunit of RNA polymerase, Mycobacterium tuberculosis CarD ( Mtb CarD) and the Thermus aquaticus RNA polymerase β subunit were recombinantly expressed and purified. Secondary-structure analysis using circular-dichroism spectroscopy indicated that Mtb CarD contains ∼60% α-helix, ∼7% β-sheet and ∼33% random-coil structure. The C-terminal domain of Mtb CarD (CarD 83–161 ) was crystallized and its X-ray structure was determined at 2.1 Å resolution. CarD 83–161 forms a distorted Y-shaped structure containing bundles of three helices connected by a loop. The residues forming the distorted Y-shaped structure are highly conserved in CarD sequences from other mycobacterial species. Comparison of the CarD 83–161 structure with the recently determined full-length M. tuberculosis and T. thermophilus CarD crystal structures revealed structural differences in residues 141–161 of the C-terminal domain of the CarD 83–161 structure. The structural changes in the CarD 83–161 structure occurred owing to proteolysis and crystallization artifacts.",

In metazoans, the Cid1 orthologues ZCCHC6 and ZCCHC11 uridylate histone mRNAs, targeting them for degradation, but also uridylate microRNAs, altering their maturation. Cid1 has been studied as a model TUT that has provided insights into the larger and more complex metazoan enzyme system. In this paper, two strategies are described that led to improvements both in the crystallogenesis of Cid1 and in the resolution of diffraction by ∼1.5 Å. These advances have allowed high-resolution crystallographic studies of this TUT system to be initiated.",

Whereas in human mitochondria PRORP has two partners that are required for RNase P activity, PRORP proteins are active as single-subunit enzymes in plants. Three paralogues of PRORP are found in Arabidopsis thaliana . PRORP1 is responsible for RNase P in mitochondria and chloroplasts, while PRORP2 and PRORP3 are nuclear enzymes.

YteR, like other URHs, has core structural homology to unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases, but hydrolyzes the unsaturated disaccharide derivative of rhamnogalacturonan I. The crystal structure of the recombinant CA_C0359 protein was solved to 1.6 Å resolution by molecular replacement using the phase information of the previously reported structure of YteR (PDB entry 1nc5) from Bacillus subtilis strain 168. The YteR-like protein is a six-α-hairpin barrel with two β-sheet strands and a small helix overlaying the end of the hairpins next to the active site. The protein has low primary protein sequence identity to YteR but is structurally similar. The two tertiary structures align with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.4 Å and contain a highly conserved active pocket. There is a conserved aspartic acid residue in both structures, which has been shown to be important for hydration of the C=C bond during the release of unsaturated galacturonic acid by YteR. A surface electrostatic potential comparison of CA_C0359 and proteins from CAZy families GH88 and GH105 reveals the make-up of the active site to be a combination of the unsaturated rhamnogalacturonyl hydrolase and the unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase from Bacillus subtilis strain 168. Structural and electrostatic comparisons suggests that the protein may have a slightly different substrate specificity from that of YteR.",

Recent crystal structures of human IL-18 (hIL-18) in complex with its antagonist or cognate receptor(s) have revealed a conserved binding interface on hIL-18 representing a promising drug target. An important step in this process is obtaining crystals of apo hIL-18 or hIL-18 in complex with small-molecule inhibitors, preferably under low ionic strength conditions. In this study, surface-entropy reduction (SER) and rational protein design were employed to facilitate the crystallization of hIL-18.

    "abstract": "Calexcitin was first identified in the marine snail Hermissenda crassicornis as a neuronal-specific protein that becomes upregulated and phosphorylated in associative learning. Calexcitin possesses four EF-hand motifs, but only the first three (EF-1 to EF-3) are involved in binding metal ions. Past work has indicated that under physiological conditions EF-1 and EF-2 bind Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ , while EF-3 is likely to bind only Ca 2+ . The fourth EF-hand is nonfunctional owing to a lack of key metal-binding residues. The aim of this study was to use a crystallographic approach to determine which of the three metal-binding sites of calexcitin is most readily replaced by exogenous metal ions, potentially shedding light on which of the EF-hands play a `sensory' role in neuronal calcium signalling. By co-crystallizing recombinant calexcitin with equimolar Gd 3+ in the presence of trace Ca 2+ , EF-1 was shown to become fully occupied by Gd 3+ ions, while the other two sites remain fully occupied by Ca 2+ . The structure of the Gd 3+ –calexcitin complex has been refined to an R factor of 21.5% and an R free of 30.4% at 2.2 Å resolution. These findings suggest that EF-1 of calexcitin is the Ca 2+ -binding site with the lowest selectivity for Ca 2+ , and the implications of this finding for calcium sensing in neuronal signalling pathways are discussed.",

BaSurE was found to be a robust enzyme, showing activity over wide ranges of temperature and pH and with various phosphoester substrates. The active biomolecule is a tetramer and each monomer was found to consist of two domains: an N-terminal domain, which forms an approximate α + β fold, and a C-terminal domain that belongs to the α/β class. The active site lies at the junction of these two domains and was identified by the presence of conserved negatively charged residues and a bound Mg(2+) ion. Comparisons of BaSurE with its homologues have revealed both common features and differences in this class of enzymes. The number and arrangement of some of the equivalent secondary structures, which are seen to differ between BaSurE and its homologues, are responsible for a difference in the size of the active-site area and the overall oligomeric state of this enzyme in other organisms.

A-TIM is a monomeric loop-deletion variant of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) which has lost the TIM catalytic properties. Ma18 and Ma21 were identified after extensive directed-evolution selection experiments using an Escherichia coli L-arabinose isomerase knockout strain expressing a randomly mutated A-TIM gene. These variants facilitate better growth of the Escherichia coli selection strain in medium supplemented with 40 m M L-arabinose. Ma18 and Ma21 differ from A-TIM by four and one point mutations, respectively. Ma18 and Ma21 are more stable proteins than A-TIM, as judged from CD melting experiments. Like A-TIM, both proteins are monomeric in solution. In the Ma18 crystal structure loop 6 is open and in the Ma21 crystal structure loop 6 is closed, being stabilized by a bound glycolate molecule. The crystal structures show only small differences in the active site compared with A-TIM. In the case of Ma21 it is observed that the point mutation (Q65L) contributes to small structural rearrangements near Asn11 of loop 1, which correlate with different ligand-binding properties such as a loss of citrate binding in the active site. The Ma21 structure also shows that its Leu65 side chain is involved in van der Waals interactions with neighbouring hydrophobic side-chain moieties, correlating with its increased stability. The experimental data suggest that the increased stability and solubility properties of Ma21 and Ma18 compared with A-TIM cause better growth of the selection strain when coexpressing Ma21 and Ma18 instead of A-TIM.",

    "abstract": "A number of anaerobic microorganisms produce multi-modular, multi-enzyme complexes termed cellulosomes. These extracellular macromolecular nanomachines are designed for the efficient degradation of plant cell-wall carbohydrates to smaller sugars that are subsequently used as a source of carbon and energy. Cellulolytic strains from the rumens of mammals, such as Ruminococcus flavefaciens , have been shown to have one of the most complex cellulosomal systems known. Cellulosome assembly requires the binding of dockerin modules located in cellulosomal enzymes to cohesin modules located in a macromolecular scaffolding protein. Over 220 genes encoding dockerin-containing proteins have been identified in the R. flavefaciens genome. The dockerin-containing enzymes can be incorporated into the primary scaffoldin (ScaA), which in turn can bind to adaptor scaffoldins (ScaB or ScaC) and subsequently to anchoring scaffoldin (ScaE), thereby attaching the whole complex to the cell surface. However, unlike other cellulosomes such as that from Clostridium thermocellum , the Ruminococcus species lack a specific carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) on ScaA which recruits the entire complex onto the surface of the substrate. Instead, a cellulose-binding protein, CttA, comprising two putative tandem novel carbohydrate-binding modules and a C-terminal X-dockerin module, which can bind to the cohesin of ScaE, may mediate the attachment of bacterial cells to cellulose. Here, the expression, purification and crystallization of the carbohydrate-binding modular part of the CttA from R. flavefaciens are described. X-ray data have been collected to resolutions of 3.23 and to 1.61 Å in space groups P 3 1 21 or P 3 2 21 and P 2 1 , respectively. The structure was phased using bound iodide from the crystallization buffer by SAD experiments.",

    "abstract": "Fatty-acid degradation is an oxidative process that involves four enzymatic steps and is referred to as the β-oxidation pathway. During this process, long-chain acyl-CoAs are broken down into acetyl-CoA, which enters the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, resulting in the production of energy in the form of ATP. Enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) catalyzes the second step of the β-oxidation pathway by the syn addition of water to the double bond between C2 and C3 of a 2- trans -enoyl-CoA, resulting in the formation of a 3-hydroxyacyl CoA. Here, the crystal structure of ECH from Thermus thermophilus HB8 ( Tt ECH) is reported at 2.85 Å resolution. Tt ECH forms a hexamer as a dimer of trimers, and wide clefts are uniquely formed between the two trimers. Although the overall structure of Tt ECH is similar to that of a hexameric ECH from Rattus norvegicus ( Rn ECH), there is a significant shift in the positions of the helices and loops around the active-site region, which includes the replacement of a longer α3 helix with a shorter α-helix and 3 10 -helix in Rn ECH. Additionally, one of the catalytic residues of Rn ECH, Glu144 (numbering based on the Rn ECH enzyme), is replaced by a glycine in Tt ECH, while the other catalytic residue Glu164, as well as Ala98 and Gly141 that stabilize the enolate intermediate, is conserved. Their putative ligand-binding sites and active-site residue compositions are dissimilar.",

    "abstract": "AGAP1 is often considered to regulate membrane trafficking, protein transport and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Recent studies have shown that aberrant expression of AGAP1 is associated with many diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It has been proposed that the GTP-binding protein-like domain (GLD) is involved in the binding of cofactors and thus regulates the catalytic activity of AGAP1. To obtain a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanism underpinning AGAP1-related diseases, it is essential to obtain structural information. Here, the GLD (residues 70–235) of AGAP1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Affinity and gel-filtration chromatography were used to obtain AGAP1 GLD with high purity for crystallization. Using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method with the protein at a final concentration of 20 mg ml −1 , AGAP1 GLD protein crystals of suitable size were obtained. The crystals were found to diffract to 3.0 Å resolution and belonged to space group I 4, with unit-cell parameters a = 100.39, b = 100.39, c = 48.08 Å. The structure of AGAP1 GLD exhibits the highly conserved functional G1–G5 loops and is generally similar to other characterized ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), implying an analogous function to Arf GAPs. Additionally, this study indicates that AGAP1 could be classified as a type of NTPase, the activity of which might be regulated by protein partners or by its other domains. Taken together, these results provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of AGAP1 in cell signaling.",

It is expected that mouse hemoglobin (Hb) plays an important role in their adaptation to living in such a high-CO 2 environment, while many other species cannot. In the present study, mouse Hb was purified and crystallized at a physiological pH of 7 in the orthorhombic space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 ; the crystals diffracted to 2.8 Å resolution. The primary amino-acid sequence and crystal structure of mouse Hb were compared with those of mammalian Hbs in order to investigate the structure–function relationship of mouse Hb. Differences were observed from guinea pig Hb in terms of amino-acid sequence and from cat Hb in overall structure (in terms of r.m.s.d.). The difference in r.m.s.d. from cat Hb may be due to the existence of the molecule in a conformation other than the R-state. Analysis of tertiary- and quaternary-structural features, the α1β2 interface region and the heme environment without any ligands in all four heme groups showed that mouse methemoglobin is in an intermediate state between the R-state and the T-state that is much closer to the R-state conformation.",

A single heat-shock 70 kDa-type chaperone, PfHsp70-x, is among the parasite proteins exported to the host cell. PfHsp70-x assists in the formation of a key protein complex that underpins parasite virulence and supports parasite growth during febrile episodes. Previous work resolved the crystallographic structures of the PfHsp70-x ATPase and substrate-binding domains, and showed them to be highly similar to those of their human counterparts. Here, 233 chemical fragments were screened for binding to the PfHsp70-x ATPase domain, resulting in three crystallographic structures of this domain in complex with ligands. Two binding sites were identified, with most ligands binding proximal to the ATPase nucleotide-binding pocket. Although amino acids participating in direct ligand interactions are conserved between the parasite and human erythrocytic chaperones, one nonconserved residue is also present near the ligand. This work suggests that PfHsp70-x features binding sites that may be exploitable by small-molecule ligands towards the specific inhibition of the parasite chaperone.",

An automatic liquid handler (Mosquito) was used to add a liquid drop to the in situ microplates in the frame, and CrystalClear HD tape was used to seal the frame. A sealed frame holding 48 microplates was developed as a novel combined crystallization plate and was used for crystal cultivation under different conditions and in situ data collection at the synchrotron beamline. Moreover, individual microplates can be separated from the combined crystal plate and then fixed on a magnetic base or loaded onto a UniPuck for in situ data collection. Automatic grid scanning was used to locate crystals. The efficiency of the combined crystallization plate for crystal screening was verified. This method avoids the manual manipulation of crystals during crystal screening and diffraction data collection; therefore, the combined crystallization plate is suitable for large-scale screening of microcrystals.",

Here, a convenient method for preparing high-quality microcrystals of a bacterial quinoprotein enzyme, copper amine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis , is reported. The method consists of the mechanical crushing of large crystals (5–15 mm 3 ), seeding the crushed crystals into the enzyme solution and standing for 1 h at an ambient temperature of ∼26°C, leading to the rapid formation of microcrystals with a uniform size of 3–5 µm. The microcrystals diffracted X-rays to a resolution beyond 2.0 Å in SFX measurements at the SPring-8 Angstrom Compact Free Electron Laser facility. The damage-free structure determined at 2.2 Å resolution was essentially identical to that determined previously by cryogenic crystallography using synchrotron X-ray radiation.",

SARM1 is a central executioner of programmed axon degeneration, a common feature of the early phase of many neurodegenerative diseases. SARM1 is held in the inactive state in healthy axons by its N-terminal auto-inhibitory ARM domain, and is activated to cleave NAD upon injury, triggering subsequent axon degeneration. To characterize the molecular mechanism of SARM1 activation, it was sought to determine the crystal structure of the SARM1 ARM domain. Here, the recombinant production and crystallization of dSARM1 ARM is described, as well as the unconventional process used for structure determination. Crystals were obtained in the presence of NMN, a precursor of NAD and a potential activator of SARM1, only after in situ proteolysis of the N-terminal 63 residues. After molecular-replacement attempts failed, the crystal structure of dSARM1 ARM was determined at 1.65 Å resolution using the MIRAS phasing technique with autoSHARP , combining data from native, selenomethionine-labelled and bromide-soaked crystals. The structure will further the understanding of SARM1 regulation.",

The overall structures of the two apo V-1 chains are also highly similar to that of CP-bound V-1 (C α r.m.s.d.s of &lt;0.50 Å), indicating that CP does not induce a large conformational change in V-1. Detailed structural comparisons using the computational program All Atom Motion Tree revealed that CP binding can be accomplished by minor side-chain rearrangements of several residues. These findings are consistent with the known biological role of V-1, in which it globally inhibits CP in the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "Actophorin, a protein that severs actin filaments isolated from the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii, was employed as a test case for crystallization under microgravity. Crystals of purified actophorin were grown under microgravity conditions aboard the International Space Station (ISS) utilizing an interactive crystallization setup between the ISS crew and ground-based experimenters. Crystals grew in conditions similar to those grown on earth. The structure was solved by molecular replacement at a resolution of 1.65 Å. Surprisingly, the structure reveals conformational changes in a remote β-turn region that were previously associated with actophorin phosphorylated at the terminal residue Ser1. Although crystallization under microgravity did not yield a higher resolution than crystals grown under typical laboratory conditions, the conformation of actophorin obtained from solving the structure suggests greater flexibility in the actophorin β-turn than previously appreciated and may be beneficial for the binding of actophorin to actin filaments.",

    "abstract": "The structures of new crystal forms of Satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) are described. These belong to space groups I2, P21212 (a low-resolution form), R3 (H3) and P23. The R3 crystals are 50%/50% twinned, as are two instances of the P23 crystals. The I2 and P21212 crystals were grown from ammonium sulfate solutions, as was one crystal in space group P23, while the R3 and the other P23 crystals were grown from sodium chloride, sodium bromide and sodium nitrate. The monoclinic and orthorhombic crystals have half a virus particle as the asymmetric unit, while the rhombohedral and cubic crystals have one third of a virus particle. RNA segments organized about the icosahedral twofold axes were present in crystals grown from ammonium sulfate and sodium chloride, as in the canonical I222 crystals (PDB entry 4oq8), but were not observed in crystals grown from sodium bromide and sodium nitrate. Bromide and nitrate ions generally replaced the RNA phosphates present in the I222 crystals, including the phosphates seen on fivefold axes, and were also found at threefold vertices in both the rhombohedral and cubic forms. An additional anion was also found on the fivefold axis 5 Å from the first anion, and slightly outside the capsid in crystals grown from sodium chloride, sodium bromide and sodium nitrate, suggesting that the path along the symmetry axis might be an ion channel. The electron densities for RNA strands at individual icosahedral dyads, as well as at the amino-terminal peptides of protein subunits, exhibited a diversity of orientations, in particular the residues at the ends.",

While recent research has suggested that this TAA might adopt a novel `hairpin-like' architecture, the characterization of Hsf has been limited to in silico modelling and electron micrographs, with no high-resolution structural data available. Here, the crystal structure of Hsf putative domain 1 (PD1) is reported at 3.3 Å resolution. The structure corrects the previous domain annotation by revealing the presence of an unexpected N-terminal TrpRing domain. PD1 represents the first Hsf domain to be solved, and thus paves the way for further research on the `hairpin-like' hypothesis.",

MarR homologues have been identified in many bacterial and archaeal species which pose daunting antibiotic resistance issues that threaten public health. The continuous prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) throughout the world is associated with the abuse of antibiotics, and antibiotic treatments of CDI have limited effect. In the genome of C. difficile strain 630, the marR gene (ID 4913953) encodes a MarR protein. Here, MarR from C. difficile (MarR C.difficile ) was subcloned and crystallized for the first time. MarR C.difficile was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli in a soluble form and was purified to near-homogeneity (&gt;95%) by a two-step purification protocol. The structure of MarR C.difficile has been solved at 2.3 Å resolution. The crystal belonged to the monoclinic space group P 4 3 2 1 2, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 66.569, c = 83.654 Å. The structure reported reveals MarR C.difficile to be a dimer, with each subunit consisting of six α-helices and three antiparallel β-hairpins. MarR C.difficile shows high structural similarity to the MarR proteins from E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus , indicating that MarR C.difficile might be a DNA-binding protein.",

The Kelch domain adopts a highly symmetric six-bladed β-propeller fold structure. Each blade of the β-propeller is composed of four antiparallel β-strands. Comparison of the Kelch-domain structures of NS1-BP and its homologues showed that the Gly–Gly pair in β-strand B and the hydrophobic Trp residue in β-strand D are highly conserved, while the B – C loops in blades 2 and 6 are variable.

    "abstract": "The identification of initial lead conditions for successful protein crystallization is crucial for structural studies using X-ray crystallography. In order to reduce the number of false-negative conditions, an emerging number of fluorescence-based methods have been developed which allow more efficient identification of protein crystals and help to distinguish them from salt crystals. Detection of the native tryptophan fluorescence of protein crystals is one of the most widely used methods. However, this method can fail owing to the properties of the crystallized protein or the chemical composition of the crystallization trials. Here, a simple, fast and cost-efficient method employing 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE) has been developed. It can be performed with a standard UV-light microscope and can be applied to cases in which detection of native tryptophan fluorescence fails. In four test cases this method had no effect on the diffraction properties of the crystals and no structural changes were observed. Further evidence is provided that TCE can be added to crystallization trials during their preparation, making this method compatible with high-throughput approaches.",

In order to gain insight into the mechanism of low-temperature tolerance by studying its three-dimensional crystal structure, prokaryotically expressed PicW2 dehydrin protein was purified using chitosan-affinity chromatography and gel filtration, and crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method. The crystal grew in a condition consisting of 0.1 M HEPES pH 8.0, 25%( w / v ) PEG 3350 using 4 mg ml −1 protein solution at 289 K.

The complex of the enzyme bound to the substrate OMP (PDB entry 2za1) would be of particular utility in this regard.

Here, the re-refinement of a set of three structures, the apo enzyme and two versions of the product-bound form (PDB entries 2za1, 2za2 and 2za3), is reported. The improved geometry and fit of these structures to the observed electron density will enhance their utility in antimalarial drug design.",

An imaging system has been designed and prototyped which automatically captures images from multi-well protein-crystallization experiments using both standard and fluorescent imaging techniques at a cost 28 times lower than current market rates. The machine uses a Panowin F1 3D printer as a base and controls it using G-code commands sent from a Python script running on a desktop computer. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to enable users to control the machine and facilitate image capture, classification and editing. A 488 nm laser diode and a 525 nm filter were incorporated to allow in situ fluorescent imaging of proteins trace-labeled with a fluorophore, Alexa Fluor 488. The instrument was primarily designed using a 3D printer and augmented using commercially available parts, and this publication aims to serve as a guide for comparable in-laboratory robotics projects.",

Substitution of the calcium ions bound to the desmoglein domains by terbium ions allowed confirmation of the X-ray model using their anomalous scattering and shows that at least one binding site per cluster of calcium ions is intact and exchangeable and, combined with SAXS data, that the cadherin domains are folded even in the distal part that is invisible in the cryo-EM reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The structure of the MP-4 protein was previously determined at a resolution of 2.8 Å. Owing to the unavailability of gene-sequence information at the time, the side-chain assignment was carried out on the basis of a partial sequence available through Edman degradation, sequence homology to orthologs and electron density. The structure of MP-4 has now been determined at a higher resolution (2.22 Å) in another space group and all of the structural inferences that were presented in the previous report of the structure were validated. In addition, the present data allowed an improved assignment of side chains and enabled further analysis of the MP-4 structure, and the accuracy of the assignment was confirmed by the recently available gene sequence. The study reinforces the traditional concept that conservative interpretations of relatively low-resolution structures remain correct even with the availability of high-resolution data.",

    "abstract": "Cytisine, a natural product with high affinity for clinically relevant nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), is used as a smoking-cessation agent. The compound displays an excellent clinical profile and hence there is an interest in derivatives that may be further improved or find use in the treatment of other conditions. Here, the binding of a cytisine derivative modified by the addition of a 3-(hydroxypropyl) moiety (ligand 4 ) to Aplysia californica acetylcholine-binding protein ( Ac AChBP), a surrogate for nAChR orthosteric binding sites, was investigated. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the favorable binding of cytisine and its derivative to Ac AChBP is driven by the enthalpic contribution, which dominates an unfavorable entropic component. Although ligand 4 had a less unfavorable entropic contribution compared with cytisine, the affinity for Ac AChBP was significantly diminished owing to the magnitude of the reduction in the enthalpic component. The high-resolution crystal structure of the Ac AChBP– 4 complex indicated close similarities in the protein–ligand interactions involving the parts of 4 common to cytisine. The point of difference, the 3-(hydroxypropyl) substituent, appears to influence the conformation of the Met133 side chain and helps to form an ordered solvent structure at the edge of the orthosteric binding site.",

It plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of Legionella -containing vacuoles in L. pneumophila pathogenesis. Here, it is shown that PlaA has a main lysophospholipase activity to hydrolyze fatty-acyl groups in lysophospholipids. Although it has a very low phospholipase A activity to catalyze the hydrolysis of fatty-acyl groups in phospholipids, PlaA can bind phospholipids such as 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine with a dissociation constant of 11.1 µ M . Sequence-alignment analysis combined with activity assays revealed that PlaA contains a distinct substrate-binding site among the known structures of the phospholipase A family, implying that PlaA may present a novel mechanism for substrate recognition. Native PlaA and its selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted form were purified and crystallized by vapour diffusion in hanging drops at 296 K. Diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.0 Å for native PlaA protein and to a resolution of 2.7 Å for SeMet-substituted PlaA protein. The crystals of native PlaA belonged to the monoclinic space group P 2 1 , while the crystals of SeMet-substituted PlaA belonged to the primitive orthorhombic space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 . Initial phases for PlaA were obtained from SeMet SAD data sets.",

    "abstract": "Actophorin, which was recently tested for crystallization under microgravity on the International Space Station, was subjected to mutagenesis to identify a construct with improved biophysical properties that were expected to improve the extent of diffraction. First, 20 mutations, including one C-terminal deletion of three residues, were introduced individually into actophorin, resulting in modest increases in thermal stability of between +0.5°C and +2.2°C. All but two of the stabilizing mutants increased both the rates of severing F-actin filaments and of spontaneous polymerization of pyrenyl G-actin in vitro . When the individual mutations were combined into a single actophorin variant, Acto-2, the overall thermal stability was 22°C higher than that of wild-type actophorin. When an inactivating S2P mutation in Acto-2 was restored, Acto-2/P2S was more stable by 20°C but was notably more active than the wild-type protein. The inactivating S2P mutation reaffirms the importance that Ser2 plays in the F-actin-severing reaction. The crystal structure of Acto-2 was solved to 1.7 Å resolution in a monoclinic space group, a first for actophorin. Surprisingly, despite the increase in thermal stability, the extended β-turn region, which is intimately involved in interactions with F-actin, is disordered in one copy of Acto-2 in the asymmetric unit. These observations emphasize the complex interplay among protein thermal stability, function and dynamics.",

The crystal itself and the noncrystalline medium around the crystal can cause background noise during long-wavelength X-ray data collection, hampering native SAD phasing. Optimizing the crystal size and shape or removing noncrystalline sample portions have thus been considered to be effective means of improving the data quality. A crystal-processing machine that uses a deep-UV laser has been developed. The machine utilizes the pulsed UV laser soft ablation (PULSA) technique, which generates less heat than methods using infrared or visible lasers. Since protein crystals are sensitive to heat damage, PULSA is an appropriate method to process them. Integration of a high-speed Galvano scanner and a high-precision goniometer enables protein crystals to be shaped precisely and efficiently. Application of this crystal-processing machine to a long-wavelength X-ray diffraction experiment significantly improved the diffraction data quality and thereby increased the success rate in experimental phasing using anomalous diffraction from atoms.",

RTKs play a role in the control of most basic cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and metabolism.

Monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular part of RTKs might be of importance to prevent tumor cell growth: targeting extracellular kringle domain molecules induces the internalization of RORs and decreases cell toxicity.

Although it has been assigned various regulatory roles, its core catalytic function is that of an RNA endonuclease. However, its catalytic efficiency is comparatively low and this has been linked to a unique C-terminal helix which partially blocks its RNA-binding site. Assuming that binding to its RNA substrate could trigger a conformational rearrangement, much speculation has arisen on the topic of the interaction of angiogenin with RNA. To date, no structural data on angiogenin–RNA interactions have been available. Here, the structure of angiogenin bound to a double-stranded RNA duplex is reported. The RNA does not reach the active site of angiogenin and no structural arrangement of the C-terminal domain is observed. However, angiogenin forms a previously unobserved crystallographic dimer that makes several backbone interactions with the major and minor grooves of the RNA double helix.",

Probiotic bacteria display a wide range of catabolic activities, which determine their competitiveness in vivo . Some lactobacilli are heterofermentative and can metabolize pentoses, using a pathway in which transketolase and transaldolase are key enzymes. L. salivarius UCC118 is capable of pentose utilization because it encodes the key enzymes on a megaplasmid. The crystal structures of the megaplasmid-encoded transketolase with and without the enzyme cofactor thiamine pyrophosphate have been determined. Comparisons with other known transketolase structures reveal a high degree of structural conservation in both the catalytic site and the overall conformation. This work extends structural knowledge of the transketolases to the industrially and commercially important Lactobacillus genus.",

These lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized peptides that possess high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including clinically challenging pathogens, and are therefore potential alternatives to antibiotics. All lantibiotic producer strains and some Gram-positive nonproducer strains express protein systems to circumvent a suicidal effect or to become resistant, respectively. Two-component systems consisting of a response regulator and a histidine kinase upregulate the expression of these proteins. One of the best-characterized lantibiotics is nisin, which is produced by Lactococcus lactis and possesses bactericidal activity against various Gram-positive bacteria, including some human pathogenic strains. Within many human pathogenic bacterial strains inherently resistant to nisin, a response regulator, NsrR, has been identified which regulates the expression of proteins involved in nisin resistance. In the present study, an expression and purification protocol was established for the NsrR protein from Streptococcus agalactiae COH1. The protein was successfully crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method, resulting in crystals that diffracted X-rays to 1.4 Å resolution.",

    "abstract": "A decade ago Acta Crystallographica Section F was launched with the subtitle Structural Biology and Crystallization Communications under the excellent stewardship of Howard Einspahr and Mitchell Guss. The journal was conceived in response to developments in the field when it was recognized that our community needed a home for the rapid dissemination of structural results and a convenient way to publish crystallization reports. The founding Editors made a commitment to maintain scientific rigor and to best serve our community, the authors and readers. Since 2005 we have all strived to do just that. Of course time is relentless and the advances in biomolecular sciences, macromolecular crystallography in particular, have continued apace. Research that was considered challenging a decade ago is now routine, and is often carried out using standard reagents and protocols. However, the results generated have enriched the scientific literature, and expanded the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and other repositories. For some time now, and driven by advances in our discipline, we have been thinking about what would be considered best for the journal with respect to crystallization papers. We at first decided to change the journal’s subtitle to Structural Biology Communications to remove the artificial segregation of crystallization from structural biology and to pave the way for Acta Cryst. F to become a full-fledged structural biology journal (Einspahr & Weiss, 2013 ▶). We also analyzed the papers that have focused on crystallization results (Weiss & Einspahr, 2013a ▶; Newman et al., 2013 ▶) and decided that in order to streamline their information content, a more formal structure should be put in place for these papers (Weiss & Einspahr, 2013b ▶). This led to the development of publBio (http://publbio.iucr.org), which is now widely used to prepare and submit manuscripts for Acta Cryst. F.\r\n\r\nThere is still some way to go and it seems that it is now time to raise the bar even higher! We have decided that we will no longer publish articles on the routine preparation and characterization of macromolecules for which orthologues have already been published or deposited. Furthermore, for a new crystallized macromolecule we expect a degree of characterization not previously required. For example, it will become essential to demonstrate that the correct macromolecule has been crystallized. Further details are available in the new Notes for Authors, available from the Acta Cryst. F author services page (http://journals.iucr.org/f/services/authorservices.html). We are also thinking about requiring the deposition of a diffraction data set together with the submission of a manuscript that reports a successful crystallization. After all, the diffraction data set is evidence for crystallization and is typically described in the paper. Further, activity parameters will be required if an enzyme is the subject of the work and, for certain proteins or modules, information from a binding assay and the characterization of quaternary structure would be sought to provide proof of function and assignment. The decision to require more data and to publish more interesting macromolecules has been driven by two considerations. Many crystallization communications do not lead to a structural paper or to citations. This suggests that such papers are of little interest or relevance to our community. Increasingly, it is also the case that the structure of the crystallized macromolecule, the subject of the crystallization paper, can be solved and refined quickly. In such a case we would prefer to see the structure published in our journal, with details of the sample preparation and characterization as part of the publication. We believe the outcome of these changes will improve the standard of publications yet maintain support for our community in keeping up to date with the current state of structural biology.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would like to use this editorial to thank and acknowledge everyone who has or continues to contribute to the journal as it enters its eleventh year. This extends from our founding Editors, the Editorial Board members, to the production team and of course our authors. Particular thanks however must go to those individuals who provide the carefully considered reviews on manuscripts. These are critical to what remains our charter – namely to ensure scientific rigor and to serve our community.",

Phosphate is an essential ion in all microrganisms owing its importance during the synthesis of macromolecules and in gene and protein regulation. Interestingly, X. citri has been identified to present two periplasmic binding proteins that have not been further characterized: PstS, from an ATP-binding cassette for high-affinity uptake and transport of phosphate, and PhoX, which is encoded by an operon that also contains a putative porin for the transport of phosphate. Here, the expression, purification and crystallization of the phosphate-binding protein PhoX and X-ray data collection at 3.0 Å resolution are described.

Thus, allosteric inhibitors of T. brucei UAP are unlikely to target Entamoeba UAPs.",

Infection is associated with mild to severe diarrhea that usually resolves spontaneously in healthy human adults, but may lead to severe complications in young children and in immunocompromised patients. The genome of C. parvum contains a gene, CUTA_CRYPI, that may play a role in regulating the intracellular concentration of copper, which is a toxic element in excess. Here, the crystal structure of this CutA1 protein, Cp -CutA1, is reported at 2.0 Å resolution. As observed for other CutA1 structures, the 117-residue protein is a trimer with a core ferrodoxin-like fold. Circular dichroism spectroscopy shows little, in any, unfolding of Cp -CutA1 up to 353 K. This robustness is corroborated by 1 H– 15 N HSQC spectra at 333 K, which are characteristic of a folded protein, suggesting that NMR spectroscopy may be a useful tool to further probe the function of the CutA1 proteins. While robust, Cp -CutA1 is not as stable as the homologous protein from a hyperthermophile, perhaps owing to a wide β-bulge in β2 that protrudes Pro48 and Ser49 outside the β-sheet.",

Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases (RLHs) are one of the two major families of pattern-recognition receptors that can detect viral RNA. RIG-I, belonging to the RLH family, is capable of recognizing intracellular viral RNA from RNA viruses, including influenza virus and Ebola virus. Here, full-length human RIG-I (hRIG-I) was cloned in Escherichia coli and expressed in a recombinant form with a His-SUMO tag.

A homotetramer of 92-residue polypeptides, C1 binds to an approximate direct repeat similar to the transcription activator CII of coliphage λ. Despite this and several other similarities, including 57% sequence identity to coliphage CII, many biochemical observations on P22 C1 cannot be explained based on the structure of CII. To understand the molecular basis of these differences, C1 was overexpressed and purified and subjected to crystallization trials. Although no successful hits were obtained for the apoprotein, crystals could be obtained when the protein was subjected to crystallization trials in complex with a 23-mer promoter DNA fragment (P RE ). These crystals diffracted very well at the home source, allowing the collection of a 2.2 Å resolution data set.

Very quickly we decided to commission a set of articles on the state-of-the-art in the many different aspects of macromolecular crystallization. We decided to publish an article in each of the 2014 issues and to conclude the year by combining all the articles into what would be the definitive book of macromolecular crystallization. What we did not anticipate, however, was the overwhelming response of our prospective authors. There were so many interesting areas that authors were willing to cover that we ended up publishing almost twice as many of these articles. Therefore, the IYCr series is only now coming to a conclusion and it is this that we celebrate on this month’s cover.\r\n\r\nThe series has been an outstanding success with a total of 20 articles, and it will end with the publication of the final two articles early in 2016. Many of the papers in the series are already among the most downloaded and cited in our journal. Once we have published the final articles, the complete collection will become available to readers as a virtual issue online, and in other formats on demand. Further details will be provided soon, so watch this space!\r\n\r\nThe cover this month is a composite of illustrations that have appeared in IYCr articles over the last two years. We thank the authors of all the contributions to this series for their support of the project. We also especially thank Professors Alex McPherson, Juan Manuel Garcia-Ruiz and Bernhard Rupp for their advice and guidance as the series evolved.\r\n\r\nIt is ten years since Acta Cryst. F first devoted its cover illustration to images of crystals. In this time the journal has moved from an almost purely crystallization journal to a full-fledged structural biology journal. It now publishes structural biology research involving a range of structural biology techniques including crystallography, NMR, cryoEM and others, and we look forward to developing the journal further.",

They rely on the coordination between cortical polarity and the orientation of the mitotic spindle, which is orchestrated by microtubule pulling motors recruited at the cortex by NuMA-LGN-Gαi complexes. LGN has emerged as a central component of the spindle-orientation pathway that is conserved throughout species. Its domain structure consists of an N-terminal TPR domain associating with NuMA, followed by four GoLoco motifs binding to Gαi subunits. The LGN(TPR) region is also involved in interactions with other membrane-associated proteins ensuring the correct cortical localization of microtubule motors, among which is the junctional protein afadin. To investigate the architecture of LGN(TPR) in complex with afadin, a chimeric fusion protein with a native linker derived from the region of afadin upstream of the LGN-binding domain was generated. The fusion protein behaves as a globular monomer in solution and readily crystallizes in the presence of sulfate-containing reservoirs. The crystals diffracted to 3.0 Å resolution and belonged to the cubic space group P213, with unit-cell parameter a = 170.3 Å. The structure of the engineered protein revealed that the crystal packing is promoted by the coordination of sulfate ions by residues of the afadin linker region and LGN(TPR).",

    "abstract": "A tetrahydrofolate-dependent O -demethylase, LigM, from Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. However, the obtained P 3 1 21 or P 3 2 21 crystals, which diffracted to 2.5–3.3 Å resolution, were hemihedrally twinned. To overcome the twinning problem, microseeding using P 3 1 21/ P 3 2 21 crystals as microseeds was performed with optimization of the reservoir conditions. As a result, another crystal form was obtained. The newly obtained crystal diffracted to 2.5–3.0 Å resolution and belonged to space group P 2 1 2 1 2, with unit-cell parameters a = 102.0, b = 117.3, c = 128.1 Å. The P 2 1 2 1 2 crystals diffracted to better than 2.0 Å resolution after optimizing the cryoconditions. Phasing using the single anomalous diffraction method was successful at 3.0 Å resolution with a Pt-derivative crystal. This experience suggested that microseeding is an effective method to overcome the twinning problem, even when twinned crystals are utilized as microseeds.",

    "abstract": "The majority of modern anticancer approaches target DNA/protein targets involved in tumour-cell proliferation. Such approaches have a major drawback, as nonproliferating cancer cells remain unaffected and may cause relapse or remission. Human coatomer protein complex I (COPI) subunit ζ (Copζ), a component of the coat protein involved in cell apoptosis and intracellular trafficking, has recently been proposed as a potential anticancer drug target. Previous studies have shown that two different isoforms of the Copζ subunit exist in mammalian cells. While normal cells express both Copζ1 and Copζ2 isoforms, various types of tumour cells display a loss of Copζ2 expression and rely solely on Copζ1 for growth and survival. Subsequent knockdown of Copζ1 results in specific inhibition of both proliferating and dormant tumour-cell populations, with no adverse growth effects on normal cells. Therefore, a Copζ1-targeting therapy was proposed to bypass the problem of dormant cancer cells that are resistant to conventional antiproliferative drugs, which is the major cause of tumour relapse. In order to aid in structure-based inhibitor design, a crystal structure is required. In this article, the recombinant expression, purification, crystallization and crystal structure of Copζ1, as well as the expression and purification of Copζ2, are reported.",

In order to elucidate the enzyme–acetyl-CoA interactions leading to catalysis, acetyl-CoA substrate analogs are needed. One possible analog for use in structural studies is acetyl-oxa(dethia)CoA (AcOCoA), in which the thioester S atom of CoA is replaced by an O atom. Here, structures of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase III (CATIII) and Escherichia coli ketoacylsynthase III (FabH) from crystals grown in the presence of partially hydrolyzed AcOCoA and the respective nucleophile are presented. Based on the structures, the behavior of AcOCoA differs between the enzymes, with FabH reacting with AcOCoA and CATIII being unreactive. The structure of CATIII reveals insight into the catalytic mechanism, with one active site of the trimer having relatively clear electron density for AcOCoA and chloramphenicol and the other active sites having weaker density for AcOCoA. One FabH structure contains a hydrolyzed AcOCoA product oxa(dethia)CoA (OCoA), while the other FabH structure contains an acyl-enzyme intermediate with OCoA. Together, these structures provide preliminary insight into the use of AcOCoA for enzyme structure–function studies with different nucleophiles.",

Simulation of the product sialic acid in the active-site pocket together with functional analysis enables clear identification of the key residues that are required for substrate binding and catalysis. Moreover, structural comparison with other sialidases reveals distinct features of the active-site pocket which might confer substrate specificity.

The anhydrobiotic tardigrades are some of the toughest micro-animals. They have an expanded set of genes for antioxidant proteins such as SODs. These proteins are thought to play an essential role in oxidative stress resistance in critical situations such as desiccation, although their functions at the molecular level have yet to be explored. Here, crystal structures of a copper/zinc-containing SOD ( Rv SOD15) from an anhydrobiotic tardigrade, Ramazzottius varieornatus strain YOKOZUNA-1, are reported. In Rv SOD15, one of the histidine ligands of the catalytic copper center is replaced by a valine (Val87). The crystal structures of the wild type and the V87H mutant show that even though a histidine is placed at position 87, a nearby flexible loop can destabilize the coordination of His87 to the Cu atom. Model structures of other Rv SODs were investigated and it was found that some of them are also unusual SODs, with features such as deletion of the electrostatic loop or β3 sheet and unusual metal-binding residues. These studies show that Rv SOD15 and some other Rv SODs may have evolved to lose the SOD function, suggesting that gene duplications of antioxidant proteins do not solely explain the high stress tolerance of anhydrobiotic tardigrades.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria regulate virulence by using two-component systems (TCSs) composed of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR). TCSs respond to environmental signals and change gene-expression levels. The HK QseE and the RR QseF regulate the virulence of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli . The operon encoding QseE/QseF also contains a gene encoding an outer membrane lipoprotein, qseG . The protein product QseG interacts with QseE in the periplasmic space to control the activity of QseE and constitutes a unique QseE/F/G three-component system. However, the structural bases of their functions are unknown. Here, crystal structures of the periplasmic regions of QseE and QseG were determined with the help of AlphaFold models. The periplasmic region of QseE has a helix-bundle structure as found in some HKs. The QseG structure is composed of an N-terminal globular domain and a long C-terminal helix forming a coiled-coil-like structure that contributes to dimerization. Comparison of QseG structures obtained from several crystallization conditions shows that QseG has structural polymorphisms at the C-terminus of the coiled-coil structure, indicating that the C-terminus is flexible. The C-terminal flexibility is derived from conserved hydrophilic residues that reduce the hydrophobic interaction at the coiled-coil interface. Electrostatic surface analysis suggests that the C-terminal coiled-coil region can interact with QseE. The observed structural fluctuation of the C-terminus of QseG is probably important for interaction with QseE.",

In particular, the major products of XynAS9 are xylose and xylobiose, which enable the subsequent bioconversion to be carried out with higher efficiency. Therefore, the three-dimensional structure of XynAS9 and its catalytic machinery are of great interest. Here, recombinant XynAS9 protein was expressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and crystallized.

Here, the first X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of this enzyme (ND-AspRS 1–104 ) from the human-pathogenic bacterium Helicobacter pylori is reported at 2.0 Å resolution. The apo form of H. pylori ND-AspRS 1–104 shares high structural similarity with the N-terminal anticodon-binding domains of the discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (D-AspRS) from Escherichia coli and ND-AspRS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa , allowing recognition elements to be proposed for tRNA Asp and tRNA Asn . It is proposed that a long loop (Arg77–Lys90) in this H. pylori domain influences its relaxed tRNA specificity, such that it is classified as nondiscriminating. A structural comparison between D-AspRS from E. coli and ND-AspRS from P. aeruginosa suggests that turns E and F ( 78 GAGL 81 and 83 NPKL 86 ) in H. pylori ND-AspRS play a crucial role in anticodon recognition. Accordingly, the conserved Pro84 in turn F facilitates the recognition of the anticodons of tRNA Asp ( 34 GUC 36 ) and tRNA Asn ( 34 GUU 36 ). The absence of the amide H atom allows both C and U bases to be accommodated in the tRNA-recognition site.",

Structural alignment with the closely related Rhodobacter sphaeroides malyl-CoA lyase complexed with Mg 2+ , oxalate and CoA allows a detailed analysis of the domain motion of the enzyme caused by substrate binding. Alignment of the structures shows that a simple hinge motion centered on the conserved residues Phe268 and Thr269 moves the C-terminal domain by about 30° relative to the rest of the molecule. This domain motion positions a conserved aspartate residue located in the C-terminal domain in the active site of the adjacent monomer, which may serve as a general acid/base in the catalytic mechanism.",

Although their sequence similarity is very low, structural comparison reveals that VqsR-N has a conserved enclosed cavity which could recognize acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) as in other LuxR-type AHL receptors. The structure suggests that VqsR could be a potential AHL receptor.",

These modifications included an n -butyl and n -octyl extension as well as hydroxyl, amine and carboxyl substitutions. The atomic structures of the complexes and the binding kinetics for each modified meditope indicated that each extension threaded through the Fab `hole' and that the carboxyethylarginine substitution makes a favorable interaction with the Fab, increasing the half-life of the complex by threefold compared with the unmodified meditope.

Currently, multi-enzymatic pre-treatment of biomass is a crucial step in making carbohydrates more accessible for subsequent fermentation. Using bioinformatics analysis, endo-β-(1,4)-glucanase from Dictyoglomus thermophilum (DtCel5H) was identified as a new member of glycosyl hydrolase family 5. The gene encoding DtCel5H was cloned and the recombinant protein was overexpressed for crystallization and biophysical studies. Here, it is shown that this enzyme is active on cellulose substrates and is highly thermostable. Crystals suitable for crystallographic investigations were also obtained in different crystallization conditions. In particular, ordered crystals of DtCel5H were obtained using either ammonium sulfate or polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a precipitant agent. The crystals obtained in the presence of ammonium sulfate belonged to space group P32, with unit-cell parameters a = 73.1, b = 73.1, 73.1, c = 127.8 Å, and diffracted to 1.5 Å resolution, whereas the second crystal form belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 49.3, b = 67.9, c = 103.7 Å, and diffracted to 1.6 Å resolution. The crystal structure was solved in both space groups using molecular-replacement methods. Structure-activity and structure-stability studies of DtCel5H will provide insights for the design of high-performance enzymes.",

However, structural studies have shown that the hematopoietic receptor FLT3, a class III RTK, does not appear to engage in such receptor–receptor contacts, despite its efficient dimerization by dimeric FLT3 ligand (FL). As part of efforts to better understand the intricacies of FLT3 activation, we sought to engineer a monomeric FL. It was found that a Leu27Asp substitution at the dimer interface of the cytokine led to a stable monomeric cytokine (FL L27D ) without abrogation of receptor binding. The crystal structure of FL L27D at 1.65 Å resolution revealed that the introduced point mutation led to shielding of the hydrophobic footprint of the dimerization interface in wild-type FL without affecting the conformation of the FLT3 binding site. Thus, FL L27D can serve as a monomeric FL variant to further interrogate the assembly mechanism of extracellular complexes of FLT3 in physiology and disease.",

The presence in such complexes of phosphate-rich oligonucleotides offers the choice of a rapid method for the routine solution of DNA-binding proteins through the use of long-wavelength beamlines such as I23 at Diamond Light Source. This article reports the use of native intrinsic phosphorus and sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion methods to solve the complex of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) bound to its interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). The structure unexpectedly shows three molecules of the IRF4 DBD bound to one ISRE.

Ligilactobacillus ruminis , a strict anaerobe and gut autochthonous (indigenous) commensal, relies on sortase-dependent pili (LrpCBA) for adherence to the intestinal inner walls, thereby withstanding luminal content flow. Here, the LrpCBA pilus is a promiscuous binder to gut collagen, fibronectin and epithelial cells. Structurally, the LrpCBA pilus displays a representative hetero-oligomeric arrangement and consists of three types of pilin subunit, each with its own location and function, i.e. tip LrpC for adhesion, basal LrpB for anchoring and backbone LrpA for length. To provide further structural insights into the assembly, anchoring and functional mechanisms of sortase-dependent pili, each of the L. ruminis pilus proteins was produced recombinantly for crystallization and X-ray diffraction analysis. Crystals of LrpC, LrpB, LrpA and truncated LrpA generated by limited proteolysis were obtained and diffracted to resolutions of 3.0, 1.5, 2.2 and 1.4 Å, respectively. Anomalous data were also collected from crystals of selenomethionine-substituted LrpC and an iodide derivative of truncated LrpA.

    "abstract": "The substrate-binding protein YfeA (also known as YPO2439 or y1897) is a polyspecific metal-binding protein that is crucial for nutrient acquisition and virulence in Yersinia pestis , the causative microbe of plague. YfeA folds into a monomeric c-clamp like other substrate-binding proteins and has two metal-binding sites (sites 1 and 2). Site 2 is a bidentate surface site capable of binding Zn and Mn atoms and is a unique feature of YfeA. Occasionally, the site 2 residues of two YfeA molecules will cooperate with the histidine tag of a third YfeA molecule in coordinating the same metal and lead to metal-dependent crystallographic packing. Here, three crystal structures of YfeA are presented at 1.85, 2.05 and 2.25 Å resolution. A comparison of the structures reveals that the metal can be displaced at five different locations ranging from ∼4 to ∼16 Å away from the canonical site 2. These observations reveal different configurations of site 2 that enable cooperative metal binding and demonstrate how site 2 is dynamic and freely available for inter-protein metal coordination.",

TTE0866 catalyzes the deacetylation of highly substituted cellulose acetate and is expected to be useful for industrial applications in the reuse of resources. In this study, the crystal structure of TTE0866 (residues 23–324) was successfully determined. The crystal diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution and belonged to space group I 2 1 2 1 2 1 . The catalytic domain (residues 136–321) exhibited a (β/α) 7 -barrel topology. However, electron density was not observed for the NTR (residues 23–135). The crystal packing revealed the presence of an intermolecular space without observable electron density, indicating that the NTR occupies this space without a defined conformation or was truncated during the crystallization process. Although the active-site conformation of TTE0866 was found to be highly similar to those of other CE4 enzymes, the orientation of its Trp264 side chain near the active site was clearly distinct. The unique orientation of the Trp264 side chain formed a different-shaped cavity within TTE0866, which may contribute to its reactivity towards highly substituted cellulose acetate.",

Although there are reports of computational studies on the activity of the enzyme with mutations at tyrosine residues, no studies concerning the crystal structure of its mutants have been found. In this study, the function of Tyr91 was investigated in detail by comparing the crystal structures of mutants and their complexes with substrate analogs. In this study, tyrosine, a conserved amino acid near the active-site loop in the C-terminal domain of Sulfurisphaera tokodaii MGMT (StoMGMT), was mutated to phenylalanine to produce a Y91F mutant, and the cysteine which is responsible for receiving the methyl group in the active site was mutated to a serine to produce a C120S mutant. A Y91F/C120S double-mutant StoMGMT was also created. The function of tyrosine is discussed based on the crystal structure of Y91F mutant StoMGMT. The crystal structures of StoMGMT were determined at resolutions of 1.13–2.60 Å. They showed no structural changes except in the mutated part. No electron density for deoxyguanosine or methyl groups was observed in the structure of Y91F mutant crystals immersed in O 6 -methyl-2′-deoxyguanosine, nor was the group oxidized in wild-type StoMGMT. Therefore, the hydroxy group of Tyr91 may prevent the oxidant from entering the active site. This suggests that tyrosine, which is highly conserved at the N-terminus of the helix–turn–helix motif across species, protects the active site of MGMTs, which are deactivated after repairing only one alkyl adduct. Overall, the results may provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which high levels of conserved amino acids play a role in ensuring the integrity of suicide enzymes, in addition to promoting their activity.",

The Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Diseases (SSGCID) expressed recombinant Bb NDK protein. The protein was crystallized and structures were solved of both the apoenzyme and a liganded form with ADP and vanadate ligands. This provided two structures and allowed the elucidation of changes between the apo and ligand-bound enzymes. Infectivity studies with ndk transposon mutants demonstrated that NDK function was important for establishing a robust infection in mice, and provided a rationale for therapeutic targeting of Bb NDK. The protein structure was compared with other NDK structures found in the Protein Data Bank and was found to have similar primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures, with conserved residues acting as the catalytic pocket, primarily using His132 as the phosphohistidine-transfer residue. Vanadate and ADP complexes model the transition state of this phosphoryl-transfer reaction, demonstrating that the pocket closes when bound to ADP, while allowing the addition or removal of a γ-phosphate.

Joosten (van Beusekom et al., 2018).Their PDB-REDO project gives crystallography a second chance to explain electron densities through automation, and with so many incorrect structures there is plenty of room for improvement.Recently in 2018, in addition to the developments presented in this issue and those recently introduced in Agirre et al. (2017), we have seen the introduction of a new semiautomated modelling tool for protein N-glycosylation in Coot (Emsley & Crispin, 2018) and the three-dimensional visualization of glycans, based on the standard Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG), in LiteMol (Sehnal et al., 2017), which is readily available for every carbohydrate-containing structure at PDBe (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ pdbe/litemol).Also a plethora of new developments can be found at glycosciences.de, the web portal stalwart that has supported carbohydrate structure determination for more than a decade.An example of how this portal serves the community can be found in the review of the conformations of the type-1 lacto-N-biose I unit in protein complex structures published in this issue (Fushinobu, 2018).",

    "abstract": "Crystal structure determination requires solving the phase problem. This can be accomplished using ab initio direct methods for small molecules and macromolecules at resolutions higher than 1.2 Å, whereas macromolecular structure determination at lower resolution requires either molecular replacement using a homologous structure or experimental phases using a derivative such as covalent labeling (for example selenomethionine or mercury derivatization) or heavy-atom soaking (for example iodide ions). Here, a case is presented in which crystals were obtained from a 30.8 kDa protein sample and yielded a 1.6 Å resolution data set with a unit cell that could accommodate approximately 8 kDa of protein. Thus, it was unclear what had been crystallized. Molecular replacement with pieces of homologous proteins and attempts at iodide ion soaking failed to yield a solution. The crystals could not be reproduced. Sequence-independent molecular replacement using the structures available in the Protein Data Bank also failed to yield a solution. Ultimately, ab initio structure solution proved successful using the program ARCIMBOLDO , which identified two α-helical elements and yielded interpretable maps. The structure was the C-terminal dimerization domain of the intended target from Mycobacterium smegmatis . This structure is presented as a user-friendly test case in which an unknown protein fragment could be determined using ARCIMBOLDO .",

    "abstract": "We are pleased to present in this issue a collection of invited contributions on current state-of-the-art cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).These contributions are to acknowledge and reflect the transformational changes in the discipline of modern cryo-EM in the past few years that have led to a remarkable number of high-resolution cryo-EM structures of isolated biological macromolecules being solved for the first time.In this context, 2017 was a particularly notable year, with the Nobel prize in Chemistry awarded jointly to Jacques Dubochet, Richard Henderson and Joachim Frank for the development of cryo-EM (Callaway, 2017), which highlighted the current progress.The meteoric progress of cryo-EM has been enabled by the availability of direct detectors, high-throughput ultra-stable 300 kV electron microscopes and clever imageprocessing algorithms exploiting powerful computer hardware.These advances have facilitated the generation of density maps for de novo semi-automated atomic modelling (Terwilliger et al., 2018), often in just a few days (Kimanius et al., 2016).Large macromolecular complexes (>MDa), requiring handling of very large volumes of image data that was not manageable until only a few years ago, are being increasingly investigated.In addition, attractive aspects, such as the requirement for relatively small amounts of a sample that does not need to be purified to biochemical homogeneity and the fact that no crystals are required, have contributed significantly to cryo-EM's current popularity in structural biology.The Topical Review (Mitra, 2019) published in this collection provides an historical background to advances in methods development in transmission electron microscopy, and how it has evolved into the discipline of modern cryo-EM as applied to biological macromolecules.It discusses the present state of the art and indicates the likely direction of future developments.Three Research Communications discuss important issues in contemporary highresolution cryo-EM image processing.In cryo-EM, single-particle analysis (SPA) is based on averaging low-contrast (low signal-to-noise ratio) 2D projection images to ameliorate the effect of noise and thereby enhance the resolution of the 3D reconstruction.Radermacher and Ruiz discuss the influence of noise in such cross-correlation analysis, and indicate an optimum method to 'correct' for the major effect of noise in scrutinizing possible bias in image alignments and classification (Radermacher & Ruiz, 2019).With regard to the exact definition of resolution, it should be noted here that there is no rock-solid consensus in cryo-EM SPA.Nevertheless, an interesting question on the relationship of image-pool size and achievable resolution is addressed by Heymann, who surmises that beyond reaching a nominal resolution (e.g.near atomic, 4 A ˚) limited by factors such as sample variability, attempts to achieve atomic resolution may require an order-of-magnitude enhancement of the image pool (Heymann, 2019).The 2D images recorded in SPA capture any discreet or continuous conformational heterogeneity that can be at the core of biological function.Unless separated into homogeneous pools, image heterogeneity can compromise the resolution achieved.On this important theme, Sorzano and colleagues review approaches using theoretical angles of dynamics and modelling that are being applied in the field to analyze heterogeneity (Sorzano et al., 2019).Such studies could be supplemented by incorporating direct analysis of experimental images, as proposed recently for instance (Frank, 2018).",

The crystal structures of the anti-(6–4) photoproduct antibody 64M-5 Fab and of its complex with dT(6–4)T were determined at 2.5 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. A comparison between the dT(6–4)T-liganded and unliganded structures indicates that the side chain of His93L is greatly rotated and shifted on binding to dT(6–4)T, leading to the formation of an electrostatic interaction with the phosphate moiety of dT(6–4)T, which shows a remarkable induced fit. Based on a comparison of the dT(6–4)T-liganded structures of the 64M-5 and 64M-2 Fabs, the electrostatic interaction between the side chain of His93L in 64M-5 and the phosphate moiety of dT(6–4)T is lost for Leu93L in 64M-2, while Arg90L in 64M-5 instead of Gln90L in 64M-2 stabilizes the conformation of complementarity-determining region (CDR) L3. These differences contribute to the higher affinity of 64M-5 for dT(6–4)T compared with that of 64M-2.",

    "abstract": "The thick outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria performs an important protective role against hostile environments, supports cell integrity, and contributes to surface adhesion and in some cases also to virulence. A major component of the OM is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a complex glycolipid attached to a core containing fatty-acyl chains. The assembly and transport of lipid A, the membrane anchor for LPS, to the OM begins when a heteromeric LptB 2 FG protein complex extracts lipid A from the outer leaflet of the inner membrane. This process requires energy, and upon hydrolysis of ATP one component of the heteromeric assembly, LptB, triggers a conformational change in LptFG in support of lipid A transport. A structure of LptB from the intracellular pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei is reported here. LptB forms a dimer that displays a relatively fixed structure irrespective of whether it is in complex with LptFG or in isolation. Highly conserved sequence and structural features are discussed that allow LptB to fuel the transport of lipid A.",

This process involves ER membrane-embedded ubiquitin E2 and E3 enzymes, as well as a soluble E2 enzyme (Ubc7 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and UBE2G2 in mammals). E2-binding regions (E2BRs) that recruit these soluble ERAD E2s to the ER have been identified in humans and S. cerevisiae , and structures of E2–E2BR complexes from both species have been determined. In addition to sequence and structural differences between the human and S. cerevisiae E2BRs, the binding of E2BRs also elicits different biochemical outcomes with respect to E2 charging by E1 and E2 discharge. Here, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe E2BR was identified and purified with Ubc7 to resolve a 1.7 Å resolution co-crystal structure of the E2BR in complex with Ubc7. The S. pombe E2BR binds to the back side of the E2 as an α-helix and, while differences exist, it exhibits greater similarity to the human E2BR. Structure-based sequence alignments reveal differences and conserved elements among these species. Structural comparisons and biochemistry reveal that the S. pombe E2BR presents a steric impediment to E1 binding and inhibits E1-mediated charging, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Moenomycin-type antibiotics are phosphoglycolipids that are notable for their unique modes of action and have proven to be useful in animal nutrition. The gene clusters tchm from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus and moe from Streptomyces are among a limited number of known moenomycin-biosynthetic pathways. Most genes in tchm have counterparts in the moe cluster, except for tchmy and tchmz , the functions of which remain unknown. Sequence analysis indicates that TchmY belongs to the isoprenoid enzyme C2-like superfamily and may serve as a prenylcyclase. The enzyme was proposed to be involved in terminal cyclization of the moenocinyl chain in teichomycin, leading to the diumycinol chain of moenomycin isomers. Here, recombinant TchmY protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and its crystal structure was solved by SIRAS. Structural analysis and comparison with other prenylcyclases were performed. The overall fold of TchmY consists of an (α/α) 6 -barrel, and a potential substrate-binding pocket is found in the central chamber. These results should provide important information regarding the biosynthetic basis of moenomycin antibiotics.",

Some Nocardia species can infect humans and are usually considered to be opportunist pathogens, as they often infect immunocompromised patients. Although their clinical incidence is low, many Nocardia species are now considered to be emerging pathogens. Primary sites of infection by Nocardia are the skin or the lungs, but dissemination to other body parts is very frequent. These disseminated infections are very difficult to treat and thus are tackled with multiple classes of antibiotics, in addition to the traditional treatment targeting the folate pathway. β-Lactams are often included in the regimen, but many Nocardia species present moderate or strong resistance to some members of this drug class. Genomic, microbiological and biochemical studies have reported the presence of class A β-lactamases (ABLs) in a handful of Nocardia species, but no structural investigation of Nocardia β-lactamases has yet been performed. In this study, the expression, purification and preliminary biochemical characterization of an ABL from an N. cyriacigeorgica (NCY-1) clinical strain are reported. The crystallization and the very high resolution crystal structure of NCY-1 are also described. The sequence and structural analysis of the protein demonstrate that NCY-1 belongs to the class A1 β-lactamases and show its very high conservation with ABLs from other human-pathogenic Nocardia . In addition, the presence of one molecule of citrate tightly bound in the catalytic site of the enzyme is described. This structure may provide a solid basis for future drug development to specifically target Nocardia spp. β-lactamases.",

There are seven enzymes in the MEP pathway, the third of which is IspD. Two crystal structures of Burkholderia thailandensis IspD ( Bt IspD) were determined: an apo structure and that of a complex with cytidine triphosphate (CTP). Comparison of the CTP-bound Bt IspD structure with the apo structure revealed that CTP binding stabilizes the loop composed of residues 13–19. The apo structure of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis IspD ( Mp IspD) is also reported. The melting temperatures of Mp IspD and Bt IspD were evaluated by circular dichroism. The moderate T m values suggest that a thermal shift assay may be feasible for future inhibitor screening. Finally, the binding affinity of CTP for Bt IspD was evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. These structural and biophysical data will aid in the discovery of IspD inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Imaging scaffolds composed of designed protein cages fused to designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) have enabled the structure determination of small proteins by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). One particularly well characterized scaffold type is a symmetric tetrahedral assembly composed of 24 subunits, 12 A and 12 B, which has three cargo-binding DARPins positioned on each vertex. Here, the X-ray crystal structure of a representative tetrahedral scaffold in the apo state is reported at 3.8 Å resolution. The X-ray crystal structure complements recent cryo-EM findings on a closely related scaffold, while also suggesting potential utility for crystallographic investigations. As observed in this crystal structure, one of the three DARPins, which serve as modular adaptors for binding diverse `cargo' proteins, present on each of the vertices is oriented towards a large solvent channel. The crystal lattice is unusually porous, suggesting that it may be possible to soak crystals of the scaffold with small (≤30 kDa) protein cargo ligands and subsequently determine cage–cargo structures via X-ray crystallography. The results suggest the possibility that cryo-EM scaffolds may be repurposed for structure determination by X-ray crystallography, thus extending the utility of electron-microscopy scaffold designs for alternative structural biology applications.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is an infectious disease pathogen that poses a significant global health threat due to its potential to cause severe infections and its tendency to exhibit multidrug resistance. Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases (Kp-NRs) from Kp is crucial for the development of effective nitrofuran drugs, such as nitrofurantoin, that can be activated as antibiotics. In this paper, three crystal structures of two Kp-NRs (PDB entries 7tmf/7tmg and 8dor) are presented, and an analysis of their crystal structures and their flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding mode is provided. The structures with PDB codes 7tmf (Kp-NR1a), 7tmg (Kp-NR1b) and 8dor (Kp-NR2) were determined at resolutions of 1.97, 1.90 and 1.35 Å, respectively. The Kp-NR1a and Kp-NR1b structures adopt an αβ fold, in which four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets are surrounded by five helices. With domain swapping, the β-sheet was expanded with a β-strand from the other molecule of the dimer. The difference between the structures lies in the loop spanning Leu173-Ala185: in Kp-NR1a the loop is disordered, whereas the loop adopts multiple conformations in Kp-NR1b. The FMN interactions within Kp-NR1/NR2 involve hydrogen-bond and π-stacking interactions. Kp-NR2 contains four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets surrounded by eight helices with two short helices and one β-sheet. Structural and sequence alignments show that Kp-NR1a/b and Kp-NR2 are homologs of the Escherichia coli oxygen-insensitive NRs YdjA and NfnB and of Enterobacter cloacae NR, respectively. By homology inference from E. coli, Kp-NR1a/b and Kp-NR2 may detoxify polynitroaromatic compounds and Kp-NR2 may activate nitrofuran drugs to cause bactericidal activity through a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism, respectively.",

Currently, there are only five published PTPN2 structures and none are truly unbound due to the presence of a mutation, an inhibitor or a loop (related to crystal packing) in the active site. In this report, a novel crystal packing is revealed that resulted in a true apo PTPN2 crystal structure with an unbound active site, allowing the active site to be observed in a native apo state for the first time. Key residues related to accommodation in the active site became identifiable upon comparison with previously published PTPN2 structures. Structures of PTPN2 in complex with an established PTPN1 active-site inhibitor and an allosteric inhibitor were achieved through soaking experiments using these apo PTPN2 crystals. The increased structural understanding of apo PTPN2 and the ability to soak in inhibitors will aid the development of future PTPN2 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogenic oral bacterium that is responsible for periodontal disease. It is linked to chronic periodontitis, gingivitis and aggressive periodontitis. P. gingivalis exerts its pathogenic effects through mechanisms such as immune evasion and tissue destruction, primarily by secreting various factors, including cysteine proteases such as gingipain K (Kgp), gingipain R (RgpA and RgpB) and PrtH (UniProtKB ID P46071). Virulence proteins comprise multiple domains, including the pro-peptide region, catalytic domain, K domain, R domain and DUF2436 domain. While there is a growing database of knowledge on virulence proteins and domains, there was no prior evidence or information regarding the structure and biological function of the well conserved DUF2436 domain. In this study, the DUF2436 domain of PrtH from P. gingivalis (PgDUF2436) was determined at 2.21 Å resolution, revealing a noncanonical β-jelly-roll sandwich topology with two antiparallel β-sheets and one short α-helix. Although the structure of PgDUF2436 was determined by the molecular-replacement method using an AlphaFold model structure as a template, there were significant differences in the positions of β1 between the AlphaFold model and the experimentally determined PgDUF2436 structure. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool sequence-similarity search program showed no sequentially similar proteins in the Protein Data Bank. However, DaliLite search results using structure-based alignment revealed that the PgDUF2436 structure has structural similarity Z-scores of 5.9-5.4 with the C-terminal domain of AlgF, the D4 domain of cytolysin, IglE and the extracellular domain structure of PepT2. This study has elucidated the structure of the DUF2436 domain for the first time and a comparative analysis with similar structures has been performed.",

To overcome these difficulties, a two-pronged approach was followed: (i) the His-tag was moved from the C-terminus to the N-terminus and was made cleavable, and (ii) Adnectin (derived from the tenth domain of human fibronectin type III) crystallization chaperones were developed. Both approaches provided well diffracting crystals, but the latter approach yielded crystal forms with only one or two HSP47 complexes per asymmetric unit, which made model building less onerous.",

Subsequently, using β-galactosidase, it is shown that both stains can also successfully be employed for single-particle analysis, yielding virtually indistinguishable results from uranyl formate. As both replacement stains are nonradioactive, they are not subjected to the same handling restrictions as uranyl-based stains.

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies recognizing nonprotein antigens remain largely underrepresented in our understanding of the molecular repertoire of innate and adaptive immunity. One such antibody is Mannitou, a murine IgM that recognizes paucimannosidic glycans. In this work, we report the production and purification of the recombinant antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of Mannitou IgM (Mannitou Fab) and employ a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches to obtain its initial structural characterization. To this end, recombinant Mannitou Fab comprising the light chain (VL-CL) and heavy chain (VH-Cμ1) was produced in HEK293 FreeStyle cells and purified by cobalt-affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), which revealed two distinct oligomeric states consistent with a predominant monomeric form and a minor dimeric form. We employed SEC inline with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and SEC coupled to small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) to establish that Mannitou Fab indeed adopts monomeric and dimeric forms in solution. Interestingly, Mannitou Fab is N-glycosylated at Asn164 of the heavy chain via HexNAc(5)Hex(6)Fuc(1-3) as revealed by mass spectrometry. We leveraged this information in conjunction with predicted structures of Mannitou Fab to facilitate the interpretation and modelling of SAXS data, leading to a plausible model for glycosylated Mannitou Fab. Analysis of the two chromatographically isolatable forms of Mannitou Fab using synchrotron-radiation circular dichroism revealed that the heat-denaturated Mannitou Fab monomer shares similar secondary-structural elements with the Mannitou Fab dimer, indicating that the latter may be misfolded. Collectively, the findings of this study will set the stage for future structural studies of Mannitou Fab and contribute to our understanding of possible side products due to misfolding during the production of recombinant Fabs, highlighting the importance of glycosylation in obtaining stable and monodisperse monomeric forms of recombinant Fabs.",

    "abstract": "The nonribosomal biosynthesis of the dipeptide antibiotic bacilysin is achieved by the concerted action of multiple enzymes in the Bacillus subtilis bac operon. BacF (YwfG), encoded by the bacF gene, is a fold type I pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent stereospecific transaminase. Activity assays with L-phenylalanine and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (4HPP), a chemical analogue of tetrahydrohydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (H 4 HPP), revealed stereospecific substrate preferences, a finding that was consistent with previous reports on the role of this enzyme in bacilysin synthesis. The crystal structure of this dimeric enzyme was determined in its apo form as well as in substrate-bound and product-bound conformations. Two ligand-bound structures were determined by soaking BacF crystals with substrates (L-phenylalanine and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate). These structures reveal multiple catalytic steps: the internal aldimine with PLP and two external aldimine conformations that show the rearrangement of the external aldimine to generate product (L-tyrosine). Together, these structural snapshots provide an insight into the catalytic mechanism of this transaminase.",

    "abstract": "Factor for inversion stimulation (Fis) is a versatile bacterial nucleoid-associated protein that can directly bind and bend DNA to influence DNA topology. It also plays crucial roles in regulating bacterial virulence factors and in optimizing bacterial adaptation to various environments. Fis from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA4853, referred to as PaFis) has recently been found to be required for virulence by regulating the expression of type III secretion system (T3SS) genes. PaFis can specifically bind to the promoter region of exsA , which functions as a T3SS master regulator, to regulate its expression and plays an essential role in transcription elongation from exsB to exsA . Here, the crystal structure of PaFis, which is composed of a four-helix bundle and forms a homodimer, is reported. PaFis shows remarkable structural similarities to the well studied Escherichia coli Fis (EcFis), including an N-terminal flexible loop and a C-terminal helix–turn–helix (HTH) motif. However, the critical residues for Hin-catalyzed DNA inversion in the N-terminal loop of EcFis are not conserved in PaFis and further studies are required to investigate its exact role. A gel-electrophoresis mobility-shift assay showed that PaFis can efficiently bind to the promoter region of exsA . Structure-based mutagenesis revealed that several conserved basic residues in the HTH motif play essential roles in DNA binding. These structural and biochemical studies may help in understanding the role of PaFis in the regulation of T3SS expression and in virulence.",

Each subunit of this homodimeric enzyme consists of a cytochrome c domain and an eight-bladed β-propeller that binds the uncommon isobacteriochlorin heme d 1 as an essential part of its active site. Although NirS has been well studied mechanistically and structurally, the focus of previous studies has been on the active heme d 1 -bound form. The heme d 1 -free form of NirS reported here, which represents a premature state of the reductase, adopts an open conformation with the cytochrome c domains moved away from each other with respect to the active enzyme. Further, the movement of a loop around Trp498 seems to be related to a widening of the propeller, allowing easier access to the heme d 1 -binding side. Finally, a possible link between the open conformation of NirS and flagella formation in P. aeruginosa is discussed.",

CotE consists of an N-terminal peroxiredoxin domain and a C-terminal chitinase domain. Here, a C-terminal fragment of CotE comprising residues 349–712 has been crystallized and its structure has been determined to reveal a core eight-stranded β-barrel fold with a neighbouring subdomain containing a five-stranded β-sheet. A prominent groove running across the top of the barrel is lined by residues that are conserved in family 18 glycosyl hydrolases and which participate in catalysis. Electron density identified in the groove defines the pentapeptide Gly-Pro-Ala-Met-Lys derived from the N-terminus of the protein following proteolytic cleavage to remove an affinity-purification tag.

Here, the 1.80 Å resolution crystal structure of the N-terminal GTPase domain of L. donovani Rab5a in complex with GDP is presented. The crystal structure determination was enabled by the design of specific single-site mutations and two deletions that were made to stabilize the protein for previous NMR studies. The structure of LdRab5a shows the canonical GTPase fold, with a six-stranded central mixed β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices. The positions of the Switch I and Switch II loops confirm an open conformation, as expected in the absence of the γ-phosphate. However, in comparison to other GTP-bound and GDP-bound homologous proteins, the Switch I region traces a unique disposition in LdRab5a. One magnesium ion is bound to the protein at the GTP-binding site. Molecular-dynamics simulations indicate that the GDP-bound structure exhibits higher stability than the apo structure. The GDP-bound LdRab5a structure presented here will aid in efforts to unravel its interactions with its regulators, including the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, and will lay the foundation for a structure-based search for specific inhibitors",

    "abstract": "Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are metalloproteins that are responsible for the dismutation of superoxide anion radicals. SODs are consequently protective against oxidative damage to cellular components. Among other protective mechanisms, the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus has a well developed defense system to scavenge toxic free radicals using SODs during migration and sojourning of the microfilariae and adult worms in the human body. O. volvulus is responsible for the neglected disease onchocerciasis or `river blindness'. In the present study, an extracellular Cu/Zn-SOD from O. volvulus ( Ov EC-SOD) was cloned, purified and crystallized to obtain structural insight into an attractive drug target with the potential to combat onchocerciasis. The recombinant Ov EC-SOD forms a dimer and the protein structure was solved and refined to 1.55 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. Interestingly, a sulfate ion supports the coordination of the conserved copper ion. The overall protein shape was verified by small-angle X-ray scattering. The enzyme shows a different surface charge distribution and different termini when compared with the homologous human SOD. A distinct hydrophobic cleft to which both protomers of the dimer contribute was utilized for a docking approach with compounds that have previously been identified as SOD inhibitors to highlight the potential for individual structure-based drug development.",

RPTPH, a member of the type 3 RPTP (R3-PTP) family, is an important regulator of colorectal cancer and hepatic carcinoma. Despite its importance in drug development, the structure of RPTPH has not yet been resolved. Here, the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of RPTPH was determined at 1.56 Å resolution. Despite similarities to other R3-PTPs in its overall structure, RPTPH exhibited differences in its loop regions and side-chain conformations. Compared with other R3-PTPs, RPTPH has unique side chains near its active site that may confer specificity for inhibitor binding. Therefore, detailed information on the structure of RPTPH provides clues for the development of specific inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The 1.72 Å resolution structure of purine nucleoside phosphorylase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus , a thermostable protein of potential interest for the biocatalytic synthesis of antiviral nucleoside compounds, is reported. The structure of the N-terminally His-tagged enzyme is a hexamer, as is typical of bacterial homologues, with a trimer-of-dimers arrangement. Unexpectedly, several residues of the recombinant tobacco etch virus protease (rTEV) cleavage site from the N-terminal tag are located in the active site of the neighbouring subunit in the dimer. Key to this interaction is a tyrosine residue, which sits where the nucleoside ring of the substrate would normally be located. Tag binding appears to be driven by a combination of enthalpic, entropic and proximity effects, which convey a particularly high affinity in the crystallized form. Attempts to cleave the tag in solution yielded only a small fraction of untagged protein, suggesting that the enzyme predominantly exists in the tag-bound form in solution, preventing rTEV from accessing the cleavage site. However, the tagged protein retained some activity in solution, suggesting that the tag does not completely block the active site, but may act as a competitive inhibitor. This serves as a warning that it is prudent to establish how affinity tags may affect protein structure and function, especially for industrial biocatalytic applications that rely on the efficiency and convenience of one-pot purifications and in cases where tag removal is difficult.",

However, CFA/I fimbriae, a class 5 fimbria and intestinal colonization factor for enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), are proposed to assemble via the alternate chaperone pathway (ACP). Both CUP and ACP fimbrial bioassembly pathways require the function of a periplasmic chaperone, but their corresponding proteins share very low similarity in primary sequence. Here, the crystallization of the CFA/I periplasmic chaperone CfaA by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method is reported.

Initial phases were derived from multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering experiments using the data from the platinum and lead derivatives. This resulted in an interpretable electron-density map showing one CfaA molecule in an asymmetric unit. Sequence assignments were aided by anomalous signals from the heavy-atom derivatives. Refinement of the atomic model of CfaA is ongoing, which is expected to further understanding of the essential aspects and allowable variations in tertiary structure of the greater family of chaperones involved in chaperone-usher mediated bioassembly.",

In Escherichia coli , the Bam machinery consists of five components ( i.e. BamA, BamB, BamC, BamD and BamE). In comparison, there are only four partners in Haemophilus influenzae : a BamB homologue is not found in its genome. In this study, the recombinant expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of H. influenzae BamD and BamCD complex are reported. The genes encoding BamC and BamD were cloned into a pET vector and expressed in E. coli . Affinity, ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography were used to obtain high-purity protein for further crystallographic characterization. Using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique, BamD and BamCD protein crystals of suitable size were obtained using protein concentrations of 70 and 50 mg ml −1 , respectively.

    "abstract": "Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), which mainly causes acute self-limited respiratory-tract infections, belongs to group A of the Betacoronavirus genus. Coronavirus genomes encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1–16), which assemble into a large replication–transcription complex mediating virus propagation. Nonstructural protein 9, which binds to the single-stranded DNA/RNA, has been shown to be indispensible for viral replication. Interestingly, a functional mutant (N60K) of nsp9 was identified to compensate for a 6 nt insertion mutation of the 3′-untranslated region (UTR), which is critical for viral RNA synthesis. It has been proposed that the N60K mutation may cause certain conformational changes of nsp9 to rescue the defective insertion mutant. To further investigate the underlying structural mechanism, the N60K mutant of nsp9 from HCoV-HKU1 was successfully crystallized in this study. The crystals diffracted to 2.6 Å resolution and belonged to space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 31.9, b = 85.0, c = 95.0 Å. Two molecules were identified per asymmetric unit.",

    "abstract": "Last month, the Executive Committee of the International Union of Crystallography approved the appointment of Dr Zbigniew Dauter as joint Section Editor of Acta Crystallographica Section F: Structural Biology Communications. This is great news for our journal, our authors and readers. Zbyszek is renowned in the field of macromolecular crystallography. He has been active in crystallography for more than 40 years. He started out investigating structures of small organic compounds with potential medical applications and obtained his PhD in 1975 from the Technical University of Gdansk, Poland, for the dissertation titled The structure of 1-nitro-9-(3′-dimethyl-aminopropylamino) acridine (C283). In time his scientific interests shifted to macromolecular crystallography and he has since been involved in the structure elucidation of over 70 proteins, among them electron-transfer metalloproteins such as rubredoxin and ferredoxin; proteinases from the subtilisin and trypsin families and their inhibitors; various other enzymes such as dUTPases, dehydrogenases, glycosyl hydrolases, aldolases, HIV reverse transcriptase; and larger complexes such as photosystem II or carnation mottle virus.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these achievements, Zbyszek is probably best known for his seminal contributions to the optimization of diffraction data collection especially using synchrotron radiation. He has published several texts on this topic, presented numerous lectures and seminars, and served as a tutor in many, many data collection workshops. He participated in the development of the protocols for analysis and validation of protein structures at atomic resolution, and he is investigating how the weak resonant signal from anomalous scatterers, present or introduced into crystals of macromolecules, can be utilized most effectively for phasing purposes. He is the inventor of the quick soaking method using halides (bromide and iodide), a method which is now widely known as dauterization of macromolecular crystals. More recently, he has developed an interest in exploiting radiation-damage signals for the phasing of macromolecular structures. In 2010, his work was recognised when he was awarded the highest science award from the Polish Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nIn total, Zbyszek has authored or co-authored about 330 papers in international journals and he is one of only a few crystallographers who have published in all six Acta journals. Up to now he has published three papers in Acta A, eight in Acta B, 15 in Acta C, 102 in Acta D, eight in Acta E and eight in Acta F. He has been a Section Editor of Acta D from 2003 until 2015 and we are very fortunate that he has agreed to join us now as a Section Editor of Acta F. We welcome him to our team very warmly. Let’s keep up the good work, Zbyszek!",

Here, it is shown that this gene encodes a monomeric FAD-binding protein of molecular mass 42.2 kDa. The structure of PA4991 was determined by a combination of molecular replacement using a search model generated with Rosetta and phase improvement by a low-occupancy heavy-metal derivative. PA4991 belongs to the GR2 family of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, comprising an FAD-binding domain typical of the glutathione reductase family and a second domain dominated by an eight-stranded mixed β-sheet. Most of the protein-FAD interactions are via the FAD-binding domain, but the isoalloxazine ring is located at the domain interface and interacts with residues from both domains. A comparison with the structurally related glycine oxidase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase shows that in spite of very low amino-acid sequence identity (<18%) several active-site residues involved in substrate binding in these enzymes are conserved in PA4991. However, enzymatic assays show that PA4991 does not display amino-acid oxidase or glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activities, suggesting that it requires different substrates for activity.",

In contrast to the phosphotyrosine-dependent binding of CBL substrates through its tyrosine kinase-binding domain (TKBD), CBL TKBD associates with the C-terminal tail of SLAP2 in a phospho-independent manner. To understand the distinct nature of this interaction, a purification protocol for SLAP2 in complex with CBL TKBD was established and the complex was crystallized. However, determination of the complex crystal structure was hindered by the apparent degradation of SLAP2 during the crystallization process, such that only the CBL TKBD residues could initially be modelled. Close examination of the CBL TKBD structure revealed a unique dimer interface that included two short segments of electron density of unknown origin. To elucidate which residues of SLAP2 to model into this unassigned density, a co-expression system was generated to test SLAP2 deletion mutants and define the minimal SLAP2 binding region. SLAP2 degradation products were also analysed by mass spectrometry. The model-building and map-generation features of the Phenix software package were employed, leading to successful modelling of the C-terminal tail of SLAP2 into the unassigned electron-density segments.",

This result is unexpected because the ligand binding-site residues arise from three separate polypeptide chains in the domain-swapped form. This work represents the first published structure of a domain-swapped form of TrpR with L-Trp bound. The presented structures also show that the protein amino-terminus, whether or not it bears a disordered extension of about 20 residues, is accessible in the large solvent channels of the domain-swapped crystal form, as in the structures reported previously in this form for TrpR without N-terminal extensions. These findings inspire the exploration of L-Trp analogs and N-terminal modifications as labels to orient guest proteins that cannot otherwise be crystallized in the solvent channels of crystalline domain-swapped TrpR hosts for potential diffraction analysis.",

The structure of S19 was solved and was superposed on the native or complex structure of SEB. In the superposition model, mutations that were introduced seemed to reduce the number of hydrogen bonds at the SEB-TCB interface. S19 also displayed an unexpected structural change around the flexible-loop region owing to the Y90A mutation. This local structural change provided evidence that the mutated form of S19 could have a lower affinity for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II than wild-type SEB.",

However, rsCherryRev1.4 still has some limitations such as a tendency to dimerize as well as complex photophysical properties. Here, the crystal structure of rsCherryRev1.4 was determined at a resolution of 2 Å and it was discovered that it forms a dimer that shows disulfide bonding between the protomers. Mutagenesis, gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatography strongly implicate Cys24 in this process. Replacing Cys24 in rsCherryRev1.4 resulted in a much lower tendency towards dimerization, while introducing Cys24 into mCherry correspondingly increased its dimerization. In principle, this finding opens the possibility of developing redox sensors based on controlled dimerization via disulfide cross-linking in fluorescent proteins, even though the actual application of engineering such sensors still requires additional research.",

In these degradation or detoxification pathways, two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases that use flavins (FMN or FAD) as a cofactor play important roles as they catalyse the first steps of these metabolic routes. The TdsC or DszC and MsuC proteins belong to this class of enzymes as they process dibenzothiophene (DBT) and methanesulfinate. Elucidation of their X-ray structures in apo, ligand-bound and cofactor-bound forms has provided important molecular insights into their catalytic reaction. Mycobacterial species have also been shown to possess a DBT degradation pathway, but no structural information is available on these two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases. In this study, the crystal structure of the uncharacterized MAB_4123 protein from the human pathogen Mycobacterium abscessus is presented. The structure solved at high resolution displays high similarity to homologs from Rhodococcus , Paenibacillus and Pseudomonas species. In silico docking approaches suggest that MAB_4123 binds FMN and may use it as a cofactor. Structural analysis strongly suggests that MAB_4123 is a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase that could act as a detoxifying enzyme of organosulfur compounds in mycobacteria.",

Previously, 5′- O -[ N -(11-phenoxyundecanoyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine (PhU-AMS) has been shown to be a general inhibitor of fatty-acid-adenylating enzymes (FadDs) in Mtb . However, the fatty acyl-AMP ligase (FAAL) class of FadDs, which includes Mtb FadD23, appears to be functionally nonredundant in the production of multiple fatty acids. In this study, the ability of PhU-AMS to bind to Mtb FadD23 was examined under in vitro conditions. The crystal structure of the Mtb FadD23–PhU-AMS complex was determined at a resolution of 2.64 Å. Novel features were identified by structural analysis and comparison. Although PhU-AMS could bind to Mtb FadD23, it did not inhibit the FAAL adenylation activity of Mtb FadD23. However, PhU-AMS improved the main T m value in a differential scanning fluorimetry assay, and a structural comparison of Mtb FadD23–PhU-AMS with FadD32 and PA1221 suggested that PhU-AMS blocks the loading of the acyl chain onto Pks2. This study sheds light on the structure-based design of specific inhibitors of Mtb FadD23 and general inhibitors of FAALs.",

    "abstract": "Using Anticalin technology, a lipocalin protein dubbed Colchicalin, with the ability to bind the toxic plant alkaloid colchicine with picomolar affinity, has previously been engineered, thus offering a potential antidote in vivo and also allowing its sensitive detection in biological samples. To further analyze the mode of ligand recognition, the crystal structure of Colchicalin is now reported in its unliganded form and is compared with the colchicine complex. A superposition of the protein structures revealed major rearrangements in the four structurally variable loops of the engineered lipocalin. Notably, the binding pocket in the unbound protein is largely occupied by the inward-bent loop #3, in particular Ile97, as well as by the phenylalanine side chain at position 71 in loop #2. Upon binding of colchicine, a dramatic shift of loop #3 by up to 11.1 Å occurs, in combination with a side-chain flip of Phe71, thus liberating the necessary space within the ligand pocket. Interestingly, the proline residue at the neighboring position 72, which arose during the combinatorial engineering of Colchicalin, remained in a cis configuration in both structures. These findings provide a striking example of a conformational adaptation mechanism, which is a long-known phenomenon for antibodies in immunochemistry, during the recognition of a small ligand by an engineered lipocalin, thus illustrating the general similarity between the mode of antigen/ligand binding by immunoglobulins and lipocalins.",

The ability to recognize two different sets of substrates is of structural and evolutionary interest. In the present study, the crystal structure of PurB from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TtPurB) was determined at a resolution of 2.38 Å by molecular replacement using a structure predicted by AlphaFold2 as a template. The asymmetric unit of the TtPurB crystal contained two TtPurB molecules, and some regions were disordered in the crystal structure. The disordered regions were the substrate-binding site and domain 3. TtPurB forms a homotetramer and the monomer is composed of three domains (domains 1, 2 and 3), which is a typical structure for the aspartase/fumarase superfamily. Molecular dynamics simulations with and without substrate/product were performed using a full-length model of TtPurB which was obtained before deletion of the disordered regions. The substrates and products were bound to the model structures during the MD simulations. The fluctuations of amino-acid residues were greater in the disordered regions and became smaller upon the binding of substrate or product. These results demonstrate that the full-length model obtained using AlphaFold2 can be used to generate the coordinates of disordered regions within the crystal structure.",

The enzyme occurs as a dimer, which has an indirect effect on the enzyme activity as the monomer retains only ∼35% of the activity. Here, the crystal structure of SOD_CL at 1.86 Å resolution is reported that may explain this peculiarity. The crystal belonged to space group P 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 61.11, b = 74.55, c = 61.69 Å, β = 106.86°, and contained four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The overall structure of SOD_CL resembles that of CuZnSOD from plants. The structure of SOD_CL shows a unique arrangement of surface loop IV that connects the dimer interface and the active site, which is located away from the dimer-interface region. This arrangement allows direct interaction between the residues residing in the dimer interface and those in the active site. The arrangement also includes Leu62 and Gln164, which are conserved in cytoplasmic CuZnSOD. This supports the classification of SOD_CL as a cytoplasmic CuZnSOD despite sharing the highest amino-acid sequence homology with CuZnSODs from spinach and tomato, which are chloroplastic.",

The YopT domain of PfhB2 contains a well conserved Cys–His–Asp catalytic triad that defines YopT family members, and shares high sequence similarity with the prototype YopT from Yersinia sp. To date, only one crystal structure of a YopT family member has been reported; however, additional structural information is needed to help characterize the varied substrate specificity and enzymatic action of this large protease family.

    "abstract": "Salicylic acid (SA) is an important phytohormone that is involved in the regulation of plant defence, growth and development. A large number of proteins have been shown to have the ability to interact with SA, and NPR4 has been demonstrated to be a receptor of SA that plays significant roles in the innate immune response of plants. In this study, Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were used to express full-length AtNPR4 from Arabidopsis thaliana . To facilitate crystallization, T4 lysozyme (T4L) was added to the N-terminus of the AtNPR4 protein. The recombinant T4L-AtNPR4 protein was expressed, purified and crystallized using the sitting-drop and hanging-drop vapour-diffusion methods. The T4L-AtNPR4 crystals have symmetry consistent with space group C 2, with unit-cell parameters a = 93.7, b = 85.8, c = 88.2 Å, β = 90° and one molecule per asymmetric unit. The best crystal diffracted to a resolution of 2.75 Å. Structure determination is in progress.",

It is known that there are two dissociated N-terminal regions and a triple-helix core in eukaryotic PDCD5. Structural and functional studies of PDCD5 from hyperthermophilic archaea have been limited to date. Here, the PDCD5 homolog Sso0352 (SsoPDCD5) was identified in Sulfolobus solfataricus , the SsoPDCD5 protein was expressed and crystallized, and the phase was identified by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction. The native SsoPDCD5 crystal belonged to space group C 2 and diffracted to 1.49 Å resolution. This is the first crystal structure of a PDCD5 homolog to be solved. SsoPDCD5 shares a similar triple-helix bundle with eukaryotic PDCD5 but has a long α-helix in the N-terminus. A structural search and biochemical data suggest that SsoPDCD5 may function as a DNA-binding protein.",

In this study, monomeric and stable recombinant Osm1 was successfully prepared for structural study. During purification, it was realized that the majority of recombinant Osm1 expressed in Escherichia coli lacked the flavin adenosine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. However, exogenously introduced FAD could be incorporated into recombinant Osm1, generating stable and homogenous holo Osm1. Moreover, after removing a flexible fragment by limited proteolysis, holo Osm1 formed isotropic crystals that retained catalytic activity. X-ray diffraction data were successfully collected from the Osm1 crystals to a resolution of 1.75 Å.",

The family of AdoMet synthetases is highly conserved, and structures of this enzyme have been determined from organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Here, the structure of an AdoMet synthetase from the infectious parasite Cryptosporidium parvum has been determined as part of an effort to identify structural differences in this enzyme family that can guide the development of species-selective inhibitors. This enzyme form has a less extensive subunit interface than some previously determined structures, and contains some key structural differences from the human enzyme in an allosteric site, presenting an opportunity for the design of selective inhibitors against the AdoMet synthetase from this organism.",

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is quickly evolving, and new strains are classified as multidrug resistant. Thus, the identification of novel druggable targets is essential to combat the proliferation of these drug-resistant strains. Filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z (FtsZ) is a key protein involved in cytokinesis, an important process for Mtb proliferation and viability. FtsZ is required for bacterial cell division because it polymerizes into a structure called the Z-ring, which recruits accessory division proteins to the septum. Here, the crystal structure of the MtbFtsZ protein has been determined to 3.46 Å resolution and is described as a dimer of trimers, with an inter-subunit interface between protomers AB and DE . In this work, a novel conformation of MtbFtsZ is revealed involving the T9 loop and the nucleotide-binding pocket of protomers BC and EF .",

    "abstract": "Successful pathogenesis is a cumulative effect of the virulence factors of a pathogen and its capability to efficiently utilize the available nutrients from the host. Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen, may either reside asymptomatically as a nasopharyngeal commensal inside the human host or cause lethal diseases, including pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. S. pneumoniae is known to acquire methionine (Met) from its host through a Met importer. Here, the crystal structure of the substrate-binding protein (SBP; SP_0149) of an ABC importer with Met bound is reported at a resolution of 1.95 Å. The three-dimensional structure of SBP shows that it is composed of two distinct domains, each consisting of a mixed β-sheet flanked by helices. The substrate, Met, is bound in the central part of the interface between the two domains. The overall structure of SP_0149 resembles those of SBPs from other reported bacterial Met and Gly-Met dipeptide transporters. However, a detailed analysis of these structures shows notable variations in the amino-acid composition of the substrate-binding pockets of the SP_0149-Met and GmpC-Gly-Met structures. In particular, SP_0149 harbors Thr212 and Tyr114, whereas the corresponding residues in GmpC are Gly and Val. This difference is likely to be the underlying basis for their differential substrate specificity. In summary, the structure of the SP_0149-Met complex provides insights into the transport function of SP_0149 and its interactions with methionine. It opens up avenues for the rational design of inhibitors of SP_0149 through a structure-mediated approach.",

Proteins homologous to the N-terminal domain of LonA peptidase, but lacking its other domains, are conserved in several phyla of prokaryotes, including the Xanthomonadales order. However, the function of these homologous proteins (LonNTD-like proteins) is not known. Here, the crystal structure of the LonNTD-like protein from Xanthomonas campestris (XCC3289; UniProt Q8P5P7) is reported at 2.8 Å resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and contains one polypeptide in the asymmetric unit. The structure was refined to an Rfree of 29%. The structure of XCC3289 consists of two domains joined by a long loop. The N-terminal domain (residues 1-112) consists of an α-helix surrounded by β-sheets, whereas the C-terminal domain (residues 123-193) is an α-helical bundle. The fold and spatial orientation of the two domains closely resembles those of the N-terminal domains of the LonA peptidases from Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium avium. The structure is also similar to that of cereblon, a substrate-recognizing component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The N-terminal domains of both LonA and cereblon are known to be involved in specific protein-protein interactions. This structural analysis suggests that XCC3289 and other LonNTD-like proteins might also be capable of such protein-protein interactions.",

Compared with other CC-NLRs, Sw-5b possesses an extended N-terminal Solanaceae domain (SD). The SD of Sw-5b is critical for recognition of the tospovirus viral movement protein NSm. An SD is also frequently detected in many NLRs from Solanaceae plants. However, no sequences homologous to the SD have been detected in animals or in plants other than Solanaceae . The properties of the SD protein are largely unknown, and thus 3D structural information is vital in order to better understand its role in pathogen perception and the activation of immune receptors. Here, the expression, purification and crystallization of Sw-5b SD (amino acids 1–245) are reported. Native and selenomethionine-substituted crystals of the SD protein belonged to space group P 3 1 12, with unit-cell parameters a = 81.53, b = 81.53, c = 98.44 Å and a = 81.63, b = 81.63, c = 98.80 Å, respectively. This is the first report of a structural study of the noncanonical SD domain of the NLR proteins from Solanaceae plants.",

Missense variants of this enzyme cause an inborn error of metabolism, which is categorized as a congenital disorder of glycosylation. Here, two disease-related variants of PGM1, T337M and G391V, which are both located in domain 3 of the four-domain protein, were characterized via X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays. The studies show multiple impacts resulting from these dysfunctional variants, including both short- and long-range structural perturbations. In the T337M variant these are limited to a small shift in an active-site loop, consistent with reduced enzyme activity. In contrast, the G391V variant produces a cascade of structural perturbations, including displacement of both the catalytic phosphoserine and metal-binding loops. This work reinforces several themes that were found in prior studies of dysfunctional PGM1 variants, including increased structural flexibility and the outsized impacts of mutations affecting interdomain interfaces. The molecular mechanisms of PGM1 variants have implications for newly described inherited disorders of related enzymes.",

It can bind to DNA on its own as well as in complex with other proteins such as CENP-TW and FANCM to recognize specific substrates. CENP-SX binds nonspecifically to dsDNA, similar to other histone-fold proteins. Several low-resolution structures of CENP-SX in complex with DNA are known, but a high-resolution structure is still lacking. The DNA-binding properties of CENP-SX and FANCM–CENP-SX complexes with various lengths of dsDNA were compared and the band-shift patterns and migration positions were found to differ. To confirm the DNA-binding properties in detail, CENP-SX–DNA and FANCM–CENP-SX–DNA complexes were crystallized. Analysis of the crystals revealed that they all contained the CENP-SX–DNA complex, irrespective of the complex that was used in crystallization. Detailed diffraction data analyses revealed that there were two types of crystal with different space groups, P 2 1 and C 2, where the volume of the P 2 1 asymmetric unit is twice as large as that of the C 2 asymmetric unit. Analysis of the self-rotation function revealed the presence of twofold and fourfold symmetry in both crystals. This suggests that there may be multiple molecules of CENP-SX and DNA within the asymmetric unit with respective symmetry. Structure determination of the present crystals should reveal details of the DNA-binding properties of CENP-SX.",

Despite the massive technological advances in the field, assigning a structural model to the corresponding diffraction data is not a trivial task. Here, the structure of acyl-carrier protein synthase (AcpS) from Mycobacterium smegmatis ( ms AcpS), which crystallized inadvertently in an experimental setup to grow crystals of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein using M. smegmatis as an expression system, is reported. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to solve the structure of the target protein by the molecular-replacement method no convincing solutions were obtained, indicating that the diffraction data may correspond to a crystal of an artifactual protein, which was finally identified by the Sequence-Independent Molecular replacement Based on Available Databases ( SIMBAD ) server. The ms AcpS structure was solved at 2.27 Å resolution and structural analysis showed an overall conserved fold. ms AcpS formed a trimeric structure similar to those of other reported structures of AcpS from various organisms; however, the residues involved in trimer formation are not strictly conserved. An unrelated metal ion (Ni 2+ ), which was possibly incorporated during protein purification, was observed in the proximity of His49 and His116. Structural and sequence differences were observed in the loop connecting the α3 and α4 helices that is responsible for the open and closed conformations of the enzyme. Moreover, the structural analysis of ms AcpS augments the current understanding of this enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the functional activation of acyl-carrier proteins in the fatty-acid biosynthesis pathway.",

It utilizes the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to deliver over 300 effector proteins into the host cell, leading to modification of cellular processes and creating a safe environment for bacterial proliferation. Dot/Icm is a multi-subunit molecular machine. The effectors are recognized by the inner membrane-embedded coupling complex (T4CC), which then delivers them to the translocation apparatus. This T4CC subcomplex is made up of DotL, DotM, DotN, IcmS, IcmW, LvgA, DotY and DotZ, and its structure was recently determined by cryo-EM. DotY is a highly mobile component of this subcomplex and its structure was only partially defined. DotY is a unique component of the T4SS that is only found in the Legionella genus. Here, the crystal structure of DotY on its own is presented and its fold and the connectivity of its secondary-structure elements are established. The protein is divided into three segments. The first and last segments form a four-helix bundle domain, while the middle segment forms an α/β domain that has a unique fold. The flexibility of the interdomain linkers allows the reorientation of the two domains between that observed in the crystal structure and that assumed within the T4CC subcomplex.",

This article focuses on saccharide binding to lectins as a theme, yet after 25 years or so it is still a work in progress to connect 3D structure to binding energies. Whilst this study involved one type of protein (lectins) and one class of ligand (monosaccharides), i.e. it was specific, it was of general importance, as measured for instance by its wide impact. The impetus for writing this update now, as a Scientific Comment, is that a breakthrough in neutron crystal structure determinations of saccharide-bound lectins has been achieved. It is suggested here that this new research from neutron protein crystallography could improve, i.e. reduce, the errors in the estimated binding energies.",

Laser-cutting technology was used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and derive an initial structure.

    "abstract": "AMSH, an endosome-associated deubiquitinase (DUB) with a high specificity for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, plays an important role in endosomal–lysosomal sorting and down-regulation of cell-surface receptors. AMSH belongs to the JAMM family of DUBs that contain two insertion segments, Ins-1 and Ins-2, in the catalytic domain relative to the JAMM core found in the archaebacterial AfJAMM. Structural analyses of the AMSH homologs human AMSH-LP and fission yeast Sst2 reveal a flap-like structure formed by Ins-2 near the active site that appears to open and close during its catalytic cycle. A conserved phenylalanine residue of the flap interacts with a conserved aspartate residue of the Ins-1 β-turn to form a closed `lid' over the active site in the substrate-bound state. Analyses of these two residues (Phe403 and Asp315) in Sst2 showed that their interaction plays an important role in controlling the flexibility of Ins-2. The Lys63-linked diubiquitin substrate-bound form of Sst2 showed that the conserved phenylalanine also interacts with Thr316 of Ins-1, which is substituted by tyrosine in other AMSH orthologs. Although Thr316 makes no direct interaction with the substrate, its mutation to alanine resulted in a significant loss of activity. In order to understand the contribution of Thr316 to catalysis, the crystal structure of this mutant was determined. In spite of the effect of the mutation on catalytic activity, the structure of the Sst2 Thr316Ala mutant did not reveal significant changes in either the overall structure or the active-site arrangement relative to the wild type. The Phe403–Thr316 van der Waals interaction is impaired by the Thr316Ala mutation, abrogating the adoption of the closed active-site conformation required for catalysis. Since van der Waals interactions with phenylalanine are conserved across substrate-bound forms of AMSH-LP and Sst2, these interactions may be critical for loop immobilization and the positioning of the isopeptide bond of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin-chain substrates.",

Eukaryotes and archaea strictly control DNA-replication initiation by the regulated loading of hexameric minichromosome maintenance (MCM) rings to encircle both strands of the DNA double helix followed by regulated activation of the loaded rings such that they then encircle one DNA strand while excluding the other. Both steps involve an open/closed ring transformation, allowing DNA strands to enter or exit. Here, the crystal structure of a dimer of the N-terminal domain of Sulfolobus solfataricus MCM with an intersubunit interface that is more extensive than in closed-ring structures, while including common interactions to enable facile interconversion, is presented. It is shown that the identified interface could stabilize open MCM rings by compensating for lost interactions at an open neighbor interface and that the prior open-ring cryo-EM structure of MCM loading has a similar extended interface adjacent to its open interface.",

This is far from an easy process, and when it succeeds there is an enormous variety in the size, shape and order found within these crystals (Svensson et al., 2019).Tens of thousands of trials are often needed to find the components of a supersaturated solution that will induce the formation of crystals; can anything be salvaged from all the failed crystallization experiments?Amorphous material is often found during screening, and can blaze a trail to crystallization, but is there order in the chaos?In this issue, Greene and colleagues (Greene et al., 2021) add to their discovery that dense phases of ovalbumin contain highly ordered regions (Greene et al., 2015), by showing the same phenomenon in a number of other proteins.The dense phases that proteins form during the crystallization process of salting-out have been largely ignored with respect to their macrostructure.The rise of the XFELs (Chapman et al., 2011;Spence, 2017), and more recently microED (Mu et al., 2021;Wolff et al., 2020), has made the collection of data from ordered structures on the nanometre scale a real prospect.This justifies the investigation of nanocrystals in order to gain atomic details of macromolecules that can be hard to crystallize.By detailed characterization using X-ray and neutron scattering techniques, combined with electron microscopy and modelling, the authors beautifully demonstrate a variety of microstructures that can be formed within protein gels.The researchers investigated three proteins, all adopting different microstructures: RNAse A that forms nanocrystalline sheets; immunoglobulin G, that forms hexagonally packed tubes; and lysozyme, that forms short, ordered chains.Each of these examples show similarities to the packing observed in fully fledged crystals, demonstrating that this phase is likely a step towards large crystals and, more importantly, could be common to this type of 'amorphous' protein gel.While the number of examples is still perhaps limited, this study clearly shows that protein gels tend to contain microstructures.This can therefore be exploited to gain structural insights into systems that have proved difficult to crystallize and may shed light on the processes of crystallization itself.We look forward to seeing the first diffraction images from these fascinating protein phases.",

JHs have multiple roles in insect development, metamorphosis and sexual maturation. A number of pesticides work by chemically mimicking JHs, thus preventing insects from developing and reproducing normally. The haemolymph levels of JH are governed by the rates of its biosynthesis and degradation. One enzyme involved in JH catabolism is JH diol kinase (JHDK), which uses ATP (or GTP) to phosphorylate JH diol to JH diol phosphate, which can be excreted. The X-ray structure of JHDK from the silkworm Bombyx mori has been determined at a resolution of 2.0 Å with an R factor of 19.0% and an Rfree of 24.8%. The structure possesses three EF-hand motifs which are occupied by calcium ions. This is in contrast to the recently reported structure of the JHDK-like-2 protein from B. mori (PDB entry 6kth), which possessed only one calcium ion. Since JHDK is known to be inhibited by calcium ions, it is likely that our structure represents the calcium-inhibited form of the enzyme. The electrostatic surface of the protein suggests a binding site for the triphosphate of ATP close to the N-terminal end of the molecule in a cavity between the N- and C-terminal domains. Superposition with a number of calcium-activated photoproteins suggests that there may be parallels between the binding of JH diol to JHDK and the binding of luciferin to aequorin.",

Synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALMs) and leukocyte common antigen-related receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-PTPs) are adhesion protein families with established synaptic function. Dysfunction of several synaptic adhesion molecules has been linked to cognitive disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. A recent study of the binding and complex structure of SALM3 and PTPσ using small-angle X-ray scattering revealed a 2:2 complex similar to that observed for the interaction of human SALM5 and PTPδ. However, the molecular structure of the SALM3–PTPσ complex remains to be determined beyond the small-angle X-ray scattering model. Here, the expression, purification, crystallization and initial 6.5 Å resolution structure of the mouse SALM3–PTPσ complex are reported, which further verifies the formation of a 2:2 trans-heterotetrameric complex similar to the crystal structure of human SALM5–PTPδ and validates the architecture of the previously reported small-angle scattering-based solution structure of the SALM3–PTPσ complex. Details of the protein expression and purification, crystal optimization trials, and the initial structure solution and data analysis are provided.",
