    "abstract": "In the present paper, a refined trigonometric higher-order shear deformation theory has been presented with the conjunction of nonlocal theory for the vibrational response of functionally graded (FG) porous nanoplate. The displacement field is chosen based on assumptions that the out of the plane displacement consists of bending and shear components whereas the transverse shear-strain has nonlinear variation along the thickness direction. The number of unknown variables is four, as against five in other renowned shear deformation theories. The governing equations have been derived using Hamilton's principle. A generalized porosity model has also been developed to accommodate both even and uneven type of distribution of porosity in the FG nanoplates. The closed-form solution of simply-supported FG porous nanoplates is obtained and the results are compared with the available reported results. In finite element solution, a C0 continuous isoparametric quadrilateral element has been used with various conventional and unconventional boundary conditions. The effects of various parameters like small-scale effect, aspect ratio, volume fraction index, porosity volume fraction, and thickness ratio have been investigated. The significant influence of small-scale effects and porosity inclusions have been observed in the reported results. It has been reported that both closed-form and finite element solutions with the present theory can make accurate predictions of the free vibration response.",

    "abstract": "The thermal buckling properties of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) are studied using nonlocal Timoshenko beam model, including the effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia. The DWCNTs are considered as two nanotube shells coupled through the van der Waals interaction between them. The geometric nonlinearity is taken into account, which arises from the mid-plane stretching. Considering the small-scale effects, the governing equilibrium equations are derived and the critical buckling temperatures under uniform temperature rise are obtained. The results show that the critical buckling temperature can be overestimated by the local beam model if the nonlocal effect is overlooked for long nanotubes. In addition, the effect of shear deformation and rotary inertia on the buckling temperature is more obvious for the higher-order modes. The investigation of the thermal buckling properties of DWCNTs may be used as a useful reference for the application and the design of nanostructures in which DWCNTs act as basic elements.",

Magnetic iron oxide especially magnetite (Fe3O4) possessed a superparamagnetic behaviour at certain nanosize which beneficial for drug and gene delivery, diagnosis and imaging. The properties of nanoparticles mainly depend on their synthesis procedure. There has been a massive effort in developing the best synthetic strategies to yield appropriate physico-chemical properties namely co-precipitation, thermal decomposition, microemulsions, hydrothermal and sol-gel. In this review, it is discovered that magnetite nanoparticles are best yielded by co-precipitation method owing to their simplicity and large production. However, its magnetic saturation is within range of 70-80 emu/g which is lower than thermal decomposition and hydrothermal methods (80-90 emu/g) at 100 nm. Dimension wise, less than 100 nm is produced by co-precipitation method at 70°C-80°C while thermal decomposition and hydrothermal methods could produce less than 50 nm but at very high temperature ranging between 200°C and 300°C. Thus, co-precipitation is the optimum method for pre-compliance magnetite nanoparticles preparation (e.g., 100 nm is fit enough for biomedical applications) since thermal decomposition and hydrothermal required more sophisticated facilities.",

This property beside the sandwich structures placed in the center of scientists' attention due to their extraordinary effects on the mechanical properties. Furthermore, in the passage of decades, more elaborated sandwich structures took into consideration results from using honeycomb core. This kind of structure, inspiring from honeycomb core, provides more stiffness to weight ratio, which plays a crucial role in different industries. In this paper, based on the Love-Kirchhoff's hypothesis, Hamilton's principle, modified couple stress theory and Fourier series analytical method, equations of motion for a sandwich plate containing a honeycomb core integrated by two face-sheets have derived and solved analytically. The equations of both face sheets have derived by flexoelectricity consideration. Moreover, it should be noticed that the whole structure rests on the visco-Pasternak foundation. Conducting current research provided an acceptable and throughout study based on flexoelectricity to address the effect of materials' characteristics, length-scale parameter, aspect, and thickness ratios and boundary conditions on the natural frequency of honeycomb sandwich plates. Also, based on the presented figures and tables, there is a close agreement between previous studies and recent work. Due to the high ratio of strength to weight, current model analyzing is capable of taking into account for different vehicles' manufacturing in a high range of industries.",

The single-walled carbon nanotube is aligned and distributed in the polymeric matrix with different patterns of reinforcement; the material properties of the CNTRC beams are described by using the rule of mixture.

Several aspects of beam types, CNT volume fraction, exponent degree (n), aspect ratio, etc., are taken into this investigation. It is revealed that the influences of non-linearity distribution in the beam play an important role to improve the mechanical properties, especially in buckling behavior.

The curved microbeam is exposed to electro-mechanical preload and also is rested on a Pasternak type of elastic foundation. Hamilton's principle is used to extract the motion equations and the MCST is used to capture the size effect. Navier's solution method is selected as an analytical method to solve the motion equations for a simply supported ends case and by validating the results for a simpler state with previously published works, effects of different important parameters on the behavior of the structure are considered. It is found that although increasing the porosity reduces the natural frequency, but enhancing the volume fraction of CNTs increasing it. Also, by increasing the central angle of the curved beam the vibrations of the structure increases. Designing and manufacturing more efficient smart structures such as sensors and actuators are of the aims of this study.",

    "abstract": "The significant growth of the Si photovoltaic industry has been so far limited due to the high cost of the Si photovoltaic system. In this regard, the most expensive factors are the intrinsic cost of silicon material and the Si solar cell fabrication processes. Conventional Si solar cells have p-n junctions inside for an efficient extraction of light-generated charge carriers. However, the p-n junction is normally formed through very expensive processes requiring very high temperature (<TEX>${\\sim}1000^{\\circ}C$</TEX>). Therefore, several systems are currently under study to form heterojunctions at low temperatures. Among them, carbon nanotube (CNT)/Si hybrid solar cells are very promising, with power conversion efficiency up to 15%. In these cells, the p-type Si layer is replaced by a semitransparent CNT film deposited at room temperature on the n-doped Si wafer, thus giving rise to an overall reduction of the total Si thickness and to the fabrication of a device with cheaper methods at low temperatures. In particular, the CNT film coating the Si wafer acts as a conductive electrode for charge carrier collection and establishes a built-in voltage for separating photocarriers. Moreover, due to the CNT film optical semitransparency, most of the incoming light is absorbed in Si; thus the efficiency of the CNT/Si device is in principle comparable to that of a conventional Si one. In this paper an overview of several factors at the basis of this device operation and of the suggested improvements to its architecture is given. In addition, still open physical/technological issues are also addressed.",

Silver nanoparticles have been fabricated by evaporation of thin Ag layers followed by the thermal annealing. The surface plasmon resonance peak was observed in the absorbance spectrum at 470 nm of glass with deposited silver nanoparticles. It is demonstrated that deposition of silver nanoparticles on silicon substrates was accompanied with a significant decrease in reflectance at the wavelength 360-1100 nm and increase of the absorption at wavelengths close to the band gap for Si substrates. We studied influence of Ag nanoparticles on photovoltaic characteristics of silicon solar cells without and with common use antireflection coating (ARC). It is shown that silver nanoparticles deposited onto the front surface of the solar cells without ARC led to increase in the photocurrent density by 39% comparing to cells without Ag nanoparticles. Contrary to this, solar cells with Ag nanoparticles deposited on front surface with ARC discovered decrease in photocurrent density. The improved performance of investigated cells was attributed to Ag-plasmonic excitations that reduce the reflectance from the silicon surface and ultimately leads to the enhanced light absorption in the cell. This study showed possibility of application of Ag nanoparticles for the improvement of the conversion efficiency of waferbased silicon solar cells instead of usual ARC.",

Three kinds of thermal loading, namely, uniform, linear and non-linear temperature rises through the thickness direction are considered. Thermo-electro-mechanical properties of FGP nanobeam are supposed to vary smoothly and continuously throughout the thickness based on power-law model. Eringen's nonlocal elasticity theory is exploited to describe the size dependency of nanobeam. Using Hamilton's principle, the nonlocal equations of motion together with corresponding boundary conditions based on Timoshenko beam theory are obtained for the free vibration analysis of graded piezoelectric nanobeams including size effect and they are solved applying analytical solution. According to the numerical results, it is revealed that the proposed modeling can provide accurate frequency results of the FGP nanobeams as compared to some cases in the literature. In following a parametric study is accompanied to examine the effects of several parameters such as various temperature distributions, external electric voltage, power-law index, nonlocal parameter and mode number on the natural frequencies of the size-dependent FGP nanobeams in detail. It is found that the small scale effect and thermo-electrical loading have a significant effect on natural frequencies of FGP nanobeams.",

The proposed model shows the vibration frequencies of armchair (5, 5), (7, 7), (9, 9), zigzag (12, 0), (14, 0), (19, 0) and chiral (8, 3), (10, 2), (14, 5) under different support conditions namely; SS-SS, C-F, C-C, and C-SS. The solutions of frequency equations have been given for different boundary condition, which have been given in several graphs. Several parameters of nanotubes with characteristic frequencies are given and vary continuously in length and ratio of thickness-to-radius. It has been illustrated that an enhancing the length of SWCNTs results in decreasing of the frequency range. It was demonstrated by increasing of the height-to-radius ratio of CNTs, the fundamental natural frequency would increase. Moreover, effects of length and ratio of height-to-radius with different boundary conditions have been investigated in detail. It was found that the fundamental frequencies of C-F are always lower than that of other conditions, respectively. In addition, the existence of boundary conditions has a significant impact on the vibration of SWCNTs. To generate the fundamental natural frequencies of SWCNTs, computer software MATLAB engaged. The numerical results are validated with existing open text. Since the percentage of error is negligible, the model has been concluded as valid.",

    "abstract": "Graphene, with impressive electronic properties, have high potential in the microelectronic field. However, graphene itself is a zero bandgap material which is not suitable for digital logic gates and its application. Thus, much focus is on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) that are narrow strips of graphene. During GNRs fabrication process, the occurrence of defects that ultimately change electronic properties of graphene is difficult to avoid. The modelling of GNRs with defects is crucial to study the non-idealities effects. In this work, nearest-neighbor tight-binding (TB) model for GNRs is presented with three main simplifying assumptions. They are utilization of basis function, Hamiltonian operator discretization and plane wave approximation. Two major edges of GNRs, armchair-edged GNRs (AGNRs) and zigzag-edged GNRs (ZGNRs) are explored. With single vacancy (SV) defects, the components within the Hamiltonian operator are transformed due to the disappearance of tight-binding energies around the missing carbon atoms in GNRs. The size of the lattices namely width and length are varied and studied. Non-equilibrium Green.s function (NEGF) formalism is employed to obtain the electronics structure namely band structure and density of states (DOS) and all simulation is implemented in MATLAB. The band structure and DOS plot are then compared between pristine and defected GNRs under varying length and width of GNRs. It is revealed that there are clear distinctions between band structure, numerical DOS and Green\\'s function DOS of pristine and defective GNRs.",

Higher-order shear deformation beam theories are implemented and their predictions of the critical buckling load and post-buckled configurations are compared to those of Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories. The nonlocal Eringen elasticity model is adopted to account a size-dependence at the nano-scale. Analytical closed form solutions for critical buckling loads and post-buckling configurations are derived for proposed beam theories. This would be helpful for those who work in the mechanical analysis of nanobeams especially experimentalists working in the field. Results show that thermal load has a more significant impact on the buckling behavior of simply-supported beams (S-S) than it has on clamped-clamped (C-C) beams. However, the nonlocal effect has more impact on C-C beams that it does on S-S beams. Moreover, it was found that the predictions obtained from Timoshenko beam theory are identical to those obtained using all higher-order shear deformation theories, suggesting that Timoshenko beam theory is sufficient to analyze buckling in nanobeams.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the electrical potential (EP) technique with an artificial neural networks (ANNs) for monitoring of nanostructures are used for the first time. This study employs an expert system to identify size and localize hidden nano-delamination (N.Del) inside layers of nano-pipe (N.P) manufactured from Basalt Fiber Reinforced Polymer (BFRP) laminate composite by using low-cost monitoring method of electrical potential (EP) technique with an artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are combined to decrease detection effort to discern N.Del location/size inside the N.P layers, with high accuracy, simple and low-cost. The dielectric properties of the N.P material are measured before and after N.Del introduced using arrays of electrical contacts and the variation in capacitance values, capacitance change and node potential distribution are analyzed. Using these changes in electrical potential due to N.Del, a finite element (FE) simulation model for N.Del location/size detection is generated by ANSYS and MATLAB, which are combined to simulate sensor characteristic, therefore, FE analyses are employed to make sets of data for the learning of the ANNs. The method is applied for the N.Del monitoring, to minimize the number of FE analysis in order to keep the cost and save the time of the assessment to a minimum. The FE results are in excellent agreement with an ANN and the experimental results available in the literature, thus validating the accuracy and reliability of the proposed technique.",

The material properties were assumed to vary according to the arbitrary function in radial and axial directions. The Navier equation and boundary conditions of the size-dependent bidirectional FG nonlinear nano-cone were derived by Hamilton's principle. These equations were solved by employing the generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM). The presented model can turn into the classical model if the material length scale parameters are taken to be zero. The effects of some parameters, such as inhomogeneity constant, cross-sectional area parameter and small-scale parameters, were studied. As an essential result of this study can be stated that an FG nano-cone model based on the nonlocal elasticity theory behaves softer and based on the strain gradient theory behaves harder.",

    "abstract": "To compare the antifungal effect of two nanomaterials (NMs), nanoparticles of zinc oxide were synthesized by a chemical route and zinc oxide-based nanobiohybrids were obtained using green synthesis in an extract of garlic (Allium sativum). The techniques of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Infrared (IR) and Ultraviolet Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopies and Scanning (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopies (TEM) were used to determine the characteristics of the nanomaterials synthesized. The results showed that the samples obtained were of nanometric size (< 100 nm). To compare their antifungal capacity, their effect on Cercospora sp. was evaluated. Test results showed that both nanomaterials had an antifungal capacity. The nanobiohybrids (green route) gave an inhibition of fungal growth of ˜72.4% while with the ZnO-NPs (chemical route), inhibition was ˜87.1%. Microstructural studies using High Resolution Optical Microscopy (HROM) and ultra-structural analysis using TEM carried out on the treated strains demonstrated the effect of the nanofungicides on the vegetative and reproductive structures, as well as on their cell wall. To account for the antifungal effect presented by ZnO-NPs and ZnO nanobiohybrids on the fungi tested, effects reported in the literature related to the action of nanomaterials on biological entities were considered. Specifically, we discuss the electrical interaction of the ZnO-NPs with the cell membrane and the biomolecules (proteins) present in the fungi, taking into account the n-type nature of the ZnO semiconductor and the electrical behavior of the fungal cell membrane and that of the proteins that make up the protein crown.",

In the literature, there are several methods for micro materials characterization. Bulge test is an established nondestructive technique for studying the mechanical properties of thin films. This study improve the performances of NEMS by investigating the mechanical behavior of Nano rectangular thin film (NRTF) made of new material embedded in Nano Electro Mechanical Systems (NEMS) by developing the bulge test technique. The NRTF built from adhesively-bonded layers of basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) laminate composite materials in Nano size at room temperature and were used for plane-strain bulging. The NRTF is first pre-stressed to ensure that is no initial deflection before applied the loads on NRTF and then clamped between two plates. A differential pressure is applying to a deformation of the laminated composite NRTF. This makes the plane-strain bulge test idea for studying the mechanical behavior of laminated composite NRTF in both the elastic and plastic regimes. An exact solution of governing equations for symmetric cross-ply BFRP laminated composite NRTF was established with taking in-to account the effect of the residual strength from pre-stressed loading. The stress-strain relationship of the BFRP laminated composite NRTF was determined by hydraulic bulging test. The NRTF thickness gradation in different points of hemisphere formed in bulge test was analysed.",

Material properties of the beam change in the height direction according to exponential distributions. The cracked nanobeam is modelled using a proper modification of the classical cracked-beam theory consisting of two sub-nanobeams connected through a massless elastic rotational spring. The inclusion of an additional material parameter enables the new beam model to capture the size effect. The new non-classical beam model reduces to the classical beam model when the length scale parameter is set to zero. The considered problem is investigated within the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory by using finite element method. In order to establish the accuracy of the present formulation and results, the deflections are obtained, and compared with the published results available in the literature. Good agreement is observed. In the numerical study, the static deflections of the edge cracked FGM nanobeams are calculated and discussed for different crack positions, different lengths of the beam, different length scale parameter, different crack depths, and different material distributions. Also, the difference between the classical beam theory and modified couple stress theory is investigated for static bending of edge cracked FGM nanobeams.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates impact of thickness stretching phenomenon on the scale-dependent behavior of nano panel in electromagnetic environment in the framework of HOSNDT. Unlike classic theories of shells and plates, the radial displacement is assumed variable along the thickness direction as summation of bending, shear and thickness stretching displacements in which the last term is assumed trigonometrically variable along the thickness direction. Generalized magneto-electro-elastic equations are derived using the virtual work principle. The main novelty of the present paper is application of thickness stretching formulation on the results. The bending results are calculated using analytical method with actuating the nano panel with initial electromagnetic potentials. An extended numerical investigation is presented to examine influence of significant parameters on the static results.",

This research develops a nonlocal flexoelectric sandwich nanobeam supported by Winkler-Pasternak foundation. The results of this work indicate that natural frequencies of a sandwich nanobeam increase by increasing the Winkler and Pasternak elastic constant. Also, increasing the nonlocal parameter at a constant length decreases the natural frequencies. By increasing the length to thickness ratio (L/h) of nanobeam, the nonlocal frequencies reduce.",

According to a nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT), the small scale influences are covered precisely by introducing two scale coefficients. Afterwards, the nonlocal governing equations can be derived coupling the local equations with those of the NSGT. Applying an analytical solution, the wave frequency and phase velocity of propagated waves can be gathered solving an eigenvalue problem. On the other hand, accuracy and efficiency of presented model is verified by setting a comparison between the obtained results with those of previous published researches.

Comparing with intensively studied Au and Ag Clusters, Cu clusters are superior in the aspects of cost and wide industrial demanding. However, tiny copper clusters are extremely prone to aggregate and undergo susceptibility of oxidation, thereby the synthesis of fluorescent zero valent copper clusters is rather challenging. In this review, synthetic strategies towards luminescent copper clusters, including macromolecule-protection and micro molecule-capping, have been systematically surveyed. Both \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" synthetic routes are found to be effective in fabricating luminescent copper clusters, some of which are quite stable and possess decent luminescence quantum yields. In general, the synthesis of fluorescent copper clusters remains at its infant stage. A great deal of effort on developing novel and economic synthetic routes to produce bright and stable copper clusters is highly expected in future.",

This theory states that the stress at a reference point is a function of strains at all points in the continuum. A cracked nanotube is assumed to be consisted of two segments that are connected by a rotational spring which is located in the position of the cracked section.

Influences of the nonlocal parameter, crack severity, temperature change and the number of cracks on the system frequencies are investigated. Also, it is found that at room or lower temperature the natural frequency for CNT decreases as the value of temperature change increases, while at temperature higher than room temperature the natural frequency of CNT increases as the value of temperature change increases.

Various concentrations of the AgNO3 used as a silver precursor (1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 100 mM) were used. Very rapid formation of Ag nanoparticles was observed, as only minutes were necessary for the completion of the reaction. With the increasing concentration, red shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak was observed in the Vis spectra. According to photon cross-correlation spectroscopy results, the finest grain size distribution was obtained for the 2.5 mM sample. The transmission electron microscopy analysis of this sample has shown bimodal size distribution with larger crystallites with 100 nm size and smaller around 10 nm. The antibacterial activity was also the best for this sample so the positive correlation between good grain size distribution and antibacterial activity was found. The in-depth discussion of antibacterial activity with related works from the materials science point of view is provided, namely emphasizing the role of effective nanoparticles distribution within the plant extract or matrix. The antibacterial activity seems to be governed by both content of Ag nanoparticles and their effective distribution.

The equations of the model are derived and the critical loads of linear and parabolic distribution of carbon nanotubes are obtained. With different disposition of nanotubes of carbon in the polymer matrix, the effects of different parameters such as the volume fractions, the plate geometric ratios and the number of modes on the critical load buckling are analysed and discussed. The results show that the critical buckling load of parabolic distribution is larger than the linear distribution. This variation is attributed to the concentration of reinforcement (CNTs) at the top and bottom faces for the X-CNT type which make the plate more rigid against buckling.",

    "abstract": "In the current paper, an exact solution method is carried out for analyzing the thermo-mechanical vibration of curved FG nano-beams subjected to uniform thermal environmental conditions, by considering porosity distribution via nonlocal strain gradient beam theory for the first time. Nonlocal strain gradient elasticity theory is adopted to consider the size effects in which the stress for not only the nonlocal stress field but also the strain gradients stress field is considered. It is perceived that during manufacturing of functionally graded materials (FGMs) porosities and micro-voids can be occurred inside the material. Material properties of curved porous FG nanobeam are assumed to be temperature-dependent and are supposed to vary through the thickness direction of beam which modeled via modified power-law rule. Since variation of pores along the thickness direction influences the mechanical and physical properties, porosity play a key role in the mechanical response of curved FG nano-structures. The governing equations and related boundary condition of curved porous FG nanobeam under temperature field are derived via the energy method based on Timoshenko beam theory. An analytical Navier solution procedure is utilized to achieve the natural frequencies of porous FG curved nanobeam supposed to thermal loading. The results for simpler states are confirmed with known data in the literature. The effects of various parameters such as nonlocality parameter, porosity volume fractions, thermal effect, gradient index, opening angle and aspect ratio on the natural frequency of curved FG porous nanobeam are successfully discussed. It is concluded that these parameters play key roles on the dynamic behavior of porous FG curved nanobeam. Presented numerical results can serve as benchmarks for future analyses of curve FG nanobeam with porosity phases.",

Geometric imperfection is first considered to be identical as the first buckling mode, then a generic function is employed to consider sine-type, local-type and global-type imperfectness. Modified couple stress theory is adopted to incorporate size-dependent behaviors of the beam at micro scale. The post-buckling problem is solved analytically to derive load-amplitude curves.

The present formulation incorporates the nonlocal scale parameter which can capture the small scale effect, and it considers both shear deformation and thickness stretching effects by a hyperbolic variation of all displacements across the thickness without employing shear correction factor. The highlight of this formulation is that, in addition to modeling the displacement field with only two unknowns, the thickness stretching effect (<TEX>${\\varepsilon}_z{\\neq}0$</TEX>) is also included in the present model. By utilizing the Hamilton's principle and the nonlocal differential constitutive relations of Eringen, the equations of motion of the nanoscale beam are reformulated. Verification studies demonstrate that the developed theory is not only more accurate than the refined nonlocal beam theory, but also comparable with the higher-order shear deformation theories which contain more number of unknowns.

    "abstract": "A study that primarily focuses on nonlocal strain gradient plate model for the sole purpose of vibration examination, for graphene sheets under linearly variable in-plane mechanical loads. To study a better or more precise examination on graphene sheets, a new advance model was conducted which carries two scale parameters that happen to be related to the nonlocal as well as the strain gradient influences. Through the usage of two-variable shear deformation plate approach, that does not require the inclusion of shear correction factors, the graphene sheet is designed. Based on Hamilton's principle, fundamental expressions in regard to a nonlocal strain gradient graphene sheet on elastic half-space is originated. A Galerkin's technique is applied to resolve the fundamental expressions for distinct boundary conditions. Influence of distinct factors which can be in-plane loading, length scale parameter, load factor, elastic foundation, boundary conditions, and nonlocal parameter on vibration properties of the graphene sheets then undergo investigation.",

Furthermore, we present a model which predicts that the critical axial buckling load embedded in Winkler, Pasternak or Kerr elastic medium under axial compression using the nonlocal Donnell shell theory, this model takes into account the effects of internal small length scale and the VdW interactions between the inner and outer nanotubes.

Indium incorporation in SnO2 lattice is seen to cause a lattice expansion, increasing the average size of the nanoparticles. The fundamental phonon vibration modes of SnO2 lattice suffer a broadening, and surface modes associated to particle size shift gradually with the increase of In content. Incorporation of In drastically enhances the PL emission of SnO2 nanoparticles associated to deep electronic defect levels. Although In incorporation reduces the band gap energy of SnO2 crystallites only marginally, it affects drastically their dye degradation behaviors under UV illumination. While the UV degradation of methylene blue (MB) by undoped SnO2 nanoparticles occurs through the production of intermediate byproducts such as azure A, azure B, and azure C, direct mineralization of MB takes place for In-doped SnO2 nanoparticles.",

The rotary inertia, gyroscopic, and rotor mass unbalance effects are all taken into consideration in the beam model. Assuming a nonlocal theory, two coupled 6th-order partial differential equations governing the vibration of the rotating SWCNT are first derived. In order to acquire the natural frequencies and dynamic response of the nanorotor system, the nonlinear equations of motion are numerically solved. The nano-rotor system frequency spectrum is shown to exhibit two distinct frequencies: one positive and one negative. The positive frequency is known as to represent the forward whirling mode, whereas the negative characterizes the backward mode. First, the results obtained within the framework of this numerical study are compared with few existing data (i.e., molecular dynamics) and showed an overall acceptable agreement. Then, a thorough and detailed parametric study is carried out to study the effect of several parameters on the nano-rotor frequencies such as: the nanotube radius, the input angular velocity and the small scale parameters. It is shown that the vibration characteristics of a spinning SWCNT are significantly influenced when these parameters are changed.",

Considering more realistic assumptions, new equations have been proposed to study the nonlinear vibration behavior of the GSs carrying electrical current and placed in magnetic field. For this purpose, considering the influences of the magnetic tractions created by electrical and eddy currents, new relationships for electromagnetic interaction forces with these nanosheets have been proposed. Nonlinear coupled equations are discretized by Galerkin method, and then solved via Runge–Kutta method. The effect of different parameters such as size effect, electrical current magnitude and magnetic field intensity on the vibration characteristics of GSs is investigated. The results show that the magnetic field increases the linear natural frequency, and decreases the nonlinear natural frequency of the GSs. Excessive increase of the magnetic field causes instability in the GSs.",

The slow crystal growth observed as a result of the interaction between the silver surface and the citrate ion makes this reduction process unique compared to other chemical and radiolytic synthetic methods. The antimicrobial effects of silver (Ag) ion or salts are well known, but the effects of citrate coated Ag nanoparticles (CAgNPs) are scant. Herein, we have isolated biofilm causative bacteria and fungi from drinking water PVC pipe lines. Stable CAgNPs were prepared and the formation of CAgNPs was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopic analysis and recorded the localized surface plasmon resonance of CAgNPs at 430 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis revealed C=O and O-H bending vibrations due to organic capping of silver responsible for the reduction and stabilization of the CAgNPs. X-ray diffraction micrograph indicated the face centered cubic structure of the formed CAgNPs, and morphological studies including size (average size 50 nm) were carried out using transmission electron microscopy. The hydrodynamic diameter (60.7 nm) and zeta potential (-27.6 mV) were measured using the dynamic light scattering technique.

Third-order shear deformation beam theory accounts for shear deformation effects by a parabolic variation of all displacements through the thickness, and verifies the stress-free boundary conditions on the top and bottom surfaces of the FG nanobeam. A two parameters elastic foundation including the linear Winkler springs along with the Pasternak shear layer is in contact with beam in deformation, which acts in tension as well as in compression.

Nonlocal equations of motion are derived through Hamilton's principle and they are solved applying analytical solution. Comparison between results of the present work and those available in literature shows the accuracy of this method.

    "abstract": "In this article, we present the effects of Ag doping and after-growth thermal annealing on the photoluminescence (PL) and thermoluminescence (TL) behaviors of <TEX>$SnO_2$</TEX> nanoparticles. <TEX>$SnO_2$</TEX> nanoparticles of 4-7 nm size range containing different Ag contents were synthesized by hydrothermal process. It has been observed that the after-growth thermal annealing process enhances the crystallite size and stabilizes the TL emissions of <TEX>$SnO_2$</TEX> nanostructures. Incorporated Ag probably occupies the interstitial sites of the <TEX>$SnO_2$</TEX> lattice, affecting drastically their emission behaviors on thermal annealing. Both the TL response and dose-linearity of the <TEX>$SnO_2$</TEX> nanoparticles improve on 1.0% Ag doping, and subsequent thermal annealing. However, a higher Ag content causes the formation of Ag clusters, reducing both the TL and PL responses of the nanoparticles.",

In the employed porosity-dependent method, the coupling between density and Young's moduli is included to consider for the effective moduli of the FG nanobeam by the means of a more reliable homogenization technique. The beam-type element will be modeled via the classical theory of beams, namely Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Also, the dynamic form of the principle of virtual work will be extended for such nanobeams to derive the motion equations. Applying the nonlocal constitutive equations of Eringen on the obtained motion equations will be resulted in derivation of the nanobeam's governing equations. Depicted results reveal that the dispersion responses of FG nanobeams will be decreased as the porosity volume fraction is increased which must be noticed by the designers of advanced nanosize devices who are interested in employment of wave dispersion approach in continuous systems for specific goals.",

    "abstract": "Metallic copper nanoparticles were synthesised by reduction of copper ions in aqueous solution, and metal-metal bonding by using the nanoparticles was studied. A colloid solution of metallic copper nanoparticles was prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of CuCl2 (0.01 M) and an aqueous solution of hydrazine (reductant) (0.2-1.0 M) in the presence of 0.0005 M of citric acid and 0.005 M of n-hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (stabilizers) at reduction temperature of 30-80°C. Copper-particle size varied (in the range of ca. 80-165 nm) with varying hydrazine concentration and reduction temperature. These dependences of particle size are explained by changes in number of metallic-copper-particle nuclei (determined by reduction rate) and changes in collision frequency of particles (based on movement of particles in accordance with temperature). The main component in the nanoparticles is metallic copper, and the metallic-copper particles are polycrystalline. Metallic-copper discs were successfully bonded by annealing at 400°C and pressure of 1.2 MPa for 5 min in hydrogen gas with the help of the metallic-copper particles. Shear strength of the bonded copper discs was then measured. Dependences of shear strength on hydrazine concentration and reduction temperature were explained in terms of progress state of reduction, amount of impurity and particle size. Highest shear strength of 40.0 MPa was recorded for a colloid solution prepared at hydrazine concentration of 0.8 M and reduction temperature of 50°C.",

The composite PANC5 exhibits UV-Visible absorption peaks at 436 nm and 670 nm whereas, PANC10 exhibits absorption peaks at 446 nm and 697 nm.

The characterized FTIR peaks observed at around <TEX>$3410cm^{-1}$</TEX> (PANC5) and <TEX>$3420cm^{-1}$</TEX> (PANC10) was due to the N-H stretching vibrations. The appearance of a broad band instead of a sharp peak can be attributed due to the presence of a high concentration of N-H groups in the nanocomposite. The TEM images show that the sample contains defective spherical, truncated triangular and rod shaped particles. The results showed that the PANI/Ag nanocomposites are composed of nano-sized particles of 43-53 nm that contain Ag domains of 33-37 nm with polymer thickness 5.7-11.2 nm at two different aniline concentrations.",

    "abstract": "In this research, beside presenting real images of produced Functionally Graded Carbon Nanotube-Reinforced Composites (FG-CNTRCs) and a brief review of the synthesis method of FG-CNTRCs, static and buckling analysis of FG-CNTRC with piezoelectric layers are investigated. It is assumed that the material properties of FG-CNTRC are varied through the thickness direction using four different distributions of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs). To capture the size effects, nonlocal elasticity theory proposed by A.C. Eringen is also adopted in our model. One of the topics in our paper is using a higher order theory with eight different displacement fields and comparing their results with each other. To solve the governing equations, an analytical method is used to find the deflections and critical buckling loads of FG-CNTRCs. To show the accuracy of present methodology, our results are compared with the results of simply supported rectangular nano plates available in the literature. In this research, the effects of aspect ratio, piezoelectric layer and nonlocal parameter are also studied. It is hoped that this work leads to more accurate models on FG-CNTRC.",

    "abstract": "Silicene is a two-dimensional (2D) derivative of silicon (Si) arranged in honeycomb lattice. It is predicted to be compatible with the present fabrication technology. However, its gapless properties (neglecting the spin-orbiting effect) hinders its application as digital switching devices. Thus, a suitable band gap engineering technique is required. In the present work, the band structure and density of states of uniformly doped silicene are obtained using the nearest neighbour tight-binding (NNTB) model. The results show that uniform substitutional doping using aluminium (Al) has successfully induced band gap in silicene. The band structures of the presented model are in good agreement with published results in terms of the valence band and conduction band. The band gap values extracted from the presented models are 0.39 eV and 0.78 eV for uniformly doped silicene with Al at the doping concentration of 12.5% and 25% respectively. The results show that the engineered band gap values are within the range for electronic switching applications. The conclusions of this study envisage that the uniformly doped silicene with Al can be further explored and applied in the future nanoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "In this article, the acoustic responses of free vibrated natural fibre-reinforced polymer nanocomposite structure have been investigated first time with the help of commercial package (ANSYS) using the multiphysical modelling approach. The sound relevant data of the polymeric structure is obtained by varying weight fractions of the natural nanofibre within the composite. Firstly, the structural frequencies are obtained through a simulation model prepared in ANSYS and solved through the static structural analysis module. Further, the corresponding sound data within a certain range of frequencies are evaluated by modelling the medium through the boundary element steps with adequate coupling between structure and fluid via LMS Virtual Lab. The simulation model validity has been established by comparing the frequency and sound responses with published results. In addition, sets of experimentation are carried out for the eigenvalue and the sound pressure level for different weight fractions of natural fibre and compared with own simulation data. The experimental frequencies are obtained using own impact type vibration analyzer and recorded through LABVIEW support software. Similarly, the noise data due to the harmonically excited vibrating plate are recorded through the available Array microphone (40 PH and serial no: 190569). The numerical results and subsequent experimental comparison are indicating the comprehensiveness of the presently derived simulation model. Finally, the effects of structural design parameters (thickness ratio, aspect ratio and boundary conditions) on the acoustic behaviour of the natural-fibre reinforced nanocomposite are computed using the present multiphysical model and highlighted the inferences.",

The MT is assumed as a cylindrical beam and a new single variable trigonometric beam theory is developed in conjunction with a modified strain gradient model. The main benefit of the present formulation is shown in its new kinematic where we found only one unknown as the Euler-Bernoulli beam model, which is even less than the Timoshenko beam model. The governing equations are deduced by considering virtual work principle. The effectiveness of the present method is checked by comparing the obtained results with those reported by other higher shear deformation beam theory involving a higher number of unknowns. It is shown that microstructure-dependent response is more important when material length scale parameters are closer to the outer diameter of MTs. Also, it can be confirmed that influences of shear deformation become more considerable for smaller shear modulus and aspect ratios.",

The obtained bio-nanocomposite material was used to investigate ultra-fast and highly efficient for removal of Ni2+ ions in a fixed-bed column. Chitosan was treated as polyelectrolyte complex with Fe3O4 nanoparticles and a Fungal Bio-Nanocomposite Material (FBNM) was derived. The FBNM was characterized by using X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Fourier Transform Infrared spectra (FTIR) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) techniques and under varied experimental conditions. The influence of some important operating conditions including pH, flow rate and initial Ni2+ concentration on the uptake of Ni2+ solution was also optimized using a synthetic water sample. A Central Composite Design (CCD) combined with Response Surface Modeling (RSM) was carried out to maximize Ni2+ removal using FBNM for adsorption process. A regression model was derived using CCD to predict the responses and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and lack of fit test was used to check model adequacy. It was observed that the quadratic model, which was controlled and proposed, was originated from experimental design data. The FBNM maximum adsorption capacity was determined as 59.8 mg g−1. Finally, developed method was applied to soft drinks to determine Ni2+ levels. Reusability of FBNM was tested, and the adsorption and desorption capacities were not affected after eight cycles. The paper suggests that the FBNM is a promising recyclable nanoadsorbent for the removal of Ni2+ from various soft drinks.",

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant was used to improve the DNPH grafting to TiO2 surface. Modified adsorbents were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, EDX and FTIR. Since the COD level in wastewaters including formaldehyde is considerable, it is necessary to determine the COD content of the synthetic wastewater. In order to determine the optimal removal conditions, the effect of contact time (60-210 min), pH (4-10) and adsorbent dosage (0.5-1.5 g/L) on adsorption and COD removal efficiencies were studied, using response surface method. EDX and FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of nitrogen-containing functional groups on the modified TiO2 surface. The maximum formaldehyde adsorption and COD removal efficiencies by modified TiO2 were about 15.65 and 7.35% higher than the unmodified nanoparticles respectively. Therefore, the grafting of nano-TiO2 with DNPH would greatly improve its formaldehyde adsorption efficiency. The optimum conditions determined for a maximum formaldehyde removal of 99.904% and a COD reduction of 94.815% by TiO2/SDS/DNPH nanocomposites were: adsorbent dosage 1.100 g/L, pH 7.424 and the contact time 183.290 min.",

The basic formulation of plate is based on first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and the material properties of FG-CNTRCs are presumed to be changed through the thickness direction, and are assumed based on rule of mixture; moreover, nonlocal Eringen\\'s theory is applied to consider the size-dependent effect. It is considered that the system is embedded in elastic medium and subjected to longitudinal magnetic field. Energy approach, domain decomposition and Rayleigh-Ritz methods in conjunction with Newton-Raphson iterative technique are employed to trace the post-buckling paths of FG-CNTRC micro cut out plate. The influence of some important parameters such as small scale effect, cut out dimension, different types of FG distributions of CNTs, volume fraction of CNTs, aspect ratio of plate, magnitude of magnetic field, elastic medium and biaxial load on the post-buckling behavior of system are calculated. With respect to results, it is concluded that the aspect ratio and length of square cut out have negative effect on postbuckling response of micro composite plate. Furthermore, existence of CNTs in system causes improvement in the post-buckling behavior of plate and different distributions of CNTs in plate have diverse response. Meanwhile, nonlocal parameter and biaxial compression load on the plate has negative effect on post-buckling response.

Functional gradation of material properties is described based on power-law formulation. The nanoshell is under a multi-physical field related to applied voltage, magnetic potential, and mechanical load. Exerting a strong electric voltage, magnetic potential or mechanical load may lead to buckling of nanoshell. Taking into account geometric nonlinearity effects after buckling, the behavior of nanoshell in post-buckling regime can be analyzed. Nonlinear governing equations are reduced to ordinary equations utilizing Galerkin's approach and post-buckling curves are obtained based on an analytical procedure.

To do this, the time-dependent torsional vibrations in a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) under the linear and harmonic external torque, are investigated in this paper. Eringen's nonlocal elasticity theory is considered to demonstrate the nonlocality and constitutive relations. Hamilton's principle is established to derive the governing equation of motion and consequently related boundary conditions. An analytical method, called the Galerkin method, is utilized to discretize the driven differential equations. Linear and harmonic torsional loads, along with determined amplitude, are applied to the SWCNT as the external torques. SWCNT is considered under the clamped-clamped end supports. In free vibration, analysis of small scale effect reveals the capability of natural frequencies in different modes, and this results desirably are in coincidence with another study. The forced torsional vibration in the time domain, especially for carbon nanotubes, has not been done before in the previous works. The previous forced studies were devoted to the transverse vibrations. It should be emphasized that the dynamical analysis of torsion is novel, workable, and at the beginning of the path.

Their structure is predefined by crystal symmetry. Two-dimensional, self-organized arrays of such nanostructures are realized reproducibly using specific preparation conditions (semiconductor wafer direct bonding). This technique allows separating dislocations up to a few hundred nanometers which enables electrical measurements of only a few, or, in the ideal case, of an individual dislocation. Electrical properties of dislocations in silicon were measured using MOSFETs as test structures. It is shown that an increase of the drain current results for nMOSFETs which is caused by a high concentration of electrons on dislocations in p-type material. The number of electrons on a dislocation is estimated from device simulations. This leads to the conclusion that metallic-like conduction exists along dislocations in this material caused by a one-dimensional carrier confinement. On the other hand, measurements of pMOSFETs prepared in n-type silicon proved the dominant transport of holes along dislocations. The experimentally measured increase of the drain current, however, is here not only caused by an higher hole concentration on these defects but also by an increasing hole mobility along dislocations. All the data proved for the first time the ambipolar behavior of dislocations in silicon. Dislocations in p-type Si form efficient one-dimensional channels for electrons, while dislocations in n-type material cause one-dimensional channels for holes.",

Although this method is relatively simple, at the theoretical level the interactions between process parameters and their influence on the fiber morphology are not yet fully understood. In this paper, the aim was finding optimal electrospinning parameters in order to obtain the smallest fiber diameter by using Taguchi's methodology. The nanofibers produced by electrospinning a solution of Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) in Dimethylformamide (DMF). Polymer concentration and process parameters were considered as the effective factors. Taguchi's L9 orthogonal design (4 parameters, 3 levels) was applied to the experiential design. Optimal electrospinning conditions were determined using the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio with Minitab 17 software. The morphology of the nanofibers was studied by a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Thereafter, a tensile tester machine was used to assess mechanical properties of nanofibrous scaffolds. The analysis of DoE experiments showed that TPU concentration was the most significant parameter. An optimum combination to reach smallest diameters was yielded at 12 wt% polymer concentration, 16 kV of the supply voltage, 0.1 ml/h feed rate and 15 cm tip-to-distance. An empirical model was extracted and verified using confirmation test. The average diameter of nanofibers at the optimum conditions was in the range of 242.10 to 257.92 nm at a confidence level 95% which was in close agreement with the predicted value by the Taguchi technique. Also, the mechanical properties increased with decreasing fibers diameter. This study demonstrated Taguchi method was successfully applied to the optimization of electrospinning conditions for TPU nanofibers and the presented scaffold can mimic the structure of Extracellular Matrix (ECM).",

    "abstract": "The effect of thermal stresses on the torsional vibration of non, single, and double-cracked nanorods surrounded by an elastic medium is investigated. The differential constitutive relation of the nonlocal theory is applied to the motion equation. Three-dimensional linear thermal strains raised from the thermal stresses are derived using nonlinear Green's strains. The surrounding elastic medium acts as infinite torsional springs. The crack is modeled as a rotational spring. Using Hamilton's principle, the motion equation is obtained. Effect of the crack position and severity, number of cracks, high and low temperatures, nonlocal coefficient, elastic medium stiffness, and nanorod length are examined. The temperature effect on the frequencies depends on the values of the crack parameters, crack numbers, elastic medium stiffness, and nanorod length, and it is independent of the nonlocal scale coefficient. The crack leads to a decrease in the frequencies at any temperature. The elastic medium causes an increase in the frequencies at any temperature.",

    "abstract": "In this study we present the reaction mechanism of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) nanoparticles synthesized by microwave-assisted chemical synthesis. We performed reactions every 10 minutes in order to identify different phases during quaternary CZTSe formation. The powder samples were analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that in the first minutes copper phases are predominant, then copper and tin secondary phases react to form ternary phase. The quaternary phase is formed at 50 minutes while ternary and secondary phases are consumed. At 60 minutes pure quaternary CZTSe phase is present. After 60 minutes the quaternary phase decomposes in the previous ternary and secondary phases, which indicates that 60 minutes is ideal reaction time. The EDS analysis of pure quaternary nanocrystals (CZTSe) showed stoichiometric relations similar to the reported research in the literature, which falls in the range of Cu/(Zn+Sn): 0.8-1.0, Zn/Sn: 1.0-1.20. In conclusion, the evolution pathway of CZTSe synthesized by this novel method is similar to other synthesis methods reported before. Nanoparticles synthesized in this study present desirable properties in order to use them in solar cell and photoelectrochemical cell applications.",

A systematic study was performed to evaluate the effect of reduction degree on the optical and electrical properties of the RGO film. We demonstrate that both the reduction process (thermal and chemical) produce RGO films of similar optical and electrical behaviors. However, the RGO films fabricated using chemically reduced GO colloid render better performance in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), when they are used as counter electrodes (CEs). It has been demonstrated that RGO films of optimum thicknesses fabricated using RGO colloids prepared using lower concentration of hydrazine reducer have better catalytic performance in DSSCs due to a better catalytic interaction with redox couple. The better catalytic performance of the RGO films fabricated at optimal hydrazine concentration is associated to their higher available surface area and lower grain boundaries.",

In this report, castor oil based hyperbranched polyester/bitumen modified fly ash nanocomposites were fabricated to achieve the desired performance. The hyperbranched polyester resin was synthesized by a three-step one pot condensation reaction using monoglyceride of castor oil based carboxyl terminated pre-polymer and 2,2-bis (hydroxymethyl) propionic acid. Also, the bulk fly ash of paper industry waste was converted to hydrophilic nano fly ash by ultrasonication followed by transforming it to an organonano fly ash by the modification with bitumen. The synthesized polyester resin and its nanocomposites were characterized by different analytical and spectroscopic tools. The nanocomposite obtained in presence of 20 wt% styrene (with respect to polyester) was found to be more homogeneous and stable compared to nanocomposite without styrene. The performance in terms of tensile strength, impact resistance, scratch hardness, chemical resistance and thermal stability was found to be improved significantly after formation of nanocomposite compared to the pristine system after curing with bisphenol-A based epoxy and poly(amido amine). The overall results of transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis and performance showed good exfoliation of the nano fly ash in the polyester matrix. Thus the studied nanocomposites would open up a new avenue on development of low cost high performing surface coating materials.",

Usually the characteristics of synthesised particles depend upon the process parameters such as the ratio of the iron ions, the pH of the solution, the molar concentration of base used, type of reactants and temperature. A modified coprecipitation method was adopted in this study. A magnetic stirrer was used for mixing and the morphology and nature of particles were observed after synthesis. Nanoparticles were characterised through XRD. Obtained nanoparticles showed the formation of magnetite and maghemite under citric acid and oxalic acid as stabilisers respectively. The size of nanoparticle was greatly affected by the use of different types of stabilisers. Results show that citric acid greatly reduced the obtained particle size. Particle size as small as 13 nm was obtained in this study. The effects of different kinds of nucleating agents were also observed and two different types of nucleating agents were used i.e. potassium hydroxide (KOH) and copper chloride (<TEX>$CuCl_2$</TEX>). Results show that the use of nucleating agent in general pushes the growth phase of nanoparticles towards the end of coprecipitation reaction. The particles obtained after addition of nucleating agent were greater in size than particles obtained by not utilising any nucleating agent.

Then, the exact nonlocal stress function is calculated through a complete solution of the von-Karman compatibility equation. In the next step, Galerkin's method is used to solve the unknown parameters considered in the proposed technique. In addition, three different scenarios, which are significantly different with respect to concept, are used to satisfy the natural in-plane boundary conditions and completely attain the stress function.

The influence of various parameters is depicted on both critical buckling load and frequency of the structure. The accuracy of solution procedure is demonstrated by comparing results with classical edge conditions. The results ascertain that the effects of different distributions of CNTs and their volume fraction are significant on the behavior of the system.

Also, the effects of porosity coefficient and different types of porosity distribution on critical buckling load are discussed. Using sandwich beam, it shows a considerable enhancement in the critical buckling load when compared to ordinary composite. Actually, resistance against buckling in sandwich beam is between two to four times more. It is also showed the critical buckling loads of laminate 1 and 3 are significantly larger than the results of laminate 2. When Configuration 2 is used, the critical buckling load rises about 3 percent in laminate 1 and 3 compared to the results of configuration 1. The amount of enhancement for laminate 3 is about 17 percent. It is also demonstrated that the influence of the core height (thickness) in the case of lower carbon volume fractions is ignorable. Even though, when volume fraction of fiber increases, differences grow smoothly. It should be noticed the amount of decline has inverse relationship with the beam aspect ratio. Among three porosity patterns investigated, beam with the distribution of porosity Type 2 (downward parabolic) has the maximum critical buckling load.

A non-cancerous cell type (L929) was also used to test whether suppressive effects of P-AgNPs on cancer cell proliferation were due to a general cytotoxic effect. The characterization results showed that the bioactive contents in propolis successfully induced particle formation. As the amount of PE increased, the particle size decreased; however, the size distribution range expanded. The antioxidant capacity of the particles increased with increased propolis amounts. P-AgNP1 exhibited almost equal inhibitory effects across all cancer cell types; however, P-AgNP2 was more effective on HeLa cells. P-AgNPs3 showed greater inhibitory effects in almost all cancer cells compared to other NPs and pure propolis. Consequently, the biological effects of P-AgNPs were highly dependent on PE amount, NP concentration, and cell type.

It was shown that C(14,17), C(14,11), C(14,16), C(14,10) show a metallic nature, and polyprismanes C(14,5), C(14,4) possess semiconductor properties and has a band gap of 0.4 eV and 0.6 eV, respectively. It was found that, when metal C(14,11), C(14,10) and semiconductor C(14,5), C(14,4) polyprismanes are coaxially connected, a Schottky barrier is formed and a weak diode effect is observed, i.e., manifested valve (rectifying) property of telescoping polyprismanes. The enhancement of this effect occurs in the nanodevices C(14,17) – C(14,11) – C(14,5) and C(14,16) – C(14,10) – C(14,4), which have the properties of nanodiode and back nanodiode, respectively. The simulation results can be useful in creating promising active one-dimensional elements of nanoelectronics.",

The evaluated parameters were trans-membrane pressure (TMP), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), particle size distribution (PSD), soluble microbial product (SMP), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and, excitation-emission matrix (EEM). The MBR0 was without any additional zeolite while 0.4 g/L of H-ZSM-5 and NH4-ZSM-5 were added to MBRHZSM-5 and MBRNH4ZSM-5, respectively. The COD removal of the MBR0, MBRH-ZSM-5 and MBRNH4-ZSM-5 were 87.5%, 93.3% and 94.6%, respectively. The TMP of the MBRH-ZSM-5 was 45% less than MBR0 whereas the reduction for MBRNH4-ZSM-5 was 65.5%. Also results showed that both H-ZSM-5 and NH4-ZSM-5 caused reduction in protein and polysaccharide related EPS but the NH4-ZSM-5 had better performance toward the elimination of organic compounds.",

Three various theories containing the classical theory, which is called Eringen's nonlocal elasticity, along with Rayleigh and Bishop theories (higher-order theories) are established to justify the nonlocal behavior of constitutive relations. The governing equation and the related boundary conditions are derived from Hamilton's principle. The assumed modes method is adopted to solve the equation of motion. For the free axial vibration, the natural frequencies are calculated for the various values of the nonlocal parameter only based on Eringen's theory.

Model graphene sheets are known to have double variant shear deformation plate theory without factors from shear correction. By using the principle of Hamilton, to acquire the governing equations of a non-local strain gradient graphene layer on an elastic substrate, Galerkin's method is therefore used to explicate the equations that govern various partition conditions.

The FGNP is considered to be supported by Winkler-Pasternak foundation. The Eringen's differential theory is used for size effect on the vibration of the FGNP. Rayleigh-Ritz method with orthogonal polynomials are employed for the governing equations and edge constraints. The advantage of this method is that it overcomes all the drawbacks of edge constraints and can easily handle any combinations of mixed edge constraints. The coefficients viz. moisture expansion, thermal expansion and elastic coefficients are considered to be transversely graded across the FGNP. The similarity of the calculated natural frequencies is examined with the previous research, and a good concurrency is seen. The objective of this article is to analyze the parameters' effect on the nondimensionalized frequency of embedded FGNP under hygrothermal environment subjected to all possible edge constraints. For this, uniform and linear rise of temperature and moisture concentration are considered. The study highlights that the nonlocal effect is pronounced for higher modes. Moreover, the effect of the Pasternak modulus is seen to be prominent compared to the Winkler modulus on non dimensionalized frequencies of FGNP.",

In addition, the impacts of chemical reaction and heat generation/absorption parameter are considered.

The resulting nonlinear ODEs subjected to relevant boundary conditions are solved analytically through homotopy analysis method which is programmed in Mathematica software.

It is noted that velocity profile enhances as the curvature parameter A and Eyring-Powell fluid parameter M increases but a decline manner for large values of buoyancy ratio parameter Nr and bio-convection Rayleigh number Rb.

    "abstract": "In this article, free vibration behavior of electro-magneto-thermo sandwich Timoshenko beam made of porous core and Graphene Platelet Reinforced Composite (GPLRC) in a thermal environment is investigated. The governing equations of motion are derived by using the modified strain gradient theory for micro structures and Hamilton's principle. The magneto electro are under linear function along the thickness that contains magnetic and electric constant potentials and a cosine function. The effects of material length scale parameters, temperature change, various distributions of porous, different distributions of graphene platelets and thickness ratio on the natural frequency of Timoshenko beam are analyzed. The results show that an increase in aspect ratio, the temperature change, and the thickness of GPL leads to reduce the natural frequency; while vice versa for porous coefficient, volume fractions and length of GPL. Moreover, the effect of different size-dependent theories such as CT, MCST and MSGT on the natural frequency is investigated. It reveals that MSGT and CT have most and lowest values of natural frequency, respectively, because MSGT leads to increase the stiffness of micro Timoshenko sandwich beam by considering three material length scale parameters. It is seen that by increasing porosity coefficient, the natural frequency increases because both stiffness and mass matrices decreases, but the effect of reduction of mass matrix is more than stiffness matrix. Considering the piezo magneto-electric layers lead to enhance the stiffness of a micro beam, thus the natural frequency increases. It can be seen that with increasing of the value of WGPL, the stiffness of microbeam increases. As a result, the value of natural frequency enhances. It is shown that in hc/h = 0.7, the natural frequency for WGPL = 0.05 is 8% and 14% less than its for WGPL = 0.06 and WGPL = 0.07, respectively. The results show that with an increment in the length and width of GPLs, the natural frequency increases because the stiffness of micro structures enhances and vice versa for thickness of GPLs. It can be seen that the natural frequency for aGPL = 25 µm and hc/h = 0.6 is 0.3% and 1% more than the one for aGPL = 5 µm and aGPL = 1 µm, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Silicene, a 2D allotrope of silicon, is predicted to be a potential material for future transistor that might be compatible with present silicon fabrication technology. Similar to graphene, silicene exhibits the honeycomb lattice structure. Consequently, silicene is a semimetallic material, preventing its application as a field-effect transistor. Therefore, this work proposes the uniform doping bandgap engineering technique to obtain the n-type silicene nanosheet. By applying nearest neighbour tight-binding approach and parabolic band assumption, the analytical modelling equations for band structure, density of states, electrons and holes concentrations, intrinsic electrons velocity, and ideal ballistic current transport characteristics are computed. All simulations are done by using MATLAB. The results show that a bandgap of 0.66 eV has been induced in uniformly doped silicene with phosphorus (PSi3NW) in the zigzag direction. Moreover, the relationships between intrinsic velocity to different temperatures and carrier concentration are further studied in this paper. The results show that the ballistic carrier velocity of PSi3NW is independent on temperature within the degenerate regime. In addition, an ideal room temperature subthreshold swing of 60 mV/dec is extracted from ballistic current-voltage transfer characteristics. In conclusion, the PSi3NW is a potential nanomaterial for future electronics applications, particularly in the digital switching applications.",

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) demonstrate unique physical and chemical properties, which allow several exciting potential applications in various fields including nanocomposites. Presently, the commercialized application of CNTs is still quite limited due to the formation of CNTs bundles, which significantly degrade the properties. Therefore, well dispersion of CNTs in nanocomposites is quite important, especially for CNTs/polymer composites, as a small amount of CNTs can improve the composite properties dramatically. This article will review the research on the dispersion of CNTs (including covalent and non-covalent functionalization) and the fabrication of CNTs/polymer composites through solution-based strategies by using the CNT dispersions.

    "abstract": "The rotor disk produces an azimuthal velocity component in the space between the rotor and stator of a turbine disk, also known as the rim seal cavity. As part of an empirically study, the rim seal cavity is subjected to a test aimed to count the number of unstable structures and evaluate their rotational speed. An Electronic Control Unit (ECU) has a leak test aperture that is sealed by a sealing device that is selectively disposed in the leak test aperture. Designing pump and compressor machines and units requires the development of dependable seal assemblies that maintain tightness over a long period of time and in a wide variety of pressures and temperature. In the field of electrochemical machining (ECM), heat-resistant and high-strength materials may be machined into complicated forms using this well-known technology. ECM presents some issues as the electrochemical copying of grooves, insulating groove features, slots and mini-holes can cause water leakage due to the poor sealing device of the closed integral structure turbine disk. Sealing devices of rotor turbine disks are heavy components with low-cycle fatigue analysis to their life curves. However, there is rare analysis to detect their defects in various rotor regions (temperature, considering stress, mission profile). This study by use of hydro-thermal loading has attempted to focus on the mechanical seals rings and basic productive and operating requirements. Taking the damage and wear, the clearance has been altered that cause a raising in leakage. Generally, the leakage grows more rapidly than linearly with the after-damage clearance. Also, damage and wear were related to the labyrinth seal itself, resulting that the bending curvature and the percentage of bent tooth length were also relevant in defining the leakage in the case of bending damage.",

A change from fixed effective mass and fixed dielectric constant to those which depend on the dopant coordinate manifestly affects TODF. Presence of noise and also its mode of application bring about more rich subtlety in the observed TODF profiles.

    "abstract": "In this disquisition, an exact solution method is developed for analyzing the vibration characteristics of magneto-electro-elastic functionally graded (MEE-FG) beams by considering porosity distribution and various boundary conditions via a four-variable shear deformation refined beam theory for the first time. Magneto-electro-elastic properties of porous FG beam are supposed to vary through the thickness direction and are modeled via modified power-law rule which is formulated using the concept of even and uneven porosity distributions. Porosities possibly occurring inside functionally graded materials (FGMs) during fabrication because of technical problem that lead to creation micro-voids in FG materials. So, it is necessary to consider the effect of porosities on the vibration behavior of MEE-FG beam in the present study. The governing differential equations and related boundary conditions of porous MEE-FG beam subjected to physical field are derived by Hamilton's principle based on a four-variable tangential-exponential refined theory which avoids the use of shear correction factor. An analytical solution procedure is used to achieve the natural frequencies of porous-FG beam supposed to magneto-electrical field which satisfies various boundary conditions. A parametric study is led to carry out the effects of material graduation exponent, porosity parameter, external magnetic potential, external electric voltage, slenderness ratio and various boundary conditions on dimensionless frequencies of porous MEE-FG beam. It is concluded that these parameters play noticeable roles on the vibration behavior of MEE-FG beam with porosities.

The films were submitted to annealing at 1100°C for 30 min in nitrogen to form the Si-QDs. The properties of as-deposited and annealed films were investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry, Fourier transform spectroscopy, Raman scattering and photoluminescence (PL) methods. Si-QDs were detected in SiNx films demonstrating the increase of sizes with Si excess. The residual amorphous Si clusters were found to be present in the films grown with Si excess higher than 50 at.%. Multi-component PL spectra at 300K in the range of 1.5-3.5 eV were detected and non-monotonous varying total PL peak versus Si excess was revealed. To identify the different PL components, the temperature dependence of PL spectra was investigated in the range of 20-300 K. The analysis allowed concluding that the blue-orange emission is due to the radiative defects in a SiNx matrix, whereas the red and infrared PL bands are caused by the exciton recombination in crystalline Si-QDs and amorphous Si clusters. The nature of radiative and no radiative defects in SiNx films is discussed. The ways to control the dominant PL emission mechanisms are proposed.",

This technique is based on the massive amplification of Raman signals which were feeble previously in order to use them for appropriate identification at qualitative and quantitative in chemical as well as biological systems. This novel powerful technique can be utilized to identify pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. As far as SERS is concerned, one of the most studied problems has been functionalization of SERS active substrate. Metal colloids and nanostructures or microstructures synthesized using noble metals such as Au, Ag and Cu are considered to be SERS active. Silver and gold are extensively used as SERS active substrates due to chemical inertness and stability in air compare to copper. However, use of Cu as a suitable alternative has been taken into account as it is cheap. Herein, we have synthesized air-stable copper microstructures/nanostructures by chemical, electrochemical and microwave-assisted methods. In this paper, we have also discussed the use of as synthesized copper micro/nanostructures as inexpensive yet effective SERS active substrates for the fast identification of micro-organisms like Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.",

Atomistic simulations based prediction has great potential in arriving at accurate traction-separation law. The present paper is aimed at establishing a method to address the above problem. A method for traction-separation law prediction via utilizing atomistic simulations data has been proposed. In this direction, firstly, a simpler approach of common neighbor analysis (CNA) for the prediction of crack growth has been proposed and results have been compared with previously used approach of threshold potential energy. Next, a scheme for prediction of crack speed has been demonstrated based on the stable crack growth criteria. Also, an algorithm has been proposed that utilizes a variable relaxation time period for the computation of crack growth, accurate stress behavior, and traction-separation atomistic law. An understanding has been established for the generation of smoother traction-separation law (including the effect of free surface) from a huge amount of raw atomistic data. A new curve fit has also been proposed for predicting traction-separation data generated from the molecular dynamics simulations. The proposed traction-separation law has also been compared with the polynomial and exponential model used earlier for the prediction of traction-separation law for the bulk materials.",

Zinc oxide nanoparticles have received considerable attention due to their unique antibacterial, antifungal, and UV filtering properties, high catalytic and photochemical activity. In this study, microbiological aspects of scale formation in PVC pipelines bacteria and fungi were isolated. In the emerging issue of increased multi-resistant properties in water borne pathogens, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle are being used increasingly as antimicrobial agents. Thus, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimum fungal concentration of ZnO nanoparticles towards pathogens microbe were examined in this study. The results obtained suggested that ZnO nanoparticles exhibit a good anti fungal activity than bactericidal effect towards all pathogens tested in in-vitro disc diffusion method (170 ppm, 100 ppm and 30 ppm). ZnO nanoparticles can be a potential antimicrobial agent due to its low cost of production and high effectiveness in antimicrobial properties, which may find wide applications in various industries to address safety issues. Stable ZnO nanoparticles were prepared and their shape and size distribution characterized by Dynamic light scattering (35.7 nm) and transmission electron microscopic TEM study for morphology identification (20 nm), UV-visible spectroscopy (230 nm), X-ray diffraction (FWHM of more intense peak corresponding to 101 planes located at 36.33° using Scherrer.s formula), FT-IR (Amines, Alcohols, Carbonyl and Nitrate ions), Zeta potential (-28.8).

Thermo-mechanical properties of the matrix and reinforcements are considered to be temperature dependent. Properties of the cylindrical panel are obtained using a refined micromechanical approach which introduces the auxiliary parameters into the rule of mixtures. The governing equations are obtained by using the static version of the Hamilton principle based on the first-order shear deformation theory and considering the linear strain-displacement relation. An energy-based Ritz method and an iterative process are used to obtain the critical buckling temperature of composite cylindrical panel with temperature dependent material properties. In addition, the effect of various parameters such as the boundary conditions, different geometrical conditions, distribution pattern of CNTs across the thickness and their volume fraction are studied on the critical buckling temperature and buckled pattern of cylindrical panels.

The results also represent that the vdW force and fringing effect on the electrostatic load increases the pull-in deflection and decrease the pull-in voltage. The numerical results of the present study show good agreement with previous analytical and experimental researches.",

    "abstract": "In this investigation, dynamic and bending behaviors of isolated protein microtubules are analyzed. Microtubules (MTs) can be considered as bio-composite structures that are elements of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells and posses considerable roles in cellular activities. They have higher mechanical characteristics such as superior flexibility and stiffness. In the modeling purpose of microtubules according to a hollow beam element, a novel single variable sinusoidal beam model is proposed with the conjunction of modified strain gradient theory. The advantage of this model is found in its new displacement field involving only one unknown as the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, which is even less than the Timoshenko beam theory. The equations of motion are constructed by considering Hamilton's principle. The obtained results are validated by comparing them with those given based on higher shear deformation beam theory containing a higher number of variables. A parametric investigation is established to examine the impacts of shear deformation, length scale coefficient, aspect ratio and shear modulus ratio on dynamic and bending behaviors of microtubules. It is remarked that when length scale coefficients are almost identical of the outer diameter of MTs, microstructure-dependent behavior becomes more important.",

The loss of stability in arteries may lead to arterial tortuosity and kinking. In this paper, post-buckling analysis of aorta artery is investigated under axial compression loads on the basis of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory by using finite element method. It is known that post-buckling problems are geometrically nonlinear problems. In the geometrically nonlinear model, the Von Karman nonlinear kinematic relationship is employed. Two types of support conditions for the aorta artery are considered. The considered non-linear problem is solved by using incremental displacement-based finite element method in conjunction with Newton-Raphson iteration method. The aorta artery is modeled as a cylindrical tube with different average diameters. In the numerical results, the effects of the geometry parameters of aorta artery on the post-buckling case are investigated in detail. Nonlinear deflections and critical buckling loads are obtained and discussed on the post-buckling case.",

Ferric oxide, titanium dioxide and copper oxide nanoparticles were used in varying amounts (2 g, 4 g and 6 g), and filtration data were obtained from the HPHT filtration test. The filter cakes formed were further analyzed with scanning electron microscope to obtain the morphological characteristics. The data obtained was used to validate the new filtrate loss model. This model specifically presents the concept of time variation in filter cake formation as against the previous works of constant and definite time. Regression coefficient which is a statistical measure was used to validate the new model and the predicted results were compared with the API model. The new model showed R2 values of 99.9%, and the predictions from the proposed filtration model can be said to be more closely related to the experimental data than that predicted from the API model from the SSE and RMSE results.",

This model has three-small scale coefficients in which two of them are for nonlocality and one of them applied for gradient effects. Hamilton supposition is applied to obtain the governing motion equation which is solved using a harmonic solution procedure. It is indicated that the longitudinal wave characteristics of the nanobeams are significantly influenced by the nonlocal parameters and strain gradient parameter.

    "abstract": "A tumor immune interaction is a main topic of interest in the last couple of decades because majority of human population suffered by tumor, formed by the abnormal growth of cells and is continuously interacted with the immune system. Because of its wide range of applications, many researchers have modeled this tumor immune interaction in the form of ordinary, delay and fractional order differential equations as the majority of biological models have a long range temporal memory. So in the present work, tumor immune interaction in fractional form provides an excellent tool for the description of memory and hereditary properties of inter and intra cells. So the interaction between effector-cells, tumor cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) are modeled by using the definition of Caputo fractional order derivative that provides the system with long-time memory and gives extra degree of freedom. Moreover, in order to achieve more efficient computational results of fractional-order system, a discretization process is performed to obtain its discrete counterpart. Furthermore, existence and local stability of fixed points are investigated for discrete model. Moreover, it is proved that two types of bifurcations such as Neimark-Sacker and flip bifurcations are studied. Finally, numerical examples are presented to support our analytical results.",

Assuming the effects of shear deformation and moderately high value of the radius-to-side ratio (R/a), based on the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and von Karman type of geometric nonlinearity, the governing system of equations is obtained. The analytical solution of field equations is carried out using the Ritz method together with the Newton-Raphson iterative scheme. The effects of radius-to-side ratio, temperature change, and boundary conditions on the nonlinear response of the functionally graded carbon nanotubes reinforced composite deep cylindrical panel (FG-CNTRC) are investigated. It is concluded that, among the five possible distribution patterns of CNT, FG-V CNTRC deep cylindrical panel is strongest with the highest bending moment and followed by UD, X, O, and Λ-ones. Also, considering the present deep cylindrical panel formulation increases the accuracy of the results. Hence, according to the noticeable amount of R/a in FG-CNTRC cylindrical panels, it is mandatory to apply strain-displacement relations of deep cylindrical panels for bending analysis of FG-CNTRC which certainly is desirable for industrial application.",

The pozzolans containing of metakaolin (15%, 25% and 35%), silica fume (6%, 12% and 18%) and fly ash (20%, 35% and 50%) were replaced instead of a part of cement separately or simultaneously.

The results showed that the pozzolans improved the microstructure of the SCC and the secondary reactions improved the mechanical properties of the concrete containing the pozzolans at older ages than the reference concrete. At 15% replacement, metakaolin increased the 180-day compressive strength up to 106 MPa that was about 18% more than reference concrete. In ternary mixtures the maximum and minimum rate were 29% and 19%, respectively, and in quaternary mixtures the rates were significant and increased up to 46%, while the rate for reference concrete was 20%. This significant growth was probably due to the secondary reaction of pozzolans with calcium hydroxide residue from cement hydration.",

The optimum amount of the factors participating in the mechanism of the fully connected neural network are achieved through the optimizer based on the momentum. The positive side of the mentioned approach employed in this investigation would be due to its high accuracy along with lower epochs required for training the multi-layered network. This scrutinization would be semi-computational research that estimates the vibrational behavior of a MEEAD employing a non-classical continuum model known as the modified couple stress (MCS) model. First-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and shell model would be provided for presenting their displacement fields. Then, Kelvin-Voight theory has been applied to model the viscoelastic foundation. Its non-classical governing equations, as well as related boundary conditions (BCs) of small-scaled MEEAD, would be achieved by considering the symmetric spinning gradient along with higher-order stress tensors for the strain energy. The provided non-classical theory would be able to capture the small scale in the MEEAD employing just one length scale of a material factor, then, the mathematical modeling of MEEAD according to the classical theory would be able to be recovered from the provided model by eliminating the material length scale factor. Ultimately, the non-classical governing equations would be solved by applying the generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) approach for multifarious BCs. Moreover, parametric research has been conducted to analyze the influences of the viscoelastic foundation, length scale factor, geometry of MEE, radial and circumferential mode number, radius ratio, and BCs on the frequency behavior of the MEEAD by applying MCST. The outcomes reveal that there would be a crucial radius ratio in which the relationship between these elements and crucial inserted voltage alters from direct to indirect relation.",

Due to finding the design-points features, the numerical solution procedure called two-dimensional generalized differential quadrature technique has been applied to the ordinary differential equations of the current structure system acquired on the foundation of the kinematic theory with refined higher order terms. Also, the involved parameters with the optimum values in the fully-connected neural network mechanism are obtained via momentum-based optimizer. For modeling a moderately thick structure, higher order terms of shear deformation are chosen. For stability analysis of the current structure the design points considering the method of adaptive learning is presented. For analysis of the current structure 'accuracy (used for determining the design-points) is presented through than the published outcomes in the literature. The outcomes of accuracy section of the current research show that the DNN-based model in analysis of the sandwich structure has less error than other models. The results show that the current momentum-based optimizer can be good tool for future researches about stability analysis of the various structure due to its good accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In the current study, vibration characteristics of a three-layered rectangular microplate with Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs)-reinforced Epoxy core which is fully bonded to piezoelectric-reinforced single-walled Carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) patches are provided. The face sheets are subjected to the electric field and the microplate is assumed to be in a thermal environment and also, is located on the visco-Pasternak model of the elastic substrate. The GNPs and SWCNTs are dispersed through the core's and face's thickness according to the given functions. To account the shear deformation effect, tangential shear deformation theory (TGSDT) as a higher-order theory is employed and the modified strain gradient theory (MSGT) with tree independent length-scale parameters is selected to capture the size effect. Using the extended form of Hamilton's principle and variational formulation, the governing motion equations are derived and solved mathematically via Navier's scheme for simply supported edges microplate. By ensuring the validity of the results after comparing them in a simpler state with previously published ones, the effects of the most prominent parameters on the results are investigated. It is seen GNPs and CNTs dispersion patterns play an important role in the microplate vibrational behavior, as well as temperature variations. Since the under consideration microstructure can be accounted as smart structures, therefore, the outcomes of this study may help to design and create more efficient engineering structures, such as sensors and actuators and also micro/nano electromechanical systems.",

This study is aimed at studying the decrement of land resources available, and the design of civil engineering structures on soft soils that will develop the soil impact of nano-SiO2 in the use of clay soil with low liquid limit, in particular shear resistance and unconfined compression. A novel nano-soil stabilizer has been created in this investigation by use of nano-SiO2 activity and ultrafine features that have enabled cement-based stabilizers to increase their characteristics in broad application possibilities. This research aims to examine the influence on soil engineering, particularly the shear strength of clay soil with a low liquid limit to the effect of adding nano-SiO2. Nano-SiO2 has 3 different percentages combined with soil (i.e., 0.5, 0.7 percent by weight of the parent soil), A direct shear test was used to evaluate the shear strength of the specimen, and then the results were analyzed by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to increase the accuracy of outcomes. Increased nano-SiO2 concentration was shown to lead to an increased internal friction angle and cohesiveness on clay soil. The optimal content for nano-SiO2 is 0.7%. ANN could accurately demonstrate the shear strength percentages in nano-SiO2 content.",

Therefore, from a technological view point, it is interesting to investigate properties of AC conductivity at frequencies of a few terahertz. To quantify the screw-induced potential effect, we calculated the AC conductivity of dislocated crystals using the Kubo formula. The conductivity showed peaks within the terahertz frequency region, where the amplitude of the AC conductivity was large enough to be measured in experiments. The measurable conductivity peaks did not arise in dislocation-free crystals threaded by a magnetic flux tube. These results imply different conductivity mechanisms in crystals with a screw dislocation than those threaded by a magnetic flux tube, despite the apparent similarity in their electronic eigenstates.",

In the current study, Size and zeta potential as well as AFM techniques have been used to prove the fact that the loading was performed correctly. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of the drug loaded on dendrimer nanoparticle were determined and compared with both of dendrimer alone and free drug with respect to staphylococcus aureus as the test microorganism. The anticancer activity among three groups including Streptomycin, Streptomycin –G2 dendrimer, and control was measured in vitro. In vitro studies showed that G2 anionic linear-globular polyethylene-glycol-based dendrimer, which loaded on Streptomycin was able to significantly improve the treatment efficacy over clinical Streptomycin alone with respect to proliferation assay. Maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated to be 257 μg/mL for streptomycin alone and 55 μg/mL for Streptomycin –\tG2 dendrimer. In addition, Streptomycin –G2 dendrimer conjugate prevented the growth of MCF-7 cancerous cells in addition to enhance the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells as demonstrated by an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate assay. Streptomycin –G2 dendrimer conjugate was able to increase Bcl-2/Bax ratio in a large scale compared with the control group and Streptomycin alone.

Employing the modified Lagrange equations for open systems, the nonlinear coupled governing equations of motion are achieved and solved via the state space problem; forth order numerical integration and Bolotin's method.

    "abstract": "Iron has a crucial role in growth as part of metalo-proteins like haemoglobin or myoglobin, enzymes; they are also involved in energetic reactions. Iron plays a vital role in fertility. At high doses, Iron has a harmful consequence on the reproductive system, which can be strongly reflected the final stage of spermatogenesis. Nutritional products are claiming to use nanotechnology and it is important to recognize the potential toxicity of nano-sized nutrients. Recently iron nanoparticles were proposed as a food additive for poultry. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of L-cystein coated iron oxide nanoparticles on reproductive performance in male quails. The results of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer, Alternating Gradient Force Magnetometer and Scaning Electron Microscopy showed that iron oxide nanoparticles was produced and have been coated with L-cycstein (Fe3O4-Cys NPs). A total of 100 one-week-old quail chicks were randomly placed to five groups of five replicates. Four quails (two male and two females) were raised in an individual cage for each replicate. The five experimental treatment diets consisted; negative control diet, with no Iron supplementation; positive control diet supplemented with 60 mg/kg of Fe3O4; treatment diets supplemented with 0.6, 6 and 60 mg/kg of L-cystein coated iron oxide nanoparticles. The hemoglobin, Red blood cell, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, gonadal somatic index, daily sperm production, total testicular sperm and sperm viability of the male quails that were fed with diet supplemented by 0.6 mg/kg of Fe3O4-Cys NPs were improved as compare with negative control. This study showed that not only the use of the Fe3O4-Cys nanoparticles had no side effects but also it can be used as a feed additive to improve the reproductive performance in male quails.",

This work analyzes the layer between the nanotube bottom and the substrate, which is thin and still susceptible to corrosion. The bottom of TiO2 nanotubes having Fluor resulting from the synthesis process changed between amorphous to crystalline anatase with a crystallite size of about 4 nm, which influenced the corrosion rates. Four kinds of samples were evaluated. A) NT by Ti anodizing; B) NTSB for Ti plates, either modifying its surface or anodizing the modified surface; C) NT-480 for anodized Ti and heat-treated (480oC) for reaching the anatase phase; D) NTSB-480 for Ti plates, first, modifying its surface using sandblast, after that, anodizing the modified surface, and finally, heat-treated to 480oC to compare with samples having induced crystallization and passivation. Four electrochemical techniques were used to evaluate the corrosion rates. The surfaces having TiO2 nanotubes with a sandblast pre-treatment had the highest resistance to corrosion.",

Elastomeric nanostructures are normally required to accomplish an explicit mechanical role and correspondingly their mechanical properties are crucial to affect device and material performance. Despite its wide application, the mechanical properties of PDMS are yet fully understood. In particular, the time dependent mechanical response of PDMS has not been fully elucidated. Here, utilizing state-of-the-art PeakForce Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping (PFQNM) together with Force Volume (FV) and Fast Force Volume (FFV), the elastic moduli of PDMS samples were assessed in a time-dependent fashion. Specifically, the acquisition frequency was discretely changed four orders of magnitude from 0.1 Hz up to 2 kHz. Careful calibrations were done. Force data were fitted with a linearized DMT contact mechanics model considering surface adhesion force. Increased Young's modulus was discovered with increasing acquisition frequency. It was measured 878+-274 kPa at 0.1 Hz and increased to 4586+-758 kPa at 2 kHz. The robust local probing of mechanical measurement as well as unprecedented high-resolution topography imaging open new avenues for quantitative nanomechanical mapping of soft polymers, and can be extended to soft biological systems.",

Isotopic materials are the constituents of these rings. The position of a ring support has been taken along the radial direction. The Rayleigh-Ritz method with three different fraction laws gives birth to the shell frequency equation. Moreover, the effect of height- and length-to -radius ratio and angular speed is investigated. The results are depicted for circumferential wave number, length- and height-radius ratios with three laws. It is found that the backward and forward frequencies of exponential fraction law are sandwich between polynomial and trigonometric laws. It is examined that the backward and forward frequencies increase and decrease on increasing the ratio of height- and length-to -radius ratio. As the position of ring is enhanced for clamped simply supported and simply supportedsimply supported boundary conditions, the frequencies go up. At mid-point, all the frequencies are higher and after that the frequencies decreases. The frequencies are same at initial and final stage and rust itself a bell shape. The shell is stabilized by ring supports to increase the stiffness and strength. Comparison is made for non-rotating and rotating cylindrical shell for the efficiency of the model.

    "abstract": "The significant issue that has been investigated in this research due to the great clinical potential is to separate a circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the peripheral blood and cancer treatment in advance. Nonetheless, it is difficult to detect CTCs because of the rare existence of CTCs in the middle of peripheral blood. It is found that the need of high resolution ethods is crucial because there is a similarity in size range between CTCs types such as the cells of breast cancer and the white blood cells (WBCs). This paper presents a device which can be used for tumor cells separation from the cells of blood with nonstop flow that is helped by fractionating dielectrophoresis (DEP) field-flow. The reason that leads CTCs to separate from the cells of blood is the obvious different sizes of hydrodynamics focusing and dielectrophoretic force. Numerous attempts have been made to calculate CTCs trajectories with the aid of simulating the flow speed and electric field and it reveals an accurate comparison of them with the measured results. Furthermore, the low applied voltage such 10 Vpp with which the represented device can be utilized. The high precision and efficiency of particle separation can be obtained by the device as well. According to the differences in size, this approach has various application for separation of other particles sorts. Based on our findings in this study, it is assumed that our device is beneficial for studying cancer and also has an excellent capability of separating tumor cells from blood cells.",

The overall nosocomial fungal infection rate in United States hospitals doubled from 1980–1990. Until recently, amphotericin B was the only agent available for the treatment of life-threatening candidal infections, but its use is plagued by toxicities including nephrotoxicity and infusion-related reactions such as rigors and hypotension. The availability of fluconazole, which is regarded more much less toxic than amphotericin B, prompted a surge in research to determine if it is as efficacious in the management of candidemia and hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. Complicating the interpretation of studies is the broad range of infection severity, from candidemia that may be transient and self-limiting to life-threatening hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. This study has used the models of Artificial neural network (ANN) and Support Vector regression (SVR) to accurately assess the clinical trials comparing fluconazole and amphotericin B demonstrate the efficacy of fluconazole for catheter-associated candidemia in critically ill patients when the likely pathogen is Candida albicans. As a result, Amphotericin B should remain the first-line agent for the management of candidemia and hematogenously disseminated candidiasis in all other patients. Also, SVR could accurately assess the efficacy of fluconazole for catheter-associated candidemia in critically ill patients.",

    "abstract": "Acute leukemia is a malignant tumor originating from the hematopoietic system with the highest incidence and mortality. At present, the main clinical treatment of leukemia is still chemotherapy, during the course of which the multidrug resistance (MDR) will significantly reduce remission rate and disease-free survival rate of patients. MDR is the most important factor affecting refractory/recurrent acute leukemia. Therefore, reversing leukemia MDR is one of the best ways to improve the complete remission rate of refractory/recurrent acute leukemia, and the study of drugs and methods to overcome leukemia MDR has received extensive attention in the leukemia research field. This study was to primarily investigate the effects of Liushen pills on leukemia drug-resistant cell line K562/DOX in inhibiting growth, reversing resistance and inducing apoptosis in anticipation of providing useful cytological and molecular biological basis for the treatment of refractory/recurrent acute leukemia. The serum containing toad venom was prepared by means of Chinese drug serum pharmacology. MTT assay was used to detect the inhibitory rates of human leukemia cell line K562/DOX after being treated with the serum containing toad venom as well as daunorubicin, or with the serum containing toad venom alone at different time points. Real-time fluorescent quantitative analysis (RT-PCR) was performed to determine the effects of serum containing toad venom on the expression of BCL-2 mRNA in human leukemia cell line K562/DOX. Compared to the control group, toad venom showed inhibitory effects on K562/DOX cells; the expression level of BCL-2 mRNA in toad venom group were decreased, indicating that toad venom may reverse the resistance of K562/DOX cells by down-regulating the expression level of MDR1.",

    "abstract": "By using differential quadrature method (DQM), a numerical investigation was provided for nonlinear stability behavior of magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) cylindrical shells at microscale. It is assumed that the cylindrical shell has been subjected to compressive loads leading to buckling phenomena in geometrically nonlinear regime. The non-uniformity of strain field has been inserted in the formulation for considering the microscale effects. The material properties of the shell are considered to be inhomogeneous with graded distribution. After solving the governing equations using DQM, it is realized that if the nanoscale shell is subjected to electrical and magnetic fields, the post-buckling path may be changed with the value of electrical voltage and magnetic potential. Also, strain gradient effects have remarkable influence on post-buckling curves and critical voltages.",
