    "abstract": "Predatory mites play the leading role in commercial augmentative biological control. They are mainly used in protected vegetable and ornamental cultivation systems to control phytophagous mites, thrips and whiteflies. Use in open-field systems and in animal husbandry is still limited. Phytoseiidae species are by far the most important group of commercially available mite biocontrol agents with about 20 species offered worldwide. Out of these, Amblyseius swirskii, Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseiulus cucumeris and Neoseiulus californicus are the most important ones, covering together about two thirds of the entire arthropod biocontrol agent market. The widespread use of these leaf-inhabiting predatory mites has stimulated research into their biology and we now have substantial knowledge on, for instance, the interaction between different predatory mite species, that helps to improve biocontrol programmes. Soil predatory mites, for example Stratiolaelaps scimitus (Laelapidae) or Macrocheles robustulus (Macrochelidae) for the control of sciarid fly larvae and thrips pupae are much less frequently used and also much less researched. This makes further development of biocontrol strategies using these mites more difficult. Currently, there appears to be no reliable method to quantify the abundance of these mites in soil samples. In studies at our laboratory, the frequently used Berlese-Tullgren funnels gave very variable results. We observed that soil predatory mites can even multiply during the extraction process. In addition to the control of plant pests, predatory mites can also be used to control parasites of animals like the poultry red mite, Dermanyssus gallinae. Good results have been obtained applying a combination of the predatory mites Androlaelaps casalis (Laelapidae) and Cheyletus eruditus (Cheyletidae) in laying hen stables. This paper provides an overview on the current status of commercial biological control using predatory mites and identifies research needs to make the currently available mite biocontrol agents even more successful and extend biological control with mites to other areas.",

In the present paper, we propose to examine the taxonomic status of this tetranychid mite through a review of studies that aimed to clarify its taxonomical position. We present and discuss the main results concerning the principal aspects investigated throughout literature published since the description of Boisduval in 1867. These studies concern morphological, biological and molecular data which have been used to separate or to synonymise T. cinnabarinus and Tetranychus urticae. Additional new morphological and biological data are also included. In light of the data presented, the authors conclude that T. cinnabarinus should be considered as a synonym of the polymorphic species T. urticae to which it constitutes the red form.",

    "abstract": "Slovenia is a small country of Central Europe. Until recently, only limited surveys had been carried out of the Phytoseiidae fauna. The occurrence of 14 species had been documented in two international papers: 6 belonging to the subfamily Amblyseiinae, 1 to the subfamily Phytoseiinae and 7 to the subfamily Typhlodrominae. Four additional species (3 Amblyseiinae and 1 Phytoseiinae) were recorded and published recently but in a national journal and not mentioned in the world online database of Phytoseiidae. Here, we present results from 2018 and 2019 field surveys and add a total of 22 new records (18 if we consider national published records): 14 Amblyseiinae, 3 Phytoseiinae and 5 Typhlodrominae. The Phytoseiidae fauna of Slovenia contains after our study 36 species: 20 Amblyseiinae, 4 Phytoseiinae and 12 Typhlodrominae. Among the 22 new record species, at least 8 species are well-known biological control agents (BCA). In addition to the intrinsic value of phytoseiid mite biodiversity in temperate environments, demonstration of the natural occurrence of efficient BCAs is of great agricultural, commercial and strategic interests.",

A little web (LW) !ife type, which in eludes four subtypes was recognized in four genera, namely Aponychus, Eurytetranychus, Panonychus and Yezonychus. Many species of Tetranychus and Eotetranychus, and a few of 0/igonychus, Panonychus and Schizotetranychus are accommodated in a category of complicated web type (CW) , which includes five subtypes. The third !ife type is characterized by a web nest (WN); it has five subtypes, and is found in the genera . Eotetranychus, Schizotetranychus and Oligonychus. It is postulated that the relationship between mite genus and leve! of !ife type complexity agrees with Tetranychinae phylogeny as proposed by GUTIERREZ et al. (1971). Relationships between host plants and spider mite !ife types operating on them indicated that polyphagous mites which live on unstable, annual host plants have only a single !ife type. This may be related to their mode of !ife as r-strategists. The !ife types of mites living on stable host plants, on the other hand, were quite diverse. Significance and problems of classification of !ife types in Tetranychinae, and relationships between the !ife types and !ife histories are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Because of the misuse of the term ’phoresy’, it is redefined as the attachment of one animal to another only when the attached animal actively sought a host, neither fed nor changed ontogenetically during attachment, and attached temporarily. Phoretic behaviour was investigated in the mite Macrocheles muscaedomesticae (Scop.), which is phoretic on the adults, and predacious on the eggs, of Musca domestica (L.). Phoretic attachment increased, and detachment decreased, with an increase in age of the manure substrate. The principal effect of age on manure apparently was the gradual decrease in moisture content. The addition of water to dried manure restored its attractiveness. The attractant component of manure is evidently not an ammonia-containing compound, judging by the general lack attraction of the mites to a series of such inorganic compounds. Since immobilised flies attracted many more phoretic mites than freshly killed flies, it is probable that the attractant in the flies is not simply movement. It was concluded that phoretic attachment occurs when the attractiveness of the manure exceeds that of the flies. This conclusion is in general agreement with the only other extensive investigation of phoretic behaviour in mites.",

In this country, according to the Spider Mites Web database, only 17 spider mite species belonging to seven genera have been reported. This study provides a review of the Serbian literature dealing with spider mites species recorded in Serbia and presents results of a four-year faunistic survey in which spider mites were collected on cultivated plants and native vegetation throughout the country. In the survey, a total of 23 species were recorded, including six species new to Serbian acarofauna: Bryobia praetiosa, Eotetranychus aceri, E. fraxini, E. pruni, Panonychus citri and Tetranychus evansi. Together with previously reported data, it raises the number of known spider mite species in Serbia to 36. A total of 90 host plant species from 21 families that are favorable to spider mites were recorded in this study; there were 62 new host records for 20 spider mite species with 11 records of new plant species as hosts of spider mites. There were 63 new records for Serbia among host plant species, raising the number of Serbian hosts for tetranychid mites to 137. The spider mite species new to Serbian acarofauna were found on 17 newly recorded host plants from 11 families. A key to all known spider mites species from Serbia is provided.",

    "abstract": "The tick family Argasidae is a complex and diverse assemblage of about 190 species. Taxa within the Family Ixodidae had received considerable attention by contemporary researchers, but currently there is no consensus about the relevant morphological features for the determination of argasid species nor there is consensus on the appropriate genus for about 130 species. As a result, many species of Argasidae have not been yet adequately described. The generic and subgeneric arrangements are still a matter of discussion and currently there is no strict description of supraspecific systematics of this group. In this review, we introduce the competing proposals for the systematics of the family Argasidae, together with an overview of prominent morphological, ecological and behavioural features, which are of interest in a synthesis of the family. Special attention is paid to previous attempts to systematize the group based on cladistic analysis, outlining the possible pros and cons of such a method. We also present the largest phylogenetic tree of the family in terms of the number of species resolved by molecular biology based on 16S rDNA. This tree provides support for some of the previously proposed systematic arrangements based on morphology alone, and shows no basic differences with other previously published trees using either nuclear or mitochondrial, coding or non-coding genes. Our main conclusion is that we are still far from an accurate view of the main evolutionary lines of the family. There is thus an urgent need to obtain additional material to, first, explore the relative position of the different species in the phylogenetic arrangement of the family, and second, to capture adequate morphological features which could support a systematic key, necessary for any kind of faunistic or epidemiological studies.",

Besides using bio-acaricides, biological control agents also show promise for T. urticae control in IPM programs. However, their compatibility with the effective predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae) remains unstudied. The current study evaluated the lethal effects of the microemulsion formulations of essential oils and the microbial-derived substance milbemectin (used as a positive control) at different exposure times on eggplant leaves. To evaluate their relative fitness on A. swirskii, biological observations were conducted on A. swirskii exposed after the 168-hour waiting period, which is determined safe for the essential oil formulations under controlled conditions (16-hour light/8-hour dark photoperiod at 27±1 °C and 70±5% humidity). The results showed that the development time of the offspring was not significantly affected by the essential oil formulations or milbemectin when compared to the control group. The longevity of A. swirskii females were not significantly shortened by essential oil formulations (21–24 days), while it was significantly reduced on leaves treated with milbemectin (8 days). While the mean fecundity and oviposition days were not significantly affected by essential oil formulations, no oviposition was observed on leaves treated with milbemectin. Based on the two-sex life table analysis, the net reproductive rate (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=7, 8, 8 offspring), the intrinsic rate of increase (r=0.139, 0.149, 0.139 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and the finite rate of increase (λ=1.15, 1.16, 1.15 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the mean generation time (T=14, 14, 15 d) for A. swirskii treated with orange oil, neem oil, and terpenoid blend, respectively, were statistically similar to those observed in the control group (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=7 offspring, r= 0.124 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, λ= 1.13 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; T= 15).

The life-history pattern of the stem species of Parasitengona and Trombidia is reconstructed along the phylogenetic system. It is hypothesized that these stem species displayed an epigaeic life style in biotopes with fluctuating air humidity. Larval parasitism of Parasitengona on flying insects is directly derived from a predatory life-style, the main advantage being the increased ability to disperse via the host. Calyptostasis in proto- and tritonymphs evolved to ease synchronization of life cycles with optimal host availability. Protelean parasitism and evolution of calyptostatic instars led to restricted possibilities to increase offspring numbers. High larval mortality in turn led to a number of different pathways to circumvent this constraint, e.g. neosomy or additional moulting of postlarval instars. In the stem lineage of Hydrachnidia an aquatic life style evolved in temporary waters, Trombidioidea switched to an edaphic life in its stem lineage, while Erythraeoidea adapted to xeric environmental conditions. The causes of the diversity and success of parasitengone groups are discussed.",

Very few is known about comparative dorsal adult organotaxy in Protoadenic gamasids. In young stases, not one of these organotaxies has been fully described. vVe there for are not ready for perfecting a general nomenclature based on unquestionable homologies of the dorsal cuticular organs as a whole. From this point of view idionymic glands, sensilla and sigilla are often easy to identify and the status of many uncertain hairs has to be reexamined owing to their topological behaviour towards the formers. In ProtoadeniC cohorts, the organotactic diversity in the opisthonotum is much greater than in the peltidium. This paper is not actually a morphological contribution as it lacks the general (comparative) scale; this is mainly a guide to the cartographical survey and to the interpretation of adult amblyseiine dorsum; moreover this surveying process is quite suitable to comparative investigations in other Protoadenic taxa. The leading aim of the paper is to promote the introduction, into species descriptions, of features characteristic of the described material in order that these attributes take the place of useless familial or cohort features in such descriptions. The cartography of an amblyseiine adult ennomic orthoadenic dorsal surface is given. Within the Tribe, dorsal organocuticular diversity has three sources: meristic, topological and structural variabilities. These are illustrated by numerous instances. The division of the dorsum into organogerous areas makes the checking of the survey much easier and is well adapted to comparative observations. Some advices concerning preparing, observing and drawing specimens are provided. Several basic terminological elements are listed.",

Detailed studies on the transmission, maintenance, infectivity, virulence, and pathogenicity of tick-borne microparasites all require the use of large numbers of live ticks raised under controlled conditions and difficulties in rearing ticks in the laboratory could partly explain the current lack of data. The most complex part in maintaining tick colonies doubtlessly lies in their engorgement, as ticks are strict haematophagous arthropods. Indeed, relatively few research teams have worked on artificial feeding systems for ticks due to the long, complex, and poorly understood feeding patterns of these arthropods. It is nonetheless essential to investigate the mechanisms underlying tick infection and infectiousness in order to better understand parasite-host-vector relationships and elaborate new control strategies for transmitted pathogens. The various methods used to date to feed ticks and infect them with their associated pathogens are reviewed here and their advantages and inconveniences are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Amblydromalus limonicus (Acari: Phytoseiidae) was described in 1956 from citrus in California; its distribution range covers North and South America, Australia and New Zealand. It first caught the attention of biocontrol workers in the 1960s as natural enemy of the spider mites Oligonychus punicae and Tetranychus cinnabarinus in avocados and other fruit trees. In laboratory studies, A. limonicus developed into adults and laid eggs on several species of mites, thrips, whiteflies and scale insects, as well as on pollen. Interest into A. limonicus re-emerged in the early 1990s after the western flower thrips (WFT, Frankliniella occidentalis) had spread nearly all over the world. It was collected during surveys for WFT biocontrol agents in New Zealand and Australia. Laboratory and semi-field experiments in the Netherlands and Australia showed that A. limonicus was a very promising candidate for biological control of WFT in several greenhouse crops. However, it was not possible to establish a commercially viable mass rearing system. At around the same time A. limonicus was also identified in surveys in South America for classical biocontrol agents for the cassava green mite (Mononychellus tanajoa) in Africa. Detailed taxonomic research showed, however, that the mites collected in these surveys were a closely related, undescribed species that was given the name Amblydromalus manihoti in 1994. Recently, a mass production system for A. limonicus was developed and the mite became commercially available in January 2012. With the material from this mass production system, more semi-field and field trials could be conducted. Results showed that A. limonicus is also an excellent biocontrol agent for greenhouse whiteflies (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) in various greenhouse crops including roses, cucumbers and strawberries. As this predatory mite originates from more temperate areas, it is a good complement to Amblyseius swirskii, which is currently the most frequently used phytoseiid in thrips and whitefly control, and Transeius montdorensis, which also recently came on the market. Both species originate from sub-tropical regions and have a higher optimum temperature than A. limonicus.",

The results revealed that mite survival rate varied from 66.5% on Bella Vita to 85.9% on Persian yellow. The immature development time was different among the tested rose cultivars and ranged from 9.35 days on Orange Juice to 12.30 days on Bella Vita. The highest fecundity rate was recorded on Pink Promise. Consequently, population growth parameters were also significantly affected. The lowest intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was recorded on Roulette and this parameter was relatively higher on Cool Water, Orange Juice, and Persian yellow. In addition, the highest net reproductive rate (R0) was observed on Pink Promise, which was significantly higher than Roulette, Tea, and Valentine cultivars. The longest mean generation time (T) was calculated on Roulette and the shortest on Cool Water, Tea, and Orange Juice. The lowest performance of the two-spotted mite on Roulette could indicate that this is a suitable cultivar against mite infestation. Differences in mite susceptibility of tested rose cultivars here highlighted have the potential to be used for integrated pest management of T. urticae in ornamental rosa cultivations.",

The aim of this study was to determine the species composition of tenuipalpid mites in the northern part of Iran, Mazandaran province. More than 150 plant species belonging to 41 families were inspected for possible infestation with tenuipalpid mites, among which 28 plant species were infested. Most of the infested plants are new records for the respective mite species. A total of 14 species of tenuipalpid mites belonging to five genera were collected and identified. Though citrus is the major fruit crop grown in Mazandaran province, flat spider mites were not yet reported from it in this area.

    "abstract": "Identification of species within the family Phytoseiidae is of primary importance for biological control programs. However, considerable disagreements between authors are often observed concerning the placement of species in genera. Moreover, considering the small number of available morphological characters and the poor knowledge of their reliability for species diagnostics, synonymies between several species could be questioned. This study aims to provide a taxonomic revision of a genus belonging to the sub-family Typhlodrominae: Neoseiulella Muma. Whereas the last revision of this genus (carried out in 1996) took into account 26 valid species, we propose now to include 47 species in the genus Neoseiulella based on type material observations. At first, three species (Neoseiulella eiko, N. eleglidus and N. schusteri) have been excluded from this genus, as their morphological attributes do not match the morphological characters which define the genus. Secondly, we also think that another species placed in the genus Typhlodromus (Anthoseius): <I>T.</I> (<I>A.</I>) elisae, has to be included in the genus Neoseiulella. Finally, several synonymies have been analysed and we conclude that: (i) N. aceri is a synonym of N. squamiger and provisionally of N. aceris, (ii) N. tiliarum is a synonym of N. formosa, (iii) N. transitans is a synonym of N. prunus, and provisionally of N. vollsella, (iv) N. manukae is a synonym of N. glenfieldensis and (v) Neoseiulella tuberculata, N. sexapori and N. arutunjani are considered valid specific entities. A new synonymy between Neoseiulella nesbitti and N. armidalensis is also proposed. A standardised re-description of all the species of the genus is proposed and a key to the species for the adult females is provided. This study also gives an exhaustive compilation of all available information concerning the geographical distribution of species of Neoseiulella and their plant supports.",

Densities of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 prey were offered to 4 (protonymph), 5 (deutonymph), 6 (1-day-old adult), 10 (5-day-old adult), 15 (10-day-old adult), 20 (15-day-old adult), 25 (20-day-old adult), 30 (25-day-old adult), 35 (30-day-old adult) and 40 (35-day-old adult) P. persimilis individuals. The results of logistic regression analyses showed that on the 15th, 35th and 40th days of predator age, predation rate of T. urticae eggs increased, resulting in the type III functional response, while at the other ages, the functional response was type II. The Rogers model was used to estimate searching efficiency (a) and handling time (Th). The longest handling time was obtained in the protonymphal stage with 2.377 +/- 0.192 h. The shortest handling time and the highest value of estimated maximum attack rate (T/Th) were estimated at the age of 20 days (0.494 +/- 0.009 h and 48.57prey/day). At the highest prey density used (128 eggs), our findings showed that the highest number of prey was eaten by 15, 20, 25 and 30 days old P. persimilis (39.3, 41.7, 39.3 and 38.1 eggs per day, respectively). The results of this study revealed that P. persimilis especially at the middle and late ages has a good predation potential on T. urticae eggs at higher prey densities.",

Habitat records suggest that L. arctica Wood, L. gersoni ·wood and L. rhodomela (KocH) mostly occur on mosses colonizing open soils, whereas L. frigida Habeeb prefers moss growing in shaded, very humid places. L. frigida was studied in the laboratory. It feeds on moss leaves, sucking out cell contents but leaving cell-walls intact. The life cycle lasts about 30 days (at 23 ± 20 C). Reproduction is arrhenotokous, as isolated females have only male descendants. Females, whether confined with males or isolated, laid about 21 eggs. The mites reproduced freely under both long-day (r6 hours) and short-day (g hours) photoperiodic regimes. Transfer experiments showed that L. frigida will feed and survive on many moss species. Reproduction, however, occurs only whilst feeding on a few of these. Eggs placed in distilled water hatched and the larvae developed to the adult while thus immersed, but no oviposition took place under water. The species L. rhodomela, L. clavata (Canestrini and Fanzago) and L. schustteri Summers and Priee also fed on various mosses and had similar life cycles.",

In non-phylogenetic treatments, the subfamily Hypoaspidinae (Laelapidae) has been hypothesized as the most primitive group within Dermanyssoidea, and the subfamily Laelapinae has been was suggested as the source of most parasitic lineages. This study uses the 28S region (domains 1-3) of the nuclear rDNA array to address phylogenetic relationships within Dermanyssoidea and the evolution of parasitism.

For different reasons, the chemical control of this pest is not feasible, and biological control has been considered an important measure to be pursued. The objective of this paper is to provide details about an effort to determine potential natural enemies of R. indica from La Reunion, for their possible introduction in northern Brazil. The only natural enemy consistently found in association with R. indica was identified as the phytoseiid Amblyseius largoensis Muma. A colony of this species was established with specimens collected from different parts of the island.

Additions to the roster of mites that affect pests (including weeds and pathogens), and of pests that may be, or are, significantly affected by ABAs, were noted. The various pest-debilitating mechanisms used by ABAs, including predation, parasitism, parasitoidism, parasiticcastration, competition as well as reductions in weed and phytopathogenic fungal growth are listed. Theaffected targets include agricultural, veterinary and medical pests, as well as weeds, nematodes and fungi. The effect of intra-guild predation on the ABAs’ ability to affect pests is discussed, along with other organisms that increase the controlling impact of ABAs. The influence of host plants, including their architecture, leaf surfaces, domatia, pollen, genetically modified plants (GMOs) and volatiles are then reviewed. Then come mite feeding on soil-inhabiting pests and the newly-discovered effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. ABA feeding on weeds and on nematodes is briefly discussed next, along with the few known ABA diseases. The effect of plant-protection chemicals are then considered, followed by new techniques for the better implementation of ABAs. These include mass rearing, modes of distribution, long-term maintenance and the application of molecular methods to determine quantitative and qualitative feeding rates. This review ends with suggestions for further research, including more collecting and assaying of ABAs (especially indigenous species), determining the effects of secondary predators and of light regimes in greenhouses, and increasing studies on the role of volatiles of plant and nematode source, and of ABAs as vectors of pest diseases.",

    "abstract": "Existing literature on marine associated Ameronothroidea is reviewed and recapitulated. Although these littoral oribatid mites strongly resemble typical terrestrial mites, they have evolved different adaptions of various kinds to the marine littoral environment. In order to cope with intertidal wave action, most species show reduced and compact sensilla as well as sickle-shaped and elongated claws. Complex cerotegument based plastron mechanisms have evolved to allow breathing under flooded conditions and enabling these organisms to survive an average of more than a month completely submerged in saltwater. Behavioural adaptations include aggregations, diurnal and circatidal activity patterns, daily and seasonal migrations and thigmotaxis. Most taxa show no reproductive adaptions to the littoral habitat but some have developed ovoviviparity to protect the offspring and a few also have evolved distinct sexual dimorphism supposed to allow direct mating and secure sperm transfer in this constantly changing environment. Ameronothroid taxa are basically generalized feeders grazing on intertidal algae, lichens and fungi which also serve as microhabitat. Coastal areas all over the globe have been colonized and these mites can be found in a wide range of habitats: e.g. polar shores, rocky coasts, sandy beaches, tropical mangrove forests, brackish river estuaries and salt marshes. The families show a distinct climate related distribution pattern, with the Ameronothridae (Podacaridae included) in polar and cold temperate regions and the Fortuyniidae and Selenoribatidae in subtropical and tropical areas. Long distance transport to remote islands is supposed to be mainly achieved by bird phoresy in Ameronothridae and by dispersal via strong ocean currents in Fortuyniidae and Selenoribatidae. In literature there are basically two contrasting theories explaining the evolutionary invasion of marine associated habitats by ameronothroid mites, one favoring a monophyletic origin and a single land-to-sea transition event and another preferring an independent terrestrial ancestry and accordingly multiple invasions of the marine littoral environment. Recent molecular genetic studies support the latter theory and render the present superfamily of Ameronothroidea a polyphyletic taxon.",

Additionally, in a survey for natural enemies of Aculops lycopersici (Tryon), P. ubiquitus was found in most European countries where samples were gathered as well as in Morocco. Together with specimens available from museum collections and originating from Brazil, South Africa and Türkiye, the newly collected specimens were measured and morphologically compared with those from the type locality. Additionally, single female expansion lines were set-up with specimens from California (USA), Belgium, France, Italy, The Netherlands and Morocco, and molecular analysis were performed in order to construct a phylogenetic tree. The tree showed differences between origins, but this was assigned to intraspecific variation. A PCA analysis on morphological characters separated the Brazilian specimens from those of all other geographical origins. The Californian (USA) specimens grouped together, as did the Moroccan and all European specimens, but with overlap between the groups. The Brazilian specimens were described as a new species, P. brasiliensis n. sp. All other specimens were considered as P. ubiquitus. Furthermore, we searched for types of early described Pronematus species and studied P. rykei, P. karrooi and P. tenuisetosus types; the first two species were confirmed morphologically as a distinct Pronematus species while the latter belongs to the genus Pseudopronematulus. The morphological characteristics of specimens that were used for a recent redescription of P. rykei did not coincide with our redescription of the type. We transferred those specimens to the new species, P. juglandi sp. nov.",

(Acari: Astigmata: Acaridae), a newly identified species of mite from Eocene Rovno amber (34–37 Ma), based on both male and female specimens. The exceptional preservation of the fossils, coupled with advanced amber preparation and imaging techniques—including high-resolution microscopy, differential interference contrast (DIC) with transmitted light, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) equipped with a super-resolution detector—enabled detailed examination of nearly all diagnostic features. These data allowed us to perform a comprehensive comparison between this fossil species and extant representatives of the genus Histiogaster. Based on morphological similarities with extant species of known biology, and the presence of syninclusions such as fossilized phloem sap emulsions and fungal or bacterial hyphae, we hypothesize that this fossil mite likely fed on fermented tree sap and associated microorganisms. Our findings indicate that species within the genus Histiogaster have undergone minimal morphological changes since the Eocene, while continuing to occupy their ancestral ecological niche. We also review fossil Astigmata and provide an annotated checklist of 14 fossil astigmatid records, and exclude 8 records, including the genus Palaeotyroglyphus Dubinin, 1962, from Astigmata.",

The RP was obtained in a previous study through six successive selections of abamectin and bifenazate from the NP of A. swirskii, resulting in a 25-fold resistance level. The functional and numerical responses of the NP and RP populations were evaluated under untreated conditions (control) and after treatment with the recommended concentration (100 ml/100 L distilled water) of an abamectin+bifenazate mixture at 27 ± 1 °C, under a 16:8 (L:D) photoperiod and 80 ± 5% relative humidity. The functional and numerical responses, as well as the related parameters of NP and RP females, were analyzed in response to different egg densities of Tetranychus urticae Koch (Tetranychidae). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the untreated RP and NP and the treated RP exhibited a Type II functional response, whereas the treated NP exhibited a Type III functional response. The handling times for T. urticae eggs were recorded as 0.0454 and 0.0376 hours for the untreated NP and RP, respectively, while they were calculated as 0.0420 and 0.0381 hours for the treated NP and RP, respectively. The handling time (Th) increased significantly in NP after acaricide treatment. The Th value of RP was not affected by acaricide treatment. The attack rate coefficients (α) varied considerably among the populations and treatments, with the highest value observed in the untreated RP (1.27), followed by the treated RP (1.13), the untreated NP (1.00), and the treated NP (0.71). Under untreated conditions, A. swirskii exhibited a higher α value in the RP population than the NP population. Our findings indicate that the resistant A. swirskii population can effectively feed on T. urticae eggs and oviposit, even at low prey densities and under acaricide-treated conditions.",

    "abstract": "A survey of phytoseiid mites was carried out in more than 2300 vineyards, selected from all viticultural regions of France and representative of the main agricultural practices during 1985-97. Twenty-two species were found, of which Typhlodromus pyri and Kampimodromus aberrans were the most abundant. T. pyri was the dominant species in all vineyards except in two southern regions where K. aberrans was dominant. Ten species were already known in France, but three of them were collected for the first time on grapevines. Twelve species had not been inventoried in French mite fauna surveys before this study. Some factors seem to influence phytoseiid mite densities within vineyards. Cultivars with smooth leaves do not seem to be suitable for phytoseiid mites. Vine crops located near woody environments seem to be better colonized than crops remote from any uncultivated zones. Above all, crop protection practices seem to have a detrimental effect on phytoseiid mite densities. The use of insecticides and acaricides and to a lesser extent of some fungicides such as benzimidazoles and dithiocarbamates, applied several times during the year before samplings, explains the absence of phytoseiid mites on treated grapevine crops. The implications of these results for viticultural mite management and research prospects are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The reactions and behaviour of four indicator species of oribatid mitesto linear and alternative relative humidities at constant temperatures have beenstudied. 2. An arboreal species, Humerobates rostrolamellatus Grandjean inatially chose a dry humidity; the humidity reaction was reversed to a moist one after 4-5 days. Belba geniculosa Oudms., collected from oak-litter, had an initial moist reaction. Platynothrus peltifer (Koch), found in litter and bog moss, had a similar reaction. A species found in permanently damp sphagnum, Fuscozetes fuscipes (Koch), showed no marked responses to humidity gradients. 3. The higher the temperature, the greater the choice for the higher humidity. 4. H. rostrolamellatus changed its initial dry reaction to a moist one after 5 days desiccation at 15° C when one-third of its original body-weight was lost. The initial moist reaction of B. geniculosa was much intensifi.ed after only 6 hours desiccation, when merely one-twenty fi.fth of its body-fluids were lost. 5. B. geniculosa showed a stronger initial moist reaction when starved for one week. This behaviour persisted for II weeks. 6. The intensity of the dry reaction of H. rostrolamellatus was correlated with the steepness of the difference in humidity rather than the position of the humidity in the humidity range. With B. geniculosa and P . peltifer the position of the higher humidity in the humidity range was more important than humidity differences in the low end of the humidity scale. F. fuscipes again showed little response. 7. The higher the temperature, the faster the speed of movement with all the species of mites. 8. H. rostrolamellatus was more active in moist air than in dry air; B. geniculosa was more active in dry air than in moist; results with F. fuscipes were variable. 9. The activity of individual B. geniculosa in a humidity gradient differed from the activity of batches of mites under the same conditions. Contact stimuli accounts for this difference in behaviour. 10. The orientation mechanism and behaviour of single B. geniculosa at humidity boundaries are discussed. 11. The humidity receptors are probably located on the forelegs.",

However, with the exception of their taxonomy, many aspects of the biology of oribatid mites have been poorly studied. This might be explained in part by the previous lack of a model species. However, in the last 20 years, more and more non-taxonomic studies regarding development, genetics, morphology, chemical ecology and ecotoxicology have become available, with a significant number focused on the trhypochthoniid oribatid mite Archegozetes longisetosus. A well-defined laboratory strain of this pantropical parthenogenetic species was established in 1993 by one of us (RAN), and has since spread through numerous laboratories worldwide. In this review, we summarize the scientific achievements this lineage has enabled while becoming a model system for general zoology, ecology and evolution.",

    "abstract": "The members of the family Scutacaridae (Acari, Heterostigmatina, Pygmephoroidea) are soil-living, fungivorous mites, and some of them are known to be associated with other animals. After reviewing the mites’ behavioural and morphological adaptations to their animal-associated lifestyle, the present publication shows the result of a thorough literature research on scutacarids living in different kinds of associations with other animal taxa. It revealed that within the more than 800 scutacarid species that have been described so far, about the half of them can be found together with various animal taxa. The respective scutacarid species can be phoretic using their hosts for dispersal, they can be inquilines of their hosts benefiting from favourable conditions in the hosts’ nests, or they can be both. The highest number of scutacarid species, by far, (n = 214) is associated with ants. The second highest number can be found on beetles (94; mainly on ground beetles, Carabidae), followed by mammals (52), bees and wasps (35) and other insect taxa (39), and some species can be found together with birds (10) and arachnids (6). The most frequent genera Scutacarus, Imparipes and Archidispus show host preferences: Scutacarus and Imparipes tend to prefer ants, while Archidispus prefers beetles. Usually, scutacarid species are rather specialised on one host genus or one host family, but some seem to be host generalists. The possible influence of scutacarids on their hosts is not known yet, but they could play a sanitary role in their hosts’ nests.",

    "abstract": "Oribatid mites are a specious order of microarthropods within the Chelicerata, compromising about 11,000 described species. They are ubiquitously distributed across different microhabitats in all terrestrial ecosystems around the world and were among the first animals colonizing terrestrial habitats as decomposers and scavengers. Despite their species richness and ecological importance genomic resources are lacking for oribatids. Here, we present a 143-Mb chromosome-level genome assembly of the clonal, all-female oribatid mite species Archegozetes longisetosus Aoki, a model species used by numerous laboratories for the past 30 years. Comparative genomic and transcriptional analyses revealed patterns of reduced body segmentation and loss of the segmental identity gene abd-A within Acariformes, and unexpected expression of key eye development genes in these eyeless mites across developmental stages. Consistent with their soil dwelling lifestyle, investigation of sensory genes revealed a species-specific expansion of gustatory receptors, and evidence of horizontally transferred genes related to cell wall degradation of plant and fungal matter, both components of Archegozetes’ diet. Oribatid mites are also noted for their biosynthesis capacities and biochemical diversity. Using biochemical and genomic data, we were able to delineate the backbone biosynthesis of monoterpenes, an important class of compounds found in the major exocrine gland system of Oribatida – the oil glands. Given the mite’s strength as an experimental model, the new high-quality resources provided here will serve as the foundation for molecular research in Oribatida and will enable a broader understanding of chelicerate evolution.",

    "abstract": "Trichomes are a first line of defense of plants against herbivorous arthropods, but they can also act as a barrier against natural enemies hampering biological control programmes. Despite the abundance of trichome types on tomato plants, many herbivorous arthropods can still evade these defenses. Over the past decades, numerous studies have evaluated the impact of tomato trichomes on phytophagous arthropods, yet few have examined their effects on biological control agents. Moreover, studies on the complex tri-trophic interactions among tomato plants, arthropod pests, and natural enemies remain limited, highlighting the need for further research to deepen our understanding of these relationships. Understanding the effects of tomato trichomes on both pests and biological control agents could enhance pest management strategies, informing tomato breeding and biological control programs. To support ongoing research and practical applications, this paper reviews the effects of tomato trichomes on the development of pests, including that of phytophagous mites and their natural enemies, with a particular focus on predatory mites. Current challenges and future directions are discussed.",

In moving down the podocephalic canal, the secretion picks up water from the air and is then imbibed. Thus, fresh water from the air can be continuously added to the water pool of such a mite. Internally, it is postulated that the salt moves from the gut to the blood, to the supracoxal gland, to the prebuccal cavity and back to the gut. In dry air, the water is evaporated from the supracoxal fluid leaving a residue of salt and other constituents that form a plug that prevents the loss of water from the opening of the gland while at the same time preserving the water uptake capacity of the salt in a manner that does not build up the osmotic pressure of the body fluids",

    "abstract": "Expressions of strong sexual dimorphism have been found in 77 species of Brachypylina, representing 36 genera, in the superfamilies Gustavioidea, Ameroidea, Oppioidea, Limnozetoidea, Ameronothroidea, Licneremaeoidea, Oripodoidea, Oribatelloidea, Ceratozetoidea and Galumnoidea. There are many examples of convergences, e.g., modifications of tarsus I setae in Cosmogneta (Autognetidae), Hydrozetes (Hydrozetidae) and Erogalumna (Galumnidae), and of possible behavioural constraints, e.g., the paraxial position of modified setae in sexually dimorphic species in these genera. Similarly, there is strong convergence in position and modification of presumed secretory porose organs in species of Autogneta (Autognetidae), Mochloribatula (Mochlozetidae), Symbioribates (Symbioribatidae), Oribatella (Oribatellidae), Zachvatkinibates, Nuhivabates (Punctoribatidae), Xiphobates (Chamobatidae) and Psammogalumna (Galumnidae). The number of superfamilies with sexually dimorphic species and the range of expression of sexual dimorphism suggest multiple independent origins in Brachypylina, as congeneric species in 20 of these 36 genera do not show such modifications. Despite 1% of brachypyline species being strongly sexually dimorphic, the evidence for courtship behaviour is limited to the Galumnidae and an undescribed species of Mochloribatula (Mochlozetidae). Evolution of strongly sexually dimorphic species in Oribatida seems to be in response to intermittent dryness, or aquatic habitats, or spatially discrete microhabitats. The littoral habitat is represented by 11 species showing strong sexual dimorphism, coastal vegetation by 6, the semiaquatic by 5, dry soil by 4 species and crustose lichens by 3 species. Arguably, these 28 species and some of the 19 species reported from arboreal habitats (including lichens and moss) live in microhabitats that can be intermittently dry, with wet-dry periods of varying lengths and intensity. Seven sexually dimorphic species of Hydrozetes are found in aquatic habitats; males of these all show modifications of one or more paraxial seta on tarsus I which may be used to orient the female. The 5 sexually dimorphic species of Autogneta, and Unguizetes mauritius (Jacot) are associated with decaying wood, bark and fungal sporophores, suggesting evolution of sexual dimorphism in this spatially discrete habitat. Undoubtedly, there are many other undiscovered cases of sexual dimorphism in Brachypylina, as microhabitats where they predominantly occur are rarely studied.",

Because of the agronomical importance of the two mite species, a wealth of modelling studies investigated the interactions of the two species at the individual level. However, regional or global level works on this system are lacking, which is impeding the investigation of climate change effects on biological control effectiveness. Here we compile and geo-locate worldwide occurrences for the two species considered, based on literature, collection and field survey data. The datasets presented in this document gather most of the literature records of both species for which locality data were available for geo-referencing (1,037 for T. urticae and 126 for P. persimilis). Geo-located data from collections and field surveys including host-plants are also presented for the first time (322 for T. urticae and 65 for P. persimilis). Phytoseiulus persimilis is also reported for the first time from Kenya and La Martinique.",

    "abstract": "Diversity of most animal and plant taxa increases towards the equator. The reasons for this pattern are manifold, but their relative importance is controversial. Understanding of the radiation of animal taxa is needed to uncover the mechanisms underlying latitudinal gradients in biodiversity. Species may have evolved more quickly in tropical regions, suggesting that the tropics function as cradle of diversity, or they may have survived in the tropics for longer periods of time as compared to higher latitude biomes, suggesting that the tropics function as museum of diversity. We used oribatid mites as a model group to investigate if the high species number of this mainly soil-living taxon can be explained by the cradle or museum hypothesis. We analyzed oribatid mite communities in tropical and temperate forest ecosystems, sequenced 18S and part of the 28S rDNA of common species, and constructed phylogenetic trees using Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood algorithms. Then, we mapped the distribution of species (tropical, temperate, cosmopolitan) onto the phylogenetic tree. Most tropical oribatid mite taxa formed terminal branches indicating that the high diversity of oribatid mites in tropical regions is due to recent radiation, supporting the hypothesis that the tropics function as cradle of oribatid mite diversity. Further, the results suggest that most early-derivative oribatid mite taxa are cosmopolitan indicating that they evolved on a large ancient continent. Overall, our results support the view that oribatid mites are a very old taxon which radiated intensively in tropical regions, but their origin predates the existence of the tropical regions of today.",

    "abstract": "Coextinction is a major and growing threat to global biodiversity. One of the affected groups is the eriophyoid mites (Prostigmata: Eriophyoidea) which are highly host plant specific. They have been described from an enormous range of annual and perennial plants from grasses to giant forest trees. It is highly likely that there are huge numbers of undescribed eriophyoid species in the subtropical and tropical regions which harbor an extraordinary wealth of plant diversity. The global total of eriophyoid species is estimated to be at least 250,000 but it could be much higher. However, the continuing destruction and degradation of natural habitat, especially tropical forests, and climate change, together pose extreme, on-going threats to the eriophyoid mites because of their vulnerability to co-extinction with their host plants. It has been reported that one third of all the Earth’s plant species are now at risk of extinction. Together with enormous numbers of other invertebrate species, it is highly likely that many thousands of eriophyoid species are disappearing in the current mass extinction event. Population decline and co-extinction, especially of the invertebrates, are greatly accelerating total biodiversity losses. The termination of habitat destruction and degradation; establishment of large, representative protected areas; restoration of degraded areas; and rapid reduction of fossil fuel use, are urgent tasks. However, the long term conservation of biodiversity can only be achieved through comprehensive social, economic and political reforms across the world that prioritize environmental protection, peaceful coexistence, social justice and the sustainable use of resources.",

These modifications lead to new interpretation of some of the apomorphic attributes used to characterize the family Zerconidae and superfamily Zerconoidea. The caudodorsal displacement of a pair of opisthogastric setae, JV5, so as to appear to be captured by the opisthonotal shield in deutonymphs and adults, is seen to be a unique characteristic of Zerconoidea. The caudal coalescence of the opisthonotal and opisthogastric shields, and the anterior displacement of setae J5 to a nearly transverse alignment with setae Z4 well ahead of the caudal body margin, characterize Zerconidae.",

The midgut consists of the ventriculus, three cranial and two caudal caeca. The pharynx which is surrounded by specialised structures for food ingestion, encloses the pharyngeal sucker and opens at the top of the gnathosoma. These structures serve to form a partial vacuum, by means of which plant cell components flow into the ventriculus without permanent sucking process. Passing through the esophagus the food reaches the ventriculus and on to the caeca, where intracellular digestion starts. The midgut epithelial cells show different functions. The ventricular and cranial caecal cells are in stage of synthesis. In the caudal caeca some cells enter the stage of resorption and storage, leave the epithelium and become free cells of the midgut lumen (= phagocytes) . After passing through the midgut in direction of the hindgut sphincter they change into excretory cells. The phagocytes take over specialised functions in digestion, whereas at the same time they serve as a system of distribution for storage and nutritive products and replace the missing hemolymph system.",

However, neither of them seems to be restricted to either of these two continents according to sparse records in the literature. The aim here was to explore the respective ecological repartitions of these two species in France and to compare them with data from the USA. We thus analyzed hematophagous mesostigmatid mites collected in France in natura, in orchards agroecosystems, in pet bird and fowl farms and compared DNA sequences from some North American and French mites in both species. It is remarkable that O. sylviarum has been recurrently encountered in bird nests from France and yet been absent from French layer farms, whereas it is a serious pest in layer farms in the USA. On the other hand, O. sylviarum has been isolated from ornamental bird farms in France (canary, pheasant). This suggests either a strong impact of different farming practices between continents or a colonization in process in Europe. It remains to be explored whether the opposite applies to D. gallinae in the USA. Lastly, mites belonging to the special lineage D. gallinae L1 have been isolated from North American pigeons providing mt and nDNA sequences very close to French L1 isolates. This confirms the specific status of this cryptic entity.",

Twelve of the most common plant species were sampled in each fragment. Twenty six phytoseiid species were recorded during the surveys. Stryphnodendron adstringens was the host plant that had the highest number of species (eight species). Amblyseius neochiapensis Lofego, Moraes and McMurtry, 2000 and Neoseiulus tunus (De Leon), 1967 were the most common phytoseiid species. These species occurred on 24 and 20 host species, respectively. Approximately 76 % of the phytoseiids found belonged to the subfamily Amblyseiinae Muma, 1961. Almost 27 % of phytoseiid species recorded were associated with only one plant species. In addition, approximately two thirds of species found in this study also occur in the Atlantic Forest. The comparison of our results from the central areas with previous surveys in peripheral areas of the Cerrado showed that only 12 phytoseiid species were common to both areas.",

Some pests have been reported in soursop, sugar apple and atemoya, the main annonas grown in Brazil. However, few mites are mentioned as pests of this plant family. This study aimed to identify mite species associated with the Annonaceae in northeastern Brazil and in the state of Para. A survey was conducted, collecting samples of Annona muricata L.

Punctoribates punctum (Koch, 1839), however, was found in high densities only at dump sites. Detrended correspondence analyses and hierarchical cluster analyses show that oribatid mites of dump habitats grouped together with those of reclaimed and meadow sites, indicating high faunal similarity and low richness, whereas the forest inhabiting oribatid community was much more diverse.

It includes the only species outside Brachypylina known to exhibit strong sexual dimorphism and courtship behavior, including nuptial feeding, and it has phylogenetic importance as a possible close outgroup of the diverse mixonomatan taxon Ptyctima. Herein, we describe all instars of the first member of the genus known outside of Eurasia: Collohmannia johnstoni n. sp. from forest litter in the mountains of northern West Virginia, USA. Males are distinguishable by the apparatus on genu IV used to hold the nuptial fluid: a hypertrophied seta with flattened, asymmetrical diamond shape and an absence of small cuticular tubercles. We also redescribe the genus Collohmannia using characters of both adults and juveniles, and give a new diagnosis of Collohmanniidae; noted for the first time is an extensive association of setae with dermal glands. Field samples suggest that C. johnstoni is highly aggregated, with a mean density of 100 per m2. Sample data are consistent with a 1:1 sex ratio and with the continual presence of all instars in the population, probably even during winter. Females are ovoviviparous, retaining eggs in their oviducts until the development of the larva, and larvae were found within females on all sampling dates. The prelarva (within eggs removed from females) is moderately regressed, retaining distinct leg remnants. Based on laboratory observations and gut contents of field-collected specimens, all active instars appear to feed directly on decomposing leaves of deciduous trees. Insemination was not directly observed, but courtship is generally similar to that previously described for C. gigantea. Morphological and molecular data concerning relationships between Collohmanniidae and Ptyctima are summarized but the issue remains unresolved. Ptyctima Oudemans, 1906 is considered equivalent to Euptyctima Grandjean, 1967.",

As a result, the subgenus Paraplonobia (Anaplonobia) is treated as a synonym of Aplonobia and the subgenus Parapolonobia (Brachynychus) is moved to Aplonobia. A new species of Aplonobia, namely Aplonobia aria sp. nov., is also described and illustrated based on females and a deutonymph collected from Haloxylon ammodendron (Amaranthaceae) in Southern Iran (Kerman Province). Aplonobia tabukensis (Kamran and Alatawi, 2016) is also recorded for the first time from Iran. Paraplonobia (Anaplonobia) ambrosiae (Tuttle, Baker and Abbatiello, 1976) [preoccupied by Aplonobia ambrosiae (Tuttle and Baker, 1968)] is renamed Aplonobia neoambrosiae nom. nov.",

    "abstract": "The resistance status in Hyalomma ticks collected from animal farms in three different regions of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (UAE) was estimated using adult immersion tests with various concentrations of cypermethrin (50ppm, 100 ppm, 200 ppm, 400ppm and 800 ppm). Regression graphs of tick mortality plotted against cypermethrin concentrations were utilized to determine lethal concentrations (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and LC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;). The data generated on different life history variables (mortality, egg mass weight, reproductive index, and percent inhibition of oviposition) were used to assess the resistance status. Results revealed level III cypermethrin resistance in Hyalomma anatolicum of the Al Hamam region (Al Ain) and level II resistance in the Malaqet region (Al Ain), whereas level I resistance was observed in the other studied locations, except Sweihan (Al Ain) where the tick population was fully susceptible. The LC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; value of susceptible (Sweihan) H. anatolicum was 244.87ppm and the discriminating dose (DC) was calculated to be 489.74ppm. The present study is the first report of cypermethrin resistance in ticks of the United Arab Emirates and highlights the need to further monitor resistance evolution during the implementation of tick control programs.",

    "abstract": "Water mites (Acariformes: Hydrachnidia) are one of the planet's most diverse and abundant groups of aquatic arthropods. With more than 7,500 described species, water mites have been documented in nearly every known freshwater environment. In lotic systems, water mites are commonly found in fast-flowing, riffle-run stream habitats, where one square meter of substrate can contain as many as 5,000 individual mites representing more than 50 species, 30 genera, and all 8 superfamilies. Despite their widespread distribution, relative diversity, and abundance, water mites have been widely neglected in freshwater biomonitoring efforts. However, several studies across the globe have found that water mites can be used as successful bioindicators of water quality conditions. Thus, the following study provides one of the first detailed examinations of lotic water mites and their bioindicator potential in North America. We sampled water mites from sites along 'attaining' (unpolluted) and agriculturally 'impaired' (polluted) riffle-run stream habitats and compared their assemblages to other physicochemical and benthic macroinvertebrate metrics used to quantify water quality in Pennsylvania. In total, we collected 9,139 individual water mites representing 5 superfamilies, 9 families, and 14 genera from both attaining (n = 13) and impaired (n = 13) streams. Similar to other global studies, we found significant differences between the water mite assemblages of attaining and impaired streams, with attaining streams having greater richness and diversity of water mites. Our data shows that several mite taxa are associated with biological and physicochemical conditions of water quality, where some known sensitive taxa are increasingly dominant in attaining streams and less dominant in impaired streams. Conversely, some pollution-tolerant taxa dominance increases in impaired streams while sensitive taxa abundance declines. These findings illustrate that water mites vary in their sensitivity to pollution and are suitable bioindicator species whose inclusion in biomonitoring assessments will increase assessment accuracy.",

We use South Africa’s interception records to highlight particular challenges related to mites detected on agricultural plants and fresh produce. These challenges include interception of damaged or immature specimens, lack of local and global taxonomic specialists, uncertainties in understudied taxa, lack of availability or access to reference material, and difficulties with international collaborations. As an example, we present a particularly notable case of a Brevipalpus interception which took sixteen years to positively identify. This mite was intercepted 54 times (2007-2023) on European kiwifruit imported to South Africa. The first interceptions were from Italy in 2007, then in 2010 from Greece, and in 2015 from France. Despite repeated interceptions, various challenges hampered our ability to identify the species, until in 2023 it was eventually identified as Brevipalpus garmani Baker. We discuss the implications of this and other interceptions for biosecurity in agricultural trade.",

Data on many additional species as potential predators has been published but research is still limited. This manuscript aims to present the results of relatively recent research about each phytoseiid species studied/commercialized to control whiteflies and thrips. The phytoseiid mite species are divided into three groups: predators that prey on whiteflies and thrips with a preference for phytophagous mites, those commercially produced for managing whiteflies and thrips, and those needing further research to clarify their potential. Available information about the efficacy and limitations of each species is provided and future perspectives for their use are proposed.",

Adjacent unpunctured cells show coagulated protoplasts and, as further damage, degenerative processes in the chloroplast structures. Thus, the feeding injury of Tetranychus is not limited to punctured ceils, but ceils of ail mesophyll layers are affected. Possible mechanisms are discussed.",

The juvenile stages of Carinozetes show a centrodorsal plate framed by plicate integument, typical for selenoribatid immatures. The cerotegument of both, adults and juveniles, retains air to the body surface when flooded, enabling the animals to breathe underwater. The morphological comparison with other members of Selenoribatidae indicates the closest relation to the genus Schusteria. A review of the literature showed that Schuster, 1963, instead of Grandjean, 1966, must be quoted as author of the family Selenoribatidae. Further the present classification of the genus Schusteria is partly based on misinterpreted information and therefore questionable. A thorough revision will be needed to solve this problem and to assess the real biodiversity of this group.",

The results interestingly showed more than 12755-fold resistance to abamectin in the ISR population of T. urticae compared with the susceptible GUS2 population. The synergistic effects of Triphenyl Phosphate (TPP), Piperonyl Butoxide (PBO) and Diethyl Maleate (DEM) were carried out to determine the involvement of esterase, mixed functional oxidase (MFO) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in resistance mechanisms, respectively. Due to very high levels of resistance in the ISR population, it was not possible to calculate LC50 value nor to accurately assess the effects of synergists on this population. When alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha-NA) was used as a substrate, the difference in esterase activity between the ISR and GUS2 populations was statistically significant, but low. Kinetic studies also indicated that the alpha-NA hydrolyzing esterases in the ISR population were different from those of the GUS2 population. Activity of GST in the ISR population was 2-fold more than that in the GUS2 population, and Km and Vmax values of the ISR population to a 1-choloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) substrate were 1.44 and 1.21 times lower and higher than those of the susceptible counterpart, respectively. The amount of heme content in the ISR population was 1.26 times more than that in the GUS2 population. Finally, comparing the nucleotide sequences of one of the transmembrane regions of the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl1) from the two studied populations showed no substitutions in the deduced amino acid sequence of this region in the ISR population.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to clarify some bio-ecological aspects of phytoseiid and tetranychid mites in Syrian citrus orchard conditions. The main objective was to obtain preliminary data on diversity, population dynamics, and overwintering phenology of mites considered in a pesticide-free citrus orchard located in Latakia province. Mites were collected on citrus leaves, in Phyto traps attached to citrus twigs, and on wild plants within and around the orchard from mid-summer 2013 to early summer 2014. Panonychus citri was the main tetranychid species collected on citrus leaves, but in very low densities. Mobile stages of this phytophagous were absent during winter. Eight phytoseiid species were found on citrus leaves during all sampling dates, and their general mean density was four times higher compared to that of P. citri. Euseius stipulatus, Euseius scutalis and Amblyseius andersoni were the dominant species on citrus leaves and seemed to have different population dynamics, different overwintering sites and phenology in winter, apparently due to differences in climatic requirements (i.e. temperature and photophase). Some phytoseiid species were rarely observed on citrus leaves, but were collected in high number in Phyto traps. Others seemed to emigrate from wild plants to overwinter on citrus twigs. Several hypotheses were formulated to explain the results obtained.",

Life table studies were performed to evaluate the nutritional value of ten different artificial diets as an alternative food source for rearing of Neoseiulus californicus McGregor. All experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions, at 25 +/- 1°C, 60 +/- 5% RH and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h. Most enriched diets reduced the total developmental time of the predator compared to the basic artificial diet (AD1). All enriched artificial diets (except AD10 (diet enriched with multivitamin syrup) and AD5 (diet enriched with serum albumin protein)) increased the total fecundity of N. californicus compared with AD1, and the highest fecundity was observed on the diet supplemented with Ephestia kuehniella Zeller eggs (AD2). The highest intrinsic rate of increase (r) values were observed on the diets enriched with E. kuehniella eggs (AD2), Artemia franciscana Kellogg cysts (AD3) and maize pollen (AD6), whereas the diet enriched with serum albumin protein (AD5) had the lowest value of this parameter. In conclusion, the diets supplemented with arthropod components, as well as with bull sperm or maize pollen all enhanced survival, development and reproduction of N. californicus, and consequently its population growth parameters.",

    "abstract": "A study has been made of the water-relations of free-living soil mites (Oribatidae) and especially of a common litter species, Belba geniculosa Oudms. 2. There is no significant difference in evaporation in either still or moving dry air. 3· When exposed to a range of different temperatures (10°C-70°C) in either dry air or in a constant saturation deficit of 9.2 mm Hg, the waterproofing cover of the adults has a marked critical temperature of about 45°C; in juveniles the corresponding temperature is about 40°C. 4· The normal behaviour of covering their soft unsclerotized integument with their cast skins and debris is not associated with the water-relations of the juveniles. This habit may be associated with (a) protection from predators and (b) protection of the waxy epicutile from abrasion. 5· The rate of evaporation of dead mites in dry air is greater than that of living mites. 6. Evaporation in dry air was increased when the integument was abraded. These mites also showed a greater increase in weight in saturated air than did untreated controls. 7· The rate of water-loss of abraded mites depends on (a) the shape but not necessarily the size of the abrasives (soft powders were least effective and hard ’gritty’ dusts most efficient) and (b) the frequency of the treatment. 8. A soft powder acted equally well as either an abrasive or as an adsorptive agent. 9· Living abraded mites slowly recovered their impermeability in saturated air, but this process was not entirely successful. 1o. Cold or hot chloroform treatment resulted in a marked increase in evaporation; the longer the treatment the greater the water-loss. The outer cover is thus a wax. II. Carbon dioxide has no effect on evaporation with living mites in dry or saturated air, nor is water-loss increased when they are pre-treated with the gas and then killed. B. geniculosa has no spiracular closing mechanism. 12. B. geniculosa has a well-developed respira tory system consisting of three pairs of tracheae. Comments are given on the observations of other workers. 13. Water-loss probably occurs mainly through the oral, anal and genital apertures. Losses by excretion are negligable. 14. Comments are given on the adaptation of certain species of oribatid mites to different environments on the basis of (a) the critical temperature of their waterproofing cover and (b) their type of respiratory system.",

    "abstract": "The digestive system of Archegozetes longisetosus comprises the following components: the preoral cavity in front of the mouth and the digestive tract, which is composed of: 1) a cuticle lined foregut starting with the mouth and continuing with the pharynx and esophagus; 2) a midgut with ventriculus, one pair of preventricular glands, one pair of caeca, a colon, an intercolon, and a postcolon; 3) a cuticle lined hindgut composed of the anal atrium and terminating with the anus. A crop or ingluvies, i.e. a widened posterior portion of the esophagus, is not present. All regions of the digestive tract are provided with muscles that are all of the cross striated type. The pharynx is crescent shape in cross section and is activated by dilator and depressor muscles. In addition there are ventral muscles. The cuticle of the pharynx is specialized in a way that likely has functional implications. The ventral wall of the pharynx is fixed to the ventral wall of the infracapitulum in a peculiar way. A functional model of the pharynx is suggested. The esophagus is a slender tube that passes through the synganglion. It is capable of expansion by means of longitudinal folds in its wall. The esophagus is predominantly provided with ring muscles. However, within the same muscle cell are also myofibrils which run in longitudinal direction. The esophagus projects into the ventriculus with a pronounced esophageal valve. The peculiar termination of the esophageal valve intima is described. The ventriculus is composed of one type of epithelial cell that is mainly characterized by its distinct brush border and concentric inclusion bodies (spherites = type A granules). The ventriculus frequently contains a food bolus that is surrounded by an indistinct layer of secretion forming a premature peritrophic membrane. The preventricular glands are represented by two pouches formed by cells similar to those of the ventriculus, but are densely filled with very dense spherites. These glands approach the lateral parts of the synganglion, which form peculiar lamellated bodies (specialized neurons) that are likely photosensitive. The spherites in the ventriculus and caeca are usually less electron dense. The caeca distinctly show three types (or phases) of epithelial cells: 1) an ER cell, which is very richly provided with rough endoplasmic reticulum; 2) a digestive (= resorptive) cell showing pinocytotic activity and containing numerous vacuoles, and 3) a spherite cell, which contains many spherites. The caeca never contained food and their main functions are likely the secretion of digestive enzymes (ER cells) and resorption (digestive cells). The spherite cells may be end stages of a cell cycle starting with resorption and ending with extrusion of that part of the cell in which spherites had accumulated. It may be that parts of the spherite cells are discarded from the epithelium, as may also be suspected from the ventriculus cells and the cells of the preventricular glands. The colon is rather inconspicuous in contrast to the postcolon, which is mainly characterized by long microvilli. The main function of the postcolon seems to be compaction of the faecal pellet and completion of the peritrophic membrane. Material contributing to this membrane also appears to be added in a short transition zone between the colon and postcolon, called the intercolon. This region is provided with rather conspicuous muscles, suggesting a sphincter function. The region is capable of being distended during the passage of the food due to its peculiar epithelium, which shows deep crypts. Finally, the anal atrium is again provided with a cuticular lining that shows specific differentiations from proximal to distal. At the beginning of the anal atrium, the cuticle seems to function as an elastic cushion that helps to keep the postcolon closed, unless contraction of the postcolon pushes the faecal pellet out. However, there are also very thick sphincter muscles in this region. Since the epithelium of the anal atrium does not show any indicative peculiarities, it seems unlikely that further processing of the faecal pellet occurs in this region. The food bolus or faecal pellet, respectively, always shows some bacteria, fungi, and algae cells, which seem to be undigested and hence may pass through the digestive tract as intact cells. The haemocoel contains peculiar large cells, which are considered to represent a storage tissue and hence are termed fat body cells, as in other mites. These cells are connected to the midgut by small finger like processes that presumably form gap junctions with the midgut epithelial cells. The fat body cells show various supplies of different inclusions and organelles, probably related to the physiological state and/or their location in the mite s body.",

These approaches have been recently and successfully applied to assess some taxonomic questions within the mite family Phytoseiidae. However, many protocols for DNA extraction of such small specimens require crushing the entire sample, precluding deposition of the carcass as a museum voucher. This study aimed to determine the efficiency of a modified Qiagen DNeasy tissue kit extraction method to both extract enough DNA for performing PCR and DNA sequencing, and recover intact the adult female specimens for identification. Two types of biological material were studied for two species: 100 % alcohol preserved females and females mounted in lactic acid for four hours. All specimens were retrieved after DNA extraction and were mounted on slides. All the structures used for species identification were visible with a phase microscope. DNA was successfully extracted from all the specimens considered and fragments of CytB mtDNA of 426 bp were amplified and corresponded to those of the two species considered. The Qiagen DNeasy tissue kit extraction protocol thus permits to retrieve, prepare and identify mites for which DNA has been successfully extracted, whatever the material considered: alcohol preserved or lactic acid treated mites. This result is of major interest for future taxonomic studies of the family Phytoseiidae, as it will allow the assignment of morphological and molecular attributes to a same specimen.",

It aims to identify potential biocontrol agents amongst mites present in poultry farms, with a focus on one feather mite pest Megninia ginglymura. A secondary goal is to provide an operational identification tool to help the development of biological control in poultry farms. Sampling was conducted from August 2013 to August 2014, with 43 sampling events, in three different laying hen management systems. We used traps, laying hen feathers, and abandoned wild bird nests to collect the mites. A total of 38,862 mites belonging to 23 families and 39 species were found, including 17 species exclusively found in traps, six in wild bird nests, and one in feathers. The most abundant and frequent ectoparasitic species was M. ginglymura (76.3%; observed in all management systems). Amongst other mites, Tydeidae showed the highest richness with five species (Brachytydeus argentinensis (Baker, 1970), Brachytydeus australensis (Baker, 1970), Brachytydeus obnoxia (Kuznetzov and Zapletina, 1972), Brachytydeus oregonensis (Baker, 1970), and Brachytydeus tuttlei (Baker, 1965)), followed by Cheyletidae with four species (Chelacheles bipanus Summers and Price, 1970, Cheyletus eruditus (Schrank, 1781), Cheyletus malaccensis (Oudemans, 1903), and Cheletomimus (Hemicheyletia) wellsi (Baker, 1949)).

Each pesticide was applied three times with an interval of three weeks between two consecutive applications. Two phytophagous mites were observed in all treatments: Tetranychus urticae and olyphagotarsonemus latus. However, the number of predatory mite species (in particular Phytoseiidae) was different according to the pesticide applied and the lowest number observed was in the fenbutatin oxide treatment. This acaricide caused high mortality of T. urticae, decreased the abundance of P. latus, and negatively affected Phytoseiidae. Acetamiprid and deltamethrin induced the resurgences of T. urticae (3.5-fold and 1.5-fold for the former and the latter respectively). The abundance of P. latus was not affected by acetamiprid but by deltamethrin. The results clarified also that these insecticides seemed harmless to Phytoseiidae [i.e. Phytoseiulus persimilis, Phytoseius finitimus and Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) recki]. Data obtained here are interesting for integrated management programs of the major eggplant phytophagous mites, although the generalization of these results requires some caution and additional experiments are needed.",

    "abstract": "Molecular markers are increasingly used for species identification and new taxa description. However, rules to determine frontiers between populations and species are not clear depending on taxa considered. For mites, few studies deal with molecular diagnoses, making rules for associated decision difficult. The present study focuses on a species of the predatory mite family Phytoseiidae (Phytoseius finitimus), considered for biological control of mites and small insect pests in fruit orchards and vineyards in the Mediterranean basin. This paper aims to elucidate the causes of great molecular variations and questions the occurrence of cryptic species. Molecular (12S rRNA, CytB mtDNA, ITSS) and morphological analyses were performed on four populations collected in Corsica and Italy in crops (vine and kiwi) and in an uncultivated environment (Viburnum lantana). Different methods for identifying species have been used (tree approaches, distances and ABGD algorithms). A reference database of distances within and between Phytoseiidae species has been elaborated to inform the present question and to assist with further diagnosis within Acari. Mitochondrial DNA analyses show that specimens from V. lantana were well separated from the three other populations with high genetic distances, suggesting the existence of a cryptic species. Molecular ITSS analyses coupled with morphological features show however that the four populations seem to belong to the same species. The great mitochondrial polymorphism is discussed in regards to: (i) genetic distances reported for Phytoseiidae species and (ii) potential biological differences between populations (cultivated versus uncultivated areas). This study clearly emphasizes the necessity of integrative taxonomy approaches for diagnosis decisions. Furthermore, based on the polymorphism herein detected, maximal intraspecific distances are proposed (9, 23 and 2.8 % for 12S rRNA, CytB mtDNA and ITSS) for diagnosis decisions within Phytoseiidae. Further statistical analyses are however clearly required to determine statistical error for general and reliable decision making.",

    "abstract": "The mesovoid shallow substratum (MSS) is a unique habitat that shelters and serves as a microrefuge for epigean, endogean and hypogean invertebrate species. Understanding the MSS community′s spatio-temporal structure and species diversity patterns in relation to the environmental parameters plays a crucial role in conservation. In this study we investigated: i) the diversity and community structure of oribatid mites from edaphic habitat, superficial MSS (i.e., the upper layer of MSS) and deep MSS (i.e., lower layer of MSS) in an alpine region of Southern Carpathians, Romania, and ii) the relationships between the oribatid mite communities and the environmental variables, such as temperature and humidity. The composition and the structure of oribatid communities differed along the three habitats indicating possible habitat specialization. The structure of the oribatid community was influenced by temperature and humidity. The rich and mixed oribatid communities in the MSS and the oribatid communities' response to surface and subsurface environmental variables suggest that the MSS may offer a micro-refuge for edaphic species when the conditions in the surface habitats become too harsh. Thus, we suggest that MSS should be prioritized for conservation because it may be the key component in maintaining biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "The mite family Phytoseiidae contains predatory species used in biological control. However, among the 2,521 valid species, only a few are presently considered for pest management. The study focuses on a species, frequently observed in agrosystems, but whose biology is almost totally unknown: Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) recki. The objectives were to assess its distribution and to determine under laboratory conditions: (i) the development of three populations fed on three tomato pests (Tetranychus urticae, T. evansi, Aculops lycopersici), (ii) the dispersion along the tomato stem, and (iii) the dispersion from mint to infested tomato leaf discs. Based on its distribution, this species seems to be adapted to Mediterranean climate, and is preferentially found on Boraginaceae, Solanaceae, Asteraceae and Lamiaceae. Results show that T. (A.) recki is a generalist predator, with good performance regarding the number of prey consumed. Differences were observed between the populations considered; one population out of the three tested shows even a higher mean consumption of T. urticae than that recorded for Neoseiulus californicus and N. cucumeris. It is attracted by food source and is able to walk along the tomato stem. These results are encouraging enough to consider T. (A.) recki as a good natural enemy candidate for biological control (especially based on biodiversity conservation). Further experiments should be developed to test the predatory ability of this species at larger scale (entire tomato plants and tomato fields or greenhouses).",

    "abstract": "Alternative food sources could sustain predator populations by influencing their performances including predation, development, and reproduction in periods of shortage or scarcity of prey under laboratory or fields conditions. The aim of this study was to explore suitability of cattail pollen (Typha orientalis) as an alternative food source for different stages of Amblyseius herbicolus (Chant) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) on their predation capacity against the eggs of whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), and the developmental and reproductive responses of the predators to different diet switching regimes under laboratory conditions (T1: nymphs and early adults fed pollen; T2: nymphs fed pollen but early adults fed whitefly eggs; T3: nymphs fed whitefly eggs but early adults fed pollen; T4: nymphs and early adults fed whitefly eggs). Results in the diet switching experiment revealed that although A. herbicolus could prey on whitefly eggs in all the treatment groups, the predatory mites obviously differed in their capacity to prey on the target pest whitefly eggs when fed on cattail pollen and whitefly eggs during different developmental stages. A. herbicolus in group T2 revealed the highest average predation rate, being 1.31, 1.17, and 1.49 times those in groups T1, T3, and T4, respectively. Our results indicated that food sources including cattail pollen and whitefly eggs were suitable for A. herbicolus, because it was able to develop from egg to adult females in all the treatment groups. The mixed diets (T2 and T3 groups) revealed positive effects on the developmental and reproductive parameters of A. herbicolus females, leading to higher oviposition rates and shorter developmental durations when compared with those of groups T1 and T4. A. herbicolus in group T2 revealed the highest average oviposition rates (1.32, 1.26, and 1.81 times those in groups T1, T3 and T4, respectively); however, no significant differences were observed between the T1 and T3 groups. All the eggs of A. herbicolus succeeded in reaching adulthood, but the duration of egg to adult developmental time of A. herbicolus was different among the four treatment groups. The longest and shortest developmental times were obtained in groups T4 and T3, respectively. All the results in the present study demonstrated that A. herbicolus adult females can prey on T. vaporariorum eggs, and cattail pollen was suitable as an alternative or additional food source with high nutritional value for this predatory mite to enhance the predation capacity towards whitefly eggs because A. herbicolus can successfully complete its immature development as well as reproduction.",

The location of maximum jerk on the profile of the chelal moveable digit indicates the end of the mastication surface, which in these mites is confirmed to be just before the theoretical cut-off point for a functioning chewing `machine`. All three species should be able to grasp yeasts, spores and mycelial hyphae in the hive. The moveable digit of C. lactis may be designed to enable pollenophagy. The mastication surface is 21.3 μm in C. lactis, 18.8 μm in G. domesticus, and 17.2 μm in T. putrescentiae. The wild-collected C. lactis shows the smallest chelal moveable digit tip velocity ratios (i.e., the lowest relative length of input to output moment arms). Glycyphagus domesticus has the most primitive geometry of its chela. The depth of the moveable digit matches the inferred resistive forces applied by the mite to food at that point. Condylar and moveable digit strengthening by sclerotisation is associated with eating tougher food. Effective chelal gape is 28.7 μm in C. lactis, 25.9 μm in G. domesticus and 24.8 μm in T. putrescentiae. Maximum food fragment size grabbed by the chela is estimated as 7786 μm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in C. lactis, 5348 μm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in G. domesticus and 4703 μm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;in T. putrescentiae.

Ixodes ricinus, une tique telotrope et triphasique, ne se nourrissant sur les oiseaux qu'a l'etat de larves et de nymphes, est de loin l'espece la plus commune.

Les passereaux, et plus particulierement le rouge-gorge (Erithacus rubecula) et le merle (Turdus merula), sont les hotes principaux pour les immatures d'I. ricinus. Les nymphes de Haemaphysalis punctata se rencontrent rarement sur les oiseaux en Suisse. Cinq autres especes d'Ixodides et un Argaside, toutes specifiques aux oiseaux, sont repertoriees: I. lividus, une tique strictement monotrope, sur l'hirondelle de rivage (Riparia riparia) et dans ses nids; I. arboricola sur des oiseaux nidifiant ou se refugiant dans les cavites des arbres; I. frontalis, I. festai et I. caledonicus qui sont recoltees en petit nombre; Argas reflexus principalement sur le pigeon domestique (Columba livia domestica) et dans ses nids. Hyalomma marginatum marginatum et Rhipicephalus simus ont ete importes par des oiseaux migrateurs. Des nymphes d'I. hexagonus ont ete trouvees sur une pie (Pica pica).",

Les termes de tocospermie et de podospermie sont couramment utilises pour decrire les modes de reproduction des gamasides.: chez les especes pratiquant la tocospermie, le mâle utilise l'ouverture genitale de la femelle pour le transfert des spermatozoides. La podospermie intervient chez divers taxa qui presentent un systeme genital et un comportement tres differents.

There is, however, apparently no harassment of the young. lt is suggested that mites in the family Dermanyssidae, especially the species associated with vertebrale nests, are intermediate subsocial.",

    "abstract": "Significant advances in disseminating taxonomic knowledge are pressing the boundaries of traditional techniques and challenging researchers to upgrade their methodology. Detailed herein are three major developments. First, field emission low temperature scanning electron microscopy (FE-LTSEM) is a contemporary tool for imaging mites that retains body turgor, setal position, and captures a snap-shot of the animal in vivo. Examples are given to illustrate the superiority of this method over conventional SEM in mite taxonomy. Second, digital illustration techniques designed to speed up the species-description process are discussed. Line drawings are created by drawing on top of a montaged photograph on a touch sensitive tablet. Necessary equipment/software and a workflow are provided with the intention of proposing new standards for creating line drawings in acarology. Third, trends in cybertaxonomy, which are raising publication standards for all taxonomists, are discussed with the hope that future acarological work will incorporate such trends and increase the accessibility of information both to taxonomists and non-taxonomists worldwide. Cybertaxonomic topics suggested here include embedding hyperlinks and e-references such as images deposited on MorphBank and sequences on GenBank. One can also contribute elements to the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), register new species with ZooBank, and share collection data with the Global Biodiversity Inventory Facility (GBIF). Particularly useful are KML files for viewing distribution records interactively with Google Earth. Finally, it is recommended that Web presence should be expanded by contributing taxon pages to the Tree of Life Web Project, and creating independent webpages on the taxon of interest that can act as the central hub of information for that group.",

Another aromatic compound, 7-hydroxyphthalide, was reported for Astigmata and Oribatida, but is not known from any other source in nature. It was discussed whether this compound was a ‘natural’ part of oil gland secretions (and thus probably of phylogenetic significance) or an artifact. Here, we show that 7-hydroxyphthalide is the result of a post-extraction chemical transformation of gamma-acaridial, and not a natural compound of oil gland secretions. We compared time series of raw extracts from Archegozetes longisetosus stored at -20°C with extracts stored at +23°C and show that storage at room temperature conditions promotes the transformation. However, since this reaction is quantitatively coherent, summing the amounts of both components seems to be a suitable approximation for the quantity of gamma-acaridial in natural secretions, even if 7-hydroxyphthalide is found in the analyses.",

Previous studies have shown that this mechanism negatively affects phytophagous mites and their predators. To better explain the tritrophic relationship of tomatoes, the interactions between population densities of the tomato rust mite, Aculops lycopersici (Massee) (Acari: Eriophyidae), and its predators on the tomato cultivars, namely, Dora, Etna, Grande, H2274, Jana and M1103, and the trichome densities of these cultivars were investigated in both a climatic room and an organic tomato field from 2014-2015. Under both controlled and field conditions, the A. lycopersici population density was significantly higher in the stake tomato cultivars, Jana and Etna, than in other tomato cultivars. When the tomato rust mite’s population density was the highest during mid-August and mid-September in the tomato field, the population density of the predator species, Tydeus kochi Oudemans (Tydeidae), showed a similar population pattern and significant positive correlation with the A. lycopersici density. However, density of this predator mite was significantly lower than that of A. lycopersici over the entire season. Remarkably, the glandular trichome type VI density was significantly higher in the stake cultivars than other cultivars. In contrast, significantly fewer glandular trichomes were found in the indeterminate tomato cultivars, Grande and H2274, which had fewer tomato rust mites and larger tydeid mite predator densities. These results support the hypothesis that trichomes provide excellent shelter for tomato rust mites and are obstacles for its predator mites. However, the population density of the insect predator, Macrolophus sp., was not affected by the trichome density or tomato cultivar, but its population density was not significantly correlated with that of the A. lycopersici population.",

The tomato red spider mite, Tetranychus evansi Baker and Pritchard, is an important pest of Solanaceae in several countries, but it is usually found in low densities in Brazil. It has been hypothesized that this is due to the effect of natural enemies. The objective of this study was to identify phytoseiid mites from Mato Grosso do Sul associated with T. evansi, to identify promising biological control agents for T. evansi in Africa. A survey was conducted in October – November 2002, sampling more than 70 plant species of 30 families, including 16 solanaceous species. The results of this survey provide some additional information to the scant knowledge on the phytoseiids from Mato Grosso do Sul. In total, 471 phytoseiids were collected, belonging to 12 Amblyseiinae and two Phytoseiinae species. The most frequent and abundant species was Euseius citrifolius Denmark and Muma, followed by Euseius concordis (Chant). Also, 3,493 tetranychids were found. Tetranychus evansi was found in Aquidauna on Solanum americanum (Miller), associated with E. citrifolius and Typhlodromalus aripo De Leon; in Corumba, on S. americanum associated with E. concordis and Neoseiulus idaeus Denmark and Muma; and in Dourados, on Solanum lycopersicum (L.), associated with E. citrifolius, Proprioseiopsis mexicanus (Garman) and Proprioseiopsis ovatus (Garman). However, none of the phytoseiids found are considered to be a promising biological control agent of T. evansi, based on both their inconsistent association with the pest and on available information about each species.",

One of these is in the South African genus Aquanothrus (Ameronothridae). We describe adults and juveniles of two new rock-pool species from the USA and propose the sister-genus Paraquanothrus n. gen. to include them. The type-species, Paraquanothrus grahami n. sp., inhabits shallow weathering-depressions (‘pans’) on barren sandstone in the Colorado Plateau, especially southeastern Utah, where it seems to be an opportunistic grazer on microflora and rotifers. Paraquanothrus spooneri n. sp. inhabits rock pools on granite outcrops, is known only from the type-locality in eastern Georgia and appears to ingest mostly plant fragments. Like Aquanothrus, these mites are active only when free water exists. Paraquanothrus shares multiple apomorphic traits with Aquanothrus, for which a new diagnosis is based on corrected information on the type-species, A. montanus, and two undescribed species (one of which is represented in the paratype series). After reviewing historical concepts of Ameronothridae, we propose a new diagnosis (excluding Podacaridae) and propose a new rank and diagnosis for the subfamily Aquanothrinae, which includes Aquanothrus and Paraquanothrus. Molecular studies that have revealed links among Ameronothroidea, Cymbaeremaeoidea and Licneremaeoidea—in ways that question the monophyly of all three superfamilies—are reviewed, and a preliminary evaluation shows morphology to have a modest level of congruence with these results.",

    "abstract": "Eotetranychus frosti and Cenopalpus irani Dosse are pests of apple trees that are widely distributed in apple orchards in Iran. The functional responses and predation rates of Amblyseius swirskii, one of the most commonly utilized phytoseiid mites for biological control, on these two pests were evaluated at 25 ± 1 °C, with 16:8 h L: D, and a relative humidity of 60 ± 10 % on apple leaves. The results of predation rate experiments on the two prey species indicated that the predator consumed significantly more eggs than larvae and protonymphs whereas consumption of deutonymphs were very rare. Likewise, the results of logistic regression analysis showed that A. swirskii exhibited a Type II functional response on all immature stages of E. frosti and C. irani. Handling time (Th) increased as prey size enlarged; the lowest handling times were determined as 0.4858 and 0.3819 h on eggs of E. frosti and C. irani, respectively, whereas the highest were found to be 1.4007 and 1.0190 h on deutonymphs, respectively. Amblyseius swirskii had the higher attack rate coefficient (α) on immature stages of C. irani than E. frosti. Attack rate coefficients (α) varied significantly between life stages of both pests with the highest attack rate obtained on eggs, followed by larvae, protonymphs, and deutonymphs. Results of this study suggest that A. swirskii could be a highly efficient biological control agent of E. frosti and C. irani at least at low prey densities.",

We extended his list by adding information concerning Oribatida, which participate in the life-cycle of tapeworms of the Anoplocephalidae and Mesocestoididae families. We gathered the Oribatida species that were found to be intermediate hosts by Denegri after 1991 and those that were available but not found in his review. This may be due to the difficulty in obtaining certain articles at that time. We gathered data concerning factors that influence the distribution of oribatid mites, development of cysticercoids in their bodies, and factors that limit the Oribatida species as intermediate hosts.",

    "abstract": "The dispersion of insects and mites can be favored by many factors, including the increasing circulation of plant materials. Special attention is needed to the eriophyoid mites, which have a greater potential as introduced species, due to their physical and biological characteristics. Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa) (Eriophyidae, Apple Rust Mite - ARM) is considered an important apple pest in several countries, being recently reported for the first time in Brazil. This study aimed to carry out a survey of the abundance and distribution of ARM in the Southern region of Brazil, in the cultivars Fuji, Gala and Eva, grown in the states of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Santa Catarina (SC) and Paraná (PR). In addition, Moran's I autocorrelation was used as an analytical tool to assess the spatial dependence between the sample points. A total of 94 orchards were sampled in 19 municipalities, distributed in the three evaluated states. Regarding cultivars, there were 40 orchards of Fuji cultivar, 43 of Gala and 11 of Eva. At each one, 20 plants were selected, from which four leaves were collected, totaling 80 leaves/orchard. The screening and identification of the mites occurred at the Laboratório de Acarologia at the Universidade do Vale do Taquari – Univates, and the statistical analysis were made using generalized linear mixed models with subsequent paired analysis, using R-software. A total of 1,647 specimens of ARM were found in 66 orchards located in 17 municipalities, with an average number (mean ± standard deviation) of 24 ± 55 mites/orchard, 44 ± 83 in Fuji, 10 ± 19 in Gala and 17 ± 21 in Eva. The average number of mites differed between cultivars and states, with the lowest number in the cultivar Gala and in Rio Grande do Sul. No spatial autocorrelation was observed between the points, indicating that the dispersion of ARM in Southern Brazil has occurred at random, without a predefined pattern that would indicate a possible hotspot. The presence of this species serves as an alert for the apple production industry, regarding the distribution of a species previously not reported in the region. The recognition of the presence, abundance and distribution of this species will help in the monitoring and future management decisions, as well as the understanding of the distribution pattern.",

Furthermore, we investigated predation rates and their body size at adult emergence. The results showed that N. cucumeris developed from egg to adult in approximately six days. Survival rates of immature predators increased significantly with the given prey density. No significant difference in body size was found between the survived adults fed at different prey density, but the females were always larger than males. To conclude, T. curvipenis can be an excellent alternative food source for the biological control agent N. cucumeris.",

    "abstract": "Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot is an important biocontrol agent for controlling spider mites (Tetranychus spp). Rearing P. persimilis is relatively expensive due to the need to raise spider mites (e.g. Tetranychus urticae Koch), as prey, on live plants. Frozen eggs of T. urticae can be easily stored and used as a potential feed for laboratory rearing of P. persimilis. This study investigated the performance of frozen T. urticae eggs compared with fresh eggs as food for rearing P. persimilis. Under laboratory conditions, the survival, immature development, consumption, and oviposition of P. persimilis given frozen or fresh T. urticae eggs were observed. The influence of the dietary experience of P. persimilis females (i.e. fed on frozen or fresh spider mite eggs) on offspring’s development and consumption was also examined. The survival and development of P. persimilis were not affected by the different diets. However, individuals fed on frozen T. urticae eggs had a reduced oviposition rate and an increased consumption compared with those given fresh eggs. The maternal dietary experience did not affect the development and consumption of P. persimilis. As the nutritional quality of T. urticae eggs is likely reduced during freezing, the frozen eggs of T. urticae may be inadequate compared with fresh eggs in rearing P. persimilis. Nevertheless, frozen eggs have the potential as supplementary food for P. persimilis. Future studies can investigate the performance of frozen T. urticae eggs on the lifespan and lifetime fecundity and in maintaining a population of P. persimilis in the field.",

    "abstract": "Predatory phytoseiid mites as biocontrol agents are increasingly used in pest control programs across the globe, and Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans) is one of them, which is a commercially available agent against various pests of greenhouse crops. This generalist predatory mite can feed on different foods and diets, including small arthropods and pollen. Feeding and reproducing on a pollen diet is a considerable characteristic of this predatory mite that facilitates the cost-effective production of large numbers of this predator so-called mass rearing. Therefore, the effects of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) pollen as an alternative food source on development and reproduction of N. cucumeris were determined over 20 successive generations. In addition, the predation ability of the nymphs and adults of N. cucumeris being switched to natural prey, Tetranychus urticae Koch after 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; generations was evaluated. The shortest and longest developmental time happened in the 1&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 5&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; generations, respectively. The predator in the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; generations had a higher intrinsic rate of increase (r) (0.171 and 0.170 day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively) than other generations, while the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; generation had the lowest value of this parameter. The development and fecundity of N. cucumeris was not significantly different when this predator switched to a diet of T. urticae. The results of this study revealed that rearing of N. cucumeris for 20 generations on saffron pollen did not affect the performance of the predator negatively and this alternative food source can be used for the mass rearing of N. cucumeris.",

    "abstract": "Ixodes ricinus is an important vector of several human and veterinary infectious agents. Its wide geographical distribution and permissive feeding behaviour have prompted earlier studies on its population genetics. Results were, nevertheless, not conclusive. Furthermore, no research has fully focused on the south-western distribution range of I. ricinus, where exchanges between European and North African populations are more likely to occur. The presence of an additional species, Ixodes inopinatus, in the area further confuses the topic, as the two species are hard to differentiate morphologically. The present work describes the testing of microsatellite markers previously described for I. ricinus using Portuguese and Tunisian tick populations of both species. In addition, new microsatellite loci were developed to complement the available marker toolbox. Loci showed different amplification successes across subpopulations, with Tunisian DNA less readily amplified. Altogether, 15 loci were considered suitable for genetic analyses of Portuguese subpopulations, 10 for Tunisian samples, and seven, common to both populations, were considered to be informative at the inter-continental level. A preliminary analysis of both datasets revealed two isolated populations, which can correspond to two different species. Furthermore, Tunisian specimens identified by sequencing of 16S rDNA as having I. ricinus or I. inopinatus sequence profiles all clustered together in one single population using the proposed microsatellites. This confirms that taxonomic decisions based only on 16S rRNA gene sequencing can be misleading. The application of the proposed set of microsatellite markers to a larger sample, representative of the south-western Ixodes’ distribution range, will be crucial to clarify the distribution of both species.",

The longest and shortest handling time (T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) was observed in G0 (1.670 h) and G40 (0.890 h), respectively. The highest value of maximum attack rate (T/T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) was estimated in G40 (26.96 prey/day). The equation of the regression line showed that the relationship between the prey density and the number of eggs laid was significant in G0, G10 and G40, and the number of eggs deposited by N. californicus increased with increasing the density of prey. The relationship between the prey density and ECI (the efficiency of conversion of ingested food) was not significant in tested generations. Our findings show that long-term rearing on thorn apple pollen did not affect the type of functional response and efficiency of N. californicus by confirming this predator is an effective biological control agent against T. urticae.",

Male and female mites raised on T. turkestani had a shorter mean pre-adult duration than those grown on date palm, castor, and hopbush pollen. Pre-adult mortality was found to be greater in either the larval stage or protonymphal stage than other stages. The highest and lowest pre-adult mortality rates were recorded on castor bean pollen (31.87%) and T. turkestani (2.94%), respectively. The total pre-oviposition periods (TPOP) on hopbush and castor bean pollen were significantly longer than those on T. turkestani and date palm pollen. The highest egg production and oviposition period were determined when T. turkestani were provided as diet. Overall, the individuals lived considerably longer when provided with T. turkestani and hopbush pollen than the two other diets. The gross reproductive rate (GRR) and net reproductive rate (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) on T. turkestani were greater than the values attained on other diets. The highest intrinsic (r) and finite rates of increase (λ) were found to be 0.2537 and 1.2888 on T. turkestani, respectively. However, R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, GRR, r, and λ were almost similar between all pollen diets tested. In general, all diets tested in this study were adequate for development and oviposition in E. scutalis, but T. turkestani was the most favorable diet.",

The study aims to investigate morphological and genetic variation among seven populations collected from different locations and plant species (cotton, orange) in Türkiye. The DNA sequences (12S rRNA and Cytb mitochondrial DNA markers) were also compared with those of commercial populations. The average genetic distance among the Turkish populations was quite low (0.7% for 12S rRNA and 0.9% for Cytb mtDNA), ranging from 0 to 2.8% and 0 to 1.5%, respectively. The phylogenetic trees show two distinct groups, separated by genetic distances of 0.9% and 1.3% for the 12S rRNA and the Cytb mtDNA fragments, respectively. The genetic differences were not explained by location or host plant. However, specimens from some populations were exclusively or predominantly included in one of the two clades, and commercialized specimens of A. swirskii only included in one clade, along with specimens collected in orange orchards. Specimens from cotton fields and Solanum nigrum, were found in both clades, but in different proportions. Results show a globally low genetic diversity within A. swirskii for the two DNA fragments. The existence of two clades raises questions about the presence of a clade derived from commercial releases. However, this result may be related to other factors. Morphological analyses demonstrated substantial variability among the populations, except for the population sampled from orange in Adana Kozan. Despite this, the morphological and molecular results are relatively consistent.",

    "abstract": "In a survey of natural enemies of Aculops lycopersici (Tryon, 1917), we collected specimens of Homepronematus anconai (Baker, 1943) in different European countries and redescribed the species based on specimens collected in Belgium. The newly collected specimens were measured and morphologically compared with USA specimens available from museum collections. We also measured collections' specimens previously identified as H. staercki from Hungary, and others, previously identified (but undescribed) as Homeopronematus cf. staercki sp. nov. from Serbia. Quasihomeopronematus n. gen., with its type species Quasihomeopronematus nordestinus n. gen. n. sp., are described based on specimens from Brazil. As the name suggests, this genus is similar to the genus Homepronematus. Single female expansion lines were set-up with H. anconai specimens from Belgium, France, Germany and Hungary, and Q. nordestinus specimens from Brazil. With specimens of these lines, molecular analysis was performed to construct a phylogenetic tree including the results of previous studies with Pronematus ubiquitus (McGregor, 1932) and P. duffelensis De Vis and Ueckermann, 2024. The tree showed differences between origins of H. anconai, with one French line standing out. In a PCA analysis on morphological characters, the same French line separated from all other geographical origins albeit with some overlap. The molecular and morphological differences were assigned to intraspecific variation, and we consider all specimens studied as H. anconai. Homepronematus anconai is morphologically different from Q. nordestinus but the latter separated similarly as that one French line from all other H. anconai lines. We conclude that the CO1-gene is not sufficient to separate genera in the family of the pronematinae. The specimens previously identified as H. staercki or Homeopronematus cf. staercki sp. nov. overlap in the PCA analysis with the specimens of H. anconai. Therefore, we synonymise H. staercki with H. anconai. The results are discussed and additionally both species' distribution, habitat, and feeding habits are presented.",

It often caused heavy damage in fields which had not been cultivated for many years, sometimes following manure applications. Field visits, answers to questionnaires and trapping data were used to follow the phenology of the pest in the soil. Most activity occurred during autumn, the mites becoming inactive as temperatures drop in winter. During spring and summer mites retreat to deeper soil layers, except in irrigated fields. No evidence for diapause was seen, and natural enemies were few and insignificant. Mite-harboring soils were quite variable in their characters. No mites were found in compound bulbs of garlic kept throughout the summer or in manure. When offered natural foods (manure, plant roots, macerated soil animais), R. robini thrived on most. It also withstood immersion in distilled water for five weeks and exposure to 6-8° C, and remained fertile. From these data it is postulated that R. robini is an indigenous soi! mite, an autochthonous species which had become more allochthonous in response to agricultural practices",

To take both sexes and the variable developmental rate among individuals into consideration, the raw data were analyzed based on the age stage, two sex life table. The estimated values of LC5, LC10 and LC15 for N. californicus are found to be 5.834, 9.529 and 13.267 ppm, respectively. The total preoviposition period of N. californicus treated with sublethal concentrations of spiromesifen was not significantly longer than for the control treatment. The minimum total fecundity was recorded for the LC15 concentration of spiromesifen (19.37 eggs/female) that was significantly different to the LC5 and control treatments. Compared with the control, the intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), net reproductive rate (R0) and gross reproduction rates (GRR) of mites treated by the dose of the LC15 concentration, decreased significantly but the mean generation time (T) was not affected by this sublethal concentration. Our results indicated that increasing concentrations of spiromesifen had significant negative effects on life table parameters of N. californicus.These quantities should not be used in combination with N. californicus in integrated pest management programs in order to obtain optimal of biological control conclusions.",

The other species, Stigmaeopsis continentalis Saito and Lin n. sp., was found in China (Fujian district). Thus four species could be discriminated from the species inhabiting Miscanthus and reed grasses. However, the two new species and S. miscanthi resemble each other very closely, thus they are considered to be sibling species.

The aim of the present study was to assess Phytoseiidae diversity and densities in these orchards both on trees and weeds. The highest Phytoseiidae diversity on citrus and weeds was observed in the organic citrus orchard (eight species on citrus and eight species on weeds). In the conventionally managed orchard, only three and four species of Phytoseiidae were found on weeds and trees, respectively. The same species, Euseius stipulatus, was dominant on citrus in the three orchards, whereas it was observed only on some weeds. The prevalent Phytoseiidae species were different according to the orchards (Typhlodromus [Typhlodromus] phialatus in organic farmed plot, Neoseiulus californicus in integrated managed plot and Phytoseiulus persimilis in the conventional one). Prevalence of such species was due to their high abundance on some plants (i.e. Phaseolus vulgaris for P. persimilis). No clear impact of weed management on citrus Phytoseiidae fauna was observed. However, pesticide use seems to affect densities and diversity of Phytoseiidae. Even if no clear correlation between E. stipulatus and Tetranychus sp. was observed, it seems that E. stipulatus could feed on Tetranychus sp. but cannot quickly and efficiently control high densities of these pests.",

Cydnodromus californicus was also found but only in some orchards and nearly always in association with one of three dominant species. This observation confirms the faunal modification initiated more than ten years ago. Amblyseius andersoni was recorded in high densities in nearly all the regions considered. Typhlodromus (T.) pyri was also widespread, even if particularly frequent and abundant in the Rhône-Alpes region. Kampimodromus aberrans was localised in some regions; it was especially frequent and abundant in the Mediterranean region. An identification key containing the eleven reported species is provided. Taylor's law was applied in order to characterize the Phytoseiidae distribution in apple orchards. The distribution is clearly aggregative, whatever the region and the Phytoseiidae species considered.

    "abstract": "The predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is produced commercially for biological control of insects and mites on crop plants around the world. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a diet of natural prey, Tetranychus turkestani Ugarov and Nikolskii (Acari: Tetranychidae), date palm pollen, or bee-collected pollen on A. swirskii development, reproduction, and life table parameters. Completely randomized, no-choice experiments were conducted in replicated experimental units, i.e., 3 x 3 cm plastic sheets inside Petri dishes. A life table analysis was also conducted. Results indicated that diet type did not affect A. swirskii preimaginal survival; it ranged from 97-100% on T. turkestani and both pollen diets. However, total development time was significantly shorter for A. swirskii females fed date palm pollen than T. turkestani or bee pollen. Adult females fed T. turkestani lived longer, had longer oviposition periods, and produced more eggs. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (0.396 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was higher for A. swirskii fed date palm pollen than T. turkestani or bee pollen. The finite rate of increase, net reproductive rate, and gross reproductive rate did not differ significantly between A. swirskii fed date palm pollen or T. turkestani. Mean generation time (7.56 d) and population doubling time (1.043 d) were shorter for A. swirskii fed date palm pollen than T. turkestani or bee pollen. This study suggests that the T. turkestani diet or date palm pollen diet is suitable for A. swirskii. Date palm pollen has great potential as a cost effective diet to mass produce A. swirskii in the absence of natural prey. Future research could determine whether long-term rearing on date palm pollen reduces the ability of A. swirskii to locate, capture, and consume T. turkestani or other Tetranychus species on crop plants.",

The observed morphological continuity between fossil and modern pediculochelid mites indicates the evolutionary stability of this lineage spanning at least 99 million years. These findings not only advance our knowledge of the evolutionary history of Pediculochelidae but also offer a broader perspective on the persistence of morphological traits over extensive geological timescales. We also address the phenomenon of phoresy within Paralycus and explore its potential implications for dispersal mechanisms.

This study evaluated the effects of four fungicides on the predatory potential of a predatory mite Neoseiulus longispinosus against Tetranychus urticae. Prey consumption began at the protonymph stage of the predatory mite and was significantly reduced under fungicidal treatments compared to the control. The lowest consumption of T. urticae eggs and protonymphs occurred in the metalaxyl + mancozeb treatment, while the highest was observed in the thiophanate methyl treatment. The predation parameters, including cumulative consumption (C₀), stable predation rate (ψ), and finite predation rate (ω), were significantly reduced in mancozeb-based treatments but remained unaffected in thiophanate methyl. Simulated projections showed that thiophanate methyl-treated predators maintained the highest prey consumption over 90 days on the log scale (log 6.47 for eggs and log 6.07 for protonymphs of T. urticae). The varying impacts of fungicides on N. longispinosus highlight the need to select fungicides compatible with predatory mites to sustain effective pest management in agroecosystems.",

Here we investigated the development, survival, reproduction and life table parameters of T. phaselus on G. max and P. vulgaris and how these traits vary between the two plants. We showed that the developmental period from egg to adult was significantly shorter on G. max than on P. vulgaris for both males and females. Tetranychus phaselus had significantly higher egg hatchability and egg-to-adult survival on G. max. Tetranychus phaselus had different lifetime reproductive pattern on the two host plants and produced significantly more daily and lifetime number of eggs on G. max than on P. vulgaris. We showed that females fed on G. max had significantly higher intrinsic rate of increase (r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) and net reproductive rate (Ro) and shorter generation time (T) and doubling time (Dt). These results suggest that G. max (soybean) is a more favorable host plant for T. phaselus, and the increasing planting area of these beans particularly soybeans may facilitate the occurrence of T. phaselus.",

Development time was longer for female (15.4 days at 25 °C and 9.8 days at 30 °C) compared to male (14.5 days at 25 °C and 9.3 days at 30 °C). The intrinsic growth rate (rm) was 0.125 at 25 °C and 0.159 at 30 °C. These findings underscore the considerable adaptability of E. orientalis and P. citri to diverse temperature variations, emphasizing the importance of this study for integrated mite management in Tunisian citrus cultivation, therefore to understand their population dynamics, ecological interactions, and optimal intervention periods.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the factors influencing larval prey consumption in the facultative-feeding predatory mite Amblydromalus limonicus (Garman and McGregor) (Acari: Mesostigmata), an important species in biological control systems. While feeding is not essential for larval development into protonymphs, understanding the factors that modulate larval feeding behaviour is crucial for optimising pest management strategies. We examined the effects of three factors on larval feeding behaviour of A. limonicus: prey availability (5 versus 20 prey eggs), conspecific presence without direct physical contact (yes or no), and maternal dietary history (abundant or restricted). Under controlled laboratory conditions, we observed that female larvae consumed significantly more prey than males, and increased prey availability resulted in higher consumption rates. However, conspecific presence did not affect feeding behaviour. Although maternal diet influenced egg size, with larger eggs produced by well-fed mothers, it did not directly affect larval prey consumption. These findings highlight the role of sex and prey availability in shaping larval feeding behaviour of A. limonicus. Future research should investigate these dynamics under field conditions and across different prey species to enhance our understanding of predator-prey interactions and improve biological control applications.",

The studies about the predator-prey dynamics of native phytoseiids are rare. Thus, this investigation aimed to determine the predatory efficiency of both species against eggs of Tetranychus urticae. Under constant conditions (27 °C, 65% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 h L/ D), six egg prey densities (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64) were separately offered to each predator to record its predation rates for 24h. According to the results, T. khosrovensis, and E. amissibilis represented a type II functional response. In T. khosrovensis, the attack rate coefficient (α) was 0.0213 h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the handling time (T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) was 2.8013 h. These values in E. amissibilis were recorded as 0.0204 h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 2.3018 h, respectively. The maximum attack rate (T/T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) on eggs of T. urticae was estimated to be 8.57 h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for T. khosrovensis, and 9.98 h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for E. amissibilis. Therefore, both native predators illustrated a highly efficient biological control against eggs of T. urticae, although field studies are needed to show their ability as promising predators on mulberry trees in the future.",

    "abstract": "Phytoseiidae are predatory mites with some species widely used in biological control programs. Currently, 2,985 species have been described, among them, 260 species have already been recorded in Brazil. Several species of phytoseiid mites that inhabiting native vegetation remnants in Brazil have the potential to act as predators of crop pests contributing to natural biological control. Here, we accessed the diversity of phytoseiid mites on plants in three Cerrado vegetation formations. Twenty-one natural vegetation remnants distributed in the grassland, forest and savannah vegetation formations in the municipalities at Barro Alto and Niquelândia, Goiás State, Brazil, were sampled. All sampled remnants were close to areas exploited for nickel mining. Species richness of mites was estimated by first-order Jackknife method in order to compare phytoseiid mite communities in vegetation formations. The similarity in communities among different vegetation formations was evaluated using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and ANOSIM. A total of 279 phytoseiid mites distributed in 19 species and 11 genera were sampled. The richness of mite species estimated for the grassland formation was lower than the one of the forest and savannah remnants. However, the composition of the phytoseiid species did not vary among vegetation formations. The most abundant phytoseiid species sampled were Euseius sibelius (De Leon) (67 specimens), Euseius citrifolius Denmark and Muma (47) and Transeius bellottii (Moraes and Mesa) (29). The present work demonstrated that remnants of natural vegetation of the Cerrado can serve as important reservoirs for the conservation of Phytoseiidae biodiversity, even under the impacts caused by nickel mining activities, and potentially provide ecosystem services for sustainable agricultural yields.",

Previous studies have shown that the two entities have evolved very recently from a common ancestor, are morphologically distinguishable in the adult stage, and are reproductively incompatible. Because of the recent divergence of the two morphotypes, gene sequences usually analyzed for a phylogenetic species definition are insufficiently informative to assign them to separate species. Microsatellite loci are predominantly non-coding sequences, selectively neutral, and usually have higher mutation rates than mitochondrial and coding nuclear gene sequences. An estimate of their divergence time based on the analysis of 8 previously developed microsatellite loci confirmed the recent speciation hypothesis, dating the radiation to approx. 230-460 years ago. A strong bottleneck signature suggests the establishment of these populations after a 1000-fold reduction in the population size of origin.",

The study documents new geographical distribution for Neotetranychus lek from India; Schizotetranychus mansoni from South India; Oligonychus tylus, O. grypus O. sacchari and Tetranychus bambusae from Kerala. New host plants were recorded for T. gloveri (21), T. truncatus (4), T. urticae (2), T. puschelii (2), T. udaipurensis (3), T. neocalidonychus (2), T. fijiensis (2), T. ludeni (1), T. bambusae (1), O. tylus (6), O. biharensis (4), E. orientalis (1), S. baltazari (2) and S. mansoni (1). A comprehensive key for the identification of different species of spider mites collected during the study is provided. The study concluded that the spider mite fauna in Kerala is diverse and that the exotic mite species, T. truncatus and T. gloveri, which were recently recorded from Kerala, have established themselves in the state by widening their host range, within a short period.",

This study expanded on that by testing DEET concentrations (control, 2.5ml, 3.5ml, 5ml of 50% DEET) for extracting soil invertebrates. Soil samples were collected monthly over six months from three locations within a 2m diameter area, totaling 72 samples (12 per month). Samples were dissected, and mites from Astigmatina, Oribatida, and Mesostigmata orders were counted, excluding Prostigmata due to their sporadic presence. Results confirm DEET’s superior efficacy over light bulbs, with varying effects across concentrations and mite groups, suggesting DEET’s potential as a selective repellent. Further research could optimize DEET concentrations for specific soil organisms.",

In this study, we examined the population dynamics of spider mites and phytoseiid mites in a Japanese pear greenhouse equipped with predator-release devices during 2019–2021. The presence of commercialized N. californicus on pear leaves before noticeable spider mite occurrence was confirmed during each of the survey years. Our results demonstrated that the spider mite density remained low for the first two years, but a notable spider mite outbreak occurred in the final year, presumably because a fungicide highly toxic to N. californicus was used before the release of the commercialized N. californicus individuals. Results also demonstrated that Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes (Acari: Phytoseiidae), the second dominant phytoseiid mite species, increased its relative proportion in the summer and possibly affected spider mite occurrence through intraguild predation. These results suggest that avoiding harmful pesticides and elucidating interactions among phytoseiid mite species are crucially important for more effective utilization of commercialized N. californicus for spider mite control.",

The experiment was conducted with four treatments: control (0 mites/leaf), T&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; (25 mites/leaf), T&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (50 mites/leaf), and T&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; (100 mites/leaf), over eight days. Statistical analysis of the data indicated that the mite density on the leaves did not significantly influence stomatal density or the average levels of Chl a and Chl t. No difference was observed in the number of stomata between treatments. However, a significant difference was observed in the average amount of Chl b at T&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;, and a continued increase in leaf perforations was noted as a function of mite density. The results suggest that, although the infestation did not alter all the assessed parameters, the presence of T. urticae impacts Chl b and leaf integrity, thereby affecting the health and productivity of the vine. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring and managing mite populations in vineyards to minimize damage.",

The most effective predator stage was determined by placing egg cards and releasing different larval instars (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;) with a release ratio of 1:20 for T. urticae management.

Among the three larval instars, the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; instars significantly reduced the T. urticae population after eight days, with 75% and 79% population reduction percentages, respectively. Furthermore, less visual damage and webbing density per plant of T. urticae were observed where 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; instar larvae were released. The 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; instar larva was further evaluated with three predator-prey release ratios to manage T. urticae population on C. sativus plants in the greenhouse. The T. urticae population reduction percentages were 66%, 61%, and 24% at the release ratio of 1:30, 1:60, and 1:90, respectively, after 12 days of predator release. Moreover, less visual damage and localized webbing on leaf per plant was observed for the release ratio of 1:30. The outcomes of the present study showed that the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; instar larvae of the indigenous predator, C. carnea, could potentially manage the T. urticae infestation on greenhouse crops.",

On the other hand, a concentration-dependent decrease in adult longevity was recorded in the LC&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; and LC&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; treatments. The oviposition period significantly decreased from 12.68 ± 0.02 days in the control to 7.04 ± 0.02 days in the LC&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; treatment.

Survival curves revealed that the shortest lifespan was associated with the LC&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; treatment (23 days), and reproductive peaks were reached earlier under sublethal concentrations.

    "abstract": "Despite their widespread diversity and abundance, water mites are understudied in many parts of the world. While previous literature has primarily emphasized taxonomy and distribution, several recent studies have found that water mite communities can be used as bioindicators of water quality conditions. Thus, there has been a push to explore strategies to incorporate them into global biomonitoring efforts. If the use of water mites as bioindicators is to become more widespread, it is important that we understand how seasonality influences their abundance in aquatic ecosystems. This study examines how populations of water mites in central Pennsylvania vary throughout the year. We sampled nine different sites every other month between August 2021 and August 2022. In total, we collected 8,471 individual water mites representing 14 genera, 9 families, and 5 superfamilies. Similar to studies conducted in Europe, our results indicate that while water mites can be collected year-round, abundance peaks in the summer between June and August, making this an ideal timeframe to focus collection efforts.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of eriophyoid mites on ferns and conifers is notably lower than on angiosperms. To date, ~40 eriophyoid mite species from 20 genera have been recorded on ferns. Most species belong to the eriophyid subfamilies Phyllocoptinae (45%), Eriophyinae (34%), and Nothopodinae (18%), while only one represents the diptilomiopid subfamily Rhyncaphytoptinae. The greatest diversity occurs on the fern orders Polypodiales and Cyatheales, followed by Equisetales, Gleicheniales, and Schizaeales, whereas no eriophyoid taxa have been described from Marattiales. We describe two new Eriophyidae species from ferns: Cymoptus ptisanis n. sp., collected in South Africa from erinea on the lower surface of frond pinnae of Ptisana salicifolia (Schrad.) Senterre et Rouhan (Marattiales: Marattiaceae), and Nothopoda vietnamensis n. sp., collected in Vietnam from galls on fronds of Nephrolepis cordifolia (L.) C.Presl (Polypodiales: Nephrolepidaceae). Morphological descriptions of the new taxa are supplemented with partial Cox1 (PV698368, PV698369) and 28S (PV711118, PV711119) gene sequences, photographs of host plant symptoms, and a series of images documenting stages of gall formation on Nephrolepis. In this paper we also propose relaxing the generic concept of Cymoptus Keifer 1946 (as Aceria-like eriophyines missing tibial seta l′ I), question the synonymy of the poorly differentiated nothopodine genera Floracarus Keifer 1953 and Nothopoda Keifer 1951, and advocate for future comparative studies on gallogenesis induced by eriophyoids on ferns and angiosperms.",

This expansion has also facilitated the introduction of potentially harmful alien species. This paper reports the presence of the eriophyid mite Cisaberoptus kenyae Keifer (Acari: Eriophyidae) for the first time in Sicily and, therefore in Europe. In the perspective of a potential further expansion of mango also in other European areas as a consequence of the climatic changes, a brief overview of current knowledge on this species is also provided.",

    "abstract": "The taxonomy of the family Phytoseiidae remains problematic, largely due to insufficient original descriptions and the lack of comprehensive redescriptions. In many cases, new phytoseiid species have been described without the provision of sufficient differential diagnosis in relation to previously known taxa. This has led to repeated descriptions of the same species under different names, particularly in neighboring countries. Amblyseius cucurbitae, Rather and A. paraaerialis, Muma were originally described from India based on undetailed illustrations, without clear diagnostic characters. As a result, both species have been described multiple times under different names. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we conclude that eight species, A. amorphalae, Sadanandan and Ramani, A. bhadrakshae, Sadanandan and Ramani, A. coffeae, Sadanandan, A. indirae, Gupta, A. kundurukkae, Anithalatha and Ramani, A. mohanasundarami, Anithalatha and A. velayudhani, Santhosh and Sadanandan, are junior synonyms of A. cucurbitae. Furthermore, A. hainanensis, Wu and A. brachycalyx, Karmakar, Bowmik and Sherpa are also considered junior synonyms of A. paraaerialis. Therefore, we provide detailed redescriptions of A. cucurbitae and A. paraaerialis based on their type specimens to clarify their taxonomic status and facilitate future identification.",

    "abstract": "A new nature reserve called Czarne Doły, established in 2022 in Wielkopolska (Greater Poland), was intended to protect the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis (L)). This fact became an inspiration to initiate long-term monitoring research studies on soil mite communities. The planned studies are aimed to ascertain how the legal protection of this area will affect the biodiversity of acarofauna in the future, that is, whether the European pond turtle can be an umbrella species for soil mites. For the purpose of this research, 85 samples from soil and dead wood were collected in the area of the reserve in 2023 and 2024. The mite groups selected for the studies are species from the following orders: Prostigmata (family Labidostommidae), Oribatida (ptyctimous mites, family Nothridae, family Camisiidae), Mesostigmata (suborders Uropodina and Sejina). In the collected samples, a total of 40 mite species were identified, of which 14 new species were found in the second phase of the study. Among the found species, many common soil species occurring all over the country predominated, with a high percentage of the eurytopic species of Uropodina, such as Oodinychus ovalis (C. L. Koch, 1839), and synanthropic - Oodinychus karawaiewi (Berlese, 1904). It is expected that the percentage the latter species should decrease over time as the area is protected. In addition, specimens of two rare species were also recorded in one of the examined sites, i.e. Dinychus septentrionalis (Trägårdh, 1943) and Labidostomma luteum Kramer, 1889. It is planned to conduct regular observations every five years in order to ascertain the changes in communities of soil mites in this area.",

The phytoseiids (Mesostigmata, Phytoseiidae) from the Canaries have been studied over the past three decades, but the existing publications refer to the three central islands of the archipelago, while the fauna of the eastern and western islands remains unknown. This study presents the results of a survey on indigenous vegetation in Fuerteventura, the easternmost island located near the African coast. Five phytoseiid species were collected and one of them, Neoseiulella extraseta sp. nov., characterized by having an extra setal pair J1 on the dorsum is proposed as new species. The remaining four species are fully re-described, and wherever possible all the motile developmental stages as well as the ontogenetic development of idiosomal and leg setation, pores, and poroids are described. The species richness is analysed from the perspective of the geo-environmental dynamics experienced in Fuerteventura, and some plausible hypotheses are suggested to explain the biogeographic origin of the species found.",

Comparison of the feather mite faunas known on different selected species of the tribe Scolopacini (dowitchers, snipes and woodcocks) shows that bird species of this tribe demonstrate a gradual loss of the primary feather mite fauna specific to the family Scolopacidae (Charadriiformes) and even its substitution with mites transferred from another host order.",

The life cycle of O. yothersi showed differences in the duration of some developmental stages. The stages from egg to teleiochrysalis were significantly shorter on peach. Regarding the reproductive parameters, the preoviposition time was shorter when the mite was reared on peach leaves, while no differences were observed on apple and rose leaves. Maximum values of oviposition, postoviposition, fecundity, and longevity periods were observed on peach leaves, followed by apple, and rose leaves. According to our results, peach leaves seem to provide better conditions for the development of O. yothersi, potentially posing a threat not only to this crop but also to apple cultivation, as these crops often grow in association in the Andean region from Ecuador.",

In controlled rearing experiments, all instars of Leptus trimaculatus (Hermann, 1804) (Erythraeidae: Leptinae), being formerly known as adult only, were reared. A description of the larva as well as data on parasitism, times of development, phenology, nutrition and habitat requirements of all instars are given. L. trimaculatus is an univoltine erythraeid, reproducing during late spring and hibernating in the adult instar. Unlike other Erythraeidae, the larva parasitizes a broad spectrum of arthropod hosts. Both postlarval active instars prey on immobile or slow moving arthropods. All stages of L. trimaculatus show a preference for humid and temperate habitat-conditions, although they may not be restricted to them.

Plants surrounding two vineyards in these three regions were sampled twice a year. Mites were also extracted from soil and aerial traps placed in the vine plots.

Among the 90 plants species sampled, 21 are reported for the first time as host plant for phytoseiid mies. Three associations of host plant-phyoseiid mite species, often reported in literature, were also observed in this study: Inula viscosa-Typhloseiella isotricha, Typhlodomus (Anthoseius) intercalaris-Quercus pubescens, Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) sapiens-Quercus ilex and Quercus suber. Some phytoseiid mite species were recorded in only one region. Only three phytoseiid mite species were present in the uncultivated areas in all three regions: Kampimodromus aberrans, Typhlodromus phialatus and Typhlodromus pyri. These three species were also the only ones present in the aerial traps in the three regions. Therefore, they seem to have a wide distribution in France. These species, particularly K. aberrans and T. (T.) pyri, are the main phytoseiid mite species in French vineyards. One can therefore ask what is the influence of crop and and of cultural practices on the diversity of phytoseiid mites fouond in the surrooundings.",

    "abstract": "In a recent publication, ZHANG, Fu & WANG (2004) reported a karyotype analysis of two species of brachypyline oribatid mites: Brasilobates spinosus Fujita (Protoribatidae, or Haplozetidae) and Galumna longiporosa Choi (Galumnidae). 3 After studying what they referred to as oocytes, the authors concluded that both species have an XX:XO sex determining mechanism and that the karyotype is 2n=16 for male B. spinosus and 2n=19 for male G. longiporosa. Chromosomes were reported to be monocentric. However, we believe that some of the applied methods and interpretations are questionable, and the authors overlooked important past studies of oribatid mite karyology. Our purpose is to briefly discuss these issues and to highlight the rather dramatic contradictions with published literature. As an example, we present the first data on the karyotype of Archegozetes longisetosus Aoki (Trhypochthoniidae), and discuss why the conclusions of ZHANG et al. cannot represent the general state of cytogenetics in Oribatida.",

It reports on the feeding habit of 69 species-level taxa (39 newly observed; 30 from the literature) belonging to 36 genera and 16 families of Mesostigmata. Feeding observations were made in small laboratory arenas where mites were offered sympatric arthropods or cultured rhabditid nematodes, springtails and mites. Most species tested readily fed on nematodes and springtails and many attacked the nymphs of mesostigmatic mites. A few fed on the fluids of crushed or decomposing arthropods. As indicated by studies on other continents, our results support the hypothesis that many soil Mesostigmata, including both ground and canopy species, are generalist predators that feed on nematodes and a variety of arthropod prey. These findings also suggest that some Mesostigmata are opportunistic scavengers.",

While queens may be covered by more than 200 deutonymphs over their entire bodies, the numbers of deutonymphs substantially differed between alates, dealates and queens, which are the preferred carriers, and the males and workers, which are usually not the phoretic hosts of these deutonymphs. It is assumed that the large amount of deutonymphs on queens may be a consequence of special conditions during nest foundings of monogyne colonies. Presence of deutonymphs apparently stimulates the cleaning behavior in workers; however deutonymphs are not removed during this procedure. This may be a consequence of chemical components produced in the opisthonotal glands of astigmatid mites that allow the mite to repel cleaning workers and remain strongly adhered to its carrier. It is unknown whether or not these mites affect the vitality of fire ant colonies.",

The two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae is one of the main pests affecting rose (Rosa spp.) cultures in Brazil. Chemical methods are used for its control, causing a significant environmental impact. Thus, this work aimed to study the predatory potential of N. californicus as an agent of biological control of T. urticae on roses. For the predatory capacity studies, 40 T. urticae mites /arenas of Jack bean leaves (Canavalia ensiformis) were offered to one specimen of each life stage of <I>N</I>. californicus. The adult females were the most efficient in preying upon immature stages, followed by nymphs. For the functional and numerical responses, adult females of N. californicus were confined to arenas made of Jack-bean leaves, and offered immature stages of T. urticae at the following densities: 0.14, 0.28, 0.70, 1.4, 2.8, 4.2, 4.9, 6.3, 7.7, 9.8, 14.1, 17.6 and 28.2 / cm2. The number of killed prey (functional response) and the number of eggs laid by the predator (numerical response) were assessed every 24 hours for 8 days. A type II functional response was inferred through a regression analysis. N. californicus preyed on a maximum of 60 pecimens of T. urticae per adult female per day.",

    "abstract": "In this study the oribatid mite communities of conventional and organic vineyards in theValencian Community (Spain) were compared. The soil samples were collected in El Poble Nou de Benitatxell in autumn 2014 and spring 2015 from four sites, treated as replicates, each including a conventional vineyard, an organic vineyard, and a control (natural habitat, i.e. in plots 1-3 an abandoned vineyard, in plot 4 an area never used in agriculture). Two parallel samples were collected in each vineyard from a zone between vine rows, driven by a tractor (Tr), a zone between vines (Vi), the border of the vineyard (Bo) and from a control, making a total of 112 samples. In total 3,225 oribatid mites were obtained represented by 59 species. No differences were found in density of Oribatida between the conventional, organic vineyards and the control, but the species diversity was higher in the control than in the vineyards. In the vineyards the density and species number of the oribatid mites were highest between vines (the average from all vineyards and both seasons was 4,400 individuals per 1 m2, 15 species), followed by the border of the vineyards (2,800 individuals per 1 m2, 14 species) and were lowest between vine rows (400 individuals per 1 m2, 6 species). The species diversity of Oribatida was higher in autumn than in spring, while the density followed this pattern only in the vineyards, but not in the control. In the vineyards Oribatula excavata dominated (D = 25), followed by Minunthozetes quadriareatus and Passalozetes africanus (D = 18 and 14, respectively), while in the control these species were not abundant. In the control the most abundant species was Oppiella subpectinata (D = 28), followed by Eremulus flagellifer (D = 20). Podoribates longipes and Steganacarus boulfekhari are reported for the first time in Spain. To conclude, the oribatid mites did not benefit from the organic cultivation of the vineyards, probably because they are tolerant to herbicides used in the conventional systems but sensitive to mechanical cultivation of soil, which was even more intense in organic vineyards than in the conventional ones.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pollen of 13 plant species commonly found in Manaus region (Brazilian Amazonia) on the oviposition of Amblyseius aerialis and Iphiseiodes zuluagai, phytoseiid species abundant in citrus orchards in that region. The study was conducted under laboratory conditions, using mostly pollen grains recently collected in the field. For comparison, a commercially available pollen (ECOPolen) and pollen obtained from two bee species were also included in the study. For about 65% of the evaluated pollen types, the average oviposition was low (less than 0.4 egg/female/day). These differed from other pollen types by the speculate wall (sunflower) or high hygroscopic property (Agave sp., Amaryllis sp., Citrus sinensis, Helianthus annuus and Turnera ulmifolia), or were collected by Apis mellifera. Highest oviposition levels of A. aerialis were obtained on pollen of Typha dominguensis, Elaeis guineensis, Cocos nucifera and the commercial pollen (1.9, 1.5, 0.9 and 0.9 eggs/female/day, respectively). For I. zuluagai, highest levels of oviposition were obtained on E. guineensis, C. nucifera, T. dominguensis, and Elaeis oleifera (1.6, 1.5, 1.2 and 0.9 egg/female/day, respectively). These results suggest that C. nucifera, E. guineensis and E. oleifera, found in the vicinity of citrus orchards in Manaus region, may play a role in maintaining predatory mite populations in such orchards. Complementary studies are needed to investigate the feasibility of maintaining those plants near orchards to increase the abundance of the predators.",

These granules apparently coalesce Into microfibers which are arranged in a parabolic pattern. The fibers are then consolidated to form laminations as the cuticle matures. An ecdysial space is present between the pharate adult and the tritonymphal cuticle. An epicuticle is present which consists of several layers. The fine structure of the epicuticle reveals a cement layer, a lipid layer with wax blooms, a cuticulin layer, and a proteinaceous layer below. The cement layer appears to cover the wax blooms and probably is a distinct factor in the water balance mechanism of this mite",

This injury, when extensive, results in malformation of the maturing structure. Other organisms or conditions interfering with the normal maturation of tissue may account for deformations similar to those produced by E. vitis feeding. The possibility of economie losses due to E. vitis is normally minimized by the propensity for the mites to feed primarily on the scales of overwintering buds and by the reduction of their numbers on new shoot growth by factors such as predation and possibly climate. E. vitis injury in commercial Tokay vineyards which were studied did not cause a commercial loss, However the effect on vine in the shoots sufficient to cause boron toxicity symptoms had little or no adverse effect on mite populations. 2) Mites were able to cause typical injury to shoots with high as weil as low boron content. 3) The symptoms produced by the mites were distinct from those produced by boron excess. The classic symptoms of boron excess syndrome were identified by Dr. J. A. Cook, and the syndrome of mite injury was identified by the authors.",

The life stages consisted of an egg, larva, protonymph, deutonymph, adult male and female. It was not uncommon for the mites to pass through all the immature stages in 5 days. The approximate duration of each stage was 8 to 24 hours as an egg, the same as a larva, 24 hours as a protonymph and 48 to 72 hours as a deutonymph. The adult female was able to oviposit at the age of 21 days, inclusive of the immature stages. The eggs were laid at intervals of 1 to 8 days. Parthenogenesis and bisexual reproduction occurred: The regular diet of Macrocheles rodriguezi in the laboratory consisted of living acarid mites. Cannibalism was observed between an adult female and her first instar nymph in the presence of numerous acarids. There appears to be no courtship display prior to mating. During mating the male and female may remain embraced for as long as 17 minutes, but usually mating is completed in approximately 6 minutes. Senescence is accompanied by a bloated appearance and the mite becomes lethargic.",

The use of plant-derived repellents against this pest could be an alternative control method as part of Integrated Pest Management strategies. In this review, the different types of repellents and the testing methods used to explore them in arthropods are synthesized. State-of-the-art knowledge on the repellent properties of natural plant-derived substances against D. gallinae is established. Studies reporting repellent properties exerted by plant-derived substances against D. gallinae are reviewed, and the level of discrimination between the different types of properties achieved by the experimental designs implemented is examined. Factors that may modulate repellent activity in arthropods are reviewed, and the available evidence for D. gallinae is highlighted. A framework is proposed for the rational use of knowledge from experiments for the implementation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM). In addition, to optimize the implementation of IPM strategies for D. gallinae, the current knowledge related to the risk of emergence of resistance to natural repellents is documented. This phenomenon has not been explored in D. gallinae to date, but resistance to several repellent substances has been reported in insects, with some cross-resistance between repellents and neurotoxic insecticides.",

The adoption of biological control methods and curative methods (plant-based insecticides) is an essential practice for pest management in agroecological systems. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical properties, toxicity, and ovicidal activity of essential oils (EOs) from Lippia sidoides, Croton rhamnifolioides, Croton grewioides, Citrus sinensis, Citrus limon, Citrus aurantiifolia and Piper divaricatum for the control of T. urticae and determine the selectivity of these EOs regarding the predator mite Neoseiulus californicus. The chemical analysis (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) of the EOs enabled the identification of 98 compounds. The major constituents were carvacrol (L. sidoides), β-caryophyllene (C. rhamnifolioides), (E)-anethole (C. grewioides), limonene (Citrus spp.), safrole and methyl eugenol (P. divaricatum). All oils exhibited satisfactory toxicity to the eggs and females of T. urticae and were even more toxic than the commercial product Azamax. The L. sidoides oil exhibited greater toxicity compared to the other oils, with LC50 values of 0.05 and 0.09 µL mL-1 for females and eggs, respectively. All oils tested were selective to N. californicus, with RS values ranging from 3.61 to 23.28 for C. aurantiifolia and C. grewioides, respectively. Therefore, the use of products based on the EOs studied in combination with the natural enemy N. californicus is a viable option in agroecological systems for the management of T. urticae.",

Phylogenetic and dating analyses show the presence of three monophyletic lineages within the H. fluviatilis-complex, with the H. turcicus-clade as the earliest branching lineage. The diversification and speciation processes mainly started from the Oligocene-Miocene around 24 million years ago and continued during the Miocene.

We found evidence of multiple colonization of Corsica in different phases of its geological history, resulting in the presence of two endemic lineages, H. corsicus and H. cyrnusensis sp. nov., the latter species is described by an integrative approach in this study.",

    "abstract": "Mites occupy a wide range of ecological niches and are good models to investigate correlations of morphological structures and ecology in arthropods. Here we compare tarsal claw shape of three terrestrial oribatid mite species with different ecological backgrounds. By means of geometric morphometrics we describe shape, size and development of the tarsal claw of the monodactyl mite species Lamellovertex caelatus and Platynothrus peltifer, and the tridactyl Melanozetes meridianus. After analysis of juvenile and adult mites we can distinguish the euryoecious P. peltifer and the alpine M. meridianus with similar claw curvatures from the saxicolous L. caelatus with considerably less curved claws. The claw height of P. peltifer, on the other hand, is remarkably higher than in the other two species. Despite these differences, no correlation between claw characteristics and environmental factors can be inferred. During the development of the mites, claw curvature and shape remain constant from protonymph to adult and claw size increases direct proportionally with body growth in all studied species. Neither the monodactyl nor the tridactyl species show any specific changes in claw characteristics.",

The stylostome of this trombiculid species in these two different host species was identically organized and is composed of the proximal eosinophilic cone, to which the larval chelicerae are cemented; the main hyaline-like, immunologically-inert unstained portion; and the distal azurophil region. The total length of the stylostome may reach 200 µm. Imaging by TEM shows that the stylostome is built of a homogeneous substance, which does not have any structurally different layers. The axial canal, around 10 µm in width, opens freely to the subjacent tissue and may contain different host cells and their debris. The skin inflammatory response to the parasites’ impact in these two host species appears to be different in its character and intensity. In P. ognevi, the epidermis is dissolved at the site of the larval penetration but peripherally, it undergoes hyperplasia. The inflammatory reaction is of moderate intensity with the presence of neutrophil leucocytes, macrophages and mast cells in the focus accompanied by dilation of the peripheral capillaries and edema. Conversely, in M. davidii, a strong reaction is observed with a total dissolution of the epidermis at the location of larval feeding, intensive hemorrhages in the dermis, and formation of a scab on the skin surface, formed of fused, necrotic inflammatory and epidermal cells that together contribute to the strong lesion in the skin. In this type of skin reaction, neutrophil leucocytes are predominant but mast cells are mostly lacking. Owing to this finding, it may be assumed that M. davidii from Kazakhstan has evolutionary evolved a strong resistance to feeding of this trombiculid species and may serve as a transitional agent of infecting pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ticks are blood-feeding ectoparasites which transmit pathogens ranging from protozoa, viruses, bacteria to both humans and animals. For decades, acaricides have significantly contributed to reduction of the tick-population, and tick-borne diseases. However, there is an increase in acaricide tick-resistance globally. Since the 1960s, diagnosis of acaricide-resistant ticks relies mainly on two methods: the Larval Packet Test (LPT) and the Adult Immersion Test (AIT). The limitations of these methods are for instance, (1) each assay is restricted to one stage of tick-development. (2) the assays require special additional reagents and materials therefore unaffordable in resource constrained regions. Objective: To address these gaps, we have developed an alternative novel method named: the Bottle-Acaricide-Impregnation-Test (BAIT) and assessed its efficacy. Methodology: We examined the potential of BAIT to detect acaricide resistant and/or tolerant ticks. Three acaricides: DuoDip (Organophosphate), Norotraz (Amidine) and SyperTix (Synthetic pyrethroid) were independently tested against unfed and fed Rhipicephalus appendiculatus colony ticks at different stages of development (larvae, nymphs and adults). The test acaricides were applied separately at single (1x) and double (2x) working concentration and the efficacy of the BAIT assessed in comparison with the AIT, LPT and Nymph Immersion Test (NIT). Results: Our data reveals that: (1) the BAIT assay is as efficient as the AIT, LPT, and NIT, and (2) the efficiency of the tests does not vary with acaricide class or concentration (3). Conclusion: The BAIT method is universal to all tick-developmental stages, simpler, cheaper and could be applicable both under field and laboratory conditions.",

Scutoribates, formerly in Carabodidae, is a junior synonym of Eremaeozetes Berlese (n. syn.) in the Eremaeozetidae. Embolacarus is reassigned to Collohmanniidae. Tectocymba and Gradidorsum are tentatively retained in Cymbaeremaeidae and Eremaeidae, respectively. Strieremaeus and Plategeocranus are removed from their current families, Eremaeidae and Carabodidae respectively, but cannot be reassigned based only on original descriptions.",

    "abstract": "l) This paper deals with the possibility of representing in general form the life cycle of the Hydrachnellae and of defining clearly the individual ontogenetic steps. In this sense the nomenclature of HENIING (1882) is compared with that of GRANDJEAN (1932). 2) Henking’s nomenclature should be given up. It is presently understood only by the few specialists in the Hydrachnellae, and even among these specialists there have repeatedly been misunderstandings with the definition of some of HENKING s stages. 3) To achieve a general understanding in the field of Acarology, the nomenclature of Grandjean should be adopted and the six developmental steps following the egg in Hydrachnellae should be designated prelarva - larva - protonymph - deutonymph - tritonymph - adult. 4) According to Grnadjean the individual developmental steps (also called ’stases’ or ’stages’) are characterised by unique morphology and delimited in time by a moult at the beginning and the end. With the Hydrachnellae, there arises a problem from the fact that two moults are missing; the protonymph does not emerge from the cuticle of the larva and the tritonymph does not emerge from the cuticle of the deutonymph. Because of this, the time of transition to proto- and tritonymph is taken as being when the larval and deutonymphal cuticles respectively become non-functional and can be removed without hindering the further development. This point in time can only be precisely determined by preparations of a whole series of animais, and is therefore impossible if one only has a little living material, as this should be used in biological studies for rearing to the adult stage. In these cases the life cycle of the Hydrachnellae can only be characterised according to phases of activity and inactivity. The inactive larval phase is included with the protonymph stase as ’postlarval resting stage I’ and the inactive deutonymph phase with the tritonymph stase as ’postlarval resting stage II’. Starting with the egg, there is then the series: prelarva - larva (active phase) - postlarval resting stage I - deutonymph (active phase) - postlarval resting stage II - adult.",

In the subfamily Tetranychinae, however, Tenuipalpoidini are more primitive than E$trytetranychini and the most advanced evolutional stage is represented by Tetranychini.

We assume a division of the Parasitiformes into three main groups: 1. Antennophorina Berlese, 1892 s. lat., 2. Margotrichina Karg et Schorlemmer, 2008, 3. Gamasina Leach, 1815. Here, we analyse these groups step by step. Cladograms that are based on autapomorphies and synapomorphies visualize relationships between subgroups. 1. The Antennophorina are divided into the Sejides Berlese and the Trigynaspida Camin et Gorirossi including the Celaenopsoidea Berlese, Cercomegistoidea Trägårdh Fedrizzioidea Trägårdh, Megisthanoidea Berlese and Trigynaspidoidea Camin et Gorirossi. Two new species belong to the Cercomegistoidea and the Fedrizzioidea. A new genus of the Fedrizziidae is erected: Holostethus n. gen. 2. Larval-systematic investigations and comparisons of the chaetotaxy of extremities lead to two novel findings. First, the group of the Microgyniina belongs to the Margotrichina. Second, the Thinozerconina have to be separated from the Uropodina group. Hence, the Margotrichina now comprise the four subgroups Microgyniina, Thinozerconina, Uropodina and Ixodides. 3. The state of art regarding the Gamasina is briefly outlined. We describe two new species of Gamasiphoides - family Gamasiphidae and generate a key for new and known species of the genus.",

The latter species exhibits modified scale-like setae. The geckobians, protected ventrally by such scale-like setae, are widely distributed: in and around the Mediterranean Basin, these species were described notably on Phyllodactylidae (Tarentola). Most of them belong to the group I defined by Jack (1964) considering the leg chaetotaxy. The distribution of geckobians allied to the new species is discussed and correlated to the most recent knowledge on the genus Tarentola. The host being primarily African, the possible African origin and the dispersion by wall geckoes of these geckobians is discussed. As far as we know, such scaly species are not present in South or North America. The acquisition of this adaptation should therefore date from the early Cenozoic. The authors conclude that new investigations are necessary to examine this hypothesis on the Mediterranean gekkotans. Three identification keys are provided, a general key for the genera, one improved key for the identification of the groups of species of the geckobians, and the third for the described species with scale like setae.",

In field experiments we evaluated the effect of the release of Kampimodromus aberrans (Oudemans) and Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten strains showing field resistance to organophosphates and dithiocarbamates. Predatory mites were released in two vineyards infested by spider mites despite the occurrence of Amblyseius andersoni (Chant) and/or Phytoseius finitimus Ribaga. Single or mixed releases were planned. Spider mite populations were not effectively controlled by local predatory mites while successful control was achieved by released species. The effects of releases were higher in the second experimental year. In most cases A. andersoni densities were reduced by T. pyri and K. aberrans releases. Ph. finitimus suffered less than A. andersoni from intraguild predation. Among released species, the effect of the presence of a competitor was higher on T. pyri than on K. aberrans. Results suggest that the outcome of intraguild predation is prey-mediated. The equilibrium level between K. aberrans and T. pyri may depend on which spider mite species is the shared prey. The implications in management of spider mites on grapevines are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Several species of the predatory mite family Phytoseiidae are of major economic importance for biological pest control in crops, including grapevines. Plant diversification in agrosystems is reported to enhance useful biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. Thus, agroforestry, which consists in co-planting trees and crops, is assumed to be a possible way to ensure regulation of pest outbreaks by phytoseiid mites. This paper investigates the effect of trees (Pinus pinea and Sorbus domestica) within vineyards on Phytoseiidae communities. Five experimental plots were considered, two where vines were co-planted with P. pinea and S. domestica, and three monoculture plots: vines, P. pinea and S. domestica. Sampling was carried out on vines and trees in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2010 and 2012. A higher Phytoseiidae diversity was observed in agroforestry plots than in monoculture plots. Kampimodromus aberrans (replacing <I>T.</I> [ <I>T.</I>] exhilaratus) seemed to colonize these plots 15 years after its plantation, especially when vines were co-planted with P. pinea. Factors affecting these faunistical changes are discussed. Effects on Phytoseiidae densities differed depending on grape cultivartree species associations. Factors affecting these interactions are discussed; plant diversity does not simply lead to a higher density and diversity of natural enemies.",

It is the most damaging acarine pest of tea crops in the sub-Himalayan Terai region of India which is mostly controlled chemically in the conventionally managed tea plantations of the region. Objectives of the present study were to i) investigate the tolerance level of O. coffeae collected from bio-organically managed plantations (BMP) (with no synthetic acaricide application) and conventionally managed plantations (CMP) (with periodic application of synthetic acaricide) to the acaricides, ’ethion’ and ’fenpropathrin’, ii) Quantify the detoxifying enzymes, general esterases (GE) of phase I and glutathione S-transferases (GST) of phase II, in O. coffeae as these are deemed important in acquiring pesticide tolerance, iii) Establish the relation of GE and GST activity levels with acaricide tolerance levels in populations of O. coffeae. The study revealed that i) BMP populations of O. coffeae were susceptible to both of the acaricides whereas CMP populations were tolerant. CMP populations of the pest showed low to medium tolerance to the organophosphate acaricide ’ethion’ whereas tolerance to the synthetic pyrethroid, ’fenpropathrin’ was high; ii) Corresponding GE and GST levels were significantly higher in CMP populations compared to that of BMP population. Electrophoretic analysis of GE isozymes of CMP and BMP populations further corroborated the quantitative study; iii) activity of the detoxifying enzymes, GE and GST were positively correlated with the tolerance level of O. coffeae populations indicating involvement of these enzymes in the development of acaricide tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Data on the diversity, distribution, and main hosts of spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) are scarce in the Iberian Peninsula, particularly for Portugal, where only 21 species are recorded on the mainland and in the Azores and Madeira archipelagos. Moreover, the scientific information is mainly available in national publications, and difficult to access for international researchers. In this paper, we review the literature dealing with spider mites in mainland Portugal and the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, compiling and synthesizing the most relevant information on their distribution, hosts and pest potential. Further information was obtained by verifying slides in the acarological collection of the Instituto Nacional de Investigação Agrária e Veterinária (INIAV), the most important national collection, and by verifying mites collected on different plant hosts during the period 2018-2020. In total, we found records for 28 spider mite species in Portugal, comprising nine Bryobiinae and 19 Tetranychinae, and including new national records for Stigmaeopsis nanjingensis and Eotetranychus tiliarium. Additionally, we record a new exotic mite species for the mainland, Eotetranychus lewisi, which was found in two localities in the Algarve District on leaves of Euphorbia pulcherrima. This is the first record for continental Europe of an established population in outdoor conditions of this regulated quarantine pest. We also comment on the presence of seven species not reported by international taxonomic databases but already recorded from Portugal: Aplonobia histricina, Eotetranychus rubiphilus, Schizonobia sycophanta, Tetranychus kanzawai and Tetranycopsis horridus (at a national level), and Oligonychus perseae and Panonychus citri (for the mainland). New host records are given for Bryobia praetiosa, Petrobia (Tetranychina) harti, S. sycophanta, E. coryli, E. rubiphilus, Tetranychus kanzawai, Tetranychus lintearius, Tetranychus ludeni and Tetranychus turkestani.",

    "abstract": "The strawberry spider mite Tetranychus turkestani Ugarov & Nikolskii is an important pest of greenhouse cucumber. Reproductive parameters, life expectancy and life table entropy of this mite on six greenhouse cucumber cultivars (Puia, Hedieh, Milad Jadid, Milad Ghadim, Khasib and Negin) were evaluated. These parameters were estimated by a leaf disc bioassay with six treatments and 40 replications under laboratory conditions (Tempt. 28 +/- 1 °C, RH: 60 +/- 5%, L:D = 16:8 h) in a walk-in growth chamber. The results of this study show that the highest total fecundity of the strawberry spider mite was observed on the Hedieh cultivar (29.784 egg/ female) and the lowest on the Puia cultivar (15.773 egg/ female). The highest gross and net fecundity rates of this pest were seen on the Hedieh cultivar (91.721 and 41.171 egg/female) and the lowest on the Puia cultivar (35.765 and 9.154 egg/female, respectively). The strawberry spider mite had the highest gross and net fertility rates on the Hedieh cultivar (44.913 and 26.720 egg/ female, respectively). Moreover, T. turkestani gross hatching rate on the six cucumber cultivars differed significantly, varying from 0.18 on Negin to 0.48 on Hedieh. The life expectancy of one-day-old adults of the strawberry spider mite was estimated to be 6.140, 7.800, 5.733, 6.551, 6.543 and 6.822 days on the above-mentioned cultivars, respectively. The values of the entropy parameter (<I>H</I>) of the strawberry spider mite on the cultivars were 6.600, 1.177, 8.468, 2.300, 1.249 and 0.247, respectively. These results suggest that Puia, Milad Jadid, Milad Ghadim, Khasib and Negin cultivars may have the highest resistance levels to this mite compared to the Hedieh cultivar. The use of resistant host plants is one of the most important components of an integrated pest management program.",

Their original descriptions are not very detailed, being based on simple drawings and an absence of diagnostic characters that include measurements of dorsal setae. Most likely due to its inadequate description, T. (A.) ghanii was not recognized by acarologists and was therefore repeatedly described as a new species under different names. We examined the holotypes of T. (A.) homalii Gupta and T. (A.) sagaricus Karmakar et al. concluding both species to be junior synonyms of T. (A.) ghanii. Moreover, T. (A.) kuznetsovi (Denmark and Welbourn), described from Tajikistan, is proposed as a new junior synonym of T. (A.) loralaiana based on the examination of their holotypes. Hence, complementary descriptions of T. (A.) ghanii and T. (A.) loralaiana, based on their holotypes, are provided to facilitate species identification and to improve their diagnosis.",

Furthermore, we studied how the different apple tree cultivars affect the diversity and distribution of these predatory mites. Collections were carried out in apple orchards in three different production areas: 1- organic agriculture (Antônio Prado, RS); 2- conventional agriculture (Muitos Capões, RS); 3- regenerative agriculture (São Joaquim, SC). In total, seven orchards were evaluated, in Muitos Capões and São Joaquim, two orchards of the Fuji and Gala, whereas in Antônio Prado, three cultivars (Eva, Fuji and Gala) were considered. In each orchard, 40 plants were evaluated, and from each plant a median branch was randomly chosen from which a leaf was removed from the apical, median and basal thirds. The collected leaves were taken to the laboratory, they were observed and the mites found mounted in Hoyer's medium and identified. A total of 695 phytoseiid specimens were collected. Greater abundance was noted in the apical stratum of plants of the Gala cultivar, demonstrating the effect of cultivar and stratum on phytoseiid richness, abundance and distribution. Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Phytoseiidae) was the main species in areas of conventional and regenerative cultivation, being present in all evaluated orchards, but with low occurrence in areas of organic management. In organic orchards, species of the genus Euseius [Euseius mesembrinus (Dean) and Euseius inouei (Ehara and Moraes)] (Phytoseiidae) were more abundant. The results suggest that producers consider less intensive use of pesticides and herbicides in orchards in order to maintain populations of predatory mites due to their potential for biological control.",

    "abstract": "The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (R. sanguineus) is a worldwide ectoparasite of veterinary and medical concern. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) of the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis are occasionally used as bio-control agents for external parasites such as ticks and flies. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of five different concentrations of the EPNs Heterorhabditis bacteriophora HP88 and Steinernema sp. SII [4000, 2000, 1000, 500, and 250 infective juveniles per milliliter (IJs/ml)] on different developmental stages of R. sanguineus ticks. The EPN application caused mortality in both engorged larvae and newly molted nymphs [H. bacteriophora HP88 (10% - 40%) and Steinernema sp. SII (10% - 18%)]. However, mortality was much higher in both engorged nymphs and newly molted adults (54% - 82% with H. bacteriophora HP88 and 84% - 96% with Steinernema sp. SII). Both EPNs were 100% effective on engorged females 9 days post-exposure. As this life stage was the most susceptible, it was used to calculate the LC (lethal concentration) values in order to determine which EPN was most virulent. The LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and LC&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt; at 5 days post-exposure were 76 and 5421 IJs/ml for H. bacteriophora HP88 and 885 and 5700 IJs/ml for Steinernema sp. SII, respectively. In conclusion, although the efficacy of the two EPN species differed among tick life stages, both nematode species can induce mortality and could be used as an alternative option for the biological control of non-parasitic (off-host) tick stages.",

    "abstract": "Grafting vegetable crops is considered a valuable tool for improving the yield and quality of fruits under various stress conditions. This study aimed to assess the influence of grafting eggplant Solanum melongena (cv. A338) onto Solanum torvum rootstock (cv. STT3) on the incidence of the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae (TSSM). An experimental study was conducted to investigate the defense response elicited, as assessed by measuring the activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), as well as hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and chlorophyll contents in grafted and non-grafted eggplants under different TSSM infestation levels (10, 30 and 50 adults per plant). In addition, the effect of grafting on plant growth and yield of eggplant was evaluated. According to the findings of the present study, grafted plants had a lower density of TSSM than non-grafted plants. The number of eggs, nymphs, and adults on grafted plants was 40.11%, 31.71%, and 27.54%, respectively, lower than on non-grafted plants. With increasing TSSM density, the activities of CAT and SOD were increased at varying degrees. In terms of SOD activity, the grafted plants outperformed both the non-grafted scion and rootstock at all TSSM densities. In addition, the results demonstrated that plants with greater CAT activity were able to maintain a lower H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content and vice versa. The lower negative impacts on photosynthetic pigments demonstrated that grafted plants on S. torvum were more resistant to mite-induced damage to chlorophyll and carotenoids as mite density elevated. The grafted plants were superior in vegetative growth, and the total fruit weight was found to be two times higher than non-grafted plants. The features modified by grafting, such as the increased activities of SOD and CAT, can alleviate the impact of TSSM. Therefore, grafting could constitute a valuable tool when combined with other strategies of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in the two-spotted spider mite control programs.",

Our results showed that the longer the rearing of E. scutalis on cattail pollen before switching to T. turkestani, the most impact it had on the developmental duration of the predatory mite. The female adult longevity was the highest in G0. In the older generations (G20 and G30), adult pre-oviposition period (APOP) was shorter than in younger generations (G10). The adult females of G0 had the longest oviposition days. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) and ﬁnite rate of increase (λ) of E. scutalis were highest in G20. There was no significant difference in the parameters R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, r, λ, and T (mean generation time) before and after thirty generations of rearing on cattail pollen when exposed to T. turkestani. The proportion of male progeny produced by this predator was higher than that of females during both the early and late ages of the oviposition period. The predation rate of E. scutalis was not affected by the time of rearing on cattail pollen before switching to T. turkestani. Euseius scutalis consumed an average of 435.93 T. turkestani over its lifetime before the predator was reared on cattail pollen. This predation rate did not differ significantly after ten and thirty generations passed on a diet of Typha pollen. Overall, the findings of the current study indicated that E. scutalis long-term reared on cattail pollen could be a good candidate as a profitable predator on plants infested with T. turkestani.",

    "abstract": "In 1995-1996, a survey was carried out in eleven viticultural regions of Greece in order to ascertain the species of predatory mites associated with vines. Twenty species of predatory mites (Phytoseiidae) were recorded: Phytoseius finitimus, Neoseiulus californicus, Euseius finlandicus, Typhlodromus hellenicus, Typhlodromus kerkirae, Typhlodromus exhilaratus, Kampimodromus aberrans, Euseius stipulatus, Amblyseius andersoni, Typhlodromus athiasae, Typhlodromus perbibus, Typhlodromus cotoneastri, Neoseiulus marginatus, Neoseiulus barkeri, Typhlodromus involutus, Typhlodromus intercalaris, Typhlodromus commenticius, Paraseiulus talbii, Typhlodromus recki and Phytoseius horridus. P. finitimus is the most dominant species since its population density reached levels of 75-100%, in most regions and varieties. It was followed by five other frequent species: N. californicus, T. exhilaratus, T. hellenicus, T. kerkirae and E. finlandicus. The remaining species were seldom collected. There are no marked differences between regions in the development of populations of P. finitimus. The highest densities occurred at the end of May to mid-June and between mid-August and mid-September. Only populations in the region of Volos peak at the end of November. Apart from a few isolated cases, the phytophagous species Tetranychus urticae, Panonychus ulmi, Brevipalpus lewisi, Colomerus vitis, Calepitrimerus vitis and Tenuipalpus granati did not cause extensive damage in vineyards.",

The size of larvae varied from 0.15 to 5 mm. The relations between the size of larvae and the sampling suggested that the reproduction occurs from spring to summer. The investigated species of water mites chiefly colonize spring astatic waters where no typical coleopterofauna has been determined. This fact suggests that the zone of infection is separated from the zone of parasitism.",

Promptly after anchoring in feeding position, secretions of the larval mite are forced into the host beneath the attachment site, where a subcuticular vesicle, bounded by a delicate gelatinous membrane, appears in the epidermis layer. The vesicle constitutes a local space of thin fluid into which the larva ejects a liquid that rapidly gels and forms a slender resilient blind sac, the stylostome. The vesicle provides a buffer zone for the nascent stylostome, protecting it against vehement defence reaction on the part of the host. The early stylostome undergoes a phase of extreme inflation of the distal thin-walled portion, which is associated with expansion of the primary vesicle. Epidermal ceiis adjoining the primary vesicle undergo lysis and fuse with the vesicle, transforming it into an epidermal abscess, whose ceii juice acts as a pool of nutrient to the larval mite. Initially short, wrinkled and thin-walled, the stylostome increases in size, elongating and remodelling as larval engorgement proceeds. Eventuaily the stylostome breaks the rim of the abscess, which becomes modified to a melanized sleeve around the origin of the stylostome. When fully formed, the stylostome is mostly lodged in a cleft in the epidermis separated from the haemocoele and deeper tissues by the sheet of epidermal basal lamina. The delicate meshwork of the basal lamina, closely applied to the outside of the stylostome, seems to prevent haemocytic reactions to the stylostome in later developmental stages.",

In view of the marked difficulties involved in distinguishing species in the genus Demodex it is evident that this structure will prove to be a cardinal key character for species separation. Since this structure seems to end consistently in the haemocoel and is never associated with the pigment (excretory) granules, it is suggested that it may function as a hydrostatic organ. It is proposed, that this structure be called provisionally the proctodeum and its opening the proctodeal pore.",

Based on molecular and cytological data, terminal fusion automixis with an inverted meiotic sequence based on holokinetic chromosomes has been suggested as the reproductive mode in these mites. However, unequivocal structural evidence for meiosis is missing. The model organism Archegozetes longisetosus, a thelytokous member of the parthenogenetic family Trhypochthoniidae, was studied to gain ultrastructural insight in oocyte progression and meiotic processes. In this study, ovarian nuclear organization of its tritonymphal instar was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Numerous synaptonemal complexes were observed in the ovary, unequivocally confirming automixis (meiotic thelytoky) in oribatid mites for the first time. No recombination nodules were found. The nuclei are transcriptionally active in late prophase. Inverted meiosis is discussed as a result of the spatial arrangement of chromatid segregation.",

    "abstract": "Sugarcane is attacked by a suite of nematode pests, but little is known of the mites and other soil microarthropods that feed on them. To address this deficit, we undertook a survey of the soil microarthropod fauna in 60 sugarcane fields in Queensland, Australia. The results showed that oribatid mites and springtails dominated the upper 10 cm of sugarcane mineral soils. Laboratory observations demonstrated avid nematophagy in Galumnidae (Galumna sp., Pergalumna sp.), Scheloribatidae (Scheloribates sp.), and one unidentified Isotomidae (Collembola). Mesostigmata, a group of mites with many known nematophages, were never very abundant. Most of the taxa identified were previously known from Australia, but Protogamasellus sigillophorus Mineiro, Lindquist and De Moraes is reported for the first time and was reared through several generations on nematodes. In addition, we reared ten other cane field mesostigmatans on nematodes: Antennolaelaps sp., Asca garmani, Asca major, Cheiroseius sp., Cosmolaelaps sp., Gaeolaelaps sp., Gamasellodes bicolor, Gamasiphis sp., Holaspulus tenuipes, Protogamasellus mica. Because Mesostigmata were present at higher population densities in mineral soil where a mulch layer was retained after harvest, we assessed the effect of mulching in two sugarcane fields. Mulching did not result in significant differences in total microarthropods in the upper 5 cm of mineral soil. However, the mulch contained large numbers of free-living nematodes and 10% of the microarthropods were nematophagous mites. Results from a pot experiment also suggested that differences in soil properties affect nematophagous mite communities. More microarthropods and greater numbers of Mesostigmata were recovered from a well-structured clay loam soil than a sandy loam soil, and populations were highest in surface soils with high carbon contents and high levels of microbial activity.",

Data showed that at the beginning of the season (early July): (1) the native level of leaf flavonoids (flavonols, anthocyanins, tannins) varied significantly being higher in T. cordata than in T. tomentosa, (2) eriophyoid mite abundance was markedly lower on leaves of T. cordata with 4-fold higher levels of anthocyanins and 6-fold higher levels of tannins than on leaves of T. tomentosa, (3) in relation to linden taxa and mite/gall density, the content of flavonoids altered differently: in mite-galled leaves of T. cordata both flavonols and tannins accumulated markedly (up to 1% of leaf dry weight), whereas in galled leaves of T. tomentosa the increase of tannins and flavonols was much weaker (up to 0.6% of leaf dry weight), (4) due to P. tetratrichus feeding, the content of anthocyanins in T. cordata leaves decreased, while in T. tomentosa it did not change or it increased, depending on gall density. Results obtained suggest that at the beginning of the season T. cordata is a less suitable host for P. tetratrichus than T. tomentosa due to the relatively high amount of native leaf anthocyanins and tannins. Since the most responsive class of leaf flavonoids to P. tetratrichus feeding were tannins and flavonols, they are proposed as putative factors negatively affecting the performance of P. tetratrichus.",

    "abstract": "Research on aboveground-belowground interactions has recently experienced a boost. In spite of the relative prosperity of scientific literature featuring aboveground herbivorous arthropods involved in aboveground-belowground interactions, mites have so far been under-represented. To stimulate work with mites in this area, we summarize existing research on plant-mediated interactions of aboveground herbivorous mites and belowground plant-associated organisms. A literature search revealed 17 studies dealing with plant-inhabiting mites, all of which involve the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae. We categorize the studies according to the belowground biota associated with the mite's host plants, summarize the observed effects of the belowground organisms on the aboveground mites and discuss possible interaction mechanisms. The paucity of existing studies does not yet allow one to draw general conclusions but it is apparent that these aboveground-belowground interactions are strongly context-dependent and vary among plant species and species of belowground biota. In conclusion, we argue that the wealth of knowledge on the behavior, ecology, physiology, and genetic make-up of T. urticae and its natural enemies, and ability to easily rear and perform experimental studies on this species at various spatial scales and organizational levels, make these plant-inhabiting mites perfectly-suited model organisms for future research on aboveground-belowground interactions.",

All instars of H. scabra are stocky, as in other species of Hermannia Nicolet, 1855, and have the same gastronotal setal ontogeny (12 pairs in the larve and 16 pairs in the nymphs and adults). In this species, the prodorsal setae are similar to other species of Hermannia, except for the bothridial seta which is clavate, as in H. reticulata Thorell, 1871. In other species of Hermannia the bothridial seta is setiform. Most prodorsal and gastronotal setae of H. scabra are phylliform whereas in other Hermannia species they are thickened. The number of epimeral setae in the nymphs and adults and the ontogeny of leg setae are characteristic for H. scabra. This species has a holarctic distribution and in Svalbard is not as common as H. reticulata, but it achieves higher density than the latter species, mainly due to the abundance of juveniles. Hermannia scabra prefers moist and wet localities, and in Svalbard the highest density is achieved in vegetation class 8 (wet vegetated flats, beaches, slopes and river fans with some exposed Dryas vegetation and graminoids Luzula sp.).",

Moderate to high ARM densities affected fruits size, fruit weight, and round colour hue of Golden Delicious fruits. In contrast, ARM populations did not affect russet on fruits, return bloom and yield efficiency.

The objective of this paper was to assess the development and reproduction abilities of T. ( A.) athenas on O. afrasiaticus under laboratory conditions at two temperatures: 27 and 32 °C. The results obtained show that females of T. (A.) athenas develop in 5 days at 27 °C and 4.1 days at 32 °C. The mean fecundity of T.

At both temperatures tested, T. (A.) athenas intrinsic rate of increase was greater than that of O. afrasiaticus (rm = 0.213 at 32 °C,against rm = 0.166 day1 at 27 °C). Typhlodromus (A.) athenas would be able to develop at a wide range of temperatures feeding on O. afrasiaticus and seems to be able to potentially control it.",

It was introduced to most countries in Europe mainly for ornamental purposes. The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence, species composition and population densities of phytoseiid mites on A. hippocastanum in countries where this tree species is autochthonous and to compare them with Central Europe. In addition, we tested whether the horse chestnut leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella or the horse chestnut leaf blotch, Guignardia aesculi has any effect on Phytoseiidae population density. Leaf samples were collected in the cities of České Budějovice, Czech Republic and Orestiada, Greece in September 2013 and 2015, respectively. Thirty compound leaves were randomly taken from tree branches up to 2.5 m above ground in both localities. Mites were collected by washing the leaves in ethanol and were then mounted in lactic acid and identified. A total of 441 specimens of phytoseiid mites belonging to six species (Euseius finlandicus, Neoseiulella tiliarum, Kampimodromus aberrans, Paraseiulus talbii, Phytoseius macropilis and Typhlodromus (Typhlodromus) pyri) were collected. A significantly higher population density of Phytoseiidae was found in České Budějovice. The density was not affected by the horse chestnut leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella or the horse chestnut leaf blotch, Guignardia aesculi. Euseius finlandicus was the predominant species in both České Budějovice (96.8%) and Orestiada (48.4%) where, however, it competed with K. aberrans (42.9%).",

It has been reported as potentially useful for the control of Bemisia tabaci, a pest/vector insect of great economic importance worldwide. Some studies have reported some biological differences among phytoseiid populations. The objective of this work was to compare 14 populations of different regions of Brazil (from the states of Alagoas, Goiás, Minas Gerais and São Paulo; straight line distance between northern and southern extremes of 2,560 km) in relation to the predation and oviposition potential when fed with eggs of B. tabaci biotype B. The morphological characterization of these mites showed that the population from Olhos d'Agua das Flores (Alagoas state) and a population from mixed origin maintained in the laboratory for about 5 years were constituted by mites with larger dorsal and ventrianal shield dimensions and presented the highest rates of daily predation (respectively 7.9 and 7.0 eggs/ female) and oviposition (1.2 and 1.1 eggs/ female). A positive and significant relationship was observed between mean population predation and oviposition rates. The results suggest that subsequent efforts should focus on exploring the variability of mites of these two populations in relation to predation and oviposition potential, in order to select a new, more promising population to control B . tabaci biotype B.",

    "abstract": "Tetranychus neocaledonicus, the commonly called vegetable spider mite is a highly polyphagous pest, infesting over 500 species of economic plants. The species has been categorized as a major pest, inducing considerable feeding damage on vegetables, fruit crops, medicinal plants, ornamentals, plantation crops etc. The present study was concentrated to assess the predatory potential of a phytoseiid predator, Neoseiulus longispinosus on the different life stages (egg, larva, nymphs and adults) of T. neocaledonicus under laboratory conditions. Separate experimental set ups were prepared with leaf arena of mulberry plants and known numbers of different life stages of the pest mite were maintained on individual leaf arena. For evaluating the predatory potential, adult females of N. longispinosus were introduced on to the individual leaf discs in the arenas and observations were made under a stereomicroscope to record the response of the predator to the individual life stage of the pest mite. The number of prey stages consumed by the predator on individual leaf arena was recorded for a time interval of 24 hrs and the rate of consumption on individual prey instar was calculated. Except at the time of oviposition, the adult predator was found to make active prey searching movement randomly, in and around the prey patches. By sensing the prey through successive contacts with the first pair of legs and pedipalps, the predator initiated feeding actively, and sucked out the entire fluid content with its mouth parts. The adult predator showed a specific preference to feed on the egg stage of the prey mite while the predator nymph exhibited preference to the nymphal stages of the prey. A decreasing sequence in the order egg &gt; larva &gt; nymphs&gt; adult was recorded in the feeding preference of the adult predator towards life stages of the prey mite and the per cent consumption on egg, larva, nymphs and adult female stages was 48.4, 29.9, 26.6 and 9.3 %, respectively. However, the feeding preference of the nymphal stage of the predator showed a slight deviation in the order nymph &gt; larva &gt; adult &gt; egg and the mean rates of consumption were 31.3, 22, 11.2 and 10.3 %, respectively. Data gathered on consumption rates of the predator upon statistical analysis revealed a significant variation towards different stages of T. neocaledonicus, thereby establishing a specific preference to prey eggs by the predator.",

At most study sites, both pastures and meadows, no significant seasonal differences in the abundance of Oribatida and Mesostigmata were seen. Such differences were only observed for the third category of other mites that were the most abundant in spring and usually the least abundant in autumn. Also species diversity of Oribatida differed between the seasons – in all pastures it was the highest in summer and the lowest in spring, while in all meadows it was the highest in spring and decreased towards autumn. Oribatid species were more affected by the habitats than by seasons, as some species were strongly associated with pastures (Platynothrus peltifer), other with meadows (Achipteria coleoptrata, Liebstadia similis, Metabelba pulverosa, Scheloribates laevigatus and Sellnickochthonius immaculatus), and some (Eupelops occultus and Tectocepheus velatus) were abundant in both habitats. Although the effect of seasonality was weaker than that of the habitat, it was still perceptible. Platynothrus peltifer was most associated with autumn, T. velatus with spring, E. occultus with spring and summer and L. similis with summer.",

The exotic predatory mite, Typhlodromalus aripo developed and reproduced when maintained on eggs and active stages of the cassava green mite (CGM) Mononychellus progresivus at three different temperatures. At the highest temperature of 33 °C and the lowest at 12 °C, mite survival was less than 15 % over a period of ten days with low fecundity. At 12 °C, immatures took longer to reach maturity, while at 33 °C high mortality (>80 %) occurred. The best performance was recorded at 27 °C and 75 % relative humidity. Typhlodromalus aripo was also able to feed, develop and reproduce on the crawlers’ stage of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci and the nymphal stage of the mealybug, Phenacoccus manihoti, though a low survival rate (<10 %) was observed for the stages of protonymph, deutonymph and adults. Normal life stage development and egg hatchability were recorded at 27 °C and 75 % RH. The egg stage exhibited high drought tolerance (70 % hatching at 40 % RH). Typhlodromalus aripo females consumed less than 3 crawlers and produced less than one egg/day when fed with B. tabaci and P. manihoti at 75 % RH. The study indicated that for successful utilization of T. aripo in the biological control of CGM, it would be important to introduce the predator at low prey density whether in absence or presence of alternative prey on cassava. In conclusion, results revealed T. aripo to have drought resilient survival attributes which enhances this phytoseiid as an effective biological control agent.",

Functional response of the adult females of the predatory mite, Typhlodromus bagdasarjani Wainstein and Arutunjan to protonymphs of Eotetranychus frosti (McGregor) on four apple cultivars Imperial Gala, Kohanz Golab, Granny Smith and Lebanon Red was investigated. The protonymphs of E. frosti were offered to the adult female of the predator at densities of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 on apple leaf discs (4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The number and length of trichomes on the lower surface of each apple cultivar were measured. The highest and lowest number of trichomes were observed in Granny Smith and Kohanz Golab, respectively. Typhlodromus bagdasarjani adult females exhibited the type II functional response on E. frosti protonymphs regardless of apple cultivars. Also, the values of attack rate (a) and handling time (T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) were determined using the Rogers's type II model. Adult females of T. bagdasarjani had the highest attack rate (a) (0.0747 h&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the shortest handling time (0.7005 h) on Kohanz Golab, and the lowest attack rate (0.0334 h&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the longest handling time (1.1189 h) was on Granny Smith.

The estimated value of a/T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; indicated that T. bagdasarjani was most effective against E. frosti on Kohanz Golab with lowest number of trichomes.

    "abstract": "The predatory mite, Neoseiulus neoagrestis Khaustov and Döker (Acari: Phytoseiidae), recently described as new species for science, but seems to have a great potential to be used in biological control. In this study, as a first step to determine the optimum temperature (between three temperatures tested) for its mass rearing, we studied its biological characteristics and life table parameters fed on Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) (Acari: Acaridae) at three different temperatures (20, 25, and 30 °C) under laboratory conditions. Results show that immature development, oviposition period as well as reproductive potential of this predator are significantly vary depending on the temperature. The immature developmental times and adult longevity for females, are ranged between 5.42 to 10.42 days and 39.88 to 74.12 days, based on the temperature, respectively. Average total number of eggs laid by per female at 25 °C (62.29) and 30 °C (58.65) are more or less similar but higher than that determined at 20 °C (41.46). The highest net reproductive rate (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is 29.066 (offspring/individual) at 25 °C. In addition, the highest intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) is 0.241 day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30 °C. Furthermore, the highest finite rate of increase (λ = 1.272 day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and the shortest mean generation time (T = 13.416 days) and doubling time (DT = 2.874 days) are also determined at 30 °C. Our results demonstrate that N. neoagrestis successfully completed immature development, and can survive and reproduce at all tested temperatures. Nevertheless, a series of biological characteristics of this predator are differentially affected by the temperature. Finally, 25 °C and 30 °C seems to be more suitable for mass rearing of this predator on T . putrescentiae. Further studies should be conducted to determine biological characteristics and life table parameters of N. neoagrestis on several important pests such as spider mites, whiteflies and thrips.",

This paper aims to improve the knowledge of Phytoseiidae diversity in citrus orchards and argan forest in central western Morocco. The surveys were conducted between April and October during three successive years (2017–2019), in nine conventional citrus orchards covering an area of more than 3,000 hectares and on uncultivated plants in argan forest at an altitude ranging from 150 to 700 meters. Twenty-nine species belonging to 15 genera were found, seven of them being new for the Moroccan fauna: Amblyseius largoensis, A. swirskii, Amblyseiella setosa, Euseius batus, E. dossei, Paragigagnathus molestus, and Cydnoseius negevi. Species of nine genera were found on citrus leaves: Neoseiulus, Amblyseius, Amblyseiella, Transeius, Phytoseiulus, Euseius, Phytoseius, Typhlodromus, and Paraseiulus. Stah AlMadina (24.8%), Ouled Abdellah (15.9%), Nour (14.3%) domains contained a high number (more than 60.2%) of individuals in the collected samples. Malva parviflora, Convolvulus althaeoides, Solanum nigrum, Bryonia dioica, Withania somnifera would be interesting companion plants to be associated in the inter-rows in citrus orchards in this region to ensure sustainability, because they host high densities and diversities of Phytoseiidae.

The majority of the currently known 265 Unionicolidae species are associated with molluscs during at least one stage of their life cycle. A new host record is presented here from India: Unionicola (Myanamaratax) savadiensis from the host Lamellidens corrianus. In addition to L. corrianus, U. savadiensis was also found associated with two other mussel species, i.e., Lamellidens marginalis and Corbicula cashmiriensis, but DNA evidence confirms parasite-host association between U. (M.) savadiensis and L. corrianus, indicating that its findings in the two other mussel species should be considered as 'vagrant' associations. This report is thus significant for two reasons: (i) the record of the new host and geographic associations of the mite and mussels extends our knowledge on the known mite-mussels associations, and (ii) the study emphasized the importance of including experts from acarology, malacology, and molecular biology, to ascertain the nature of mite-mussel associations.",

    "abstract": "Studies on the mites from the Franz Josef Land Archipelago have become strongly belated and impeded because of the archipelago’s highly remote location (1,500 km from the mainland) and logistics barriers. Material collected during five expeditions (1981−2016) has revealed a total of 48 species of free-leaving mites, yet two species are added based on literature data (absent in the present material). Altogether, 17 families, 22 genera, and 23 species are reported for the first time to inhabit the archipelago. The presence of 16 from 26 previously recorded species must be confirmed. Like in the other parts of the polar desert zone, arachnids (52 species, including two spider species found in previous works) generally appear to be more diverse than insects (14 species, found in previous and present works), this being a unique feature of that natural zone. Prostigmatic mites (19 species) are twice as diverse as oribatid mites (10 species). The mesostigmatic mite genus Arctoseius Thor, 1930 is the most species-rich (8 species of all 13 mesostigmatic mite species collected), as previously reported throughout the Arctic. The acarofauna is strongly fragmentary, 23 of all 30 genera (76.7%) being represented by one species each. The fauna of Mesostigmata is much more specialized (in terms of cryophily) in comparison to Oribatida, true arctic and arctic-montane species amounting to 92% versus 10%, respectively. The total mite abundance varies between 120 and 3,760 ind./dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, being the maximal in a tundra-like habitat on a south-faced slope in Tikhaya Bay, Hooker Island. Small and thin-tegumented members of Eupodidae, Tydeidae and Nanorchestidae, all using liquid food alone, predominate everywhere across the archipelago as they do throughout the polar deserts of both Hemispheres. Small oribatids (Liochthonius spp., Brachychthoniidae) are often also abundant. All these taxa represent the most ancient lineages of the superorder Acariformes known to date back to the early or middle Devonian. The rather large and well-sclerotized members of the oribatid family Ceratozetidae are abundant only in the best heated habitats with an extended vegetation season.",

J. parva is an univoltine species, but it is suggested that there are two oviposition periods: (1) After insemination in autumn, these eggs hibernate, diapausing within the substratum. (2) After hibernation in late spring, by females which have also been inseminated in autumn of the year before. Adults die soon after reproduction; males do not survive the winter. The larva emerges from June to August and is parasitic on parasitengonid mites, with a preference for those of other species of the same genus. After passing through the parasitic phase, individuals develop quite quickly to the adult instar within the same year. The active postlarval instars prey on diptera larvae and pupae.

Oogonial divisions occur in the first immature stages (larva, protonymph and especially deutonymph). Premeiotic stages appear during the deutonymphal stage and are achieved during the tritonymphal stage. Maturation divisions occur in the adult and are followed by segmentation divisions which lead to the formation of an entire (T. tectorum) or unfinished (P. peltifer) prelarva enclosed in the egg. Diploidy results from fusion of 2 haploid anaphasic sets of chromosomes formed at the 2nd maturation division. The rearrangement of genetic material can occur.",

    "abstract": "In the present work 35150 water beetles of 6 families and 244 species were screened. Water mite larvae of the genus Eylais were found on 76 species of beetles of the families Haliplidae, Dytiscidae, Gyrinidae, Hydraenidae, and Hydrophilidae. Twelve Eylais species were found, the most numerous of them being E. longipalpis, E. extendens, E. relicta (?), E. setosa, E. muelleri, E. undulosa, and E. sp. The infestation rate was generally low, reaching at maximum 11,9 % of the specimens of species. E. hamata, E. bisinuosa, and E. glubokensis were found on a single beetle species. The other species are parasites on more than one species, but showed preferences. Larvae were located under the elytra. The size of the larvae varied from 0.13 to 7 mm. The relations between the body size and the data of sampling suggest a prolongation of the reproduction nearly over the entire spring-summer period, or the occurrence of more than one generation during the year. The environmental diversity of parasitism indicates a partial separateness of the infection and parasitism zones, probably due to the extensive mobility of the host.",

    "abstract": "Cheletogenes ornatus was reared during its life span on eggs and immature stages of two scale insects and two tetranychoid mite species, at 25 ± 0.5°C. Various types of non-prey nourishment were introduced to the newly egg-laying adult females, during ten days. Experiments showed that the predator female had two nymphal stages, while the male passed through one nymphal stage, before reaching adult. Prey eggs, specially those of mites, highly favoured the predator biology. Shorter periods of development prolonged oviposition period and longevity as well as greater number of eggs were obtained with prey eggs, than immatures. The duration of the predator female immature stages changed from 36.7 to 43 .4 days on eggs, and from 49.8 to 47.6 days on immatures of T . urticae and P. oleae, respectively. The male emerged earlier than the female for a period ranging from 7.0 days on eggs of C. pulcher and 13.0 days on immatures of T. urticae. The oviposition period varied from 58.4 to 62.5 days on eggs and from 43.1 to 59.0 days on immatures of T. urticae and C. aonidum respectively. Adult female lived for 94.5 and 71.2 on eggs and immatures of T. urticae, 118.5 and 101.3 days on eggs and immatures of C. aon~dum. The predator larva could afford starvation for 6.8 days, and adults fasted for 10.5 days. The predator attacked number of prey mites greater than scale insects, and laid high number of eggs. The number of consumed prey immatures, nexcept that of T. urticae, were highly exceeding eggs. The predator female immature stages attacked from 68.8 and 94.5 eggs and immatures of C. aonidum, while C. pulcher presented 141.5 and 161.8 eggs and immatures. Adult female consumed 299.3 and 329.7 eggs and immatures of P. oleae, while it killed 519.1 eggs and 517.0 immatures of C. pulcher. The male seemed to be less efficient than the female, as the former fed on about 2/3 that attacked by the latter. During the life span, the female killed 371.4 eggs and 429.3 immatures of P. oleae, while it consumed 660.7 eggs 678.8 immatures of C. pulcher. Prey eggs, specially those of T. urticae, increased the predator egg deposition, than immatures. The predator female deposited from, 47.7 to 53.3 eggs when fed on eggs of C. aonidum and T. urticae, 37.7 to 39.2 eggs on immatures of P. oleae and C. pulcher, respectively.

Seventeen phytoseiid mite species were observed in the uncultivated areas sampled. Typhlodromus pyri and Kampimodromus aberrans were the two prevailing species encountered. The highest diversity was observed in woodland. Herbaceous areas, fallows and humid areas shared similar species. Hedges and moor land were grouped together. Some plants have been identified as good reservoirs for K. aberrans and T. pyri. The dominant species on vine crops was T. pyri except on the cv. Chenanson, colonised by K. aberrans.

In order to understand its phylogeny, the investigation should start from a primitive Arachnid in which the mouth is still situated in front of the chelicerae, and in which the chelicerae are still in front of the palps. This primitive condition is indeed still found in the Palpigradida. The mouthparts of a species of this group (Eitkoenenia mirabilis) have been studied; they serve as starting point for an investigation of the fondamental structure of the gnathosoma of mites. The displacement of several parts of the gnathosoma in comparison with the primitive position has been studied, and phylogenetic interpretations have been added. Special attention has been paid to the displacement, in the course of phylogeny, of (1) the cheliceral frame with the tegulum and the coxal regions of the chelicerae, (2) the mouth with the lips, (3) the cervix, and (4) the palp and the ventral surface of the infracapitulum.",

All but one of the Digamasellus treated in this paper appear closely related to species occuring in Europe.Interspecific differences in leg setation were described. The retention of Longoseius as a distinct genus was justified on, the basis of the extreme reduction in the setae on the legs and podonotum.

Plants also benefit from arresting predators before prey arrival, as this will minimize future herbivore damage. For predators, however, the benefits of being attracted to clean plants depends on alternative food and on the degree of competition on other plants. Although the interactions between the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis and its plant host are well-studied on cucumber or bean, that with other plants remain largely unknown. Here, we studied the olfactory response of P. persimilis to volatiles of rose plants that were either clean (i.e., empty), occupied by their prey (Tetranychus urticae) or by conspecific competitors, using bean and cucumber as comparisons. We found that, relative to clean air, predators were attracted to clean plants, and also to plants with prey. On cucumber and bean, naïve predators preferred plants with prey over clean plants, but no such discrimination occurred on rose plants. However, after 24 hours of experience with rose plants infested with T. urticae, predators preferred those plants to clean roses. Predators avoided plants with prey and conspecifics, even without any previous experience. Our results show that predator attraction to plants hinges on the plant species and on experience. Attracting predators to clean plants may favour biological control, as plants may become better guarded from herbivores, but it may also be detrimental, as predators may starve on those plants.",

    "abstract": "Macrocheles muscaedomesticae (Scopoli) is a predatory mesostigmatic mite that inhabits different manure microhabitats and preys mostly on housefly (Musca domestica L.) eggs. When a virgin female colonizes a new manure substrate, it produces male offspring through parthenogenesis (arrhenotoky); when her sons reach maturity, oedipal mating takes place and the female begins to produce bisexual offspring. In order to examine the consequence of oedipal reproduction on population development, we designed two separate experiments to compare life history traits and life table parameters of oedipal versus bisexual cohorts of M. muscaedomesticae, using the age-stage, two sex life table method. Experiments were conducted at 28 +/- 1 °C, using a photoperiod of 14:10 (L: D) h, and 65 +/- 5% relative humidity, with housefly eggs used to feed mites. Mean adult female longevity was 38.63 days, and fecundity 128.51 offspring under bisexual reproduction, and 37.48 days and 68.23 offspring under oedipal reproduction. In the bisexual cohort, the intrinsic rate of increase (rm), the finite rate of increase (λ), the net reproduction rate (R0), the gross reproductive rate (GRR) and the mean generation time (T) of M. muscaedomesticae were 0.2938 d-1, 1.3415 d-1, 54.216 offspring/individual, 77.7 offspring/individual and 13.5885 days, respectively. Because only male eggs were produced during the first 5.62 days (on average) of the oviposition period in the oedipal cohort, it was theoretically incorrect to compute the population parameters using the survival and fecundity values for this group, even though bisexual reproduction did occur after this period. Our findings determined that the effect of oedipal reproduction could be correctly defined and analyzed by using the age-stage, two-sex life table method. Our results demonstrated that virgin females are able to produce and copulate with their sons (oedipal mating), which then allows those females to produce both sexes. This reproductive system can enable this valuable natural enemy to considerably extend its distribution potential.",

Activity of three principal detoxifying enzymes of these mite populations was also assayed.

There was no change for fenazaquin which was effective at lower doses than the recommended dose. Of all the acaricides tested, fenazaquin was the most toxic and ethion was the least toxic. General esterases (GEs), glutathione- S-transferase (GST), and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases exhibited a higher activity in mite population from the conventionallymanaged tea plantation as compared with the activity in mites from the organicallymanaged tea plantation.

Examining contemporary species distributions along altitudinal gradients is one approach to predicting species future distributions, as species occurrence patterns at cold, high altitudes are expected to resemble the species distribution patterns currently observed at warmer, lower altitudes if warming occurs. Strong changes in climate have been observed in the sub-Antarctic over the last 50 years, with a 1.5 °C increase in mean temperature and a c. 30% decrease in mean precipitation recorded on Marion Island. In this study, the distribution patterns of mites and springtails inhabiting the cushion-plant Azorella selago were studied on Marion Island. Mite and springtail species richness and springtail abundance were significantly higher on the western aspect of the island, possibly due to higher rainfall and greater cloud cover on the windward side of the island. Mite abundance did not differ between aspects of the island, which may be due to the higher desiccation tolerance of mites. Mite and springtail species richness and springtail abundance were significantly lower at high altitudes coinciding with lower temperatures and generally harsher environment at higher altitudes. Plant characteristics generally did not contribute to explaining species patterns, suggesting that at the island-scale abiotic variables, rather than biotic factors, appeared to be the more important determinants of community structure. Therefore, despite species responding individualistically, it is clear that a warmer and drier climate will dramatically change the microarthropod community structure within A. selago on Marion Island.",

Phytoseiidae and Stigmaeidae were evaluated with a total of 324 plant sampled from nine sites in three environments. Twenty-two Phytoseiidae species and six Stigmaeidae species were found. Riparian Forest presented the highest abundance of predatory mites (243) and the greatest species diversity. Mites were more abundant in Grazing Exclusions (64) than in Grassland (25) environments, but species diversity was similar. In Riparian Forest, the most abundant species were Amblyseius tamatavensis Blommers, Amblyseius herbicolus (Chant) and Agistemus floridanus González-Rodríguez. Arrenoseius gaucho Ferla, Silva and Moraes and Zetzellia malvinae Matioli, Ueckermann and Oliveira were the most abundant in Grassland environment.

Based on surveys carried out in two experimental sites in Tunisian citrus orchards, this study aims: (i) to compare Phytoseiidae communities on citrus trees and weeds, (ii) to determine dispersal between agrosystem compartments and (iii) to assess the impact of weed management on Phytoseiidae communities. Samples were collected on trees and weeds; dispersal between ground cover and trees was surveyed using traps along tree trunks. Euseius stipulatus and, to a lesser extend, Iphiseius degenerans were the main species on citrus trees. Phytoseiidae were observed in weeds, with diversity and densities varying according to plant species. Phytoseiidae species in weeds were globally similar to those observed on trees. Phytoseiidae were trapped along the trunk; however higher dispersal was observed from weeds to trees than from trees to weeds. In one survey, species moving up the trees were not the same as those present on trees. With respect to weed management strategies, it seems that ploughed plots favour Phytoseiidae mite dispersal from weeds to trees with consequent increases in densities on trees. This weeding strategy therefore requires more attention to determine how its schedule can enhance biological control.",

    "abstract": "Diagnoses of 111 ptyctimous species known from Madagascar and neighbouring islands Seychelles, Mauritius, Comoros and Reunion (MAG) are presented. Additionally, 44 species have been redescribed based on type material. Four species are new for the Afrotropical Region, and nine are new for MAG. Keys for identification of species and higher taxa have also been constructed. The percentage ratio of Protoplophoridae to Archoplophoridae: Mesoplophoridae: Euphthiracaroidea is 2: 5: 27: 66. The proportions of species representing two families – the more primitive Oribotritiidae and less primitive Euphthiracaridae of Euphthiracaroidea are similar. Within Phthiracaroidea the more primitive Phthiracaridae are less abundant than Steganacaridae. Among Euphthiracaridea the most abundant are the genera: Oribotritia and Acrotritia, while from among Phthiracaroidea by far the most abundant species is the genus Notophthiracarus, while Hoplophorella and Phthiracarus are also rather abundant. The proportions of the number of species from higher taxa are usually similar to those in the fauna of other zoogeographic regions in the southern hemisphere. The fauna of MAG is characterised by a high number of related species (88), endemic 68 (61 %) and indigenous 20 (18%) as well as a relatively high number of pantropical species (11). All these proportions of species are similar to other zoogeographic Regions of the southern hemisphere: Afrotropical, Oriental, Australasian and Neotropical. The fauna of MAG (111 species) is closer to that of the Afrotropical Region (200 species) (15% common species) than to that of the Oriental Region (262 species) (4% common species). A significant number of widespread species (14) occur in the faunas of MAG and the Oriental Region, and four of them seem to be of Oriental origin. The fauna of Madagascar and neighbouring islands shows no similarity to that of India. In 171 soil samples collected in 2010-2015 on Madagascar the number of species found was 78. The eastern part of the island is the most abundant in species – 67 species; the northern part is less abundant – 53 species and, central part is the least abundant – 34 species. The highest number of endemites was found in the fauna of the eastern and central parts of Madagascar. The unique character of Madagascan fauna is the presence of a high number of endemic species among the dominant species and species of high frequency. In the new material the most abundant and most frequent species is the endemic Oribotritia striata, followed by five endemic species Protophthiracarus araios, Oribotritia mahunkai, Indotritia paulyi, Notophthiracarus similis, Notophthiracarus zebrus and two pantropical species Acrotritia vestita and Indotritia javensis. The fauna of neighbouring islands does not show an Oriental origin and is closely related to that of Madagascar, more than half of the number of species (17) occur also in Madagascar but nearly a quarter of the species are endemites. The fauna of MAG has been compared 12 years after the former report, some similarities and differences were found.",

As soil-dwelling predaceous mites are known as potential biological control agents against many pests, we investigated the interactions between the cunaxid mite, Cunaxa capreolus (Berlese), and two plant parasites (root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) and the citrus Nematode, Tylenchulus semipenetrans Cobb under laboratory conditions. The predatory mite C. capreolus completed its life-span when fed on egg masses EM and second-stage juveniles J2 of M. incognita and J2 juveniles of T. semipenetrans as food sources in the laboratory in sealed arenas at 32ºC, 60% relative humidity in the dark. Males developed slightly faster than females irrespective of different prey. Adult females lived longer than males and showed a higher rate of food consumption. Life table parameters indicated that feeding C. capreolus on J2 juveniles of M. incognita and J2 juveniles of T. semipenetrans led to the highest reproduction rate (r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;= 0.185 and 0.167 females/female/day), while feeding on EM of M. incognita gave the lowest reproduction rate (r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;= 0.085). The results show that C. capreolus multiplied rapidly when juveniles of M. incognita and T. semipenetrans were offered as prey, indicating the mite’s potential for regulating population densities of these two pests. Future research should focus on understanding the crop and soil management applications required to enable this cunaxid mite and other predatory species to thrive. The implications of these results on biological control of plant parasitic nematodes are discussed.",

Les prevalences de P. ulmi ont varie d'une facon similaire aux abondances de cette espece.

Our analysis of the addition of leg setae and the setae in the genital region supported the hypothesis of three post larval developmental stages. An alternative hypothesis of sexually dimorphic deutonymphs that the stage currently recognised as the tritonymph is the female deutonymph, and the stage currently recognised as the deutonymph is the male deutonymph, is not supported by our data.",

The criterion of division of the family Oppiidae into subfamilies is the absence (Oppiinae Grandjean) or presence (Oppiellinae nov. subfam.) of setae ta on the notogaster of adult individuals, while the subfamilies are divided into genera depending on the presence or absence of dorsal setae (da, dm and dp). The new division supported by ontogenetic observations makes it possible also for juvenile forms to be classified to the appropriate subfamilies. The division is in line with the differences in walking behaviour: both the juvenile and adult individuals of the subfamily Oppiinae agitate the first pair of legs before putting them down, while members of the other subfamily walk without agitating their legs. Instead of the 51 genera hitherto accepted, the new division of the family Oppiidae proposes only 4, grouped in two subfamilies.",

A keratin-Iike protein present in the mid-layer (exocuticle) is apparently of adaptive significance in lencling fiexibility, especially in the egg and in mature stages, to the exoskeleton. The epicuticle is very thin and, in part, lipid in nature. The endocuticle was most reactive to ali tests for chitin. The pigment granules found in ali stages (even ova) of the democlicid life cycle are not guanine. They seem to play a dual role as (r) inert repositories of waste material and (z) elements used in ’excretory cocling’ - since they are incorporated in the egg and probably forma substrate for waste immobilization during development. Members of the three genera, Demodex, Harpyrhynch~ts, and Psorergates, show birefringence on polariscopic examination and so fall within Grandjean s phylogenetic grouping of Actinochitinosi.",

Larvae and nymphs of A. triste were found on Akodon azarae (Fischer, 1829); Calomys callosus Renger, 1830; Oxymycterus rufus (Fischer, 1814) and only nymphs on Oligoryzomys delticola (Thomas, 1917). All these Sigmodontinae are new hosts for these tick species. Birds are considered crucial for the life cycle of A. tigrinum; however the results of this study show that Sigmodontinae rodents may also play a role for the maintenance of this tick in nature. This information also confirms the importance of Sigmodontinae as natural host for A. triste. Although on a wide basis the distribution of both tick species appears to be sympatric they colonize different ecological niches.",

    "abstract": "La phylogenese des opilioacarides et leurs affinites avec les autres acariens. - Because of the lack of paleontological data, conclusions on the phylogeny of Opilioacarida are obtained only by phyletic weighting of characters of recent species. Up till now eight valid species have been described, whilst the descriptions of seven new species are in preparation. These species are classified in four genera. The geographie distribution is especially gondwanian. Starting from a fenetic classification obtained by comparison of species and homologous structures, six pairs or series of characters can be distinguished to which an important phyletic value is attributed. By paying special attention to shared possession of derived characters, a cladogram can be constructed. By means of this cladogram an archetype (in the sense of a synthetic type, combining the ancestral characters of a monophyletic taxon) can be constructed. The phyletic divergence is determined by comparing each genus with the archetype. When the divergence is known, the dendrogram can be constructed representing the phylogeny of the Opilioacarida. One of the most important conclusions from the dendrogram is that on the depilation of the opisthosoma in different genera by parallel evolution. In comparing the Opilioacarida with other groups of mites, it appears that there is a distinct relationship with the Holothyrida; bath groups, without doubt, belong to the Anactinotrichida. In spite of the shared possession of a number of primitive characters, Opilioacarida are widely separated from the Actinotrichida, especially because of the presence of sternal taenidia, and the absence of a podocephalic canal. It is demonstrated that in a common ancestor of Anactinotrichida and Actinotrichida (in case the mites are monophyletic), sternal taenidia as well as podocephalic canal must have been absent; this means that the gnathosoma of this ancestor was still at the beginning of its evolution, and the ancestor itself still at the very beginning of its evolution as mite.",

Irrespectively of the species studied and developmental stages, the excretory organ is represented by a simple thin-walled blind sac that occupies an axial position. The excretory organ is not divided into obvious morphologically or functionally different parts. Posteriorly, the excretory organ transforms into the short cuticular-lined excretory duct, the proper hindgut, derivative of proctodeum. The excretory duct terminates by the axially orientated fissured opening (excretory pore, uropore) that anatomically corresponds to the anus, located on the ventral body wall. In larvae P. carnea, the excretory duct and the excretory pore are lacking. The lumen of the excretory organ is variously filled with yellowish double-refractive crystals of excretory wastes (probably guanine) and sometimes also contains single electron-dense globule. The walls of the excretory organ are formed of the single-layered endodermal epithelium, composed of the uniform cells greatly variable in their shape and size. The basal plasma membrane forms round digital indentations frequently containing corresponding projections of the underlying connective tissue cells penetrating through the basal lamina. Clear vacuoles resulting from these indentations immerse into the cells and migrate through the cytoplasm to the apical plasma membrane where they are discharged from the cells. The cells may also contain round or irregularly shaped electron-dense bodies resembling secondary lysosomes or residual bodies. These inclusions may come close to the apical plasma membrane and may be release from the cells. The apical plasma membrane forms irregular microvilli as well as larger irregular projections also bearing microvilli. Golgi bodies and profiles of granular endoplasmic reticulum occur only rarely. Passive transport of residual precursors, vacuolar transport as well as excretion of the electron-dense material provides the accumulation of wastes in the lumen of the organ.",

The goal of our work was to evaluate the effects of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae BIPESCO 5, which is a potential biological control agent against the bee parasitic mite V. destructor, on the behavior of the parasite. In detail, we investigated whether the presence of fungal spores on the surface of host nurse bees, A. mellifera, affects the host choice behavior of adult female mites. We conducted two behavioral assays to monitor the behavior of the mites towards adult bees inoculated with a solution of fungal spores. Both choice and no-choice experiment revealed that M. anisopliae has a significant repellent influence on V. destructor‘s host selection behavior. The mites preferred, and stayed longer on, nurse bees free from fungal spores over bees carrying fungal spores. Our study provides the first evidence of sub-lethal behavioral effects of a fungal biocontrol agent against Varroa mites.",

The aim of this study was to estimate the potential risk of exposure to common tick-borne diseases in the recreational areas of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland, Poland with particular emphasis on the city of Częstochowa. The DNA from 459 I. ricinus ticks was used to detect B. burgdorferi s. l., A. phagocytophilum and B. microti by PCR and nested PCR methods. Generally, infectious agents were found in 26.3% of all the examined ticks: B. microti was found in 23.3%, and A. phagocytophilum in 2.4% of the ticks. The protozoan was found mainly in females and nymphs, while A. phagocytophilum was detected mainly in adults. The co-existence of B. microti and A. phagocytophilum was found in 2.1% of the examined ticks. The presence of B. burgdorferi s. l. was not revealed in the examined material. The conducted studies demonstrate the high potential risk of exposure of tourists and pilgrims to B. microti, and a low risk of exposure to A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi s.l. in the examined areas of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland. Furthermore, the possible co-existence of A. phagocytophilum and B. microti in 3 individual ticks means that infection by multiple infectious agents is possible. The obtained results highlight the need to conduct further research on tick-borne pathogens in this region of Poland.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the investigation was to determine the response of different taxa of mites across the land use types and demonstrate that soil mites could be used as an indicator of environmental change after the conversion of secondary forests into rubber plantations. The sampling was performed during the dry season on 12 sampling areas, consisting of four land use types: secondary forests, 7-year-old rubber plantations, 12-year-old rubber plantations, and 25-year-old rubber plantations, with three replications of each treatment. Soil cores were sampled along a 40 m transect with a steel corer. The soil mites were extracted using modified Berlese-Tullgren funnels during a 10 day period. Soil physico-chemical parameters were measured on each sampling area. The conversion of secondary forests into rubber plantations was characterized by a modification of the mean values of mite density (+103 and +262%), species richness (-11 and +32%), water content (-41 and -5%), bulk density (+6 and -3%) and soil organic carbon (-73 and -59%) respectively, after 7 and 25 years of conversion. The density of mites, species richness and soil water content increased with the aging of the rubber plantations, demonstrating an improvement in soil ecological quality and environmental conditions. These results are confirmed by the values of the Maturity Index of Gamasid mites, which increased with the increasing age of rubber plantations. In other words, the severity of environmental impact decreased with the aging of the rubber plantations and was ranked as follows: 25-year-old rubber plantations &lt; secondary forest &lt; 12-year-old rubber plantations &lt; 7-year-old rubber plantations. The Maturity Indexes estimated that 25-year-old rubber plantations (0.84) and in secondary forests (0.74) are relatively similar and characterize stable habitats, which are potentially dominated by Gamasid species with K selection.",

We investigated the lethal and sublethal effects of the essential oil from the latex of the mango fruit [Mangifera indica, Espada and Rosa (MESPA and MROSA) varieties] and selected monoterpenes on T. urticae. The yield of the MROSA oil was higher (9.22 ± 0.15%). The GC/MS analysis of the oils enabled the identification of 26 constituents. Terpinolene (70.14 ± 0.61%) was the major compound identified in the MESPA oil; β-pinene (38.22 ± 0.80%) was the major constituent of the MROSA oil, followed by terpinolene (29.44 ± 0.29%). The mite was more susceptible to the oils and constituents through fumigation, with no difference between the two varieties. By residual contact, the MROSA oil was 2.7-fold more toxic than the MESPA oil. Terpinolene was the most toxic constituent by fumigation, whereas β-pinene and α-pinene were the most active by residual contact. The selected compounds from M. indica also affected the behavior of the mite, exerting an influence on fecundity, feeding preference and egg-laying preference. The positive control (Azamax®) was more efficient at reducing the fecundity of the mite than the oils, but the MROSA oil was more toxic by fumigation and residual contact. The effects of fumigation and residual contact combined with the change in behavior may be a considerable advantage in the integrated management of T. urticae. For the practical use of these oils as novel acaricides, however, further investigations are needed to evaluate the effects on non-target organisms and the cost-benefit ratio for the formulation of a product to be used on protected crops in the semiarid region of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil.",

    "abstract": "The structure of phytoseiid communities on citrus varies among orchards and seasons, with potential implications for biocontrol services. Such variation may be driven by meteorological conditions and cultivar-specific traits. We conducted an outdoor seedling experiment to determine the effects of different cultivars on the establishment of introduced predatory mites (Euseius stipulatus and E. scutalis) and colonization by naturally occurring phytoseiids (Amblyseius swirskii, Iphiseius degenerans, and Typhlodromus athiasae) across seasons. Euseius stipulatus persisted through the spring only where it was released, regardless of cultivar, and reduced colonization by I. degenerans. In early summer (hot and dry conditions), nearly all phytoseiid species essentially disappeared, and after that only the naturally occurring A. swirskii and T. athiasae re-established. In mid-summer, A. swirskii colonized cultivars differentially, especially where pollen was provisioned, and was negatively related with the colonization of T. athiasae, which is known as its intraguild prey. Additionally, we performed laboratory experiments that simulated daily temperature fluctuations typical to spring and mid-summer seasons, measuring key demographic parameters of A. swirskii and E. stipulatus on leaf disc arenas of two citrus cultivars. Simulated spring temperatures resulted in higher total reproductive output in E. stipulatus than in A. swirskii, whereas mid-summer temperatures resulted in the opposite pattern. Both results are consistent with the seasonal patterns observed in the outdoor experiment. Together with the phytoseiid dynamics observed previously in commercial orchards, these findings emphasize the role of meteorological conditions and cultivars in the structure and function of phytoseiid communities.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research was to obtain initial data on the fauna and abundance of the oribatid mites from the main types of the mountain tundra habitats of the Chunatundra Mountains. Four plots, including two lichen tundra plots, one dwarf shrub tundra plot and one sphagnum bog in the belt of mountain tundra were investigated. Multidimensional scaling and discriminant function analysis were used to identify trends in the fauna and abundance of oribatid species through the explored plots. A total of 70 species and one subspecies from 37 genera and 24 families were found during the course of this investigation. Nine species, one subspecies, one genus and one family of oribatid mites have been added to the fauna of the Kola Peninsula. The families Brachychthoniidae, Oppiidae and Suctobelbidae are the most diverse in the discovered local fauna. According to literature data, the first two families are characteristic of the low tundra communities, the third family is more common for the boreal zone. The discovered oribatid fauna is similar to the fauna of other tundra sites of the Kola Peninsula studied previously and is significantly different to the local oribatid mite faunae of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The abundance of the adult oribatid mites reached 39 080 ind./m2 in the lichen tundra and 56 200 ind./m2 in the dwarf shrub tundra. The minimum abundance of oribatid mites, 18 640 ind./m2 was found in the sphagnum bog. Differences in the oribatid mite complexes of lichen tundra, dwarf shrub tundra and the sphagnum bog were found. The species Carabodes labyrinthicus, Nothrus borussicus, Sellnickochthonius immaculatus, Mycobates sarekensis, and Tectocepheus velatus were associated with the lichen tundra habitats. Nanhermannia sellnicki, Chamobates borealis and a few species of Oppiella and Suctobelbella were associated with the dwarf shrub tundra. Mucronothrus nasalis, Limnozetes ciliatus, Platynothrus peltifer, Trimalaconothrus foveolatus, Limnozetes cf. rugosus, and Trimalaconothrus maior are most characteristic of the sphagnum bog. The family Suctobelbidae was represented by a large number of species, while the families Ceratozetidae and Camisiidae were much less diverse. The low diversity of Ceratozetidae, a high diversity of Suctobelbidae and relatively high abundance of oribatid mites in the explored tundra habitats may be explained by an ambivalent nature of the oribatid community, which combines boreal and arctic features due to marine climate. Also, this result may be a feature of a local mountain tundra which is surrounded by the underlying belts of the mountain forests that are a source of the increasingly diversity of species.",

    "abstract": "The nutritional quality of the host plant is one of the most important factors of growth and reproduction for crop pests. In order to investigate the impact of nitrogen on the biology and demography of Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), cucumber plants were nourished by four levels of nitrogen: N1 (10 meq /L NO3-), N2 (12 meq/L NO3-), N3 (15 meq/L NO3-) and N4 (20 meq /L NO3-). The experiments were performed under laboratory conditions at 25+/-1 °C, 60+/-5 % RH and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) hours. Based on the results, increasing nitrogen nutriment was associated with a diminution of pre-imaginal duration in female mites from 13.13 to 10.74 days. In the opposite direction, the population reared on nitrogen-deficient cucumbers exhibited the highest rates of net fecundity (36.79 eggs/female) and net fertility (27.22 eggs/female). However, no considerable variation was demonstrated in fertility life-table parameters. The greatest net reproductive rate (R0) was observed when using the deficient (N1) nitrogen solution (22.12 females/female/generation). Additionally, the intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) was estimated to be 0.178, 0.171, 0.183 and 0.185 females/female/day on cucumbers which were nourished by 10 to 20 meq/L NO3-, respectively. Finally, the mean population doubling time (DT) ranged from 3.72 to 4.04 days, and was at a minimum with the excess (N4) nitrogen solution and at a maximum with the moderately deficient (N2) treatment",

A detailed study of the morphology of N. coineaui is presented. The following characters are recorded for the first time in Teneriffiidae: two pairs of prodorsal trichobothria; a distinct, pigmented ventro-median eye on the naso; two pairs of stigmata and tracheae with common atria; and sexual dimorphism of the pedal solenidia. The homologies and notations of the podocephalic and intracapitular glands of Prostigmata are discussed. A gland duct homologous with gl.c III of Caeculidae and the Lassenia-organ of certain Parasitengona, is demonstrated in Teneriffiidae. The oncophysis of the chelicera bears a hollow, spine-like process which may represent the duct of a cheliceral gland. The process of the palpal tibia is here named the palpal oncophysis. Heteroteneriffia mortoni Luxton is transferred to the genus Teneriffia Thor (n. comb.).",

Ticks collected (N = 255) for this study belong to the species Ixodes ricinus and Haemaphysalis punctata (immatures only), Ixodes frontalis (all stages) and Hyalomma marginatum (nymphs). The estimated prevalence for some bird species (Sylvia atricapilla, Phylloscopus collybita, Parus major and Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) is very low, but others like Erithacus rubecula, Turdus merula and Turdus philomelos it reaches values of about 20 % or even higher. Most of the cases of parasitism by ticks are due to Ixodes frontalis. This tick can attach a wide range of hosts, although Erithacus rubecula and Turdus philomelos are the commonest. With regard to Ixodes ricinus, Turdus merula seems to be the most important carrier, whereas Emberiza cirlus may be the main host for Haemaphysalis punctata.",

The regular monitoring, during 14 consecutive months, of infestation levels on black birds (Turdus merula) - which appeared to be, by far, the most frequently and intensively infested host - revealed that the tick was essentially most frequent as an ectoparasite during October to December. Newly recorded hosts included Accipiter nisus, Perdix perdix, Columba palumbus, Sturnus vulgaris, Corvus corone and Parus caeruleus. This study allowed several aspects of the previously almost unknown biology of this species to be determined. Although considered a rare species by several acarologists, this is an abundant tick, at least in the geographic areas sampled here, especially in open biotopes. This study included investigations of repletion times on birds, time taken for egg maturation and hatching, and longevity of fasting larvae. The results indicated that this tick has only one generation per year. Other aspects of the biology of this species remain to be defined, such as modalities of bird infestation in cold conditions. Nevertheless, it appears that this tick will need to be taken into consideration for its potential role in the epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis, a wide spread anthropozoonosis.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether differences in tomato hairiness affect the devlopmental time, survival and fecundity of Tetranychus urticae Koch and Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor). Laboratory experiments were performed on 2 tomato hybrids (Fortaleza and Parador) with different density of glandular hairs. There were no significant differences in developmental time of immature stages and total preadult time of T. urticae and N. californicus, between hybrids. Survival of both immatures and adults T. urticae was not affected by tomato hairiness, but fecundity, although low in both hybrids, was significantly lower in the most pubescent hybrid. Neoseiulus californicus did not show any difference among hybrids in none of the life history traits studied. However, there was a trend towards reduced cohort survival when hairiness increased. Tomato plant seems to be a very poor resource for the performance of T. urticae and N. californicus compared to other horticultural crops. An antibiosis process due to glandular hairs could be, at least in part, the cause of this detrimental effect. Implications of these observations in the control of T. urticae on tomato are discussed.",

Earlier all Ameronothrus species have been considered larviparous, which implies that larvae hatch from the eggs inside the female. Proving ovoviviparity requires laboartory studies were newly deposited progeny are observed. Culturing congeneric species may reveal that A. lineatus is not the only ovoviviparous Ameronothrus species. Observations of cultures of A. lineatus showed that occasionally eggs with incomplete larval development were deposited. These eggs were observed at all constant laboratory temperatures (5-21 deg C), but most of them were found at 5 deg C. The majority of the eggs dried without any further development taking place, but 3 (out of 61) successfully hatched after 8-12 days at 15 deg C. This is the first record of mixed-parity mode in an ovoviviparous oribatid mite.",

The peak of detachment was seven days after infestation for nymphs of either sex fed on rabbits and eight days for those fed on rats. The final weight of nymphs of either sex was not related to the feeding period. The premouit time at 30°C and 2-3 mm Hg saturation deficit in darkness was longer in female nymphs (19.7 days) than in males (17.7 days). Heavier engorged larvae produced heavier engorged nymphs which, in turn, gave rise to more females than males. Prediction of the sex of nymphs using engorgement weights was unreliable due to weight overlap. The different sizes of male and female nymphs must create problems in developing a technique for accurately evaluating field populations on hosts of bisexual three-host ticks. The different premouit periods and weights of male and female nymphs must be taken into account in experimental designs involving engorged nymphs.",

Histochemical methods have revealed extensive enzyme activity in the midgut cells and lumen. In addition, the oesophagus contains acid phosphatase and the wall of the post colon shows strong alkaline phosphatase activity associated with a brush border. The midgut epithelium appears to consist of two main kinds of cell. The stomach wall is composed of cells many of which show strong alkaline phosphatase activity and have microvilli. These are thought to be absorptive in function. The posterior and outer walls of the caeca include large claviform cells with strong esterase activity and there, these cells have a digestive function. Bacteria are found in large numbers in the lumen of the midgut and the mite appears to be a general browser on the zoogloeal film surrounding the medium in se,vage beds. Bacteria are also found in the cells of the midgut wall and may form a mycetome. Intraluminar and intracellular digestion may occur. Although the food bolus lying in the colon shows enzyme activity, the wall of this organ does not appear to be the site for the production of these enzymes. The Malpighian tubules are well developed, have granular contents and appear functional in this species. The nomenclature used by various authors to describe the organs of the alimentary canal in Sarcoptiform mites is reviewed, illustrating a continuing lack of uniformity and confusion. The terminology adopted by Hughes (1950, 1959) is recommended for the gut of the Sarcoptiformes.",

Despite having approximately the same number of described species, spiders outshine mites on the Web, although the study of mites (Acarology) is better represented than the study of spiders (Araneology). Broad searches of scientific literature imply that publications on mites exceed those on spiders by 2-3x; however, this dominance was reversed when a smaller number of journals with broad readerships and no taxonomic orientation (e.g., Nature, Science) were surveyed. This latter analysis revealed that the topical content of mite and spider papers in these general-science journals differs significantly. A troubling leveling-off of taxonomic publications on mites also was discovered. We conclude by suggesting some strategies that acarologists and editorial boards might follow in order to raise mites to their proper status as exemplary models for ecological and evolutionary research.",

Free-living males and females of this tick species were collected in Calcehtok cavern, Yucatán, Mexico. The morphology of the females of O. viguerasi was identical to the holotype female from Cuba. The only difference was related to size; females from Mexico were bigger than the holotype female. The male of O. viguerasi was described for the first time from the specimens collected in Mexico. The diagnostic characters are a combination of a genital aperture covered by a semicircular flap, a central sclerotized plate posterior to genital aperture, a transverse and thin plate anterior to the genital aperture located at the level of the anterior margin of coxae I, a pair of sclerotized plates bordering coxae II, III and IV, basis capituli rectangular in shape and protrusible, a hypostome roughly blunt at the apex with small denticles (it appears to be functionless), and article I of the palpi with a medial integumental extension which has a long setae on the medial margin. A comparative morphological analysis of the male described in this work with the paratype specimens from Cuba was also conducted; we conclude that the nymphs described in the original description of O. viguerasi correspond to males. Sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA gene of both male and female ticks from Mexico were identical. In a phylogenetic analysis, the monophyly of the subgenus Subparmatus could not be resolved.",

    "abstract": "The Cerrado biome suffers constant impacts mainly due to agricultural activities, which can reduce food resources and habitats for many plant-dwelling mites, including important species to agriculture, such as predators. However, the mite fauna from this biome are still poorly known. Here, we present a checklist of mite species on Astronium fraxinifolium Schott, a Brazilian plant species threatened with extinction, from the Cerrado remnants associated with nickel mining areas, in the Niquelândia municipality, Brazil. Moreover, we performed cumulative (Mao Tau) and estimated (Jackknife 1) species accumulation curves in order to test for an effect of sampling effort and to estimate the potential number of species sheltered by the studied Cerrado remnants, and NMDS and ANOSIM analyses to test for similarity in mite species composition among samples. We sampled five A. fraxinifolium plants in each of six Cerrado remnants. Among these, three remnants were preserved (PR) and three were experiencing a secondary regeneration process (SR). Both PR and SR remnants were close to nickel mining areas. We recorded 1,562 mites including 17 species from 12 genera and eight families. Tetranychidae was the most diverse family, followed by Phytoseiidae and Tenuipalpidae. The most abundant species were phytophagous mites, namely Brevipalpus sp.1, Oligonychus sp., Eotetranychus sp.1, and the predator Agistemus brasiliensis Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira. Regarding feeding behavior, phytophagous mites were the most abundant and diverse on A. fraxinifolium. Both species accumulation curves (Mao Tau) for PR and SR remnants trended towards an asymptote, while estimated curves (Jackknife 1) proved to be similar to accumulation curves (Mao Tau). These results indicate that sampling was sufficient to assess mite assemblages using the methods applied in this study. No differences in mite species composition were observed between PR and SR areas. This paper is a pioneer report of mite assemblages on A. fraxinifolium. Furthermore, we report here two genera and one species recorded for the first time in the Cerrado biome. Our checklist can contribute to bridging the knowledge gap on the occurrence of plant mite species in Brazilian natural vegetation remnants.",

    "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation produced by human impacts can generate changes in the distribution and abundance of populations across their geographic ranges. The chigger mites are ectoparasites that are widely distributed on a wide range of species. The distribution depends of the characteristics of the host and of the habitat where said species is found. As the host distribution is highly dependent on environmental factors, chigger mites are good study models to test geographical distribution patterns. The main objective of this study was to determine variation in abundance of Eutrombicula araucanensis, parasite on Liolaemus pictus, by testing three hypotheses: abundant centre hypothesis, abundance optimum hypothesis and latitudinal distribution pattern. For this purpose, mites from 147 individuals from 23 localities along the distribution of L. pictus were extracted. The three distribution models evaluated in the present study were not adequate to represent the geographical structure of parasitic mites on L. pictus. No association between the distance from the area of greatest species abundance and relative intensity, or association with the distance to the mite’s distribution centre was observed. In addition, no latitudinal distribution pattern was observed. Temperate forest fragmentation may influence the population density of mites, with each forest patch having different optimal conditions for development. The heterogeneity makes it difficult to find a clear distribution pattern.",

    "abstract": "The two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae is one of the most polyphagous and most damaging pests worldwide. The behaviour of the mite differs on its various host plants and this could influence crop defence strategies. We investigated the perception of leaf morphology by T. urticae in relation to the effects of visible light on the selection of sites on which females prefer to live and feed. Mite females chose the shaded surface when smooth and glabrous lemon leaves were offered as a surface for living and feeding, showing a photophobic behaviour. However, they clearly preferred the abaxial surface of bean leaves regardless of the presence or absence of visible light. As no differences were found regarding the food quality between the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces, mite behaviour seems to be related firstly to the perception of leaf morphology and secondly to visible light. As regards the first factor, T. urticae prefers the abaxial surface of leaves with a complicated architecture, i.e. veins in relief, on which they can easily build their dense web, and this factor has priority in comparison to the negative effect of the visible radiations. The second factor is important on smooth and glabrous leaves, these being unsuitable for building the complicated characteristic webs of T. urticae.",

Successful management of T. evansi in a given region benefits from information about its distribution, host plants, and associated natural enemies. Therefore, we investigated, in 2019 and 2020, the status of T. evansi on solanaceous plants in the Syrian coastal region, an important producer of solanaceous crops. A total of 237 samples were collected at 187 sites in Latakia and Tartus governorates. Tetranychus evansi was found in 34 cultivated and wild solanaceous plant samples collected at 29 sites distributed across all districts in those governorates, and in a variety of landscapes and elevations, ranging from the coastal plains to high altitudes in the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range. It was collected from three solanaceous crops, namely tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), as well as from two wild solanaceous plants: black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) and red nightshade (Solanum villosum Mill.). A total of 14 species of predatory insects and mites, and five species of phytophagous mites, were identified in association with T. evansi. Predatory insects were more frequent and abundant than predatory mites. The insect predator Feltiella acarisuga (Vallot) was the most common and abundant species among the predators, followed by Stethorus gilvifrons (Mulsant) and Scolothrips longicornis Priesner.

    "abstract": "The distinctive oribatid mite family Eulohmanniidae has been known almost exclusively from the type species of Eulohmannia, E. ribagai (Berlese, 1910), which is widely distributed in the northern Hemisphere where it inhabits fine humus, typically beneath forest litter and moss. We describe the morphological ontogeny of E. ribagai based primarily on material from New York—supported by specimens from Canada, Europe, and Asia—and correct errors in the literature. Ancillary biological notes relate to phenology, feeding biology, and reproduction; most important is the discovery of apparent sexual populations in the Pacific Northwest in this otherwise thelytokous (‘parthenogenetic’) species. Feeding seems to be preceded by secretion of a thick globule that captures food particles in the ventriculus, but this needs verification. Related nomenclatural actions include the clarification of purported synonyms and the proposal of species-rank for E. ribagai bifurcata Fujikawa. The latter was described as having several traits, including the purported presence of opisthonotal glands, that a study of type specimens show to reflect errors of observation or interpretation. A new diagnosis of Eulohmannia is informed also by preliminary observations on two as-yet undescribed species from Asia, one of which is apparently sexual, and the other paedomorphic in being monodactylous. We propose a new genus, Paedolohmannia n. gen., with P. metzi n. sp. as type, based on type material from Oregon, USA and additional material from California and Washington. The paraprocts of this species are formed by the adanal segment in all post-larval instars; it is only the second unequivocal example in Oribatida of the anal segment failing to appear during anamorphic development. This species also appears to be sexual, so it is unlikely that thelytoky was an ancestral trait of the family. Based on new information, the diagnosis for Eulohmanniidae is adjusted and expanded. Published inferences on the relationships of the family with other members of the paraphyletic infraorder Mixonomata, variously based on morphological and molecular methods, are reviewed and found inconsistent. While properly considered a relictual taxon, Eulohmanniidae is more diverse than previously thought, with the northeast Palaearctic and northwest Nearctic being regions especially deserving of more thorough sampling and genetic analysis.",

This approach allowed us to conclude that, despite such variations in a morphological key character, all the specimens observed belong to the same species.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the parasitic relationships of mites and ticks infesting lizards in Morocco and their determinant factors. A total of 1498 lizards representing 27 species, 8 families and 18 genera were randomly captured and examined in their natural habitats. The overall prevalence of ectoparasite infestation was 22.4%, with a mean intensity of 14.5 (95% CI: 12.2 – 16.8). Four families of Acari (Chelicerata) were identified: Ixodidae, Macronyssidae, Pterygosomatidae, and Trombiculidae, with eleven new host records and new data on geographical distributions. Trombiculid mites were the most prevalent (17.2%), followed by the Pterygosomatidae (4.1%), the Ixodidae (1.5%), and the Macronyssidae (0.4%). Nevertheless, Macronyssids showed the highest mean intensity 31.7 (14.3 – 54.2), followed by the Pterygosomatidae 22.0 (16.2 – 30.5), the Trombiculidae 12.7 (10.9 – 14.8), and the Ixodidae 1.7 (1.3 – 2.2). In total, nine species of parasites were found, and co-infestations were recorded on three lizard species. Ixodid prevalence and intensity were significantly related to altitude and host species, whereas Macronyssid prevalence and intensity were associated with host age and altitude. Ectoparasite intensity was associated with lizard sex for all mite families, with males carrying heavier loads than females, while prevalence was related to sex only for Pterygosomatid and Trombiculid mites. Season was important for Macronyssid and Trombiculid infestation intensity. Finally, host characteristics (species, size, age class), along with altitude, were determinant factors for infestation prevalence and intensities in Pterygosomatid and Trombiculid mites. The Ixodidae and Macronyssidae were mainly attached to the ventral side of hosts, whereas the Trombiculidae and Pterygosomatidae were attached to different parts of the host body with aggregations in skin folds. This updated information should prove useful for modeling biodiversity and predicting zoonotic disease outbreaks.",

Among the agriculturally important spider mite species, Tetranychus urticae Koch and Tetranychus macfarlanei Baker and Pritchard severely affect crop production and incur heavy yield loss in agriculture sector. As an ecofriendly pest management strategy, biocontrol using phytoseiid predatory mites are gaining significant attention over the past few decades. Evaluation of predatory potential and prey stage preference could provide invaluable information on the predatory efficiency of any predators. Feeding experiments were conducted using the phytoseiid predatory mite, Neoseiulus longispinosus (Evans) on mulberry leaf discs under the laboratory conditions of 30±2ºC, 70±5% Relative Humidity (RH) and a photoperiod of 11 L: 14 D h. After 24 hr of feeding experiment, the nymph and adult female predator exhibited a significant preference in feeding towards the eggs of T. urticae and T. macfarlanei. The larval stage of the predator was found to be non-feeding, thus excluded from the feeding experiment. The order of feeding preference of adult female predator towards different life stages of both the spider mite species were identified as egg&gt;nymph&gt;larva&gt;adult. On the contrary, the predatory nymphal stage exhibited different trend in feeding preference towards the life stages of T. urticae and could be recorded as egg&gt;larva&gt;nymph&gt;adult. For T. macfarlanei, the same could be found as egg&gt;larva=nymph&gt;adult. Surprisingly, irrespective of the life stage differences, N. longispinosus hardly consumed any of the T. macfarlanei adults.",

    "abstract": "The diverse biogeography of Chile provides it an ideal field to study the influence of environmental factors on plant and animal biodiversity. Some small animal species are distributed throughout dissimilar environmental zones, such as the biogeographic provinces, Mediterranean, Temperate Forest and Patagonia. One of these species is Oligoryzomys longicaudatus (Long-tailed pygmy rice rat), which is parasitized by mites of the genus Mysolaelaps (Fonseca, 1936). In this context, the present study describes the parasitic infestation rates of Mysolaelaps microspinosus on O. longicaudatus and evaluates its relationship with biotic factors (sex and host body mass) and abiotic factors (biogeographical province and season). Of 328 O. longicaudatus analyzed, 68 Mysolaelaps positive cases were obtained. Prevalence and mean abundance were 20.7% and 0.708, respectively. Multifactorial logistic and negative binomial regressions were performed to evaluate the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on prevalence and mean abundance. Both rates were significantly and directly related with biogeographic province and season, with higher rates in Mediterranean and Temperate Forest provinces and in winter and spring. The mean abundance had a significant direct relationship with host body mass, describing higher rates on heavier individuals. These results suggest that environmental factors such as temperature and food availability, strongly affect the ecology of M. microspinosus. Here we proposed that the southern limit for the genus in Chile is 47°S, mainly, due to colder temperatures. Also, biotic factors such as the weight of unpregnant hosts are relevant in parasite infestations, due to a greater parasitic load capacity by heavier individuals.",

    "abstract": "The development and life history parameters of Neoseiulus agrestis feeding on the storage mite, Thyreophagus sp., were studied at three different temperatures of 20, 25, and 30 °C. The results show that juvenile development and oviposition period as well as reproductive potential of this predatory mite are significantly affected by the temperature. The development times of immature and the life expectancy of adults ranged from 11.36 to 6.06 days and 58.71 to 38.65 days, respectively, depending on the temperature. The average total number of eggs laid per female at 20 °C (27.21), 25 °C (46.38), and 30 °C (61.12) differed significantly from each other. The highest net reproductive rate (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) was 51.95 (offspring/individual) at 30 °C, although there was no significant difference from that obtained at 25 °C (37.10). Furthermore, the highest intrinsic rate of increase (r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) is 0.286 day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30 °C. Moreover, the highest finite rate of increase (λ = 1.331 day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the shortest mean generation time (T = 13.786 days) and doubling time (DT = 2.418 days) were also determined at 30 °C. Our results indicate that N. agrestis successfully completed immature development and can survive and reproduce at all temperatures tested. However, a number of biological traits of this predator are affected by the temperature on this food source. Finally, a temperature of 30 °C seems to be more suitable for mass rearing of this predator on Thyreophagus sp. Further studies should be carried out to determine the biological characteristics and life cycle parameters of N. agrestis on various important pests such as spider mites, whiteflies and thrips.",

Numerical variations of leg setae and solenidia were studied in a population of Tetranychus urticae (White Eyes I strain) on adult and immature individuals as well as on pupae. Females had 131 leg phaneres on either side of the body, males had 5 more solenidia. On the whole, 35 phaneres were found variable in both sexes whereas 12 additionnal phaneres varied only among females and 35 others among males. Most phaneres showed little variation. By contrast, 10 setae and 4 male solenidia varied in more than 5% of individuals. Such frequent variations reveal a low ’priority’, i.e. an evolutionary trend for a complete suppression in the future. With few exceptions, measured Variations conform to the 3 models of regression described by Granjean (1954a): vertical, ascendant and descendant. Variations of many setae can be related to the model of descendant regression, and this is clearly unusual in Actinotrichida. Also uncommon were variations shown by some phaneres (e.g. the seta ev N1 in femur IV) since they can be related to two models, suggesting an inter-individual variability of regressive processes in the population studied. Departures in size and location were less frequent than numerical variations. However, to our knowledge, the left/right inconstancy of disjunctions or basculations we detected in some paired setae (e.g. the pair v - v’’ of tibia I) has never been reported in any other Actinotrichida.",

Based largely on observations of V. rubi, po st-deutonymphal instars of Vidia occur on the leaves that Megachile bees use for nest cell walls, where the mites presumably feed on fungi. They do not occur on the bees provision masses nor on the young bee larvae. The ontogeny of V. rubi is discussed in a phylogenetic context. The genus Vidia is redefined and its systematic position as sister-group to the remaining genera of the subfamily Ensliniellinae is hypothesized based on cladistic analysis.",

A control measure of one summer pesticide (abamectin) application seemed to be the most successful management of the harmful mites.

In Euryparasitus emarginatus (Gamasida), the broad stalk is composed of two cell types: central and parietal. The oocyte adheres to central cells via the micropylar orifice in the vitelline envelope. At the site of contact, numerous spherical protrusions of oocyte interdigitale with invaginations of the central cells. In Erythraeus pha/angoides (Actinedida) the oocytes are placed on distinct stalks composed of four cellular elements: ( 1) pear-shapec! main stalk cells which surround (2) the centrally running microtubule containing probably nutritive, protrusion (3) border cells which separate the stalk from the rest of ovary, and (4) scarce muscle cells twining around the stalk. Through the micropylar orifice passes a nutritive protrusion which connects oocyte with multinucleate nutritive cell embedded in the ovarian wall. In Hafenrefferia gi/vipes (Oribatida) only oogonia and previtellogenic oocytes possess microtubule-rich protrusions which join each other to form anucleate, microtubule-rich central mass. Possible functions of stalks and attachment sites are discussed.",

In the testes, the spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids as well as spermatozoa are distributed in a sequence from the dorsal to the ventral region. Primary spermatocytes show the presence of a peripheral spongy layer of cytoplasm formed by ER cisternae which grow into the cytoplasm during spermatocyte division to separate the newly formed spermatids. At the spermatid stage the chromatin condenses in a form of threads, cisternae of the spongy layer become electron-dense, anastomosing ER tubules appear in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria loose their normal structure and are transformed into double piles of mitochondrial derivatives. As spermiogenesis proceeds, the thickness of the chromatin threads increases and the ER tubules become electron-dense. Spermatozoa found in the male genital tract contain thick chromatin threads freely embedded in the cytoplasm, eltron-dense ER tubules, and mitochondrial derivatives,but are devoid of the acrosomal complex. Spermatozoa observed in the seminal receptacle of the female genital tract show similar structure but are less condensed, their mitochondria reveal a more typical structure and the cytoplasmic face of the plasmalemma is incrusted with regularly distributed filaments. Contact zones can be observed between the adjacent spermatozoa. Spermatozoa characterized by long cytoplasmic protrusions and different levels of electron density were found penetrating the ovarian somatic cells.",

Species of the atopomelid genera Lemuroptes Lawrence, Micropotamogalichus Fain, and Didelphoecius Fain were selected as close outgroups and Listrophorus leuckarti (Listrophoridae) was chosen as a distant outgroup. A single, most parsimonious cladogram was obtained (A. talpae (A. crocidurae (A. locusta (A. hylomys + A. priapus)))). Atopomelus species primarily parasitize Oriental insectivores, gymnures of the genus Hylomys (Erinaceidae) (3 mite species) and shrews of the genus Crocidura (Soricidae) (A. crocidurae). A single species, A. talpae is known from Talpa romana (Talpidae) in Italy. Plesiomorphic characters of this genus suggest that it is the ancestor of the clade was associated with the basal Eulipotyphla and hedgehogs as the earlier derivative of this host clade. The occurrence of A. talpae on T. romana is probably the result of an ancient host switch from gymnures inhabiting Europe in the Oligocene. The association between atopomelids and Oriental shrews is probably also secondary. Host switching of atopomelids onto Oriental Crocidura, probably happened with pioneering shrew species dispersing into this region from the Palaearctic.",

    "abstract": "Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) is a phytoseiid that can provide biological control of Tetranychus urticae Koch. The effectiveness of phytoseiids for biological control depends on different attributes including their ability to survive conditions of food shortage. Newly N. californicus copulated females were singly introduced into an arena for 10 days and were either provided with or deprived of food (all stages of T. urticae) during the first 48 or 96h. Food deprivation reduced adult survival (control: 100%, 48h: 83% and 96h: 62.5%) and the proportion of reproducing females, while the pre reproductive period increased with increasing starvation. The number of offspring produced by females of age x that effectively laid eggs after the periods of starvation was not significantly different from the control in all cases they levelled at approximately 2.9 eggs per reproducing female. Expressing the mean number of eggs laid per female in physiological age (days after starvation), differences were observed in the second and third days denoting the effect of starvation in the fecundity recovery period. The net reproduction rate during the first 10 days of adulthood was 18.22, 8.91 and 1.95 female eggs/female/10 days, for the control, the 48 and the 96h starvation treatments, respectively. The overall effect of food deprivation was mainly due to a reduction in adult survivorship and in the proportion of reproducing females. The negative effect on the net reproductive rate during the first 10 days of adulthood could reduce the capacity of N. californicus to prevent population increases of T. urticae in the short term. Notwithstanding, this effect would be mitigated because this predator is capable of feeding on alternate food sources such as pollen, different mites and insect eggs.",

They are unusually large, remarkably modified species both of which are restricted to the Meibomian ducts of their respective hasts, Carollia perspicillata and Molossus molossus. Both are also low grade pathogens subsisting primarily on epithelial cells of the ducts. The major adaptations are apparently primarily related, as holdfast mechanisms, for maintenance of position in ducts which are sluiceways for the Meibomian secretions. Both species also possess operculate ova, and larval egg teeth - the first report of such structures for the genus. The differences between the two species, such as larger girth and more prominent holdfast structures in D. molossi, are thought to be directly related to the difference in physical dimensions of the ducts of the two hosts, that of Molossus molossus being nearly two times the diameter of the Meibomian duct of Carollia perspicillata. Sorne information is also provided on the population structure of D. longissimus and D. molossi. The ratio of immatures to adults is very similar in both (3:2; 4:3) as is also the sex ratio (1:2 vs 2:3).",

The date palm pollen could be a suitable food source for the mass production of C. negevi.

Eggs of P. viburni are laid in round cavities excavated by the ovipositing female beetle and covered with a protective secretion. We document in this paper the mite fauna associated with P. viburni egg masses on Viburnum tinus in southern France. We then report the results of experiments investigating the seasonal patterns of mite infestation and the effects of the most common mite found within egg masses, Trichoribates trimaculatus (Oribatida: Ceratozetidae), on P. viburni egg survivorship. A diverse mite fauna of 18 species was found on V. tinus twigs, often living within P. viburni egg masses, including predaceous, phytophagous, and detritivorous species. Mite abundance and diversity were higher on Viburnum twigs containing at least one intact egg mass and were positively correlated with the number of intact egg masses per twig. Detritivorous mites were more abundant on twigs nine months after oviposition than one and four months after oviposition. Finally, we found no evidence that T. trimaculatus impacts P. viburni egg survivorship and overwintering success. These findings show that P. viburni egg masses and their associated cavities form a microhabitat favorable for the establishment of several mite species. It seems likely that these associations are cases of commensalism where mites benefit from the presence of food and shelter in these protected cavities, with no direct negative impact on P. viburni eggs.",

All markers were polymorphic, with limited evidence for deviations from linkage equilibrium. In accordance with previous markers developed for this species, we found large heterozygote deficits for six of the nine loci. Deficits were of the same order of magnitude within a tick infrapopulation, suggesting that population-level estimates were not due to a Wahlund effect among individual hosts, but more likely to technical problems (i.e., null alleles due to mutations in the flanking regions of the microsatellites). Although micro-geographic substructure (e.g., homogamy within infrapopulations) can not be ruled out, it is possible that null alleles could be an inherent problem associated with this tick species and specific genome-level studies are called for. Despite the possible presence of null alleles, the precision of population genetic estimates was improved by the addition of the newly-developed markers making them a useful addition for studying the population ecology of I. ricinus.",

However, only the first copulation results in fertilization when the interval between the first and second copulation is longer than 24 h. Therefore, such male copulation behaviour does not directly contribute to male fitness. A previous study examined indirect effects on male fitness, but no effect was detected. A proximate explanation for males attempting to copulate with mated females may be the inability of males to discriminate between females that have recently copulated and those that had copulated earlier. Thus, here I tested male preference for females that had copulated 30 h ago and those that had copulated 6 h ago under dual choice conditions. Males chose equally both types of females, which supports the proximate explanation of male discrimination inability. In conclusion, this study suggests that males attempt to copulate with mated females because they are unable to perceive female mating history.",

Recently, some halacarid specimens were extracted from sandy deposits of the banks of streams and creeks. These samples included four species, namely Limnohalacarus cultellatus Viets, 1940, Limnohalacarus novus Bartsch, 2013, Lobohalacarus weberi (Romijn and Viets, 1924), and a new species of the genus Ropohalacarus. The new species, Ropohalacarus pallidus n. sp., is described, and the characters of the other species are outlined. The three genera collected in Madagascar are cosmopolitan and the Lobohalacarus and Limnohalacarus species are wide-spread. The halacarid fauna of Madagascar seems to be poor in endemic species, which is contrary to the situation for the freshwater Hydrachnidia mites. Future studies will certainly increase the number of halacarid species but not the percentage of endemics.",

We briefly discuss the species validity of Achipteria nitens (Nicolet, 1855), as well as the generic placement of Parachipteria nivalis (Hammer, 1952) and P. bella (Sellnick, 1928). Furthermore, we present data on habitat ecology, distribution and diversity of all achipteriid species in various areas of Mongolia and the Russian Far East, and provide a key for the identification of hitherto recorded species in these regions. The majority of achipteriid species found in Mongolia and the Russian Far East are known to be widely distributed in the vast areas of the northern hemisphere. Only three species have restricted distributions in the Russian Far East, Siberia and Mongolia. Most species of Achipteriidae in Mongolia and the Russian Far East are inhabitants of the litter of various forests, soils of grasslands or mosses growing on rocks or on forest floor; only two species seem to be arboreal inhabitants.",

This study focuses on the spatial distribution of one of the largest taxa within the family: the sub-genus Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) currently comprising 322 species. It also provides a description of five discrete morphological characters used to discriminate between species and easily observed. This survey is the first analysis of the combined distribution of both species and associated morphological characters within the family Phytoseiidae. It reveals the great utility of taxonomic data compilation and associated databases for aspects beyong alpha-taxonomy. The highest number of species of Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) was reported from the East Palearctic region and the lowest from the Neotropical province. This was quite surprising as the highest species diversity of Phytoseiidae is reported from this latter region. Several hypotheses are discussed to explain this observation. In provinces showing the highest number of Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) species, we usually also observed the most diverse morphological forms for the five characters considered. High endemism levels were observed in all the provinces considered, even those where only few species were reported (especially the Neotropical province). Possible synonymies are thus discussed, as species could have been described more than once in different biogeographic provinces. Furthermore, some hypotheses are discussed to explain the high species and morphological diversity of the sub-genus Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) in theWest and East Palaearctic regions. Further phylogenetic analyses are required to test these different hypotheses.",

The study was carried out in two main polluted areas - one situated in Southern Romania (Cement Plant from Campulung Muscel - Arges County) and the other one in the North-East (the Tasca-Bicaz Cement Plant - Neamt County). Forest ecosystems located at different distances from the pollution sources were studied and the seasonal dynamics of both the gamasid fauna and community structures were monitored. The study focused on the suborder Gamasina Leach 1815, but the total abundance of the uropodids (Uropodina Kramer, 1882) was also considered. It was found that the percentage of Gamasina mites among all mites was higher in the control forests than in the polluted ecosystems, which was true for both polluted areas. Considering their ecological requirements, their habitat preference, vertical distribution in the soil, and seasonal population changes were investigated. In polluted biotopes, the Gamasina communities suffered from lower densities, fewer species and replacement of some species with others. The analysis of the Gamasina species distribution in the control and polluted ecosystems suggests that some species can be considered tolerant, such as certain representatives of Zerconidae, Parasitidae, Pachylaelapidae, Veigaiidae etc.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to carry out a large survey in order to characterize Phytoseiidae species diversity on cassava in Kenya. A total of 29 species from 10 genera were identified in diverse ecological zones in Kenya. The warm-to-hot low midlands of eastern and the warm-humid coastal strip yielded over 70 % of the species identified. The dominant species were Euseius fustis (Pritchard and Baker) and Typhlodromalus aripo De Leon present in 37 and 34 % of samples, respectively. Typhlodromalus aripo was found persistent in coastal, eastern and western regions of Kenya while E. fustis was present in all sampled localities of the country. In addition to morphological diagnosis, molecular sequences for DNA fragments 12S, CytB, COI and ITS, were obtained for T. aripo and E. fustis. Molecular diagnosis has revealed the unexpected presence of Neoseiulus idaeus Denmark and Muma and indicated its misidentification as Neoseiulus onzoi (Zannou, Moraes and Oliveira) in a previous survey carried out in Kenya. Molecular sequences herein obtained will help further diagnosis of phytoseiid species and complement the international reference databases needed to assist molecular identification of Phytoseiidae species.",

    "abstract": "Many pathogens, parasitoids and predators have been documented as natural enemies of ticks, but their impact on tick populations are rarely evaluated. Here, we report the predatory behaviour of ants on the spinose ear tick, Otobius megnini. Ticks were collected from the ear canal of stabled horses in Nuwara Eliya and were brought to the laboratory. Eggs, unfed and engorged larvae, engorged nymphs and adults were naturally exposed to ants under laboratory conditions and the predatory behaviour of the different species and their feeding preferences were observed. Five ant species were found feeding on different life stages of O. megnini including eggs, larvae (fed/unfed) and adults; ants did not feed on the nymphal stages. Ant species were identified as Tapinoma melanocephalum, two species of Monomorium, one species of Pheidole and one species of Crematogaster. The predatory preference differed among the five ant species, with T. melanocephalum being identified as the best predator as it fed on eggs and adults, the non-parasitic stages of O. megnini. Different strategies have been used to control the infestations of O. megnini in the stabled horses but none of them were successful. Although we cannot extrapolate our empirical findings to a natural context, observations suggest that these ant species may be potential bio-suppressors of this tick species.",

The two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae is one of the main pests affecting rose (Rosa spp.) cultures in Brazil. Chemical methods are used for its control, causing a significant environmental impact. Thus, this work aimed to study the predatory potential of N. californicus as an agent of biological control of T. urticae on roses. For the predatory capacity studies, 40 T. urticae mites /arenas of Jack bean leaves (Canavalia ensiformis) were offered to one specimen of each life stage of <I>N</I>. californicus. The adult females were the most efficient in preying upon immature stages, followed by nymphs. For the functional and numerical responses, adult females of N. californicus were confined to arenas made of Jack-bean leaves, and offered immature stages of T. urticae at the following densities: 0.14, 0.28, 0.70, 1.4, 2.8, 4.2, 4.9, 6.3, 7.7, 9.8, 14.1, 17.6 and 28.2 / cm2. The number of killed prey (functional response) and the number of eggs laid by the predator (numerical response) were assessed every 24 hours for 8 days. A type II functional response was inferred through a regression analysis. N. californicus preyed on a maximum of 60 pecimens of T. urticae per adult female per day.",

We found a wide range of sperm dimensions and nucleus lengths, but basic external and internal structures were substantially constant across genera. Spermatozoa are rod- or club-shaped cells with an elongated nucleus. The chromatin granules are focused in the middle zone of the nucleus. The cytoplasm around the nucleus and in the adjoining postnuclear region is filled with inclusion bodies with striated content (striated inclusion bodies, sIBs), whereas in the distant postnuclear region they are replaced by larger granular inclusion bodies (gIBs) usually containing a striated core surrounded by granular material. Mitochondria are distributed mostly subplasmalemmally in the nuclear region and between gIBs in the postnuclear region of the sperm cell. The most variable feature of the spermatozoa is the number of compound longitudinal ribbons of plasmalemmal origin alternating with subplasmalemmal cisterns: 9 (Leptogamasus anoxygenellus) to 21 (Pergamasus barbarus) in Pergamasinae and 5 (Parasitus berlesei and Paracarpais loricatus) to 30 (Paracarpais lunulata) in Parasitinae. In general, ribbons are electron-dense in the nuclear region but more lucent in the postnuclear region. The variation in sperm structure was not reflected in the taxonomic arrangement of genera and subfamilies within Parasitidae, but it must be emphasized that the taxonomy of Parasitidae is still awaiting a comprehensive modern revision.",

The larvae, which exclusively parasitize adults of Tipula spp., recognize and rest on the pupa. When the fly emerges from the pupa, the larvae transfer to the fly and begin to feed. The life-cycle of J. errans is usually semiunivoltine, some females may reproduce more than once. Females and the obligatory diapausing eggs are the usually hibernating instars.",

A more rapid reproduction of D. pteronyssinus on fibrous house-dust, as compared to rearing media consisting of non-fibrous fine particles, indicated that the mite prefers an aerated over a dense substrate. This was shown to be related to the antagonistic effects of the endemie mold, Aspergillus penicilloides, with which the mite establishes a symbiotic relationship. The fibrous component of the mattress microhabitat is a natural biotope for D. pteronyssinus. Deeper mattress fibres may provide a protective niche for mites during winter. They may also provide protection from other adverse environmental conditions.",

In both host species adult female ticks attach mainly in covered areas of the legs, especially in the axillae, where there is minimal disturbance with optimal feeding conditions. Adult female density is very low and nonfeeding adult males may have to wait a long time before locating a mate. During this phase the males attach on the host in places where they are protected but can also receive female pheromone signais, eg. in nasal cavities and around the cloacal orifice. Compared with inactive males few adult males in the activity phase of mate searching were found . The immature stages appear to choose those sites which provide optimal feeding with. minimal disturbance. The nymphs are found mainly on the legs and axillae while larvae attach preferentially on the lateral body sites and on the neck, where they are protected under the posterior edges of scales. It is proposed that the most likely reason for change of attachment site in the stages of the tick is interstadial competition. This mechanism seems to be long established in evolutionary terms, because the stages attach on the preferred sites when other stages are absent, or infestation rate is very low.",

Mites were present in all of the poultry houses surveyed; in 92 % of dust samples and in 90 % of soil samples. More than 30 species were identified; as many as 796 mites per 100 mg of dust and 840 mites per 100 mg of soil were count_ed. In dust samples, the most prevalent species were Dermatophagoides evansi (74.4 %) and Acarus immobilis (5.6 %); and in soil samples: A. immobilis (40.9 %), D. evansi (11.4 %) and Hughesiella africana (9.2 %). The mite population in dust and soil samples was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in September. Significantly higher (p < 0.01) mite counts were noted in dust samples from the hottest and most arid region of the country. Great variation was noted in the number of mites in samples from the same climatic zone. Seventy-two percent of the pou\try farms reported the occurrence of workplace-related respiratory disease.",

The predatory mites Amblyseius andersoni, Euseius finlandicus and Typhlodromus pyri constitute the most important species among the twelve phytoseiid mites collected. A. andersoni is the dominant species in the lowland orchard of Agia, E. finlandicus in the highland orchards of Zagora and Anilio, where, with Typhlodromus pyri, they are the most important predators while in the orchard in the Farma plateau, the populations of E. finlandicus alternate with those of A. andersoni. These wer followed by N.californicus in Agia, Phytoseius macropilis in Farma and Typhlodromus cotoneastri in the orchards of Zagora and Anilio. Their relative population densities reached low levels, while the remaining species that were collected could be considered as sporadic or occasional. Four phytophagous species were found: Panonychus ulmi, Tetranychus urticae, Amphitetranychus viennensis (Tetranychus viennensis) and Aculus schlechtendali. Their presence varied between regions, sometimes showing high population densities and causing economic damage to apple orchards in Central Greece. The population levels of A. andersoni, E. finlandicus and T. pyri reached peak values during the months of summer (July and August) in the respective regions where they were present. The tolerance of their populations to treatments with fungicides (especially sulfur, copper compounds, pyrimidines and triazoles) and selective insecticides, observed during the three-year survey, is probably due to the development of tolerant strains.",

Holothyrina is regarded as a suborder of Anactinotrichida, together with Gamasina and Ixodina. All similarities between Holothyrina and the order Opilioacarida are regarded as plesiomorphic. Holothyridae is regarded to consist of three genera: HolothyrusGervais, 1842 (typespecies H. coccinella Gervais, 1842), Hammenius n. gen. (type-species H. Jujuge n. sp.), and Thonius n. gen. (type-species Holothyrus longipes Thorell, 1882). Hammen ius ingii n. sp. is also described. Both Hammenius and Thonius are distributed from Seychelle Islands to New Guinea, but Holothyrus is restricted to Mauritius.",

The morphology of each species was studied, and each species was classified in agreement with the systematic view expressed by Lindquist (1986). The study involved the collection of twelve species, eleven of which belonged to the subfamily Tarsoneminae and to the tribe Tarsonemini. Of the collected Tarsonemini species, nine species were assigned to the genus Tarsonemus and to the subgenus Tarsonemus (T. smithi, T. aurantii, T. confusus, T. parawaitei, T. waitei, T. floricolus, T. idaeus, T. bilobatus and T. lobosus), one to the genus Daidalotarsonemus (D. vandevrieri), and one to the genus Fungitarsonemus (F. monasterii). The only Pseudotarsonemoidine was assigned to genus Polyphagotarsonemus (P. latus). The given list of Tarsonemini does not include T. bakeri and T. unguis, since the authors subsequently verified that the specimens identified as T. bakeri belonged to T.waitei and the ones identified as T. unguis were T. floricolus. Four new records (T. floricolus, T. idaeus, T. bilobatus and T. lobosus) on citrus in Italy are recorded.",

The anatomy and fine structure of the male genital systems are described and are shown to exhibit the organisation considered to be fundamental in Actinotrichida: paired testes with germinal and glandular parts, paired vasa deferentia, unpaired ejaculatory duct, progenital chamber containing genital papillae. The genital system is located ventral of the digestive tract. The testes produce relatively few or even very few aflagellate sperm cells, which represent synspermia consisting of likely four undivided sperm cell equivalents in a common cytoplasm. Whereas S. delamarei produces a rather large stalked spermatophore containing many synspermia, both the other species produce very tiny stalked spermatophores with a spherical head representing only one synspermium. Thus, in these latter species only one synspermium is transferred to the female at a time, but the male can convey several (possibly five or more) spermatophores to the female during the mating session. A scenario is suggested which could describe the evolution of this remarkable mating system and behaviour.",

Infested plants develop cauliflower-like galls on the inflorescence and leaves deforming the reproductive structures and inhibiting seed production. The potential reduction in seed set suggests that this mite could constitute a potential biological control agent against this noxious weed. To investigate intraspecific variability between A. alhagi n. sp. populations from Iran, Turkey and Armenia, we analysed molecular sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (mtCOI). These results indicated that there are no significant intraspecific divergences among populations of A.alhagi n. sp. from the five different localities in three West Asia countries.

The prevalence of G. pelaezi, G. texana, and E. alfreddugesi was relatively high (&gt;70%) and statistically different from that of O. talaje (&lt;20%). Abundances of G. pelaezi and E. alfreddugesi were higher than in O. talaje and G. texana, and the latter species showed the lowest mean intensity. Further investigations are necessary to verify these differences and reveal their causes.",

Because brownfields are subject to rapid development in urban areas, their biological communities, including soil mesofauna, are overlooked and seldom researched, even though they could provide valuable insight into the ecological functioning of these areas. This exploratory study describes the community characteristics of oribatid mite fauna of 12 brownfields in Tallinn, Estonia, and analyzes the potential of oribatid mites as bioindicators of brownfield successional stage. This study provides the first faunistic list of oribatid mites from the brownfields of Tallinn. No significant changes in species abundance or richness depending on the successional stage were discovered. While some changes in community structure were noted, due to low overall abundance, no clear indicators of brownfield successional stage were identified. For future research on urban brownfield oribatid fauna with the intention of finding potential bioindicators of brownfield properties, increasing the sampling size and inclusion of other groups of soil mesofauna is recommended.",

Following a survey of the classification history of the genus, emphasizing the changes that occurred in the morphological characters used in its definition, we briefly discuss their relative importance for the genus delimitation. As a result, we provide amended diagnoses for the genera Pseudobryobia and Bryobia and transfer 7 species from Pseudobryobia to Bryobia. Species belonging to the genus Pseudobryobia bear two setae on coxisternal plate II, one pair of tenent hairs on all the empodia and are distributed in the Nearctic biogeographic zone. Conversely, some species previously assigned to the genus Pseudobryobia bear one seta on coxisternal plate II, two rows of tenent hairs on empodia II-IV, and are recorded in the Palearctic and Afrotropical biogeographic zones. These species are transferred to the genus Bryobia. The following nomenclature changes resulting from the revision are proposed: B. (Bryobiopsis) abbatielloi new combination, B. (B.) anacantha reinstated combination, B. (Allobia) bucharica reinstated combination, B. (B.) eurotiae reinstated combination, B. (A.) japonica reinstated combination, B. (B.) neoephedrae new combination, B. (A.) nikitensis reinstated combination. We recognise six subgenera for Bryobia, as previously considered by other authors, and also treat Nuciforaella Vacante (1983) as a junior synonym of Bryobia (Allobia) Livshits and Mitrofanov, 1971. A key to the species of Pseudobryobia is also provided.",

In total 16,062 adult individuals from 30 families representing 81 species of mite (and 1 incertae sedis). Among them, 95% were obtained from leaves, with the Mesostigmata contributing 23 species and 1,805 specimens. The phytoseiid mites were the most abundant, with 1,793 specimens. Seventeen families of Prostigmatid mites were recorded, represented by 48 species and 12,485 individuals. On fruits, the Mesostigmatid mites included three families and eight species. The Prostigmatid mites included nine families and 18 species, totalling 852 individuals. Brevipalpus sp. was the most abundant and frequent species, representing approximately 92% of the Prostigmatid mites.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyse selected factors determining the level of infestation of Ixodes ricinus ticks on Lacerta agilis and Zootoca vivipara lizards found in Central Europe. Both environmental factors (habitats within protected areas and areas transformed as a result of human activity) as well as morphological factors (age, sex and size of lizards, location of ticks on the lizard’s body) were assessed. We found that the age and size of a lizard played a significant role in the level of infestation, but this depended on the species and habitat. Females of both species differed significantly in their level of tick infestation; females of L. agilis had lower infection than Z. vivipara. In contrast, there was no difference in levels of infection between juveniles and males of the different species. We also found that the impact of body size changed in the different habitats: the number of ticks increased with body size in natural areas only. In addition, more frequently ticks were found in the front groin area (336 individuals) and forelimbs (202), less often on the neck (12) and never in the hind groin area. These differences might be because it is easier to infest a larger individual than a smaller one, and areas of the front of the lizard might be more accessible whilst foraging. This study provides additional information about tick infestation that may be relevant to the conservation of the species of lizards.",

    "abstract": "This study was done to investigate the relationship between the reproductive potential of oribatid mites (estimated by egg number) and their population density in different orchard habitats. We hypothesized that species with narrow feeding niches would be more susceptible to intraspecific competition and would show a decrease in egg number with increasing density, while general feeders would show egg numbers independent of density. To investigate these predictions, soils were sampled four times a year in orange, mango and date palm orchards at each of three sites in Al-Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. The number of mites extracted, the total number of eggs contained in their bodies and the gut contents were evaluated. The results show a significant difference between species in the way egg number varies with density. In Scheloribates laevigatus, a positive correlation between population density and egg number per individual is present. For Xylobates lophotrichus, however, a negative correlation was observed, while in the case of Zygoribatula undulata, no significant correlation between population density and egg number could be demonstrated. Gut contents showed that S. laevigatus has the widest trophic breadth, while X. lophotrichus is the most specialized feeder. We argue that the relationship between egg number and population density is shaped by differences in feeding habits: a specialized feeding habit is associated with a negative relationship between egg number and population density, whereas a broad trophic niche seems to be associated with a positive relationship between egg number and population density. This suggests that feeding habits have important population dynamic consequences in these soil-living invertebrates.",

The development from larva to adult, skipping the facultative deutonymphal stage, takes about 6 days at an average temperature of 24°C (room temperature). Adults show a sex ratio of 1 : 2.6 in favor of females. Deutonymphs have a partially reduced sucker plate, apparently dispersing through ambulatory activity rather than phoresy. Precopulatory mate guarding occurs many hours before tritonymphs enter quiescence. During mate guarding, males rest motionlessly on the tritonymphal dorsum, but are not unable to move meanwhile. Legs I are conspicuously thick and serve as ‘safeguard holder’ while legs II are used to fight against male competitors and to hold on to the female regardless of environmental disturbances.

    "abstract": "Precopulatory guarding of tritonymphal females by adult males is common in feather mites (Acari: Astigmata). Within the Proctophyllodidae (Astigmata: Analgoidea), some genera possess morphological features in both sexes that have been suggested to enhance male attachment. One such structure in tritonymphal females is the development of a pair of fleshy lobe-like docking papillae, while males possess a pair of ventral adanal suckers that are proposed to fit over top of these projections. To determine whether these structures are strongly correlated in size, we measured the dimensions of the male adanal suckers and tritonymphal female docking papillae in three genera of mites: Neodectes spp. Park and Atyeo, 1971, Proterothrix spp. Gaud, 1968 (Proctophyllodidae: Pterodectinae), and Proctophyllodes spp. Robin, 1877 (Proctophyllodidae: Proctophyllodinae). We looked for correlations in these measurements as an indication of selective cooperation. Our results did not reveal strong positive correlations between the dimensions of these structures in tritonymphal females and adult males. We propose several reasons for why we may not have detected strong evidence of a good fit between anal suckers and tritonymphal papillae that are related to the biology of feather mites, and suggest steps to expand on this research in future.",

Instead, based on ontogeny of the peculiar palpal structure and chaetome of labidostommatids, a case is made that the proximal segment, which bears a single, ventral, postlarval seta, is a basifemur, with the trochanter autapomorphically either coalesced with it or subsumed into the base. Consequently, the second segment is a telofemur, articulating with the third article, which is an unusual, coalescent genuotibia. The phylogenetic significance of various interpretations of segmental coalescence are considered. Ontogenetic studies of palpal musculature and gene expression are needed to provide more substantive evidence.",

    "abstract": "The coconut mite, Aceria guerreronis Keifer, is one of the main pests of the coconut tree (Cocos nucifera L.) worldwide. Its control is mainly based on the use of acaricides. However, due to the habitat of this pest mite, which is protected by fruit bracts that act as a physical barrier, chemical control is often inefficient. Thus, natural enemies have been studied as an alternative to acaricides. We evaluated the functional and numerical responses of Amblyseius aerialis (Muma) to increasing densities of A. guerreronis (40, 80, 160, 240 and 360) and additionally the oviposition rates of the phytoseiid A. aerialis over 11 days on different food sources: coconut pollen, A. guerreronis and a mix of pollen and A. guerreronis. Our results showed that Amblyseius aerialis showed a type III functional response, where prey consumption increasing as the density of A. guerreronis increased, with a maximum consumption of up to 175 prey per predator. All the prey densities allowed female oviposition. The number of eggs laid by A. aerialis increased with increasing prey density and stabilized between 240 and 360 A. guerreronis individuals, with an average oviposition of 1.7 eggs/female. Furthermore, our results showed that all the food sources (coconut pollen, A. guerreronis and a mix of pollen and A. guerreronis) supported oviposition. The mean oviposition was approximately 1.5 eggs/female on all the food sources. Our study suggests that A. aerialis can be effective in the biological control of A. guerreronis. However, further studies are needed to investigate whether A. aerialis can explore the habitat of A. guerreronis and if that prey can support the development of immature stages and the reproduction of A. aerialis.",

Samples were taken from five mango orchards with different cultivars during four seasons through the year 2020–2021. Different parts of the mango trees such as leaves, raceme, buds as well as underneath the trees were sampled at fortnightly intervals. In total, 17 species representing 16 genera and 12 families with different feeding habits were collected and identified during the study. The relationship between predacious and plant feeding mites in this agriculture eco-system was discussed. Family Phytoseiidae represented the largest diversity of mites reported herein, with four species records. We anticipate that the results reported in the current study may encourage the establishment of control programs for plant-feeding mites using phytoseiid mites. Different oils and pesticides and their combinations were used to control the eriophyid mite, Cisaberoptus kenyae Keifer on mango leaves “Ewais” cultivar. The lethal concentrations were 2, 1, and 0.5%. The results showed that the most effective compound was mineral oil and spirodiclofen and the essential oil, Thymus vulgaris L. This is the first reported study demonstrating the control of C. kenyae using combinations of different oils, and a pesticide on mango leaves. These results can be used in future biological pest control programs.",

    "abstract": "Heterostigmatic mites (Acari: Trombidiformes: Prostigmata) are usually associated with arthropods, especially insects, and poorly studied in Iran. As a result of a study of beetle-associated heterostigmatic mites carried out in western Mazandaran Province, northern Iran, during spring and winter 2013, a total of 14 species and 11 genera of eight families were identified. Among them Spatulaphorus vladimiri Khaustov, 2005 (Pygmephoridae), Archidispus conspicuus Kurosa, 1978; A. bembidii (Karafiat, 1959), A. armatus (Karafiat, 1959) (Scutacaridae), and Eutarsopolipus steveni Khaustov, 2010 (Podapolipidae) are new records for mite fauna of Iran. The latter is also new for Asia. Eight new beetle host records are documented and the world distribution of the mites is reviewed. Moreover, beetles of the subfamily Cicindelinae (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are recorded for the first time as hosts of Caraboacarid mites.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of long-term negative effects of insecticides on the target and non-target insects can help assess the toxicity and side-effects of pesticides. In this study, the sublethal effects of a low concentration of spiromesifen (LC&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;) on life-history traits of T. urticae and its phytoseiid predator N. californicus were estimated for two successive generations (F0 and F1). According to the results, adult longevity, oviposition days, fecundity, and life table parameters (r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and T) exhibited significant negative impacts at LC&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; compared to the control. Meanwhile, significant effects of the LC&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; were found on most parameters of the life table (longevity, fecundity, oviposition days) of N. californicus. Also, spiromesifen had significant negative effects on the population parameters except for the net reproductive rate (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) in N. californicus. On the other hand, the parameters of the consumption rate (finite predation rate (ω), stable consumption rate (ψ), and net consumption rate (C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)) in this predator exhibited significant negative impacts. Therefore, the results suggested that spiromesifen effectively controls the successive generation of T. urticae. Also, this compound adversely affected most parameters of N. califonicus, so it is inappropriate for IPM applications in the presence of this parasitoid.",

    "abstract": "The Texas citrus mite, Eutetranychus banksi (McGregor) (Acari: Tetranychidae), is a citrus pest widely distributed throughout the Americas and recently introduced in Spain. In this study we studied the within-tree distribution of E. banksi and the predatory phytoseiid mites, identify the phytoseiid species associated with the pest, and describe the seasonal trends to analyse the predator’s behaviour in response to the increase in pest density, allowing evaluation of biological control possibilities. The Texas citrus mite was mainly found on the adaxial (upper) side of leaves from the current year's shoots located at the periphery of the tree canopy, whereas phytoseiids prefer the abaxial (lower) side of leaves inside the tree canopy. The spider mite preferred to feed on leaves rather than fruits, whereas phytoseiids use both substrates equally. Eutetranychus banksi showed a single population peak in late summer-early autumn, while phytoseiids showed two peaks, a main spring peak and a second less abundant in autumn. The seasonal dynamics of E. banksi and phytoseiids on fruits occurred in parallel to those recorded on leaves. Euseius stipulatus (Athias-Henriot) was the most frequent and abundant phytoseiid species, apparently displacing other predatory mites. In autumn, when E. banksi reached high densities, phytoseiids moved from the leaf abaxial sides inside the tree canopy to the adaxial sides on the periphery and to the fruits, to feed on E. banksi. In addition, a change in phytoseiid colouration from white to reddish-brown was observed. Both, the number of red phytoseiids and their leaf occupation increased significantly in response to the prey population growth, which was indirect evidence of their contribution to the biological pest control. However, the low predator:prey ratios observed cannot avoid the pest population growth.",

Mites of this genus live inside fallen tree trunks and have been only occasionally collected. However, it is increasingly likely that these mites are more widespread than previously believed. The single described species, Fagacarus verrucosus, is known from the USA (Indiana and Michigan); two undescribed species were reported from North America (Colorado) and the Western and Eastern Palearctic.

    "abstract": "Micromegistus bakeri is a purported commensal mite that spends most of its life on the ground beetle Scarites subterraneus. It is thought to sustain itself by feeding on the beetle’s dermal fluids and opportunistically scavenging on nearby organic debris, although the nature of this relationship, and whether it’s beneficial, detrimental or neutral to the host, is unclear. This species has previously been recorded in Mississippi, Texas, and Kansas. This study reports the first record of M. bakeri in Pennsylvania based on our collecting, as well as the first records for Ohio, Michigan, Missouri, Arizona, and Canada, based on previously unpublished museum records. The literature and our own survey of carabid beetles indicate that M. bakeri has a strong preference for S. subterraneus as a host and is not common on other carabids. Our own data shows a prevalence of 27% of S. subterraneus (10 out of 37) carrying M. bakeri, with an average of 3.1 (range 1–8) mites per infested beetle; none of the other 31 carabid species collected during this study carried M. bakeri. This study represents the first publicly available COI barcode sequence for this taxon. We also provide photographs of live mites and summarize suspected sightings from additional locations across North America obtained via the citizen science websites BugGuide and iNaturalist. These records indicate that M. bakeri is present throughout the known distribution of its beetle host. Suspected M. bakeri were observed on other Scarites species in North America, but their presence on these hosts needs to be confirmed via examination of physical specimens. It should be noted that the westernmost record for the species is in Arizona, based on a male specimen that exhibits 6.6% divergence in COI barcode sequence with specimens from Pennsylvania. The specimen is otherwise essentially morphologically identical to males of eastern USA, and it is therefore uncertain whether it represents a cryptic species or merely high intraspecific genetic divergence over a large geographic distance.",

    "abstract": "Water mites are the most ubiquitous, abundant, diverse, and ecologically important group of arachnids in all freshwater environments. In Mexico, despite being a megadiverse country, only 271 species have been recorded so far since 1873. This is probably due to the scarcity of taxonomists in the country or the inherent complex morphology of this group, which challenges its systematics and its integration into other research studies. Molecular identification has been highly useful for practical applications of these organisms, while taxonomic identification work continues. Until now, a species checklist and reference information about water mites diversity and distribution in Mexico is lacking. In this work, we compiled species described or recorded in Mexico and provided preliminary data for a COI barcode library of the water mites in the country. This checklist includes 271 species from 25 families and 61 genera. In addition, the COI barcode library is supplied in a public dataset from the BOLD database (boldsystems.org); it contains 794 sequences corresponding to 103 BINs or putative species, of which only five of them have been identified to the species. We predict that the discovery of hidden diversity of mites will continue and improve after the use of integrative taxonomy tools. Also, their value as indicators of water quality will be re-evaluated, helping in the conservation of freshwater environments and the evaluation of the global warming impact.",

The purposes of this study were to determine the within-plant distribution and to develop a sampling technique for SRM. The study was carried out in sugarcane fields naturally infested with the mite population. The mite distribution was identified with the visual direct counting technique and the imprinting technique. Subsequently, the effectiveness and reliability of both techniques were evaluated. The results showed that the within-plant distribution of mite populations was more concentrated in the middle canopy than in the upper or lower canopies. Furthermore, the mite sampling of the middle portion of the leaf could represent the entire mite population on the plant. More importantly, the imprinting technique was reliable, especially when the third or fourth (+3 or +4) fully expanded leaf was taken as sample, resulting in relative variation (RV) as low as 12.9% and 12.4%, respectively; therefore, the imprinting technique is a promising technique for population monitoring programs.",

    "abstract": "The predatory mite Phytoseius plumifer (Canestrini and Fanzago) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is an effective predator of phytophagous mites in several countries worldwide. Plant pollen is an important alternative food for generalist predatory mites, ensuring survival and fostering population growth during periods of prey scarcity. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of a diet of a natural prey, Oligonychus afrasiaticus (McGregor 1939) (Acari: Tetranychidae), and a diet of pollens, e.g. corn pollen or date palm pollen, on P. plumifer life table parameters under laboratory conditions. The total developmental time was significantly shorter for P. plumifer females fed on O. afrasiaticus than corn or date palm pollen. However, diet type did not affect P. plumifer survival rate. Survivorship during immature development varied from 96 to 99% on the three tested diets. Adult females that fed on O. afrasiaticus lived longer, produced more eggs, and had longer oviposition periods. The highest mean of daily oviposition of P. plumifer was recorded when predator was fed on O. afrasiaticus 2.26 eggs/♀/day, while the lowest mean of daily oviposition was recorded when predator was fed with corn pollen 1.53 eggs/♀/day. The average number of preys consumed daily by the protonymphs, deutonymphs and adult female individuals was 8.09, 11.20 and 18.18, respectively. Throughout the whole life-span P. plumifer female fed on an average of 739.26 prey, of these more than 96% were consumed during the adult stage. The highest intrinsic rate of increase (r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;), net reproduction rate (R&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) and finite rate of increase (λ) were recorded when predator fed on O. afrasiaticus. Mean generation time (T) was shorter for P. plumifer fed on O. afrasiaticus than date palm pollen or corn pollen. Based on the findings, in the scarcity or absence of the main prey in the environment, the date palm pollen or corn pollen can be suggested as an alternative or supplementary food for P. plumifer. Also, the predatory mite, P. plumifer has good potential to suppress O. afrasiaticus populations and can be used in the biological control strategies against this pest.",

Türkiye is one of the countries that started kiwi cultivation late. However, with the increase in newly established and productive gardens, it is among the most important countries in the world for kiwi production. The study was carried out to determine leaf-inhabiting mite species in kiwi vines in Türkiye from 2018 to 2022. Surveys were conducted in seven sampling areas in the Ordu, Black Sea Region, Türkiye where the kiwi is cultivated. Leaf samples were collected at 10–15-day intervals from June to November each sampling year. The number of sampled plants per site was determined according to the total number of plants in each kiwi vine. Approximately, 20 leaves from each plant were collected on each sampling date. A total of 24 mite species belonging to 2 orders, 8 families and 15 genera including Phytoseiidae (10 species), Tydeidae (5), Tenuipalpidae (3), Tarsonemidae (2), Cheyletidae (1), Iolinidae (1), Stigmaeidae (1) and Tetranychidae (1) were identified during the study, The results revealed that Ordu's kiwifruit vines are highly abundant in beneficial mite species. The limited use of pesticides in the area may account for this.",

The population consisted mainly of the species E. stipulatus (more than 80%). The population of E. stipulatus showed peaks in June-July for the regions of Aegeon and Preveza and in August for the region of Sparti. It did not exhibit the phenomenon of diapause and all of its developmental stages were represented during the winter. In Aegeon and Sparti the second most frequent species was T. amaliae, with 11% and 6% respectively, but in Preveza it was T. athenas, with 9% frequency. The other species could be considered as scarce. One species of phytophagous mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, was found. It did not cause extensive damage, since its populations reached a maximum level of 4 mites per leaf.",

In order to localize the tick populations, the area of Marseille was first divided into 11 zones according to the various types of buildings (fields use, forests, waste lands, gardens). The 300 dogs were examined from five veterinarian practices. The ticks were picked up, identified, and the owners questionned about the annualleve1 of infestation of the dog by ticks. On the other hand, R. turanicus was investigated in the same zones by the flagging method. The main results of this study are: - R. sanguineus (s., str.) has a very large distribution in the various type of urban development. Dense centers of housing are however much less favourable for the tick than scattered ones. In the favourable zones, the different types of habitats are not equally propitious for the species. Houses with gardens are the most suitable biotopes. The environment of large buildings is less propitious. The other ticks of the sanguineus complex (R. turanicus, R. pusillus) are rather scarce and more usually found in the outskirts of the town. The large increase of the suitable habitat (houses with gardens) in the outskirts of Marseille could be a reason for the increasing incidence of Mediterranean spotted Fever in the town.",

The population dynamics of E. finlandicus, T. pyri and A. andersoni were studied. E. finlandicus and T. pyri were observed on the hedge plants Rubus fruticosus, Rubus sp., Castanea sativa, Juglans regia, Cornus sanguinea, Prunus avium and Sambucus nigra while A. andersoni was found mainly on herbaceous plants.

A previous interpretation, that the third opisthosornal dorsal plate EF in postlarval instars of tarsocheylids is compounded from the tergites of two segments, is confirmed by the component plates E and F remaining separate in the larva. Observations on the ontogeny of various structures, particularly on the changes between larva, protonymph, and deutonymph, treat the opisthosomal dorsum and caudal bend, the proral and tectal setae of tarsi I to IV, and the denudation of setae on leg IV of the protonymph.

The procedures described by FILIPPONanId co-workers in similar studies were used in the present experiments, in order to compare their results to those obtained with macrochelid mites that feed on Madsca domestica eggs. The innate capacity for increase of M . subbadizbs was evaluated by calculating r, or its antilog Rm (finite rate of increase), which indicates how many times the population will multiply in one day. Not all the temperatures at which the species can multiply were considered, but only those within the optimal range. This was determined by preliminary stuhes in which two population attributes were considered; the rate of oviposition (Table I) and the duration of preimaginal development (Table 11), both within the 10-400C range. The results indicated a provisional optimal range of 25-33°C, and the tests were conducted at 25, 27, 29, 31, and 330C. Cohorts of 16 females, each composed of two subsamples of 8 each (corresponding to two laboratory cultures of the same field strain) were tested for net fecundity (adult progeny per female), adult female longevity, and fertility rate (adult progeny per female per day) at each of these temperatures. Analysis of variance of the data (Table IV) showed that each of the three population attributes reacted differently to temperature (first value of F), while the two subsamples and the interaction among females (second and third values of F) were not modified. As there were no differences due to subsampling, the data were cumulated, and a comparison of the means (Table V) showed that the maximum net fecundity occurred at 27OC, that the adult female longevity was influenced by temperature (only at 27 and 2gOC was there no apparent influence on longevity, in that the comparison revealed no statistically significant differences), and that the optimal range for the fertilitv rate was 27,- za,oC . In the 25-33OC range the minimum duration of preimaginal development occurred at 31OC for both females and males (Table VI), and analysis of variance (Table VII) showed that males complete their preimaginal development more rapidly than females. To compile the life and fertility tables, and therefore to estimate Rm, the sex ratio had to be determined, nsince this is an arrhenotokous species. By cumulating all the progeny data (Table VIII), the mean sex ratio, expressed as female probability, was found to be 0.449 at 270C. On the basis of these data, the life and fertility table (Table IX) were compiled, and the parameters regarding the capacity for increase (r,; Rm; R, = rate of multiplication per generation; T = mean length of a generation) were defined. In terms of R,, a population of M. subbadius can multiply 1.97 times per day at 2s0C; 2.24 at 270C; 2.37 at 290C; 2.41 at 31OC; and 2.04 at 33%. The values of R, of other macrochelid mites studied bv the same ex~erimenta~l roceduresa nd of U. Musca domestica, the natural food source of these mites, are: for Macrocheles robustulus, 1.96 at 250C; 2.05 at 270C; and 2.03 at 290C: for M. ~eniculatus1, .65 at 240C; 1.76 a t 260C; and 1.70 at 280C: for M. penicilliger, 1-34 at 220C; 1.38 at 240C; and 1.32 at 260C; for M. muscaedomesticae, 2.17 at 280C; 2.47 at 30°C; 2.31 at 32°C; and 2.08 at 34°C: for M. matrius, 1.71 at 24°C; 1.92 at 26°C; 2.10 at 280C; 2.15 at 300C; 2.20 at 320C; 2.25 at 340~; and 1.50 at 360C: for~~usdcoam estica, 1.17 at 240C; 1.45 a t 280C; 1.41 at 32OC; and 1.37 at 360C.",

It consists of an introduction to the classification, the morphological terminology, the ontogeny, and the evolution of mites. The following classification is introduced here. Subclass: Acarida. Superorders: Anactinotrichida and Actinotrichida. Orders: Opilioacarida, Holothyrida, Gamasida, Ixodida (Anactinotrichida); Actinedida (= Trombidiformes), Oribatida, Acaridida (Actinotrichida). The ending ina is proposed for the suborders (Gamasina, Liroaspina, Uropodina, Antennophorina; Argasina, Ixodina; etc.). A survey is given of the main characters seperating the two superorders. The introduction to the general morphology deals with soma-terminology, segmentation of the body, gnathosoma, segmentation and articulation of the appendages, and general chaetotaxy. The terms gnathosoma, idiosoma, prosoma, opisthosoma, and podosoma (although dorsally ill-defiued) are accepted here; the terms proterosoma, propodosoma, metapodosoma, and hysterosoma are dissuaded; stethosoma ( = prosoma without gnathosoma) is introduced as a new term. Directions are given for the orientation of figured structures; a general use of the same series of abbreviations is recommended. A general nomenclature for the postembryonic ontogeny, including a clear distinction between stase and stage is also recommended. The study of evolution by comparison of ontogenies is briefly explained. Attention is drawn to the value of the investigation of the phylogeny of characters and the reconstruction of archetypes for the creation of a natural classification.",

They are Labidophorus soricis Oudemans, I9I5, primarily of Cryptotis parva, Dermacarus hypudaei Koch, I84I, abundant on Zapodids but also found on other small mammals, Dermacarus heptneri Zachvatkin, I94I found on Mus musculus, and Dermacarus ondatrae sp. n. found on Ondatra zibethica.",

    "abstract": "Individual reproductive success in polyphagous arthropod predators critically depends on the prey species included in their diet. Hence, selection will act on traits that enable the predator to tune its preference to the best prey available. Such traits may be either rigid or flexible and are manifested as genetically fixed or learned preferences. Whether these two types of behaviour are mutually exclusive or manifest themselves in condition-dependent ways, is still an open question. We sought possible answers by studying a soil-dwelling predatory mite (Hypoaspis (Gaeolaelaps) aculeifer Canestrini), known to exhibit a genetic polymorphism in prey preferences within local populations. We had previously shown that 4 generations of artificial selection on the choice for either of two astigmatic mites (Rhizoglyphus robini and Tyrophagus putrescentiae) resulted in isofemale lines with contrasting prey preferences (<I>R</I>-line and <I>T</I>-line) and that the preference traits are inherited as though they are monogenic without dominance. In this article, we ask whether artificial selection has influenced the ability to switch preferences in a condition-dependent way. First, we conditioned the female predators of both isofemale lines by starving them in the presence of odour from each of the two prey species separately or in the absence of any prey odour. Then, at least half an hour later, we assessed their prey preference in two-choice tests. When starved in presence of odour from non-preferred prey, both lines show a slight but non-significant increase in preference for their preferred prey. However, when starved in presence of odour from the preferred prey, predators of both lines showed a clear and significant switch toward the alternative prey. This shows the ability of predatory mites to memorize the odour experienced during starvation, and to change their prey preference. It also shows that - despite four generations of artificial selection for a fixed prey preference - they retain the ability to exhibit a form of learning and to switch preferences. This result sheds new light on the impact of selection on fixed and flexible prey preferences in polyphagous arthropod predators that experience different dominant prey species in space and time.",

Diagnoses of 61 species known from Tanzania (TAN) are given, 15 species have been redescribed on the basis of types and 22 species have been redescribed in earlier papers. One new species: A. ( H.) onkos sp. nov. is described. For each species a morphological diagnosis and geographic distribution are given. Eight species are new to TAN, including one new to the Afrotropical Region. Keys for identification of species and higher taxa are given. The fauna of ptyctimous mites of Tanzania (TAN) shows some differences and specificities as well as some similarities to the fauna of the nearby hotspot Madagascar with neighbouring islands (MAG), to that of the Afrotropical Region and even to that of distanced faunas of other zoogeographic regions of the southern hemisphere. The fauna of TAN comprises slightly more genera and subgenera (19) than that of MAG (18), although the number of species in MAG is much higher (111) than in TAN (61 species). The specious higher taxa are: Pocsia, Plonaphacarus and Notophthiracarus. Pocsia is represented by the highest number (10) of species found in the Afrotropical Region, and it is likely this subgenus originates from Tanzania (7 endemic species). Plonaphacarus is relatively rich in species in the Oriental Region. Notophthiracarus is even more speciose in the fauna of MAG and the Australasian Region. Over a half of the species known from Tanzania (37) were found in the material collected in 2010 from the Uluguru and Nguru Mts. Both these mountain ranges show some specificity of fauna. Two species occur only in the Nguru range, while as many as 7 species are endemites in the Uluguru.",

    "abstract": "Species of Blattisocius Keegan (Acari: Blattisociidae) are commonly found in storage facilities, seemingly feeding on mites or insects. Two species of this genus, Blattisocius keegani Fox and Blattisocius everti Britto, Lopes and Moraes, were recently found coexisting in a sample of a commercial dog food in southern Brazil. Although very similar, the species have rather different cheliceral structures, the first with the fixed digit distinctly shorter than the movable digit and the second with both digits of similar lengths. It was hypothesized that they coexisted because of their different feeding habits, the first assumed to perform better on insect prey and the second, on mite prey. A comparative study was conducted in the laboratory offering a mixture of all postembryonic stages of a mite and eggs of three insect species. Blattisocius everti had a better performance on the mite Thyreophagus sp. than B. keegani, but both species had about the same predation rate on Thyreophagus sp., and very low ovipositon rates on insects. The results corroborate the hypothesis of a better performance of Blattisocius with cheliceral digits of similar lengths (B. everti) on mite prey, but did not indicate that the possession of a short fixed digit is sufficient for the predator to feed on insect eggs. Blattisocius everti was shown to be able to develop and reproduce when offered Thyreophagus sp. as prey, with calculated R0 and rm of 16.95 and 0.13, respectively, at 25.0 +/- 0.5 °C, 80 +/- 5 % of relative humidity and in the dark. The biotic potential of B. everti was comparable to what has been reported in previous work for other Blattisocius species offered acarid mites as prey.",

Thus, the objective was to record the species of spider mites associated with plants in forest fragments located in the Northwestern of the State of São Paulo, Brazil. Thirty-eight species belonging to 14 genera of Tetranychidae were recorded. Only Tetranychus mexicanus and Eutetranychus banksi, species recorded on plants of economic interest, in some cases causing damage to crops, were abundant and frequent in the forest fragments sampled in this study. The knowledge of plants that can serve as alternate hosts or plant-traps can assist in understanding the dynamics of these mites in agroecosystems. The great diversity of Tetranychidae registered, and the limited knowledge of these mites associated with plants in natural environments, reinforces the importance of surveys carried out in forest remnants. Future studies should be conducted to increase the knowledge of spider mites in natural areas.",

Comparison with other halacarid genera proved, the position of the solenidion is stable within a species and genus, no variants are known, whereas in respect to the other characters, various states within a genus are documented. Because of differences in the position of the solenidia, the genus Arhodeoporus Newell has to be splitted. Species of Arhodeoporus s.str. have the solenidion on tarsus II dorsolateral in position; the genus includes the two species once described by Newell (1947), namely A. arenarius and A. submarinus. The other species have this solenidion on the dorsomedial flank of claw fossa. The species once referred to as the bonairensis group are moved to the re-established genus Plegadognathus, the other species are included in the new genus Maracarus. Camactognathus shares with Arhodeoporus s.str. the position of the solenidion on tarsus II but differs in other characters; the genus is solidly diagnosed. The differences between Winlundia and Plegadognathus are small, with an increase of knowledge of the species, Winlundia may turn out to be a synonym of Plegadognathus. The five genera have records from tropical and temperate coastlines but not from polar waters. Maracarus and Plegadognathus are spread all around the globe whereas Arhodeoporus s.str. and Winlundia are restricted to the north-eastern Atlantic and south-eastern Pacific, respectively.",

Forest floor sampling (mineral soil and litter) was also performed in the same locations. Altogether, 77 species of oribatid mites were identified. 31 species were found in the canopy and 64 species were found in the mineral soil and litter. Juveniles made-up 7.6% of the canopy fauna. Ommatocepheus ocellatus (Michael, 1882), was a new finding for Mtirala National Park. Steganacarus (Tropacarus) patruelis Niedbala, 1983 was the most numerous species found on twigs and leaves. Almost the whole canopy fauna (94%) belonged to higher oribatids (Brachypilina) and the lower oribatids were only represented by only S. patruelis and Camisia segnis (Herman, 1804). Canopy fauna was separated from those found on the ground supporting the importance of both habitats in maintaining overall biodiversity. The highest number of individuals and the highest number of species was found on mid-altitudes, decreasing with increasing elevation. There was no difference in species richness between twig and leaf habitats, whereas abundance was much higher on twigs. We showed that rhododendron understory harbored well established and abundant oribatid fauna preserving rare and unique species that enhance regional biodiversity.",

Given that V. destructor has very low survivability and exhibits no successful reproduction away from their natural environment and host and that the availability of mites for experimental purposes is limited by seasonality, several protocols of mite rearing under laboratory conditions have been developed. However, only one of these rearing systems has been able to yield a fertile second generation with a low mite survival. The aim of this study was to develop a semi-field rearing method to obtain mites of known age and life cycle that can be maintained through several generations. We registered and compared survival and reproductive parameters of mites of controlled age during four generations (P, F1, F2, F3) and evidenced no significant differences between these mite groups for these life-history traits. With present results we demonstrate that it is possible to successfully produce a third generation of mites under semi-field conditions. This study brings useful information about key conditions for the proper reproduction of mites in a controlled rearing system and provides a potential standardized method for V. destructor research, especially for host-parasite interaction experiments.",

We collected a total of 5842 mites, representing seven families and seven species: Cercoleipus coelonotus (Cercomegistidae) Dendrolaelaps quadrisetosimilis (Digamasellidae), Ereynetes propescutulis (Ereynetidae), Iponemus confusus confusus (Tarsonemidae), Mexecheles cf. virginiensis (Cheyletidae), Proctolaelaps subcorticalis (Melicharidae), and Trichouropoda californica (Trematuridae). We calculated the average number of mites per beetle to be 18, with a maximum of 147 mites on a single beetle. The vast majority of mites (98% of total abundance) was represented by three species (I. c. confusus, D. quadrisetosimilis, and T. californica). Attachment locations on the beetle varied across mite species, with mite species exhibiting a preference for specific locations. Mite abundances on emerging host beetles varied over time, with some species occurring mostly on early-emerging beetles, while others occurred on later emerging beetles.",

    "abstract": "Background: Amblyseius andersoni is a common predatory mite occurring in fruit orchards located in Europe and North America. Its role in preventing spider mite outbreaks is widely recognized, in particular when selective pesticides are used. The compatibility between plant protection products and predatory mites is crucial to preserve their activity. There is a need to investigate the effects of pesticides on beneficials using multiple approaches. Objectives: Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of a number of insecticides on A. andersoni. Methods: The effects of neonicotinoids (i.e., acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thia-methoxam) were compared with those of pyrethroids (i.e., tau-fluvalinate), well known for their negative impact on predatory mites. Insecticides were applied 1-3 times in an experimental fruit orchard located in Northern Italy. Laboratory trials focused on their effects on the survival and the fecundity of predatory mite females. Results: Field experiments showed a decline in predatory mite numbers in plots treated with neonicotinoids or tau-fluvalinate compared to the untreated control. However, predatory mites in neonicotinoid plots reached higher densities compared to those recorded in tau-fluvalinate plots. Spider mite (Panonychus ulmi) populations reached moderate to high densities in plots treated with tau-fluvalinate while their densities were negligible in the remaining plots. Amblyseius andersoni survival was moderately affected by some neonicotinoids in the laboratory while they significantly reduced predatory mite fecundity. In contrast tau-fluvalinate exerted severe effects on survival and fecundity of predatory mites. Finally, escaping rate increased after pesticide exposure suggesting possible alterations in predatory mite behavior. Conclusions: Neonicotinoid applications significantly affected predatory mite densities in field conditions and this phenomenon appeared to be influenced by their impact on female fecundity. Their effects on survival were less severe. Implications of these results for IPM tactics in fruit orchards are discussed.",

In the present study, the functional responses and predation rates of two predatory mites Macrocheles mammifer Berlese (Macrochelidae) and Stratiolaelaps scimitus (Womersley) (Laelapidae) on M. usitatus pupae were evaluated. The former was discovered in a cowpea Vigna unguiculata (Linn.) Walp. field of southern China, while the latter is commonly used as a biological control agent for soil-dwelling pests. Both M. mammifer and S. scimitus females consumed more M. usitatus than protonymphs, and the predation rate of the adult stage of M. mammifer was found to be significantly higher than that of S. scimitus. Likewise, logistic regression analysis revealed that both predators exhibited a type II functional response. Females of M. mammifer and S. scimitus displayed a higher attack rate and shorter handling time (T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) compared to conspecific protonymphs when preying on pupae of M. usitatus. Female M. mammifer recorded the highest attack rate (a) of 4.028, closely followed by female S. scimitus at 3.994. The protonymph of M. mammifer had an attack rate of 2.651, while the protonymph of S. scimitus displayed the lowest rate of 1.402. Female M. mammifer exhibited the shortest handling time (0.089), indicating superior prey-handling ability. Overall, the predatory mites M. mammifer and S. scimitus demonstrated considerable promise for managing M. usitatus, with M. mammifer displaying higher efficacy than S. scimitus.",

Les Ixodides (acariens, Ixodoidea) parasites de carnivores et d ongules domestiques sur la bordure orientale du massif - The combined usage of two methods of investigation (collection of ticks on the vegetation by dragging flannel blankets; collection on hosts) has allowed the identification of eight species of the Ixodidae infesting Carnivora and Ungulata, on the eastern border of the Massif Central (France). Each of the species identified on this ter.ritory presents a particular type of distribution, linked to its particular ecological requirements. The authors have attempted to specify several of the factors which govem this distribution. The communities of plants which characterize the Ixodidae biotopes give a general idea of the required ecological conditions (climatology and lithology). In the present works, the vegetation series was taken as the reference unit. Any supplementary information was obtained by the use of the data provided by a network ofmeteorological stations. Rhipicephalus turanicus is confined to regions subject to a Mediterranean climate. Haemaphysalis punctata finds its optimal conditions in the supramediterranean level (Submediterranean series of pubescent oak). The species which has the widest distribution is Dermacentor marginatus which is very widely spread through the mediterranean, supramediterranean and hill levels, but does not penetrate into the damp montane level (Beech and beech-fir seri~s). D. reticulatus is essentially linked to the series of the hill leve! but has a tendancy to infiltra te into the supramediterranean level. Lastly Ixodes ricinus is the only hilly species to penetrate into the series of the damp montane level. Several indications are given concerning human and animal illnesses the distribution of which is linked to that of the tick vectors (Lyme disease, Boutonneuse fever, Babesiosis ... ).",

The development of 71 eggs has been studied from September 73 to April 74. For each egg the real developmental period (from oviposition to hatching), the corresponding mean temperature and the thermie variations to which the animais were exposed, were recorded. The mean temperature enables to predict the developmental period (dt11) if the temperature remains constant, thanks to the relation between constant temperature and developmental period established in a previous work. The comparison of the observed period (dobs) with the theoretical one (dt1,) shows high variations ranging from 4 to 300 %: the observed period is practically always Jess at variable temperature. The interpretation of the results brings the author to underline the essential role of thermie variations in this phenomenon. The influence of this variations is, however, complex because too large variations including temperatures near o°C delay hatching time.

Also, when reared on inadequate food sources or at low temperature, development usually proceeds only to the tritonymphal stage. Field observations on natural populations indicate that during a dearth of food and also during winter the tritonymphal instar predominates. When adequate environmental conditions return, the tritonymphs transform to adults almost simultaneously. The tritonymphal stage thus phases the population in response to cooling temperatures and/or lack of food, re:mlting (by synchronous molting) in a population of young, highly reproductive adults when adequate conditions return to the treehole. Such a population, through its high reproductive potential, can best compete with other saprophagus organisms for the available food supply.",

A technique was developed for rearing N. bee1•i in the laboratory. The larvae were allowed to engorge on their natural host, Alobates pennsylvanica (DeG.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Nymphs and adults fed upon the eggs of Tenebrio molitor Lin. (Tenebrionidae). 243 eggs required an average of 32 days for larval emergence, at laboratory temperatures. A deutoval stage preceded the larva. A minimum of about 14 days of feeding was required before the larvae could continue development to the nymph. 31 nymphs emerged from larvo-pupae after II to 20 days. Nymphs entered pupation after at least one engorgement on aT. molitor egg, 10 to 214 days after emergence from the larvo-pupa. The nympho-pupa required from II to 21 days before adult emergence. Twenty-one adults, 12 females and 9 males, were obtained, living up to 3 years after eclosion from the egg. One of these laboratory-reared females supplied 243 eggs, from which an Fr generation of adults was reared. Neotrombidium beeri shows a degree of host specificity towards tenebrionid beetles. Larval mites were commonly collected from under the elytra of Alobates pennsylvanica, and laboratory-reared larvae placed upon this host readily engorged and completed development The larvae were placed upon several other potential beetle-host species, but were unable to complete development. The post-larval instars refused a large assortment of nutrient material, but readily accepted T. molitor eggs.",

The presence of P. richmondenae George, 1961, in Brown-headed Cowbird represents a new host association, and a potential new species of Ptilonyssus was also recovered.

According to our observations on the type material of G. angustus, previous redescription of G. queenslandicus (sensu Costa 1966, based on holotype), specimens of this species from Australia and numerous specimens from Iran identified as either G. angustus or G. queenslandicus, notable variations were observed in some morphological characters, which had previously been considered as distinguishing features between the two species. Our analysis indicates that these morphological differences represent intraspecific variation, and therefore the two species names are synonyms. Furthermore, observation of type material of G. tripodiger shows that the two first mentioned species are junior synonyms of G. tripodiger. The original descriptions of G. trifurcatus (Wang and Li, 1965) [new comb.] and G. trifurcatoides (Yan and Ma, 1999) ([new comb.] show no authentic morphological difference from G. tripodiger and those are also junior synonyms of the later. The oldest available name for this species is Gaeolaelaps tripodiger. However, that name is almost unknown, and to use it as a valid name would cause taxonomic confusion. Therefore, we continue to use the widely known name Gaeolaelaps queenslandicus for this species, in the interests of stability.",

In South Africa it has first been identified in 2014 and now occurs between Amsterdam and Lothair, and near Lydenburg and Dullstroom in the Mpumalanga Province. The morphology of the South African A. vaccinii specimens was compared with previous published taxonomic descriptions and differences were found. Infestation levels in South Africa were high, and reduced flower and berry formation considerably on various Vaccinium corymbosum L. cultivars, and on rabbiteye blueberry Vaccinium virgatum Aiton. 'Centurion'. The current status of, symptoms, and cultivars infested by the mite in South African blueberry plantings are presented and discussed in the context of published information in North America. Acalitus vaccinii is a potential threat to cultivated blueberries in South Africa, but the threat varies according to climate and the susceptibility of different cultivars to this mite. Acalitus vaccinii will unlikely infest South Africa’s indigenous vegetation, apart from possibly the native Vaccinium exul Bolus.",

    "abstract": "Tree-canopy and trampling management are reported to influence soil arthropod abundance and diversity. However, there is limited understanding of their interactive effects on a soil microarthropod community at the Safari Zoological Center, central Israel. This study assessed the spatial influence of three dominant tree species (Cupressus sempervirens, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, and Tamarix aphylla) under contrasting trampling and enclosure treatment on soil microarthropod abundance and diversity during a wet Mediterranean winter. There was a significant interactive effect of tree species and trampling management on soil moisture, organic matter, pH, and soil density, with an individual effect of tree species or trampling management on soil electrical conductivity and water-holding capacity. There was a significantly greater abundance of total microarthropods under enclosure than under trampling in open spaces and beneath the E. camaldulensis canopy, with the greatest abundance found in the open spaces under enclosure. However, there were no significant differences in the average abundance of total microarthropods between trampling and enclosure beneath either the T. aphylla or C. sempervirens canopy. The soil Acari diversity indices (i.e., taxon richness, Shannon index, and evenness index) were significantly greater under enclosure than under trampling in open spaces and beneath tree-canopy habitats, with the exception of taxon richness beneath the C. sempervirens canopy. We concluded that the trampling activities had a detrimental effect on soil microarthropod abundance and soil Acari diversity in some cases only. The distinctive canopy architecture of some tree species (i.e., T. aphylla and C. sempervirens) has ecophysiological attributes which could mediate the effect of trampling on soil microarthropods.",

Fluorescence has been found in numerous biological organisms, including ticks. However, the overall function, evolutionary significance, and distribution of fluorescence in ticks are unknown. This study examined tick fluorescence in purchased, unfed adult Amblyomma americanum (Linnaeus), A. maculatum Koch, Dermacentor variabilis (Say), D. andersoni (Stiles), Ixodes scapularis Say, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus Latreille ticks. An Olympus SZX7 microscope and NightSea SFA system with ultraviolet (UV) and royal blue sets were used for observing tick morphology. Ticks were shown to have widespread fluorescence in all species observed. The results corroborated previous studies, but with the addition of more fluorescent structures. Tick fluorescence could potentially play roles in communication or predator avoidance. Studies on tick behavior in conjunction with fluorescence are now called for to elucidate potential roles.",

    "abstract": "The fauna of oribatid mites (Acari, Oribatida) in the mountain tundra on the Kola Peninsula (Russia) is still poorly studied. The main aim of this research is to obtain initial data on the fauna and abundance of oribatid mites of the Lovozersky Mountains. We investigated five plots, including three lichen tundra plots, one dwarf shrub tundra plot and one wetted tundra plot in one of the largest mountain massifs of the Kola Peninsula — the Lovozersky Mountains. Multidimensional scaling and discriminant function analysis were used to identify some trends in the fauna and abundance of species on the explored plots. The abundance of oribatid mites in the lichen tundra reached 23,680 ind./m2. In the dwarf shrub tundra, this value is over three times higher — up to 81,160 ind./m2, which is comparable with the oribatid mite abundance of forest habitats. The minimum values were discovered in wetted tundra (6,200 ind./m2). A total of 71 species, 38 genera, and 24 families of oribatid mites were found during the course of this study. Eight species of Oribatida have been added to the fauna of the Kola Peninsula. A significant difference was observed in the structure of oribatid faunas of the explored habitats. The occurrence in samples and relative abundance of Mycobates sarekensis, Oribatula amblyptera, Tectocepheus velatus and Carabodes labyrinthicus increased in lichen tundra compared to dwarf shrub tundra. Species of Suctobelbidae and Oppiidae were higher in occurrence and relative abundance in dwarf shrub tundra compared to lichen tundra. The occurrence and relative abundance of Trimalaconothrus angulatus, T. maior and Platynothrus peltifer prevailed in wetted tundra as compared to automorphic tundra habitats. The family Suctobelbidae was represented by a large number of species, while the family Ceratozetidae showed a small number of species in the discovered fauna. According to the literature, these features of the fauna are unusual for tundra. A low diversity of Ceratozetidae, a high diversity of Suctobelbidae and high abundance of oribatid mites in dwarf shrub tundra may be explained by the ambivalent nature of the oribatid community in the explored region, which combines boreal and arctic features due to marine climate.",

For Spinturnix myoti, parasite of Myotis myotis, we were able to develop nine polymorphic loci and screened them in 100 mites from five bat colonies. For S. bechsteini, parasite of M. bechsteinii, we developed five polymorphic loci, which were also screened in 100 mites from five bat colonies. In both species, all markers were highly polymorphic (22-46 and 6-23 alleles per locus respectively). The majority of markers for both species exhibited departure from Hardy-Weinberg proportions (8 of 9 and 3 of 5, respectively). One marker pair in S. myoti showed evidence for linkage disequilibrium. As the observed departures from Hardy-Weinberg proportions are most likely a consequence of the biology of the mites, the described microsatellite loci should be useful in studying population genetics and host-parasite dynamics of Spinturnix myoti and Spinturnix bechsteini in relation to their bat hosts.",

However, in the last 20 years, more and more non-taxonomic studies regarding development, genetics, morphology, chemical ecology and ecotoxicology have become available, with a significant number focused on the trhypochthoniid oribatid mite Archegozetes longisetosus. A well-defined laboratory strain of this pantropical parthenogenetic species was established in 1993 by one of us (RAN), and has since spread through numerous laboratories worldwide. In this review, we summarize the scientific achievements this lineage has enabled while becoming a model system for general zoology, ecology and evolution.",

A set of fundamental data was acquired through a method using plant communities as indicators. The results presented in this article are related to the South-Western quadrant of France. The study area includes the following regions: Landes, Bassin Aquitain, the foot-hills of the Pyrenees and the western part of Massif Central. The aim of the study was to ascertain the presence of the vector in the various parts of a territory of great ecological variety. A zoning was first carried out in order to define phyto-ecological and geographical units. Seventeen units were delineated. In a range of 5 to 10 forest experimental sites per unit, the flagging method was used for one hour s time to take samples of the tick during its period of activity. Ixodes ricinus was found in all the phytoecological zones, except three. Its occurrence frequency ranges from 0 % to 80 %. The Atlantic influence is quite propitious to the species, whereas the Mediterranean climate is not. The supramediterranean series of Quercus pubescens is not convenient for the species. The presence of Ixodes ricinus was ascertained at numerous sites in forests belonging to the Atlantic series of Quercus pedunculata as well as in the artificial pine forest of Pinus maritimus. Dermacentor reticulatus is the other tick species the most frequently encountered in the same forests as Ixodes ricinus in the study area.",

The peak of the oviposition period of Amb. limbatum females was however two days earlier than that of Ap. hydrosauri females. Amb. limbatum females also laid significantly more eggs than Ap. hydrosauri of an equivalent body weight and their eggs were significantly fighter in weight.

We assessed the ability of adult females of Neoseiulus fallacis (Garman), a native predaceous mite, to invade S. longus nests after construction times of 5 or 10 days. Frequency of predators in nests decreased from 5 to 10 days, although the predator laid most of its eggs in nests irrespective of construction time. In choice tests, spider mite webbing was more attractive to N. fallacis than eggs, but similar to feces. Predators searched more in proximity to feces than eggs, but resting sites were equally common near both. Survival, activity and reproduction of N. fallacis when given excess of mixed life stages of S. longus, Tetranychus urticae Koch, pollen of Tulipa gesneriana L. or Pseudotsuga menzesii (Mirbel), or no food were measured by holding single adult female N. fallacis for 7 days. Survival, activity, oviposition and immature production of predators were alike for both spider mites, but lower (or higher activity) with pollens or when starved. To see if N. fallacis would suppress S. longus under normal growing conditions, predators were added to infested Sasaella hidaensis (Makino and Uchida) var. 'Murai' plants, and mites were monitored thereafter for 5 weeks. N. fallacis significantly reduced levels of S. longus and the rates that it infested bamboo leaves; it nearly eliminated S. longus from plants at the end of the test.",

The Maximum Effective Engorgement Weight (MEEW) was defined to characterize the weight - specific for each species - at which the number eggs laid is not influenced by the engorgement weight. Individual capability of engorged ticks to lay large or small numbers of eggs after attainment of MEEW was observed and this led to the recognition of two oviposition capabilities within a given tick species i.e. high and low. Amblyomma maculatum had the biggest eggs followed by Dermacentor variabilis and then Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Eggs of the species hatched as long as they were ’egg-shaped’ and not circular. In addition, eggs of R. sanguineus which were less than 0.30 mm failed to hatch irrespective of their shape. The viability of eggs laid by R. sanguineus and D. variabilis which engorged on dogs was higher than that of eggs laid by females which engorged on rabbits. The phases of embryonic development of eggs were described as well as the microscopic structure of the egg-shells.",

Le developpement des oocytes comprend une previtellogenese, ou petite croissance cytoplasmique, et une vitellogenese, ou grande croissance cytoplasmique.

En previtellogenese avancee, les oocytes sont riches en mitochondries et sont caracterises par la formation a leur surface de microvillosites. Au sommet des microvillosites commence a se deposer une substance finement granuleuse a basse densite electronique que l'on considere comme la membrane vitelline primaire. Au debut, le depot de vitellus est assure par un processus intraovocytaire place sous l'action de petits appareils de Golgi librement repartis dans le cytoplasme en previtellogenese avancee.

Male body size and leg IV size were positively correlated for the three populations of T. confusus. However, the correlation was imperfect and males of the same body size often had different leg sizes. When two males were placed into an arena with a pharate female, the male that succeeded in capturing and guarding the female had legs IV that were significantly longer and larger (by area) than those of the loser.

Within the Oppiidae genital papillae are reduced to two pairs, and the posterior genital papillae are very broad, in adults of Aeroppia, Amerioppia, Oppia, and Ramusella. Examination of genital papillae in immature instars of Ramusella maculata (Hammer) and Oppia nitens (C. L.

A 25° C, avec une diete de nematodes, N. camini acheve son developpement de la larve a l'adulte en 48 ± 2 jours et de l'oeuf a l'adulte en 57 ± 3 jours; avec la meme nourriture, F. grossipes a un developpement lent, une haute mortalite, et atteint rarement le stade adulte. La reproduction de N. camini s'effectue de ventre a ventre. La protection du partenaire apres copulation a ete observee, conduisant parfois a la mort des femelles tenerales.",

From the unsprayed vineyards, 18 were situated in the north region of the Douro river and 23 were located in the south region of this river. The sprayed vineyards were all situated in the north region of the Douro. Sampling was done on 20 random selected leaves from 5 plants in each vineyard, and phytoseiids were extracted and identified. Seven species were found: Euseius finlandicus (Oudemans), E. stipulatus (Athias-Henriot), Kampimodromus aberrans (Oudemans), Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor), Typhlodromus athenas Swirski and Ragusa, T. phialatus Athias-Henriot and T. pyri Scheuten. The dominant species were T. pyri and K. aberrans. T. pyri, which represented 47.2% of total number of individuals, were found mostly in the South region of Douro in cooler sites. K. aberrans, which represented 46.7% of the total number of individuals, dominated in the North region of Douro, in warmer and drier places. T. phialatus and T. athenas were common in the sprayed vineyards. The dominant species of phytoseiids found in the region, T. pyri and K. aberrans, were known as the most efficient agents against spider mites in many vine-growing areas of Europe.",

The study is concerned with both the morphology of the spermatophore and the functional morphology of the male reproductive organs of Sphaerolophus cardinalis. The systematic position of the species is discussed. Sphaerolophus produces stalked spermatophores. The stalk is formed between the eugenital lips, whereas the sperm drop is formed in the central part of the ejaculatory duct and is covered there by a thick layer of a secretion produced by the glandular part of the testis. The secretion is homologous to the secretion type III, which forms in A brolophits species a membranous crown topping the spermatophore (WITTE, 1975). Sperm drop and stalk are glued together apparently by a secretion from a pair of glands entering into the ejaculatory duct. The systematic position of Sphaerolophus next to A brolophits within one subfamily (Callidosomatinae) is not justified.",

Leaf samples were collected monthly from nine different blackberry cultivars including ‘Arapaho’, ‘Choctaw’, ‘Freedom’, ‘Kiowa’, ‘Natchez’, ‘Navaho’, ‘Osage’, ‘Ouachita’, and Von. Approximately 20 leaves per blackberry plant were taken. Twenty mite species (a total of 152 mite specimens) belonging to 7 families including Phytoseiidae (9 species), Ascidae (1), Cheyletidae (1), Erythraeidae (1), Stigmaeidae (1), Tetranychidae (4) and Tarsonemidae (3) were identified during the study. It was found that the abundance of predatory mites collected in organic farms was over 2-fold higher (105) than in conventional farms (47), which may be related to pesticide use on these commercial farms. Future surveys should provide a list of predatory species, which may hold potential for biological control of economically important pest mites.",

In addition, larvae were studied in scanning electron microscope (SEM). The apical hypostomal portions form a temporal sucker, which applies to the host skin during feeding. Larval feeding on both naturally infected voles and chipmunks causes an epidermal hyperkeratosis and a permanent delayed inflammation with predominance of neutrophil leukocytes, dilation of dermal capillaries and local hemorrhages. Larvae tend to feed in tight groups and may attach themselves to both ‘living’ epidermis and hypertrophic stratum corneum. The stylostome is organized nearly identically in the two host species, which points to the species-specific character of the feeding tube in trombiculid larvae. The stylostome does not penetrate the epidermis through, so it may be classified as belonging to the epidermal type. The stylostome is produced by a solidifying larval secretion and composed of the proximal eosinophil cone and the main stylostome tube, both pale-pink in azure-II-eosin with a greyish peripheral portion more pronounced in voles. No longitudinal and transverse stratification is found in the stylostome composition. In contrast with other trombiculid larvae studied so far, larvae of N. talmiensis also ingest, besides liquefied nutrients, a pure blood that reveals a possibility for trombiculid larvae to be natural bloodsuckers.",

Three main compounds, Limonene (45. 99), Myrcenol (21. 85%), Cis Ocimene (15. 49%) were found. In this study, we evaluated two essential oils obtained from two plant species, Citrus sinensis var. balady, Citrus limon and avermectin as control agents against the engorged female of Hyalomma dromedarii. In vitro study, Citrus limon oil had a stronger effect than that of Citrus sinensis oil. LC 50 and LC 90 were 0.0151; 0.0316 and 0.022; 0.0527 for C. limon and C. sinensis respectively. In vivo study, Avermectin together with each essential oil have a stronger effect than that of each essential oil alone and avermectin alone respectively, the mortality rate was 36, 36, 20, 30 and 13% respectively. Histological examination (HE) and sodium dodecyle sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were done for midgut; ovary and hemolymph of the engorged female H. dromedarii within 7 days after injection with avermectin and essential oils. HE revealed that the basement membrane and digest cells of midgut were completely damaged. The vacuoles have disappeared from the main cell of the gut and there was no hematin in the digest cells. Gut lumen was filled with hemolysis blood after injection with C. sinensis, C. limon and avermectin together with each essential oil respectively. SDS-PAGE exhibited 5, 6,11, 5, 5, 6, 8 bands for ovary and 6, 3, 6, 9, 5, 4 for hemolymph of engorged female H. dromedarii injected with C. limon, C. sinensis, avermectin and avermectin together with each essential oils, negative and positive control respectively. Our results indicated that the essential oils of C. limon and C. sinensis have strong toxic effect on female H. dromedarii than avermectin alone.",

    "abstract": "The economic importance of the Phytoseiidae motivated many scientists to work on the systematics of this family. One of them was the French acarologist Claire Athias-Henriot. In her first work, she tackled the question of supraspecific groupings within this family from an evolutionistic point of view, and suggested a system for numbering dorsal shield setae, that could be applied to both hypotrichous and holotrichous forms. She also looked for other characters, such as the ratios of the distance between the insertions of some setae on dorsal and sternal shields, the presence of macrosetae on legs, and the length/width ratio of the ventrianal shield. Following Dosse (1957; 1958) who used the shape of the insemination apparatus (spermatheca) for taxonomic purposes, she also adopted this character to define genera, initially without giving it a particular weight. Meanwhile, she also studied other gamasids, and in 1966 considered the insemination apparatus as the main character for distinguishing families of Gamasida. She distinguished the Phytoseiidae within the Laelapoidea (sic), by the type of insemination apparatus and the dorsal hypotrichy. In 1966, she adopted Lindquist and Evans (1965) chaetotactic nomenclature system in her",

(Ori.) savignyi at all stages in the Sahelian zone, data on the recent appearance of Hya. (Hya.) anatolicum excavatum are added. Progressively, this species of Hyalomma is colonizing the northern third of Senegal. Moreover, Hya. dromedarii can be found at all stages in the north of the country. The other species quoted above progressed towards the south or their relative abundance changed. The known hosts for each species are quoted in their new distribution areas. Following the redescription of Hya. nitidum and the new recognition of the occurrence of Hya. anatolicum excavatum in Senegal, we propose a new identification key for the Hyalomma tick species of Senegal and Mauritania. This key also remains applicable to the ixodid fauna of the Occidental sub-Region of the Afro-tropical Region.",

On each site, three adjacent plots of 100 m x 50 m were delimited, to which a given fire regime was applied. At each site, soil cores were taken at 0-10 cm soil depth three days before the fire application, the day after and one month after the fire (10 soil cores x 3 sampling periods x 3 fire regimes or plots x 3 sites = 270 soil cores). Soil mites were then extracted from these cores. 108 soil cores were sampled at two upper layers (0-5 and 5-10 cm) for estimation of the bulk density and water content. After data analysis, four groups of mite were observed (Actinedida, Gamasida, Oribatida and Acaridida). Gamasida and Oribatida were dominant groups (early fire: Gamasida 35%, Oribatida 55%; mid-season fire: Gamasida 16%, Oribatida 70%; late fire: Gamasida 16%, Oribatida 74%). In total, 70 species were observed, with 29, 44 and 31 species recorded respectively during the early, mid-season and late fires. Mite density and species richness varied significantly along the three fire regimes and decreased substantially after fire application. Except for the mid-season fire, Simpson index from all mites differed significantly across sampling periods. Lower Oribatida represented 25% of the total Oribatida. Whatever the fire regimes, brachypyline Oribatida abundance increased the day after fire application. Overall, fire intensity reduced drastically soil mite abundance and diversity.",

Water mites can be found in high densities in the Laurentian Great Lakes and adjacent habitats. Although they are abundant, water mites are generally not used in the assessment of aquatic habitats in the Great Lakes and are usually assigned to the “other” category in macroinvertebrate assessments. This is despite evidence of their utility as aquatic bioindicators. In the present study we consider water mites as bioindicators of the environmental health of Point Rosa marsh, a threatened marsh found on the US side of transboundary Lake St. Clair. The abundance of water mites in Point Rosa Marsh increased from 2017 to 2019 as lake water levels increased. Although increasing water levels in Lake St. Clair can be considered a negative event due to loss of irreplaceable coastal habitat by erosion with potential economic impacts, this present study indicates that water mite populations in Point Rosa Marsh increased during the same period (2017 to 2019). As a result of our study we: update the biodiversity of water mites from Lake St. Clair with new records compared to the last report from the lake over 45 years ago, first report on water mite assemblages at Point Rosa marsh at the Lake St. Clair Metropark on Lake St. Clair and the first demonstration of water mites used as bioindicators in the habitats of the Laurentian Great Lakes.",

    "abstract": "The Gigantolaelaps mites (Mesostigmata: Laelapidae) are easily recognized by their large size. In Chile, Gigantolaelaps wolffsohni is the only recognized species Gigantolaelaps and it has only been reported from four localities, always in association with Oligoryzomys longicaudatus. Our research study aimed to contribute to the severely limited information about the ecology and distribution of G. wolffsohni in Chile and determine whether factors such as season, ecological region and weight-and sex of the host influence the abundance of this mite. We captured and assessed 329 O. longicaudatus in different seasons and localities. We classified sampled localities as being part of the Mediterranean, Template Forest, or Magellanic Forest ecoregion due to reported genetic and morphological differences of O. longicaudatus between ecoregions. Information about the season, ecoregion, and weight and sex of the host were recorded during mite sampling. These variables were assessed to determine their influence on mite abundance and prevalence through negative binomial and logistic regression models. We found 19 new localities where G. wolffsohni is distributed in Chile. These mites displayed an aggregated distribution in all ecoregions. We found that biogeography, weight, and sex of the host are not related to the abundance and prevalence of G. wolffsohni. Nonetheless, we found a strong association between the season and the abundance and prevalence of mites. All mites found were females; additionally, we found larva stage inside some female mites. We discussed the relationship between different ecological aspects and the abundance and prevalence of ectoparasites. Also, we discussed the finding of the larvae of G. wolffsohni, which means that this specie is at least larviparous, and finally, we discuss the specificity of Laelapidae mites.",

    "abstract": "Phoresy is a widespread phenomenon in mites. It allows mesostigmatid mites that are associated with ephemeral habitats such as mammal dung to travel fast on larger animals that can detect a proper habitat from a greater distance. To address the gap in knowledge on phoresy in these mites, we examined host specificity in phoretic Mesostigmata associated with psychodid species and studied temporal dynamics to see if phoretic life cycles are synchronized with the host life cycle. Using a field collection of more than 2500 moth flies (Psychodidae) from eight localities in Norway, we found three out of 29 species carrying phoretic mites of two species: deutonymphs of Trachygamasus ambulacralis were phoretic on female Psychoda phalaenoides and both sexes of Psychoda grisescens, and adults of Iphidozercon gibbus were phoretic on females of Psychoda satchelli. All flies were species with larval development in vertebrate dung. Abundances of P. phalaenoides and T. ambulacralis were highly correlated, probably due to the two species exhibiting similar seasonal variations in abundance; both were significantly seasonal with a peak in August and September. Thus, T. ambulacralis infestation levels on P. phalaenoides appeared similar throughout the season. We discuss the implications for the life histories of the mites in question. Trachygamasus ambulacralis is first time recorded from Norway.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between the weight of engorged females of ixodid ticks and the number of eggs they produce is considered, using both our own data and numerous literature data. There are three critical weights during female engorgement, which are followed by a change in the relationship of female weight/egg number. When the females acquire an initial weight (W-) after which they are able to lay eggs, they produce a constantly increasing number of eggs per unit weight (partially-engorged females). After the females acquire weight W2, they produce a constant number of eggs per unit weight (fully-engorged females), and after reaching the weight W3, they produce a diminishing number of eggs per unit weight (over-engorged females). In the linear regression between female weight (x) and egg number (y) (y= a + bx), used in most studies of tick life history, the X-axis not only expresses the whole range of weights (thus mixing together females of all groups, even those which do not produce eggs at all), but also includes non-existing weight values, from 0 to the mean weight of an unfed female. Under these conditions, the parameters a and b have no biological meaning, since the linear dependence between female weight and egg number is only valid for fully-engorged females. This means that 0 on the X-axis must correspond to the very beginning of the linear dependence. The regression should only be computed over the part of the X-axis with weights of fully engorged females, where the relationship of female weight/egg number is truly linear (Y, X; W2, 0), thus making both parameters informative: a corresponds to the number of eggs laid by a fully engorged female with a minimal possible weight (W2) and b is the number of eggs produced per unit of weight increase. Hence, this is a simple way to take into account the real limits of the linear relationship between y and x values and to transform the regression, such that its parameters can be interpreted biologically.",

Plasmatocytes contain free ribosomes, mitochondria, RER, Golgi bodies, vacuoles and pseudopodia-like processes on the cell surface. Granulocytes, the predominent cell type in the haemolymph, contain numerous granules in addition to other cell organelles. Plasmatocytes and granulocytes are phagocytic and possibly also involved in other functions in the tick body. Nephrocytes are scattered in the haemolymph or attached to fat body strands. The plasma membrane forms deep invaginations whose openings are closed by diaphragms. Tubular elements, found in cells performing extensive endocytosis, connect the invaginated cell membrane with large coated vesicles, and probably transfer material from the haemolymph into the coated vesicles. These are specialized for internalization of proteins from the haemolymph. The cell cytoplasm also contains lysosomes, Golgi bodies, RER, mitochondria, and dense granules.

In this species, the distal mouthparts (palparmembrane structures) are conspicuously transformed in adaptation to the fluid like habitat where the species is found. A comparative study of the chemotactic orientation of deutonymphs of Bonomoia opuntiae n. sp. and other histiostomatid species was performed. An up and down movement of legs I (waving) to receive scent particles from the air is characteristic of all species of Histiostomatidae. The light sensitive organs of Bonomoia deutonymphs are possibly homologous to the lenticulus of the Oribatida, a type of eye that originated within the paraphyletic Oribatida and probably remained within the Astigmata that phylogenetically come out of the Oribatida. This eye differs completely from the ommatidium type that is usual for other mite groups that exhibit eyes. Experiments demonstrate that Bonomoia opuntiae n. sp. deutonymphs are attracted to light. This is a plesiomorphic character of all Histiostomatidae, but only B. opuntiae n. sp. (or probably Bonomoia in general) is able to recognise slight beam gradients. The special ability to position the body perpendicularly while walking and thereby bring the eyes in a position to receive small spots of light enables the mite easiliy to find the light. The phototactic behavior of B. opuntiae n. sp. is therefore derived and differs from that of other histiostomatids.",

Les glandes paires tubulaires coxales courent le long de l'axe du corps et sont en position ventrale et mediane. Les canaux excreteurs cuticulaires des glandes coxales et des glandes salivaires alveolaires posterieures sont reunis immediatement des la sortie des glandes pour former un canal salivaire commun (canal podocephalique) des deux cotes du corps. En electro-microscopie les glandes coxales sont formees de deux types de tubes : le tube distal donne le debut de canal exterieur et le tube proximal poursuit le tube distal en formant une partie basale de l'organe. Le tube distal se dirige vers l'arriere jusqu'a l'extremite de la glande ou il forme plusieurs cercles diriges vers l'arriere et vers l'avant, puis se transforme en tube proximal. Ce dernier dessine une courbe chaotique autour et en avant du tube distal pour s'achever en aveugle a une distance de 1/3 avant le bord anterieur de la glande. Les cellules des tubes sont disposees en rosette autour de la cavite centrale et sont jointives ne permettant pas de voir une portion d'espace extracellulaire du meme tube ou des autres tubes. Les cellules du tube proximal et distal sont munies de plis basaux de la membrane plasmatique (labyrinthe basal) comprenant des mitochondries. La surface apicale des cellules du tube proximal forme de longues microvillosites bien compactes tandis que la membrane apicale plasmatique des cellules du tube distal reste plane avec quelques courtes excroissances. Les bords lateraux des cellules sont plisses, les cellules elles-memes sont connectees a l'aide de desmosomes septaux. Les noyaux de forme irreguliere des deux types de tube sont identiques et contiennent de petites particules d'heterochromatine et un grand noyau. Des vesicules de Golgi de petite dimension constituent de petites bulles peu nombreuses. Les processus de la pinocytose et de l'exocytose aussi bien que le transport vesiculaire a travers la paroi de la glande n'ont pas ete remarques. La structure de la glande correspond bien aux epitheliums de transport et la glande coxale elle-meme prend part probablement a l'excretion d'eau et aux processus de la regulation de la concentration ionique.",

In contrast to the relatively rich history of the mite superorder Acariformes, fossils of the Parasitiformes are extremely rare. This is especially true of the most diverse order, Mesostigmata, with only nine families recorded, including four named species, having been described so far. As part of a wider effort to clarify the diversity of Baltic amber Mesostigmata the historically oldest fossil, Sejus bdelloides Koch and Berendt, 1854, is re-examined. While clearly a mite, it is not a mesostigmatan, but a member of the Prostigmata (Acariformes), referable to the Anystina. Thus of the three main mesostigmatan lineages currently recognised both Sejida and Trigynaspida lack a fossil record. Monogynaspida can be traced with confidence back to the Eocene (ca. 44 - 49 Ma).",

In this study we present the anatomy of female and male reproductive systems of this species as well as its gonadal structure and gametogenesis at the ultrastructural level. The reproductive systems are similar to those of other Astigmata. The ovaries are paired and each contains germ-line cells – a giant nutritive ovarian cell connected via funnel-type intercellular bridges to oogonia and previtellogenic oocytes. Germinal cells are embedded in several large somatic stroma cells. Remarkable numerous protrusions of the nutritive ovarian cell penetrate into the stroma cell cytoplasm. Conspicuous ER cisterns run close and parallel to the surface of the germinal cells. Oocytes entering vitellogenesis disassociate with the nutritive cell and a vitelline envelope composed of heterogeneous material appears on their surface. When vitellogenesis is completed, the oocytes are full of lipid droplets and two types of yolk spheres; the vitelline envelope transforms into a thin and homogeneous chorion.Paired testes are located on one side of the body, whereas the opposite side is filled by a male accessory gland. In testis, germinal cells are embedded in a few somatic stroma cells. The earliest spermatogonia form a compact germarium, whereas later stages are dispersed randomly within the testis. Spermatocytes are characterized by a superficial spongy layer, formation of mitochondrial derivatives, loss of nuclear envelope and condensation of chromatin in threads. A single electron-dense lamella appears during the spermatid stage, separating chromatin threads from a large spongy body surrounded by arcuate, double-membrane bounded cisterns. In spermatids, the superficial spongy layer is absent. The testicular central cell in the germarium and structures related to meiotic division were not observed in the testes. Spermatozoa are multiform cells (approx. 4x11µm) containing electron-dense lamella (ca. 45 nm thick) surrounded by mitochondrial derivatives which separate chromatin threads 45-50 nm thick from remnants of the spongy body i.e. arcuate cistern profiles. Spermatozoa deposited in female spermatheca are more electron dense; the electron-dense lamella is deeply folded several times, whereas chromatin threads are present in the center of the spermatozoon and are either flanked by lamella folds or located more peripherally under the plasmalemma. Remnants of the spongy body are not discernible.",

The data available in the literature on this species is scant. The available taxonomic descriptions are based on schematic and very rough drawings. The authors of this article conducted a research study that will shed more light on this species. The study is based on a large set of data (21,741 samples), which have been collected for over 50 years in the area of Poland and a few other European countries. The description of the morphology of the species is based on materials obtained from a scanning electron microscope, and the description of the distribution of the species on the basis of data obtained from the GIS system, which allows the precise localisation of samples to be determined. Finally, the authors have also tried to ascertain the habitat preferences of T. elegans, analyzing the phenology and influence of the altitude on the distribution of the species. This study is probably the first attempt to establish the effects of the Pleistocene glaciations on the current distribution of T. elegans in Poland and the whole area of Europe.",

The presence of this genus in Baltic amber confirmed that the family was represented in the early Cenozoic by genera whose members are presently confined to rather warm or cool, or Mediterranean climatic conditions, either in the South or in the North hemisphere, or cosmopolitan. The past and present distributions of the labidostommatid genera known from Baltic amber are discussed with respect to environmental changes.

Instead, based on ontogeny of the peculiar palpal structure and chaetome of labidostommatids, a case is made that the proximal segment, which bears a single, ventral, postlarval seta, is a basifemur, with the trochanter autapomorphically either coalesced with it or subsumed into the base. Consequently, the second segment is a telofemur, articulating with the third article, which is an unusual, coalescent genuotibia. The phylogenetic significance of various interpretations of segmental coalescence are considered. Ontogenetic studies of palpal musculature and gene expression are needed to provide more substantive evidence.",

External characteristics of Nuttalliellidae relating to Argasidae are the general integument structure, unarmed coxae, hypostome structure, and absence of porose areas. The anteriorly arised capitulum, presence of pseudoscutum (? true scutum), and structural similarity of dorsal and ventral integuments are ixodid characteristics. Unique features to Nuttalliellidae are 3-segmented palpi, pseudoscutum, ball and socket joints, and fenestrated spiracular plates. Internal characteristics of Nuttalliellidae relating to Argasidae are stomach lobe numbers and arrangement, number of Malpighian tubule loops, transverse position of the ovary, bilobed uterus, vaginal division into cervical and vestibular parts, absence of cervical chamber and seminal receptacle, and number of main tracheal trunks. Features relating to Ixodidae are unlobed rectal sac, connecting tube joining uterus with the cervical part of vagina, and presence of a valve between the two parts of vagina. Gene s organ saccular numbers and arrangement are unique to Nuttalliellidae. Thus, the external and internal morphology of Nuttalliellidae combines certain characteristics of the Argasidae, and Ixodidae and also has characters unique to this family. However, N. namaqua will stands as a mysterious tick species among biologists until data on its biology, histophysiology and life-cycle become available. Therefore, it is difficult at this time to determine whether Nuttalliellidae is closely related to Argasidae or Ixodidae.",

    "abstract": "Methods of sampling populations of adult Dermacentor andersoni were tested and compared as part of a 13-year experiment which began in 1959. Tick counts were made in four fields, two of which were stocked with cattle during the tick season for the first five years. Cattle in field A were untreated; in field B, cattle were treated with acaricides or ticks were removed by hand-picking. Fixed quadrats were sampled in all fields. In the two stocked fields, randomly selected quadrats were also sampled. Two smaller fields were kept unstocked for 5 and 4 years respectively. The counts of ticks on cattle were highly correlated to counts of host-seeking ticks on fixed quad rats in field A in 1959-63. Counts of ticks on fixed and randomly selected quadrats showed similar trends in fields A and B in 1963-68. However, the counts on the fixed quadrats needed division by about 4 in field A and by 17 in field B, to give a tick/unit area index comparable to the more extensive random samples. Stratification increased the efficiency of random sampling. The area sampled per day increased with size of quadrat, within the limits tested. Calculations based on six sizes tested in 1967 indicated that minimum standard error would be obtained with 279- m2 quadrats. For future use, stratified random sampling would be the preferred method of sampling ticks on vegetation, but the simpler fixed quad rats may sometimes be useful as indicators of annual trends in numbers, or when they occupy a high proportion of the area to be sampled. Counts of ticks on both cattle and random C}uadrats need transformation before analysis of variance. Tick counts in the two unstocked fields declined only slowly during 1959-63, indicating that exclusion of stock, even for five years, may be ineffective in usefully reducing tick numbers.",

Other species are recorded. In Northern French Alps, all are exophilous (Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus); in Southern French Alps, one of them is exophilous (Rhipicephalus turanicus), but others are burrow-inhabiting (Rhipicephalus pusillus and Ixodes ventalloi, rabbits being the preferred hosts), or endophilous ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). The Carnivora ixodid fauna is almost the same in Northern Alps and in Eastern France, but it is quite different in the Southern French Alps (mediterranean species being involved).

    "abstract": "The biology and mating behavior of the pterygosomid mite, Pterygosoma mutabilis Jack (1961), was studied. Mite colonies were maintained on the lizard host in the laboratory. The active stages (larva, nymph and adults) fed on the host s blood. All developing stages, including quiescent ones, spent their entire life beneath the scales of the host; however, the commonest and longest-lasting stage was larva. Distribution on host body was indiscriminate. Nevertheless, immature stages preferred the venter, while adults favored the dorsum. Eggs were deposited singly and were found at random on the sand of the cage. Duration of stages at 80-90°F: Egg 7-9 days; larva 19-21 days; larval chrysalis 10-12 days; nymph 7-12 days (including nymphochrysalis); adult female 25-30 days. Males lack a nymphal stage; their life span was not determined. A complete generation lasted 68-84 days. The mating behavior of a mature male and female was observed in the laboratory. The male uses a spermatophore in fertilizing the female.",

Dermanyssina, Ascidae). - During the course of а two уеаг microarthropod sampling of soil and litter of ап old pasture in Normandy, it was established that the individuals of ’Neojordensia levis’ originating from the litter layer actually belong to three distinct species. Neojordensia lawrencei Evans (= Lasioseius berlesei (Ouds.) sensu Westerboer = L. frondeus Karg) was also examined then in order to assess the phylogenetical relationships between the last species and the three first ones. These relationships are far from being tlle genus tie. The family Ascidae is clearly delimited; it is indeed necessary to define correctly the familial sets within the соЬ. Dermanyssina in view of systematic investigations. Several additions are supplied to the generic definition of Neojordensia Evans; that of Orthadenеиа п. g.

Rhombognathus auster, R. plumifer (Halacaridae), Halozetes littoralis, H. marinus (Podacaridae) and Hyadesia subantarctica (Hyadesiidae) rapidly establish their dominance in spring and remain ascendant throughout the summer. Predation and competition have minimal impact on the mite populations compared with abiotic (climatic) influences. Low winter temperatures exert an indirect pressure by killing most of the algal substrata, while storms have a more direct effect by removing both mites and algae from the shore. Surviving mites over-winter in the shelter afforded by crevices and among the basal portions of enduring algae.",

At the same time, the nucleus strongly elongates and the nuclear envelope almost completely disappears. Peripherally distributed, flattened and tubular cisternae appear in the late spermatid. These cisternae develop as invaginations of the plasmalemma and their membranes communicate with the plasma membrane. Immediately before entering the lumen of the testis, the spermatozoa develop an additional outer membrane formed on the outside of the plasmalemma. During spermiogenesis mitochondria undergo a structural reorganization, with electron-dense granules appearing in their matrix",

After the damage, the plants were kept free of mites during 15 days. Then, excised leaves of 'Selva' plants and whole 'Milsei Tudla' plants were infested with 10 females, counting the offpring at different intervals. In 'Selva' cultivar, the number of eggs and immatures of T urticae as well as the egg-days/female-days ratio were higher in plants exposed to the highest level of damage. This effect was not detected in 'Milsei Tudla'. The stage survival rates and the duration of stages were unaffected by previous damage in both cultivars. The demographic pattern found in 'Selva' cultivar suggests that induced susceptibility against T urticae is due primarily to differences in fecundity.",

A. arboreus differs from A. persicus by the presence of two pairs of additional median setae. A. hermanni differs by the presence of an additional pair of dorsolateral setae and absent of anterosubmedian setae. Body setae of A. arboreus and A. hermanni longer than in A. persicus. Length and width of body were equal in A. persicus and A. arboreus but smaller in A. hermanni. Dorsal plate displayed very distinct bulging cells in A. hermanni, shallow cells in A. arboreus and slightly bulging wrinkles in A. persicus. This plate is longest in A. hermanni than others.

Chaetotaxy of palps was similar in all three species. Distances between posthypostomal setae (Phl and Ph2) were longer in A. persicus and A. arboreus than in A. hermanni.",

    "abstract": "Neoseiulus Hughes is one of the most diverse genus of Phytoseiidae, with approximately 400 described species. Among them, Neoseiulus tunus (De Leon) is very frequent and abundant in the Neotropical region. Although considerable amount of data about morphological variation of phytoseiid mites are available, the possible causes of intraspecific variations are still poorly understood, being diet and feeding habit usually reported as the main drivers. The present study investigated the influence of three different diets on morphological traits of taxonomic interest of N. tunus, aiming to verify whether diet is a determinant factor in the morphological pattern of this species and which structures are most affected by them. Our results show that based on the diet treatment, populations of N. tunus may be differentiated based on the size of morphological traits. All treatments differ from stock population and among them, except between populations feeding with Aculops lycopersici (Massee) (Eriophyidae) and Tetranychus urticae (Kock) (Tetranychidae). The widest range occurred on the dorsal setae, macrosetae of leg IV, width of the dorsal shield, distance between the bases of the genital’s setae and posterior width of the ventrianal shield. Most of the dorsal setae responded to the treatment with significant variation, being the longest lengths observed when the A. lycopersici was offered as diet. Considering the other two diets, the variation does not present a clear increasing or reducing pattern.",

This mite shows a very close association with the horned-passalus beetle, Popilius disjunctus (Illiger). Significantly more mites attached to beetles at ro0 than at 25°C. A significantly large number of mites attached to beetles that were allowed to move freely in a container compared to beetles restricted to a limited area of the container. Reproduction of this mite occurred only when the female was in direct contact with a beetle. Mites confined with a beetle one, two, three, and four days produced offspring in direct relation to the number of days with a beetle, no offspring being produced by mites with a beetle for only one day. Mated females produced both male and female progeny; unmated females produced only male progeny. Reproduction did not occur at 32°C or below 21°C; maximum reproduction occurred at 28 °C. in these t ests. The primary photo - thermo - and chemo-receptors of this mite appear to be located on legs I. Mites with legs I amputated showed no response to light, temperature, paradichlorobenzene crystals, and did not go on to the host beetle. Mites with only one front leg amputated responded in the some manner as control mites -i.e. mites with both front legs intact. Control mites were negatively photokinetic and responded negatively to paradichlorbenzene crystals. The average preferred temperature for control mites was 27.9°C.",

    "abstract": "The effect of an Assembly Pheromone – Deltamethrin complex (AP – D complex) on the larvae of five ixodid tick species viz. Rhipicephalus sanguineus, R. microplus, R. haemaphysaloides, Hyalomma marginatum and Haemaphysalis bispinosa, as well as the adults of R. sanguineus and R. microplus, was assessed by in vitro bioassays. All the larval as well as adult stages of ticks exposed to the AP – D complex were lured and killed within 24 hours of exposure, except H. bispinosa. Exposure to the AP – D complex for an hour resulted in 70%, 95%, 90%, 90%, 95% mortality of the larval stages of Rhipicephalus sanguineus, R. microplus, R. haemaphysaloides, H. bispinosa and H. marginatum respectively. No mortality was observed when the larval stages of the five tick species were exposed to AP alone (positive control). Exposure of adults to the AP – D complex for an hour resulted 92% and 90% mortality of R. microplus and R. sanguineus, respectively. Negligible mortality was recorded in adult ticks exposed to deltamethrin alone (Negative control), while no mortality was recorded when exposed only to AP (Positive control). Hence, the AP – D complex is better in luring and killing ticks than AP or D alone, regardless of the life stage. Our results suggest that the development of a sustained release AP – D complex device may be an effective means of controlling ticks in India.",

The experiment shows that 15-20 °C is the optimum temperature for rearing Achipteria holomonensis in laboratory. At low constant temperatures mortality of all life stages was minimum, while spermatophores and oviposition were not recorded. Development did not advance at all and animals hardly moved at w·c or remained even inactive at 5 °C. Fungal hyphae cause mortality in Achipteria holomonensis only at high temperatures (20 and 25 °C), while predation by Insecta Staphylinidae and Acari Rhodacaridae as weil as relative humidity above 70% and inundations dont affect the parameters of this species.",

La reponse au stimulus chez Arrenurus rotundus Marshall sur les pupes de deux ceratopogonides, Palpomyia slossonae (Coquillett) et Sphaeromias longipennis (Loew.), est variable et contagieuse, de sorte que la probabilite pour qu'un stimulus intervienne a temps pour grimper sur la mouche en mue s'accroit avec le nombre d'acariens presents sur la pupe. Par contre, une interference entre larves dans les groupes reduit les chances du transfert des larves, de la pupe a la mouche adulte. De nombreuses larves echouent parce que ces reponses soumises a une densite contraire reduisent le nombre des acariens par mouche a un niveau qui ne tue pas prematurement les hotes. Les larves d'Arrenurus qui s'attaquent aux Odonates montrent un ensemble de traits bien differents parce qu'elles n'ont pas besoin de penetrer dans le film de surface de l'eau, et qu'elles disposent de minutes au lieu de secondes, pour s'attacher selectivement sur des hotes qui peuvent supporter des centaines de larves d'acariens au lieu de dizaines.",

Both ears of the hosts were invaded, and the path of approach to the ears appeared to be subalar rather than dorsal as in phalaenodectes.

Dosage mortality relationships were used to measure the susceptibility of A. swirskii to the citrus insecticide dimethoate in laboratory bioassays. In orchards with no or occasional use of organophosphates, the field rate (1.5%) caused high mortality. A. swirskii from populations exposed to frequent applications of dimethoate were resistant (up to 12 times fold) to the field rate. In a moderately resistant population malathion was three times as toxic as dimethoate and diazinon 68 times. The synthetic pyrethroid, deltamethrin was 108 times as toxic. Under field conditions, application of diazinon in this orchard greatly reduced A. swirskii populations for at least 6 months.",

    "abstract": "The name “house dust mites” is commonly used to refer to species of mites belonging mainly to the Pyroglyphidae family (Astigmata) that are found in association with dust in the human dwellings. They represent the main source of allergens in the home and can cause allergic diseases. Mattresses often provide ideal conditions for mite colonization. In order to compare the diversity of house dust mites in the provinces of Panama and Panama Oeste in 2015, we collected dust from the surfaces of mattresses over an area of one square meter using the vacuum method. We obtained 50 samples using the vacuum method and recovered 10,225 mites. We found that the mites in our samples belonged to 15 families, 15 genera and 22 morphospecies. Relatively, high mean densities of mites per gram of dust on mattresses were obtained in the provinces of Panama (3,577 mites/g of dust) and Panama Oeste (6,273 mites/g of dust). The mite Blomia tropicalis was the most abundant species in mattresses in the Province of Panama and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was the most frequent one in Panama Oeste. Our results indicate that the mite community in mattresses is similar between PA and PO. However, our results differ significantly from those found in bedroom floors in a previous study. These differences correspond to a lower species richness, higher density and relative abundance of Astigmata mites in mattresses.",

    "abstract": "Ethnobiology is the science that identifies, describes, and classifies organisms with a cultural importance that are utilized by a particular human group. The term ‘cultural importance’ refers to the way people perceive an organism either as food or ornament, the role they play in the myths and legends in a region or even their usage in religious and civic ceremonies. Despite the high biological diversity of Acari, their cultural importance has been poorly studied, with information scarce and scattered. In this paper, I define ethnoacarology as the branch of acarology that compiles, documents, and analyzes the cultural values given to mites and ticks by a particular human group. I conducted a bibliographic search in databases with a combination of words: articles were classified according to the cultural values given to Acari. Thirty articles were recovered: most of them focused on the traditional knowledge and management of Acari and tick-borne diseases and other acariasis. I recognized five categories for the cultural value of Acari: 1) vernacular and autochthonous names; 2) management of pests and diseases; 3) Acari in oral and written tradition; 4) Acari and toponymy, and 5) entomophagy and traditional medicine. Citizen science represents an opportunity for acarology to obtain this type of data faster. Making people part of an acarological community could derive in faster data obtention, alternative techniques for the management of pests and diseases, the revalidation of traditional knowledge, and the participation of society in decision-making that can open the door to obtaining financing, among other benefits.",

    "abstract": "Fortuynia atlantica, is a sexually dimorphic oribatid mite and although observations are lacking, direct sperm transfer is assumed. We found an additional sexual dimorphism in claw morphology, with females showing relatively smaller and more curved claws, which may point to a possible direct contact during reproduction. Males possess lateral notogastral projections and these could be used as ‘handles’ by the females in the course of some kind of mating. The claws of the females are large enough to embrace the male’s lateral projections and the females’ first legs are long enough to attach to the males’ body from behind without hampering its movement with the rest of the legs. Based on these indications, we propose a hypothetical mating scenario where the male attracts females via pheromones, the female approaches from behind and clasps with the claws of the leg I the ’handles’ of the male. This stimulates the male to deposit a stalkless spermatophore and in a final step the male leads the still attached female over the spermatophore to absorb it. Observation of living specimens is ultimately necessary to verify the existence of the proposed or any other mating behaviour.",

Juveniles of Fortuynia elamellata micromorpha are well in accordance with the morphology of other known juveniles of Fortuynia, but the larva of the former shows distinctly barbed rostral setae, a trait which lacks in all the other species. Adults of the South African Selenoribates divergens are similar in morphology to the Egyptian specimens, except for the presence of small rostral humps, anterior notogastral tubercles and the position of lyrifissure ih. These differences are presently considered to be only geographic variation. Juveniles of Sel. divergens can be easily distinguished from juveniles of other known Selenoribates species by the presence of a spinose clavate bothridial seta and branched notogastral setae in deuto- and tritonymph. Due to the loss of type specimens of Schusteria ugraseni, a neotype was designated. The juveniles of this species are very similar to those of Schusteria littorea and Schusteria melanomerus, but differ in amongst others the anoadanal and leg setation. Adults of Halozetes capensis show strong variation in the length of dorsal setae and juveniles of this species differ significantly from others in the number of prodorsal and gastronotic porose sclerites.

Therefore, we looked for the specimens used in the original description of L. communis and successfully found 14 specimens on five glass slides (Nos. 2698-2702) deposited in the Natural History Museum of Basel. Comparative study of morphological characteristics between real specimens and the original descriptions by Walter (1925) was carried out in order to specify the material used in the descriptions of female, male, and nymph of L. communis. As a result, it was confirmed that the female on slide No. 2700, the male on slide No. 2701, and the nymph on slide No. 2702 were the specimens used in the original description of L. communis. Consequently, we designated the female on slide No. 2700 as the lectotype and the male on slide No. 2701 and the nymph on slide No. 2702 as the paralectotypes of L. communis. Redescriptions of the female, male, and nymph of L. communis were also given on the basis of the newly designated types to provide additional information on morphological characteristics of the species.",

Microzetes (Microzetes) samarensis n. sp. differs from other species of the subgenus by the insertions of notogastral setae c and la (close to each other vs. distanced in the other species). Updated generic and subgeneric diagnoses for Microzetes are given. The taxonomic status of Teraja Mahunka, 1995 and the systematic placement of representatives of this genus are discussed, resulting in the following taxonomic proposals: Microzetes Berlese, 1913 (=Teraja Mahunka, 1995) n. syn.; M. (Microzetes) asymmetricus (Mahunka, 2001) n. comb.; M. (Microzetes) sungai (Mahunka, 1997) n. comb.; M. (Megazetes) wongi (Mahunka, 1995) n. comb. The initial systematic placement of Microzetes flagellifer and M. tuberculatus (in the subgenus Microzetes) is supported, and the inclusion of M. fimbriatus in Microzetes (Megazetes) and Megazetes rugosus (Mahunka, 1986) in M.

The effect of temperature on the developmental time and the survival rate of E. hirsti feeding on fig leaves was determined at six constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, 32 and 35 ░C. The total developmental time of females (from egg to adult emergence) at the above-mentioned temperatures was 41.29, 24.15, 16.95, 12.35, 10.21 and 10.67 days, respectively. The lower, optimal and upper developmental threshold (Tmin, Topt and Tmax, respectively) and thermal constant (<I>K</I>) of the pest were estimated by ordinary linear and Logan 6 nonlinear models. The lower temperature threshold (Tmin) and thermal constant (K) of the immature stages were estimated to be 9.86 ░C and 239.48 degree-days (DD), respectively. The Topt and Tmax were estimated to be 34.30 and 35.44 ░C, respectively. As the temperature increased from 15 to 30 ░C, the survival rate of immature stages increased from 33.33 to 70.59 %, then decreased and reached 54.91 % at 35 ░C. Temperature-dependent development data, thermal requirements and temperature thresholds can be used to predict the occurrence, number of generations and population dynamics of E. hirsti.",

    "abstract": "Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Trouessart, 1897) (Acariformes: Astigmata: Pyroglyphidae) is amongst the most common house dust mites (HDMs) species in Europe. Vacuuming is commonly employed as a method for the recovery for the subsequent quantification of mite densities. The vacuuming protocols employed and their efficiencies are frequently unreported. In this study, a constant-flow vacuum sampler was used to evaluate the recovery of laboratory-reared D. pteronyssinus from cotton, denim or fleece. Two vacuuming protocols were employed. Protocol 1 (P1) entailed a single unidirectional pass of the vacuum head across the fabrics for 60, 90 or 120 seconds. For Protocol 2 (P2), fabrics were vacuumed twice (laterally followed by diagonally) for the same time periods. Vacuuming was carried out on fabrics seeded with live mites (LM), dead mites (DM), and live mites, which were applied to fabric surfaces for 10 minutes and then euthanized by freezing prior to vacuum sampling (EM). There was a significant difference (P&lt;0.001) in mean HDMs recovery with regard to mite viability (LM, DM, EM), fabric type (cotton, denim, fleece), duration of sampling (60, 90, 120s) and vacuuming protocols employed (P1, P2). The numbers of mites recovered from fleece (compared to cotton and denim) were lower for each treatment type where LM and EM were deployed. Overall, the use of protocol 2 resulted in the greatest mean percentage recovery (&gt;80%) of dust mites for all fabrics combined. Recovery rates were also influenced by entrapment of mites (or active attachment) in the fabric microstructure within the weave. The results have implications for the standardisation of mite recovery from fabrics by means of vacuuming.",

    "abstract": "Neoseiulus ramabettaensis n. sp. Döker and Jose is described based on specimens collected from Karnataka, India. The new species is accommodated to the cucumeris species group and ceratoni species subgroup in the genus Neoseiulus Hughes (Acari: Phytoseiidae). The morphological characters including conspicuously longer setae j1 and j3, in addition to Z4 and Z5, chelicera dentition, wider ventrianal shield at anterior corners, large crescentic preanal pores, absence of macroseta on legs II-IV, and presence of macroseta on genu I distinguished the new species from its congeners in the ceratoni species subgroup. The current study describes a macroseta on leg I (SgeI) for a species listed in the ceratoni species subgroup for the first time. Indeed, the presence of SgeI, and the absence of macroseta on leg IV are unusual characters for the genus Neoseiulus, except SgeI present in a few species in Neoseiulus desertus species group. Therefore, chaetotaxy of legs frequently used in the systematics of other groups of Mesostigmata which are closely related to the phytoseiid mites, seems to be an important morphological character and should be included in future descriptions. In addition, we constructed an identification key for the Indian species of the genus.",

The morphology of exobothridial seta, gnathosoma and ovipositor, and the identification of leg setae and solenidia are given for the first time for this species. The revised generic diagnosis, identification key, distribution, and habitats of all known representatives of Discoppia Balogh, 1983 are presented. Some taxonomic nuances within Discoppia are discussed, resulting in the following proposals: Oppia bifidus Bayoumi and Al-Khalifa, 1985 is a junior synonym of D. (C.) cylindrica; Oppia agricola Fujikawa, 1982 is not synonym of D. (C.) cylindrica and transferred to the genus Microppia Balogh, 1983; Oppia tenuis Hammer, 1958 is not representative of Discoppia; Discoppia (Cylindroppia) rostroincisa Subías and Rodríguez, 1986 n. stat. (instead of the existing subspecies status). Together with D. (C.) cylindrica, in the same samples, two rare Oppiidae species were found: Oxyoppia (Oxyoppiella) minuscula Hugo-Coetzee, Lotfollahi, Abbasi-Kalo and Movahedzade, 1917 (known only from the open habitats in Iran) is first recorded in Russia; Graptoppia (Stenoppia) boucheri Ermilov and Frolov, 2021 (known from passalid beetles collected in Ghana and Gabon, West Africa) is first found in the Palaearctic.

For the morphometric study, photomicrographs of mites from two colonies kept in the laboratory were taken: one derived from a single female of the aberrant Brevipalpus that was collected on citrus in Tetipac, Guerrero State, Mexico and provisionally designated as Brevipalpus sp. (Tetipac); another derived from a single female collected in Texcoco, Mexico State [hereafter, B. californicus (Texcoco)]. The observed characteristics were compared with slide-mounted specimens of B. lewisi McGregor and B. californicus Baker from their respective type series. From specimens of each species, 37 morphometric characters were evaluated and compared using univariate and multivariate analysis (principal components and clusters). In the molecular characterization, specimens of Brevipalpus sp. (Tetipac) and B. californicus (Texcoco) were used. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on two segments of the COI and one of the 28S genes. Acquisition and inoculation tests of CiLV-C and OFV-citrus were carried out using larvae, nymphs, and adult females of Brevipalpus sp. (Tetipac), on the indicator plants Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Fabaceae), Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Brassicaceae), and sweet orange [Citrus x sinensis (L.) Osbeck. ‘Valencia’; Rutaceae]. In this last host, B. californicus (Texcoco) and B. yothersi were added as controls. To detect these viruses, specific primers for each of them were used. Univariate analyses showed that only 17 morphological characters were significantly different among mite species. The multivariate analysis showed that Brevipalpus sp. (Tetipac) and B. californicus (Texcoco) are not separate entities; therefore, both were determined as B. californicus s.l. The molecular characterization showed similar results. In the acquisition tests, only two of the 90 replicates were positive for CiLV-C, whereas 84 of the 90 replicates were positive for OFV-citrus. In the inoculation tests, symptoms did not appear in the indicator plants A. thaliana and P. vulgaris after being infested with Brevipalpus sp. (Tetipac) carrying the OFV-citrus. Small nuclear-leprosis-like lesions were only observed on C. sinensis after infestation by viruliferous Brevipalpus sp. (Tetipac). However, RT-PCR did not confirm the presence of OFV-citrus in these plants. In contrast, control plants infested with viruliferous B. californicus (Texcoco) developed leprosis symptoms and the presence of OFV-citrus was confirmed by RT-PCR.",

    "abstract": "Spirodiclofen is characterized by a relatively slow acaricidal action against adult females of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), with reduction of their fecundity (eggs laid/female) and fertility (eggs hatched/female). Exposure of pre-ovipositing T. urticae females to the acaricide may affect population growth, considering that a high reproduction of young females is crucial in the population biology of this colonizing species. Effects of spirodiclofen on life-history traits and population parameters of T. urticae were evaluated in demographic bioassay using the age-stage two-sex life table, constructed in fecundity-based and fertility-based variants. The acaricide was applied against pre-ovipositing females in a series of nine concentrations, starting from the recommended field rate (96 mg/l). The treatments with concentrations ranging from 12 - 96 mg/l significantly reduced fecundity and longevity, while 27 - 40% of females didn’t lay eggs. Exposure was lethal to 2 - 21% of the females, of whom a large majority didn’t lay eggs. A considerable part of surviving females also failed to lay eggs within the first four post-treatment days (when around 50% of all eggs in the control were laid) i.e., they were sterilized by the acaricide. At the same time, the percentage of dead females rose to 17 - 55%, mainly due to the mortality of sterilized females. The three highest concentrations (24 – 96 mg/l) significantly reduced the net reproductive rate (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (λ), by 49-72%, 20-34%, and 4-6%, respectively, compared to the control. This reduction was mainly the result of sterilization and high mortality of treated females, in combination with reduced fecundity and longevity of reproductive ones. Application of the fertility-based life table showed significant decrease of r and λ (by 23-40%, and 4-7%, respectively, compared to the control), in the treatments with the three highest concentrations. The short-lived transovarial toxic effect observed in the fertility-based life table was not sufficient to cause a significant reduction in population parameters, compared to those acquired by the fecundity-based life table.",

A voucher specimen of Nicrophorus vespillo (L., 1758) housed in the historical collection at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History (OUMNH) was examined for its 456 plus phoretic mites, which were carefully glued to cardboard slides and preserved together with the beetle carrier. Due to the fragility of the samples, only the Mesostigmata mites were prepared for mounting and further species identification. With the addition of 6 hypopi of Histiostomatidae, a total of 462 mites were identified. Four hypopi were found attached on the Parasitidae dorsal shields and two glued to the cardboard surface. The remaining 456 were composed of 445 specimens of two populations of Poecilochirus carabi Canestrini and Canestrini, 1882 (Parasitidae), and 11 specimens identified as two populations of Macrocheles nataliae Bregetova et Koroleva, 1960. We discuss the interaction and diversity of the numerous mites recorded on a single N. vespillo host. We propose that the presence of different populations of phoretic mites on a single carrier is beneficial to the mites, increasing their chances of outbreeding, adding to their genetic diversity.

    "abstract": "Dynamique spatio-temporelle des populations de Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille, 1806) (Acariens: Ixodoidea) dans une cite HLM de Marseille. - The brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus is known as the main reservoir and the most efficient (or even the only) vector of the Mediterranean Spotted Fever in the Meditterranean part of Southern France. The aim of this study is to delineate the areas populated by the tick in an ’HLM’ housing estate situated in the northern suburban districts of Marseille and to specify the dynamics of its populations in the summer period. Over 25 per cent of all estate houses have a dog. Though most of these pets are parasitized by R. sanguineus, dog parasitism seems on the whole to be kept under relative control. However, some microfocuses of ticks do exist. They are linked to the presence of a small number of hyperparasitised hosts and make it possible for the whole cycle to take place and the species to proliferate. Two types of microfocuses have been observed. The first one is called ’closed’ because the dog is confined indoors. The second, or ’open’ type, in which the dog is kept outside the house but very close to it, enables the spreading of the tick and the graft of the species in public areas (such as the place where dustbins are kept, or sports grounds). In restricted areas forming suitable ecological niches (with a screen against the wind and a high enough relative humidity) the engorged nymph is, of all stages, the most favourable to the spreading. In epidemiological terms. the consequence is an increased probability of the encountering of human with ticks, beyond the limits of the primary microfocuses. The larval stage is the shortest-lived one. The two orther stages (nymphs and adults) may be observed throughout the summer period. The observations performed during the summer of 1989 enable us to believe that a second wave of adults emerges in the month of August and becomes immediately active.",

A similar constraint probably applies to other - if not most - arthropods and calyptostases are considered to be indicators of such a developmental constraint. However, this constraint escapes traditional analysis for several reasons, such as the weakness of traditional terminologiy, the underuse of an appropriate methodology able to detect the presence of calyptostases, and some reluctance to take into account these regressed states.",

Two hundred and forty birds (39.4 070) were found infested with parasitic mites. In total 1375 mites were collected from the trapped birds, belonging to 16 species of sarcoptiforme and 6 species of mesostigmatic mites. S. senegalensis and Columba IMa were infested with 13 and 8 species of parasitic mites respectively, with the other wild bird hosts being infested with fewer species of mites. The possible role of wild birds as a reservoir of parasitic mites to the domestic fowl is discussed with particular reference to Ornithonyssus sylviarum, O. bursa and Megninia ginglymura. The last species is reported for the first time from poultry in Israel.",

The luminal part of plasmalemma forms scarce microvilli. The mononuclear muscle cells with the maximal thickness of 5 micormeter, as measured at the level of nucleus, possess numerous processes and in their cytoplasm there are mitochondria, microtubules, cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum, lysosome-like vacuoles, and myofibrils composed of thick and thin myofilaments. Each of thick filaments (200 Angstrom) is surrounded by 10 to 12 thin filaments (50 Angstrom). The Z lines show irregular contours. The basement membrane enclosing from the outside the whole vas deferens, consists of several layers, each zoo A thick. The secretory role of epithelial cells in the vas deferens is discussed.",

The effect of four different techniques of soil management was tested. In total, 40 species of Gamasina were identified, 11 of which were new to the Swiss fauna. Their average abundance varied from 718 to 970 individuals/m2, and was not affected by the different soil cultivation methods. The different methods did have an influence on the composition of Gamasina communities, which proved to be more rich and diverse in the rows that were lightly tilled every alternate year. Chemically weeded rows were found to be the least avourable for diversity of Gamasina. At the species level, Hypoaspis aculeifer benefited from light tilling of the soil whereas Asca bicornis developed best in the permanent grass cover variant. With the exception of Neoseiulus alpinus, very few Phytoseiidae were observed in vineyard soil litter. The presence of several Pergamasinae species, together with Veigaia planicola, is rather characteristic of a stable agrarian system.",

    "abstract": "In the present work, the parasitic mite Riccardoella eweri, which was first described by Lawrence (1952), is being recorded in Egypt for the first time on the Maculated Egyptian Toad - Bufo regularis Reuss. Observations are made on the general form of the body bath from binocular examination of anaesthetised live mites and from mounted preparations. The body is heart-shaped and not aval as mentioned by Lawrence (1952). The different mouth parts coristituting. the gnathosoma are described in detail. The number and position of the body hairs of the mite are given. The legs are described and the number of hairs on their different segments recorded and found out to differ from one leg to the other. Special attention is given to the tarsal hairs concerning their position and n,umber. In this concern, leg I is shawn to present marked differences from leg II, which in turn differs from legs III and IV. The latter two have the same tarsal hairs. The genital opening and the area of skin in its immediate neighbourhood are described in detail in bath sexes. Such differentiation between the male form and the female form is being carried out for the first time, and is based on the constant occurence of ova or developing young in the female form, and a testis with tiny sperm cells in the male form. The tracheal system of the larval and early nymphal stages is examined and found to agree with Lawrence s (1952) description. A tracheal system in the adult is being described here for the first time and is found to have a pair of stigmata opening on the inner edges of the bases of the mandibles. The two main tracheal tnunks give off a considerable number of branches and are connected through transverse commissures. The whole system does not extend backwards further than the region of the 2nd coxae.",

Population abundance of the eriophyid mango prey were affected by climatic conditions, predation, shady and sunny zones and vertical distribution. A control measure of one winter acaricides treatment, applied after budding, seemed to be the most successful management of the harmful mites. Higher temperature enhanced development of A. mangiferae and M. mangiferae. Some of the life table parameters varied greatly, especially at 25 °C and 60 % RH and 35 °C and 50 % RH.

Both species typically produce stalked spermatophores, although A. inexpectatus deposits spermatophores singly and C. bermudensis in groups. Occasional spermatophagy could be observed by specimens of A. inexpectatus. Oviposition was observed for all species and time from deposition to eclosion ranged from 15 to 30 days.

Pour ce faire, ils ont essaye d'etablir une comparaison entre les donnees nosologiques et les donnees acarologiques (fluctuation des populations de tiques), en mettant a profit les donnees de la litterature. Les bases acarologiques etant notablement insuffisantes, un complement d'information a ete acquis grâce a l'implantation d'un reseau de stations d'etude distribuees dans chacun des trois grands secteurs climatologiques (climat oceanique frais, climat oceanique doux, climat a tendance continentale). L'etude mensuelle des effectifs de tiques dans sept massifs forestiers a permis la recolte d'environ 20.000 individus et de suivre la cinetique des stases vectrices (plus particulierement la stase nymphale) dans des contextes ecologiques divers. La duree d'incubation de la maladie etant classiquement d' un mois, on constate, dans tous les cas, un delai trop important entre l'acme des populations nymphales, stase consideree comme la plus vectrice (fixation plus frequente sur l'homme) et l'acme des cas de E.C.M. Par contre, aux U.S.A., une correlation entre E.C.M. et acme des populations d'Ixodes «dammini» aurait ete constatee, la stase nymphale etant egalement incriminee. Ce fait montre que l'importance des populations vectorielles n'est pas seule en cause et que d'autres facteurs peuvent intervenir de facon predominante (variations d'agressivite des populations de tiques, variations de la frequence d'infestation des tiques par Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. au cours de l'annee, variations de l'intensite du contact homme-vecteur...).",

With an average for all investigated textiles of 90 living mites per sqm the most abundant species was D. pteronyssinus. The analysis was done after vacuuming carpets, mattresses and stuffed furniture. Possible recolonization was followed after mite control by an acaricide based on solidified benzyl benzoate (ACAROSAN). During the first 6 months after the mite-control no reactivation of the mite populations arrived. The number of dead mites increased in the first months after the acaricidal treatment. Only 12 months later a slow recovery of the Dermatophagoides species population could be observed. However, even after 2 years this population reached only about 10 % of the original density. A slow recolonization of the mattresses and the upholstery by Cheyletus was observed too, whereas storage mites (Acarus sp., Glycyphagus sp., Tyrophagus sp., Tarsonemus sp.) did not reappear after the single acaricidal treatment. Thus it is to be seen that at least during two years the living conditions of the mites in their biotopes are definitively changed after the application of the acaricide.",

In a recent survey, Gaeolaelaps aculeifer (Canestrini) and Parasitus bituberosus Karg, two soil-dwelling predatory mite species (Acari: Mesostigmata), were found associated with this crop at Boyacá department, Colombia. Given that T. tabaci spends its pre-pupal and pupal stages in the soil, this study was conducted to evaluate the predation and oviposition of G. aculeifer and P. bituberosus on these developmental stages under laboratory conditions. The predators consumed up to 6.8 ± 0.52 and 6.9 ± 0.45 T. tabaci pre-pupae/ pupae, respectively, when offered 6 –10 prey a day. The maximum oviposition rates were 4.4 ± 0.25 eggs/female/day for G. aculeifer and 6.9 ± 0.26 eggs/female/day for P. bituberosus, with a mean egg viability higher than 91% for both predators. These results suggest that the evaluated predators may affect the population of T. tabaci under field conditions, and that the conduction of complementary studies on those predators is warranted, envisioning their practical use for T. tabaci control in Colombia.",

The leg structures are scarcely correlated one with other, with the exception of the spur on trochanters II and III in the males. There are not significant partial nor multiple correlations in the covariation of dorsal scutal pattern. A very high degree of variation in gnathosomal and spiracular features has been observed, and these structures are strongly correlated between them; however the allometric growth of palpi, basis capituli, and cornua, is not linked. None of these anatomical peculiarities are useful in the taxonomie separation of the marginatus complex of ’species’, although the paratypic series of D. niveus was included into the studied specimens. The cladistic analysis display the existence of several ’groups’ of specimens, or ’morphotypes’ , and a clinal variation can be observed in the length and breadth of some gnathosomal structures; such a variation is not evident in the shape of spiracular plate nor relative size of dorsal palpal spur.",

The performance of a previously described flotation method used for the detection of mites present in food and feed samples was assessed. This method could analyse a wide variety of dust and debris of varying sample weight. Its validation was performed using ten replicates of both 0.5g and 2.0g of dust samples obtained from offices and homes and seeded with a known number of labelled mites to assess accuracy. The minimum mean recovery was 76%, achieved with no statistically significant difference in performance due to sample size. To test the method's vigour, more than three hundred samples collected from different domestic (bedroom and living room) and occupational (office, factory and warehouse) environments were analysed. Of these samples, about 88% and 78% obtained from the domestic and office environment contained mites. In total, 48 mite taxa were detected of which 31 were identified to species level with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus being the most abundant species. In addition 26% and 15% of domestic and office samples respectively, contained mites well in excess of the lower threshold limit of ca. 100 mites that is considered to cause sensitisation. It was concluded that the method is versatile in application and can be a valuable tool for future investigations on the occurrence of house dust mites.",

External attributes agree with previous descriptions. The preapical process on tibia and genu IV is described for the first time in this species. Mating females show a depression of the postanal cuticle, which seems to be a topographic reference for seminal reception organs. A key for motile stages of this species, based in the chaetotaxy and differential attributes between sexes, is presented. The study of 43 numeric variables, show: (i) the possibility to establish a model of three categories of variables (populational, sexual primary and sexual secondary), which are the numerical representation for the traditional concepts of sexual homomorphism, sexual primary dimorphism and secondary sexual dimorphism; and (ii) the factors pigmentation and female gravid state define a second type of intrapopulational variability within the adult life history. This model may represent an instrument to clarify the systematic, diagnostic, ecological and taxonomic relatedness of groups belonging to the family Acaridae and the major group Astigmata.",

The two species could be clearly separated based on the length of seta S5 and the ratio of setae Z5/S5. In a 28S tree, the examined strains also formed separate clades with 100% bootstrap values.

The genus Plesialges syn. n. is synonymized with the genus Hemialges. A new diagnosis, comments on taxonomy and an updated checklist of species are provided for the genus Hemialges. The transfer of P. mimus to the genus Hemialges created a conflict with the previously named Hemialges mimus Trouessart, 1920 from the Trumpet Manucode, Phonygammus keraudrenii (Lesson &amp; Garnot) (Passeriformes: Paradisaeidae). Hemialges mimus (Trouessart, 1919) comb. n. is now the older homonym within this genus and H. mimus Trouessart, 1920 from the Trumpet Manucode is a junior homonym; here I provide the latter with a new name, Hemialges trouessarti nom. n.",

    "abstract": "The tetranychid Tetranychus turkestani Ugarov and Nikolskii is a serious pest of many important crops around the world. Management of T. turkestani by augmentative biological control using predators such as the phytoseiid Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot) is envisioned as an environmentally safe alternative to acaricides. Foundational knowledge on T. turkestani – A. swirskii interactions in the laboratory are necessary to predict the outcome of A. swirskii augmentative releases in the field. In this study, the functional and numerical responses of adult A. swirskii females feeding on immature stages of T. turkestani were determined in the laboratory. Prey densities were 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 individuals per Petri dish arena. The functional response of A. swirskii to prey showed a Holling's type II response. The attack rate and handling time estimates from the random predator equation were 0.1148/h and 0.3146 h, respectively, indicating that A. swirskii consumed 76.28 individuals per day at the maximum level. The number of eggs laid by the predator, i.e., the numerical response, increased as host density increased up to a maximum of 33.10 eggs per female; then oviposition rate leveled-off. This study suggests that A. swirskii is a suitable candidate for augmentative biological control of T. turkestani but follow-up experiments in greenhouses or open fields are necessary.",

Yeast and F. oxysporum gave the highest reproductive rate as compered to feeding on F. solani. Ontogenetic setal development in the comparative study of the two eupodid life stages indicated that the dorsal idiosomal chaetotaxy and number of pseudanal setae remained unchanged throughout life cycle. The increase in genital flap length at each moult is accompained by an increase in the number of setae situated on the flaps and the number of these setae provides the simplest method of separating the nymphal stages. The cheatotaxy of coxae and trochanters also provide a method to separate nymphal stages.",

Extracts of both parts of the plant, prepared from various solvents were affected the behavior, toxicity and fecundity of females under laboratory conditions. Ethyl acetate extract of leaves and fruits was the most potent extract tested against eggs and adult females of T. urticae. In contrast, ethanol extract of fruits was the least effective extract against both tested stages. The egg stage was less susceptible to most different extracts of both parts of C. aegyptia. Leaf discs treated with LC50 concentration of various extracts showed a high percentage of repellency in case of ethanol extract from leaves and fruits (86.67 and 96.42 %), respectively. Treated females with LC50 concentration of different extracts showed a higher remarkable percentage of mortality as well as a reduction in the total number of eggs laid during 15 days with fruit extracts than that with leaves extract.",

Usually reported from domestic fowl and man, this tick s wild hosts should be further sought by examination of nests of swallows and other birds. The small size of individuals in population samples from U.S.S.R. and India, in relation to those from Europe, northwestern Africa, and Palestine, suggests the presence of a large western form and a small eastern form of O. coniceps. Larvae from India are necessary in order:finally to settle the question of differentiation of this population from O. capensis Neumann, and additional studies of capensis samples from many parts of the world are required for a satisfactory taxonomie disposition of this complex.",

The results obtained may be sum.marized as follows: 1. The susceptibility of adult female mites to dicofol, omethoate and cypermethrin applied sequentially over three generations was studied. Susceptibility was varied due to the type of chemical as well as to the scheme of insecticidal sequences used. 2. Biological studies indicate that the life span of selected mites was extended, this was more pronounced in the schemes of (cypermethrin / cypermethrin / cypermethrin) - and (cypermethrin / dicofol / omethoate) - selected strains. Also, egg production was significantly increased in case of (cypermethrin / cypermethrin / cypermethrin) - selected strain, while decreased in case of (omethoate / omethoate / omethoate) - selected strain. The percent of hatchability was significantly decreased, this was highly occurred in (cypermethrin / omethoate / dicofol) - selected strain. 3. Field studies show that plots sprayed successively three times with dicofol recorded the highest reduction in mite population infesting soybean plants. The contrary was obtained in plots sprayed successively three times with cypermethrin. This indicate the necessity of using specific potent acaricide on soybean in case cypermethrin is used to control the cotton leafworm to avoid outbreak of mite infestation.",

Many surviving juvenile mites did not successfully complete their development to adult: 8 hours at 0 degrees C was sufficient to prevent almost all development. The longevity of surviving treated adults was reduced, but there was little reduction in the adult longevity of surviving treated juvenile stages. Both duration and level of low temperature exposure affected the fecundity of treated adults. Treatment at the deutonymph stage-also affected the fecundity of the resulting adults. Male fertility was unaffected by low temperature exposure, except possibly at the longest exposure durations. Development of the surviving treated immature stages was retarded; the temperature experienced had more effect than the duration of exposure.",

On the other hand, the features of great taxonomic importance, showing little or so far unnoticed individual varaition, include: shape of sensillus, lenght of exobothridial setae and shape of setae c3. Analysis of these features had led to the synonymy of six species, and the description of two new species. Hence, the number of known Oriental species of Apoplophora is nine; four of which are endemic, two of wider distribution in the Orient, and three are more widely distributed species, introduced to the south and esatern Palearctic, north Australia and western Pacific islands.

At this temperature mortality is lowest, developmental rate fastest, and larviposition greatest - thus providing for the highest intrinsic rate of increase (rm) of a population. Temperatures of 30°C or higher inhibit molting, and a temperature of I5°C does not allow the development of most mites to proceed past the tritonymphal stage. N. arboricola feeds on decaying leaves that fall into the treehole from surrounding vegetation. Food source (species of tree) has a great influence on the immature mortality rate, developmental rate, adult survivorship, reproductive success and intrinsic rate of increase of a population. Thus by contributing the food source, the species of plants surrounding a treehole determine the abundance of N. arboricola within the treehole. N. arboricola has a rather low intrinsic rate of increase compared to other acarid mites. This probably evolved as an adaption to the seasonal influx of food into the treehole, as well as to the stable habitat in which they live.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to describe the developmental biology of the tick Ornithodoros peruvianus Kohls, Clifford and Jones under laboratory conditions. A total of 174 live specimens of O. peruvianus at different stages were collected from caves located on Pan de Azúcar Island (26°09’S, 70°41’W) and Tal Tal (25°15’S, 70°15’W). In the laboratory, ticks were fed on rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and kept in acrylic tubes under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature (average of 75% +/- 5 and 23 +/- 1°C, respectively), and a 12 hour photoperiod. The minimum period between stages were: oviposition to egg hatching: 9 days; larva to nymph one: 44 days (44-56); nymph one to nymph two: 10 days (10-20); nymph two to male: 66 days (66-84); nymph two to nymph three: 68 days, and nymph three to female: 42 days. Oviposition occurred in 24 females, with an average of 70 (15-133) eggs per female after the first bloodmeal. The total time to complete the cycle under laboratory conditions was 185 days on average (SD = 17.43). O. peruvianus may require three nymphal stages to molt into an adult female and only two to molt into an adult male. The selected environmental conditions, host and photoperiod are important factors that must now be considered to better understand the factors that affect developmental times of this tick.",

Both species belong to the merulae species group, being morphologically closest to other two species of the genus, previously described from birds of the family Turdidae in Asia (Japan): M. sibirica Kuroki, Nagahori and Mironov, 2006 and M. aurea Kuroki, Nagahori and Mironov, 2006, respectively. The new species most clearly differ from those described in Japan by the dorsal shield ornamentation. In both sexes of M. hernandesi sp. n., the ornamentation of the prodorsal and hysteronotal shields is represented by round and ovate lacunae, and the ornamentation of the lobar shield of females has few ovate lacunae. In both sexes of M. caerulea sp. n., the ornamentation of the hysteronotal shield is very particular, with large and almost round lacunae in the anterior half and small ovate lacunae in the posterior half.",

Pacific Northwest forest habitats of western Canada have high relative diversity of peloppiid mites representing species of the genera Ceratoppia, Dendrozetes, and Metrioppia. Many of these are newly described species that are seemingly endemic to the region. Here I review the status and diversity of Peloppiidae from North America, and summarize the distributions of described species. Despite recent efforts, significant work remains. Within Ceratoppia two widely-distributed and established species have considerable morphological variation, while the type specimens are missing or destroyed, making confirmation of new specimens difficult. For other genera, extensive review of the Canadian National Collections in Ottawa, Canada suggest there are at least four undescribed species of North American Peloppiidae - two potentially new species of Paenoppia, and new species each of Parapyroppia and Pyroppia.",

Previous studies conducted in America have focused on the biological control of RPM through predatory mites and insects. Stethorus tridens Gordon (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is considered a promising biocontrol agent of phytophagous mites it has been observed on several cultures, and has a high predatory capacity. The aim of this study was to investigate S. tridens preferences among different developmental stages of RPM and estimating the functional and numerical responses of S. tridens over its most preferred prey-stage. Furthermore, the prey preference of S. tridents was examined between eggs of Tetranychus evansi Baker and Pritchard (its natural prey) and eggs of RPM through two-choice and non-choice experiments. The results showed that S. tridens prey on all developmental stages of RPM, with a marked preference for eggs over other stages of RPM. The functional response of this predator was type III, as consumption increased rapidly at intermediate egg densities. Predation on RPM eggs was unable to stimulate S. tridens reproduction, even at the highest densities. When we compared the food preference of S. tridens to eggs of T. evansi and RPM, we found that the predator preferred tetranychids. The results of this study suggested that RPM can be used as alternative prey to S. tridents, serving as a source of energy and allows for maintenance but not its reproduction.",

This study deals with a description of A. bisetosa n. sp., accompanied by detailed illustrations drawn under a differential interference contrast microscope and scanning electron microscope photomicrographs. Additionally, it includes a character comparison table of the A. brevipalpus group and a key for known Agauopsis species in the northwest Pacific, both including the new species.",

    "abstract": "Flies are often found in poultry facilities due to the utilization of bird faeces as a substrate for their larval development. Despite the use of pesticides for fly control in poultry houses, the potential contribution of natural enemies in assisting with fly control deserves attention. This study aimed to assess the diversity and abundance of predatory and phoretic mites associated with flies in two laying hens poultry houses in Minas Gerais, Brazil (ASA and GSJ). By placing 24 pan traps around the sheds of each poultry house, we captured adult flies and mites adhering to these flies over the course of three samplings in each poultry house. Musca domestica was found to be the most abundant fly species in both places. Phoretic, predatory and saprophagous mites belonging to the genera Prodinychus, Parasitus, Sejus, Callidosoma, Macrocheles, Eupodes and the family Nothridae were collected at GSJ. In contrast, only one mite genus, Trichotrombidium was found at ASA. In addition, a notable contrast in mite abundance was observed between the two poultry houses, with a total of 181 mite specimens associated with flies in the GSJ, compared to 13 in the ASA. While these findings underscore the presence of a diverse mite community associated with flies in poultry houses, we discuss the potential factors contributing to the observed differences between them, shedding light on the ecological contribution of mites within poultry houses.",

Three different plant growth stages (young: 2nd trifoliate- leaf formation, middle: pre-flowering, old; fruit formation) were infested with four mite densities (0, 20, 40, 80 (adult mites/plant)) and four replications per treatment in completely randomized design were used. The infested plants were left for 14 days, and then macro- (P, K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients (Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, B) in leaf samples were determined, number and length of leaves and height and dry weight of plant were recorded. The lowest phosphorus content (0.19%) was recorded in the old stage of the plant in the treatment with a density of 40-mites, while it was 0.29 and 0.25% in the young and middle stage, respectively. However, the lowest potassium content (6.59%) was observed at the density of 40 mites and in the young stage. As the density of mites increased, the calcium content in the plant decreased, but no change in the magnesium content. Micronutrients did not significantly vary with mite density, except for copper, which showed a difference. The increase in mite density resulted in an increase in the plant dry weight and a decrease in plant height and leaf length. This study may further suggest fertilization programs might help to overcome nutrient deficiencies in crops due to mite infestation.",

    "abstract": "The marine littoral acarofauna is of interest both in relation to the history of seas and as biological indicators of water quality, but it remains poorly studied. For the first time, we characterize the molecular genetic variability of four widespread, common and abundant species of littoral mesostigmatic mites: Phorytocarpais kempersi, Parasitidae; Halolaelaps celticus and Halolaelaps orientalis, Halolaelapidae; and Thinoseius spinosus, Eviphididae. Based on the nucleotide sequence analysis of nuclear ribosomal repeats (ITS), we studied mite collections from the coasts of the Caspian, Azov, Black, Baltic, White, Barents, Norwegian, Bering, Okhotsk, and Japan seas. The molecular identification of the species studied, based on DNA barcoding using ITS sequences, appears to be clear. We obtained genetic evidence for the separation of Halolaelaps celticus and H. orientalis as two distinct species, based both on clustering their ITS genotypes (separated by 6 parsimony-informative substitutions) and the geographic distributions of their genotypes. The high genetic similarity of the western and eastern Palaearctic populations in both arctic-adapted species, Phorytocarpais kempersi and Thinoseius spinosus, is explicable in terms of their rather recent contact on the northern coast of Eurasia during the last interglacial or Holocene climatic optimum. The high genetic similarity of Halolaelaps orientalis, a relatively thermophilous species, from the Mediterranean region (the Azov, Black, and Caspian seas) with a sample from the very distant Sea of Japan suggests a recent connection between the European and Pacific populations via the Indian Ocean.",

The new species T. thalassina sp. n. is most similar to T. cyanoptilae Mironov, 2023 in having, in both sexes, setae d1 absent and lateral margins of the hysteronotal shield shallowly concave. In males of the new species the terminal lamellae are semi-ovate (vs. the terminal lamellae roughly rectangular with posterior margin obliquely cut in T. cyanoptilae).

Proterothrix sibillae sp. n. belongs to the wolffi species group, and is most similar to P. cyornissimilis Constantinescu, 2017. The new species is larger than P. cyornissimilis, and in the males, the prodorsal shield has small circular lacunae, the rudimentary sclerites rEpIIa are present, the genital papillae are situated distinctly anterior to the genital arch and the aedeagus is 92–104 long (vs. the prodorsal shield is without ornamentation, the genital papillae are situated at midlevel of genital arch, the rudimentary sclerites rEpIIa are present, and the aedeagus is 72–76 long in P. cyornissimilis).

We here report an unusual occurrence of this mite on coffee plants, causing significant damage in fields where they are intercropped with papaya in that state. Mites at different developmental stages were found on the underside of young coffee leaves, producing profuse webbing, causing leaf malformation, necrosis and premature fall. The intercrop of papaya with other crops may lead to the need to adopt measures to control the two-spotted spider mite on the associated crop, even when the latter is known as an unfavorable host to this mite species.",

As a derived character, males of H. palustre n. sp. are polymorphic with respect to the shape of the second leg. This leg can be considerably enlarged. Enlarged legs function as a clasping organ in fights with other males for females. A new nomenclature is proposed for dorsal and ventral setae, for ventral apodems of the deutonymph and for the cuticular pattern of the propodosoma shield of the adults.

Le taux maximal estime de production de boulettes fecales n'est pas correle aux abondances dans 3 sur 4 des sites experimentaux. Le modele montre que la defecation des acariens est importante de mai a septembre. A l'automne, en periode de haute abondance, la defecation est negligeable.

La presente etude porte sur la relation entre l'action du parasite Unionicola foili (Edwards & Vidrine) et la FA de leur hote Chironomus tentans (Fabricius). L'examen de l'asymetrie des ailes des individus parasites ou non n'a pas revele de relation positive entre la FA de l'aile et l'infestation. Ces resultats sont coherents avec les etudes comportementales montrant que la larve d'acarien n'influence pas en apparence la regularite de developpement de l'hote durant l'infestation. Ces resultats sont aussi en accord avec les etudes precedentes selon lesquelles le stade larvaire de U. folii ne modifie pas negativement les parametres de la fitness de l'hote. Des etudes anterieures sur le couple chironome-acarien ont suggere que les larves d'acariens peuvent identifier les hotes potentiels et le choisir grâce a des variables de la FA. Cependant, les donnees experimentales presentees ici montrent qu'en presence d'un ou de deux hotes potentiels, le nombre de larves rejetees par l'hote n'est pas significativement different. On peut en deduire d'une part que les chironomes ne sont pas soumis a une forte selection de rejet du parasite et que les larves d'acariens ne peuvent etre considerees soumises a une forte pression selective pour infester les hotes les plus favorables.",

    "abstract": "Storage mites, especially several species in the families Acaridae, Glycyphagidae, and Chortoglyphidae are commonly found in farming and occupational environments. They are a source of clinically important allergens, and may also have a significant impact on forensic analyses. They may be of use in forensic situations, particularly as allergenic taxa, in relation to workers who are occupationally exposed to mites. Additionally, because many of them are present through all stages of vertebrate decomposition, they may provide valuable information as indicators of time and circumstances of death. This study aimed to investigate the possible occurrence and abundance of allergenic mites in farm buildings, as well as to examine and analyse collected material samples in relation to forensic medicine. A total of 58 samples from 15 farms in the Żywiecki district (Silesian Province, Poland) were examined as potential sources of allergenic mites in farm buildings with a special reference to forensic acarology. Mites were found in all the examined samples. A total of 4,473 specimens were isolated and 22 mite species were identified. Most of them were found in barns and pigsties. The species composition of the acarofauna was varied across the particular types of farm buildings examined. Generally, the dominant species were representatives of families Acaridae and Glycyphagidae (Astigmatina). This knowledge may be useful in a variety of cases or situations in the field of forensic medicine.",

    "abstract": "Conflicts of interest between the sexes over control of mating can be reflected in various aspects of morphology and behaviour, including structure of genitalia and copulation duration. In Arrenurus water mites (Hydrachnidia: Arrenuridae) there are two main patterns of sperm transfer that differ in degree of potential male control of sperm uptake by females. In some species, males are equipped with an intromittent organ (the ‘petiole’) that is used to forcefully insert sperm into the female reproductive tract. In others, males lack an intromittent organ and females appear to push sperm into their reproductive opening themselves. Theory suggests that the amount of time spent in courtship after sperm transfer should differ between males with and without an intromittent structure. We predicted that male Arrenurus able to push sperm into the female’s reproductive tract (petiolate males) should spend less time courting females after transferring sperm than apetiolate males, which may have to ‘convince’ females to take up their sperm. Here, we examined durations of mating for 11 species of Arrenurus with males that differ in genital morphology: seven species with males equipped with a well-developed petiole (= ‘petiolate’ species) and four species with males that either completely lack a petiole or have a minute peg-like petiole that does not appear to function as an intromittent organ (= ‘apetiolate’ species). We tested whether males of petiolate species spend less time in the stage of courtship that takes place after sperm transfer (= ‘post-transfer courtship’) than apetiolate males. In contrast to our prediction, we found that species with well developed petioles spent significantly more time in post-transfer behaviours than species lacking petioles. The possible function of protracted post-transfer courtship in the genus Arrenurus is discussed.",

For this purpose, twelve sampling areas were chosen in the Ordu region of Turkey. The study was carried out on four fruit tree species, apple (Malus domestica), pear (Pyrus communis), quince (Cydonia oblonga), and loquat (Eriobotrya japonica), between 2014 and 2019. In the study, a total of 42 mite species were identified from 12 families belonging to two orders. 92.43% of all species were found on the neglected trees, while 7.57% were reported in the conventional orchards. Among phytophagous mites, Cenopalpus pulcher on the neglected trees and Amphitetranychus viennensis in the conventional orchards showed the greatest overall constancy. The most abundant and common predatory species were Phytoseius finitimus on the neglected trees and Transeius wainsteini in the conventional orchards. A high faunistic similarity was found between the conventionally grown apple fruit trees and neglected apple, pear, quince, loquat trees. Considering together predatory and tetranychoid mites, the highest interspecific association index was revealed for the pair T. wainsteini -- C. pulcher. Additionally, the pair Z. mali -- T. wainsteini within the predatory mites and A. viennensis -- C. pulcher within the tetranychoid mites had the highest index of association.",

The present study determined the biological, reproductive parameters and host preference of T. bastosi in three plant species: Morus rubra L. (Moraceae); Ipomoea batatas L. (Convolvulaceae); and Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae). The incubation period of T. bastosi eggs was longer in M. rubra (5.9 days), followed by I. batatas and P. guajava (4.0 days for both). The longest larval period was observed in P. guajava (5.7 days). The longest durations of the protonymph and deutonymph stages were recorded in P. guajava (3 days) and M. rubra (2.3 days). However, T. bastosi could not complete its life cicle on P. guajava. The longest period from egg to adult of T. bastosi was observed in I. batatas (30 days). The highest longevity of T. bastosi was observed in the hosts I. batatas and M. rubra (39.8 and 30.2 days, respectively). The longest average duration of a generation (T) was observed on M. rubra 21.3 days. Nevertheless, for the intrinsic capacity for population increase (rm) and finite rate of increase (λ) no differences were observed on I. batatas and M. rubra. In this sense, T. bastosi presents a high biological performance in I. batatas and M. rubra, however P. guajava was not considered a suitable host for the red spider mite.",

La detection des borrelies seulement dans l'etroit espace endoperitrophique d'une nymphe male 15 jours apres son repas montre que tous les spirochetes dans l'intestin moyen avant le repas de sang doivent s'enfermer dans cet espace lorsque apparait et/ou se condense la membrane peritrophique, et la membrane peritrophique doit devenir une barriere prevenant la penetration des spirochetes dans l'epithelium intestinal. L'origine des formes atypiques de Borrelia burgdorferi et leur role dans le cycle de vie du spirochete sont discutes.",

    "abstract": "Grandjeanicus gabonensis Coineau and Theron n. sp. shows a functional grouping of two setae and a trichobothrium at the extremity of its first pair of legs, which is interpreted as novel system of acoustic communication. A hair termed C, which has its base solidly implanted on the tibia, is prolonged by a long, densely-ciliated flagellum, suspended on a spring-like structure. A small posterior projection (lp) establishes contact with the trichobothrium (T) implanted on the tarsus which slides in the middle of the supporting spring of the flagellum. Through its large surface of contact, the-latter can resonate in response to a relatively weak stimulus and transmit its vibrations to the trichobothrium. The last segment of leg I also shows a solidly-implanted hypertrophied hair (A), the upper ridge of which bears a row of teeth, Flexion of the tarso-apotele, relative to the tibia, places a spine (e) of hair C in contact with the row of teeth on hair A, thus causing microstridulation. The system caused to vibrate in this way can in turn stimulate the equivalent system borne by a conspecific.",

Alectorobius (Reticulinasus) camicasi n. sp. is closely related to the two other African species: Alectorobius (Reticulinasus) salahi (Hoogstraal, 1953), a parasite of the fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus (Geoffroy) in Egypt; and Alectorobius (Reticulinasus) faini (Hoogstraal, 1960), a parasite of Rousettus leachii (Smith) in the Congo. The new Senegalese species is easily distinguished from the Egyptian species by shape of dorsal surface of idiosoma of adults, coral setae and hypostomal formula of the larva. It is very similar to the Congolese species, but differs from it by the appearance of the antero-dorsal surface-of idiosoma of male, and by the hypostomal formula, dorsal plate, length of fourth palpal article, and the position and distance between some setae of the larva.",

The data are compared with those previously obtained with the same method used for Macrochefes matrius. The main conclusions are as follows: . I) The effective temperature range is between 15° and 36°C in M. subbadius, between 14° and 34°C in M. vernalis, and between 12° and 36°C in M. matrius. 2) The maximum speed of development occurs at 32°C for M. subbadius (average 37,7 h for the females and 36,2 h for the males); at 32°C for M. vernafis (36,7 h for the females and 34,1 h For the males), at 34°e for M. matrius (average 52,10 h for the females and 44,60 h for the males); 3) The most suitable mathematical expression for the speed of development temperature relationship was found to be the logistic equation calculated for the feinales and males of each species. Ecological consequences of the problem are also discussed. In particular, the analysis of the data revealed differences in ecological niches between the fimicolous and predator species which frequentry occur in the same dropping",

    "abstract": "Males of Piona carnea form a cluster of 14-18 connected spematophores embedded into viscous secretion. This cluster is kept ready by modified legs III in a genital pocket. After grasping the female, the male keeps the pairing position by hooking his notched genu of legs IV to the first legs of the female. After a resting phase, sperm is transferred through a sequence of rubbing and dabbing movements of the spermatophores against female gonopore, followed by a second resting phase. Separation happened 1.5 to 3.5 h after pairing started. The male genital organs comprise a proximal tract (circular testis, paired vasa deferentia, the proximal part of an unpaired vas deferens) and a chitinous distal tract (distal unpaired vas deferens, ejaculatory complex and phallocrypt). The glandular part of testes is filled with matrix secretion, spermatozoa, droplets of stalk secretions and of sheath secretion. The testicular products are moved by the peristalsis of the muscular vasa deferentia to the ejaculatory complex (EC). The EC is a complex system of sclerites connected by less sclerotized areas. By means of six intrinsic muscle groups, this construction enables the dilatation and compression of the sperm passage during the formation of the spermatophore and ejaculation. The stalk secretion flows over the claws of legs III, hardens and form the basal part of stalk. As the legs are lifted, the secretion is f=drawn out to the medium part of the stalk. The spineelike apical part of the stalk is cat in a distal moud of the EC while the head is fromed in an elongated proximal chamber. The sheath secretion of the head is drawn out to a tube when the tip of the stalk is released. Repeated depositions and the release of embedding secretion form the dome-shaped cluster.",

Ces hypopes appartiennent a trois especes: Acarus nidicolous Griffihs, 1970, Acarus avicolus sp. n. et Acarus sp. La premiere espece est rencontree exclusivement sur des puces de rongeurs et d insectivores. La deuxieme semble infeodee aux puces d oiseaux. La troisieme espece n a ete rencontree qu une seule fois sur une puce provenant de la litiere d un chien. Les hypopes signales par Fain (1966) sur des puces de herisson et attribues a Acarus siro, appartiennent en realite a Acarus nidicolotts. II est probable que les hypopes signales par Zachtvatkin 1941 et par Cooremann (1944) sur des puces de mammiferes et qui ont ete attribuees a Acarus siro appartiennent aussi a A. nidicolous. Une puce provenant de Pologne portait des hypopes de Acarus nidicololis. D autres hypopes sont encore rencontres sur les puces mais beaucoup plus rarement, ce sont ceux des genres Rhizoglyphtts (Acaridae) et Histiostoma (Anoetidae) en France, et ceux du genre Psylloglyphus (Saproglyphidae) dans les pays chauds. La stricte specificite que montrent les deux especes d A carus, l une pour les puces d oiseaux, l autre pour celles de mammiferes fait penser que leur presence sur ces insectes n est probablement pas simplement accidentelle mais pourrait etre liee au cycle biologique de l espece et jouerait donc un role important dans la dissemination et la conservation de celle-ci. Cette association << hypope-puces n releverait donc du symphorisme plutot que de la simple phoresie (voir FAIN, 1966).",

Random samples of shoots were taken every 10 days and the number of buds, blossoms, fruits, and leaves present on each shoot were counted. Blossoms and fruits were classified as healthy or deformed and the immature and adults stages of the citrus bud mite and associated predatory mites were counted. Observational data indicated that the citrus bud mite does not have a negative influence on the lemon harvest and that the interaction between its populations and the host plant is a mutual symbiosis in which mite populations use the buds as a resource and repay the host plant by positively regulating its productive system. In both lemon groves, three stigmaeid mites [Zetzellia mali (Ewing), Z. graeciana Gonzalez and Agistemus collyerae Gonzalez] were also collected and their density was compared with that of the A. sheldoni. Our study highlights the complexity of relations of the citrus bud mite and lemon trees, and stresses the importance of carefully determining the real influence of the citrus bud mite on host plant harvests.",

    "abstract": "Several species of the predatory mite family Phytoseiidae are of major economic importance for biological pest control in crops, including grapevines. Plant diversification in agrosystems is reported to enhance useful biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. Thus, agroforestry, which consists in co-planting trees and crops, is assumed to be a possible way to ensure regulation of pest outbreaks by phytoseiid mites. This paper investigates the effect of trees (Pinus pinea and Sorbus domestica) within vineyards on Phytoseiidae communities. Five experimental plots were considered, two where vines were co-planted with P. pinea and S. domestica, and three monoculture plots: vines, P. pinea and S. domestica. Sampling was carried out on vines and trees in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2010 and 2012. A higher Phytoseiidae diversity was observed in agroforestry plots than in monoculture plots. Kampimodromus aberrans (replacing <I>T.</I> [ <I>T.</I>] exhilaratus) seemed to colonize these plots 15 years after its plantation, especially when vines were co-planted with P. pinea. Factors affecting these faunistical changes are discussed. Effects on Phytoseiidae densities differed depending on grape cultivartree species associations. Factors affecting these interactions are discussed; plant diversity does not simply lead to a higher density and diversity of natural enemies.",

    "abstract": "A female Acaropsis docta lays an average of 97.0 eggs in 8 days. The female usually deposits more than 50 % of eggs in first 4 days of oviposition and caver them with a web. An individual female knits an average webbed area of 1I.4 ± 2.0 mm to caver an average of 86.2 ± 9.12 eggs. There is a close relationship behveen the number of eggs deposited with a webbed area. The linear regression shows that for an increase in the number of each egg laid, the webbed area increases by 0.17 sq mm. Various stages of the mite have been described. The developmental period of various stages is as follows: egg stage: 3·5 days; larval stage: 2.4 days; protonymphal stage: 4.2 days and deutonymphal stage: 4·3 days. Between the larval to adult stages, there are three resting stages (larva-protonymph = 14.9 h; protonymph-deutonymph: 20.4 h; deutonymph- adult: 2r.7 h), corresponding to 3 moults passed by the mite. A. docta completes its development in 14.4 days at a combination of temperature 35° ± 1°C and R. H. 55 ± 5 %· The sex ratio between male and female mites is 1: r.9. The male survives longer (12.9 days) than the female mite (9.8 days).",

The aim is to establish definitively whether the two species are synonyms or not. This paper follows the doubt on the taxonomic status of the former and the hypothesis of conspecificity of the two species formulated by both authors in previous papers concerning Mauritius phytoseiid fauna. Setal and shield measurements were highly similar between species. In addition, other morphological characters previously used to separate these taxa, such as the position of setae R1, showed a wide intraspecific variability, and largely overlapped between populations previously identified as S. asiaticus vs S. reptans. We conclude that the two forms are conspecific and, therefore, S. reptans is herein designated a junior synonym of S. asiaticus.",

This discovery prompted us to redescribe the adult females and males from the type host and locality (pineapple in Queensland, Australia) and compare it with the original description, subsequent descriptions, and material collected from the USA, Costa Rica, and Colombia on pineapple, Neoregelia, and an unidentified bromeliad. Further specimens from pineapple in Guatemala were identified as the same species and represent the first record for this country. We concur with previous observations that the original description by Tryon is not the same species in subsequent descriptions. We tentatively consider all specimens examined the same as those described as S. ananas in succeeding descriptions, i.e., Steneotarsonemus ananas Tryon sensu Beer.",

When they were reared on larvae of cotton springtail Lepidocenitus insertus (Hand.), larvae of housefly Musca domestica L. and immatures of the tydeid soil mite Tydeus aegyptiaca (Rasmy and El-Bagoury), they laid eggs. They passed through egg, larvae, proto-, deuto-, tritonymph and adult stages. The durations of the immature and adult stages, as well as life table parameters were determined. Feeding on L. insertus gave the highest reproductive rate as compared to that on M. domestica and T. aegyptiaca. Ontogenetic setal development in the comparative study of the life stages of the two rhagidiid species indicated that the dorsal idiosomal chaetotaxy and the number of anal setae remained unchanged throughout the life cycle; a single adanal pair appears only in R. (R.) qaliubiensis protonymph and its successive stages. The increase in genital flap length at each moult is accompained by an increase in the number of setae situated on the flaps and the number of setae provides the simplest method of separating the nymphal stages. Patterns of leg chaetotaxy and solenidia also provide a method to separate nymphal stages.",

Unfortunately, efforts to track down the type specimen were unsuccessful and it is almost certainly lost.

    "abstract": "Despite their great interest for pest management, the biogeography of the Phytoseiidae is still poorly known. This study focuses on the spatial distribution of one of the largest taxa within the family: the sub-genus Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) currently comprising 322 species. It also provides a description of five discrete morphological characters used to discriminate between species and easily observed. This survey is the first analysis of the combined distribution of both species and associated morphological characters within the family Phytoseiidae. It reveals the great utility of taxonomic data compilation and associated databases for aspects beyong alpha-taxonomy. The highest number of species of Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) was reported from the East Palearctic region and the lowest from the Neotropical province. This was quite surprising as the highest species diversity of Phytoseiidae is reported from this latter region. Several hypotheses are discussed to explain this observation. In provinces showing the highest number of Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) species, we usually also observed the most diverse morphological forms for the five characters considered. High endemism levels were observed in all the provinces considered, even those where only few species were reported (especially the Neotropical province). Possible synonymies are thus discussed, as species could have been described more than once in different biogeographic provinces. Furthermore, some hypotheses are discussed to explain the high species and morphological diversity of the sub-genus Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) in theWest and East Palaearctic regions. Further phylogenetic analyses are required to test these different hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "The calyptostasic prelarva of the trombiculid mite Leptotrombidium orientale (Schluger, 1948) and its moulting were investigated by means of transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Even before the formation of the prelarva, a particular embryonic cuticle above ectoderm cells is secreted; this soon detaches, leaving an exuvial space where haemocytes migrate. Prelarval cuticle is deposited above short microvilli of hypodermal cells and, in the completely developed state, is very similar to the cuticle of quiescent proto- and tritonymphs. It is composed of a thick, clear procuticle with curved pore canals and a narrow epicuticular layer, completely lacking setae. The hypodermal layer of the prelarva consists of flattened epithelial cells, which undergo mitotic divisions. The prelarva, as an individual instar with cuticle closely applied to the hypodermis, exists for a very short period and is completely concealed within the eggshell, being only a pharate instar. Within the eggshell, the prelarva undergoes the next moult, expressed again by detachment of cuticle, migration of haemocytes into the exuvial space, reorganization of hypodermis and, finally, secretion of an essentially new strongly-folded, cuticle of the active larva. At this time, the eggshell splits and the prelarval exuvium with the pharate larva inside appears. After some time, the latter hatches actively from the prelarval cuticle. Since the egg at the later stages is not an embryo, but only a cover for the pharate prelarva as well as for the larva, the processes considered can not be attributed to an embryonization and the prelarva cannot be regarded as an embryonic instar.",

    "abstract": "The water mite Rutripalpus limicola Sokolow, 1934, can be considered exceptionally rare. It shows a scattered distribution range and, until recently, was known from six sites across Europe only. This strictly spring-dwelling species has a highly localised distribution, presumably due to its specific ecological requirements. We present the first records of R. limicola in the Netherlands and review the current state of knowledge on its distribution and biology. In addition to the previously existing morphology-based investigations, we provide a phylogenetic placement based on 28S rRNA gene data and shed light on the controversial systematic position of R. limicola: In contrast to the previously hypothesised Lebertioidea-relatedness of the isolated, monotypic family Rutripalpidae, our results reveal a putative Hydryphantoidea association. Moreover, we discuss the host-parasite association of R. limicola larvae and the dipteran family Ptychopteridae. Combined with additional information derived from the new records from the Netherlands, we contribute to a better understanding of this elusive species' biology and phylogenetic position.",

Eriophyoidea mites are among the most important arthropod pests affecting production of this crop worldwide. Despite this, reports on species diversity of Eriophyoidea on blackberry in Mexico are scarce. We sampled six orchards from two municipalities in the state of Michoacan, the most important region for blackberry production. Sampling was carried out monthly between May and November 2018. Only one species of eriophyoid mite was found, Diptacus rubuscolum Trinidad, Duarte and Navia. We conducted a detailed morphological study of this mite and a complementary description is presented. In addition, we obtained partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (mt COI), the 18S and 28S of the rRNA. The duration of each developmental stage was determined under controlled conditions (25 °C, 60% RH and 12:12 light regime). We confirmed the identity of D. rubuscolum by comparing partial sequences of the D2 region within the 28S rRNA from our samples and sequences retrieved from GenBank. Overall, morphological characteristics were in line with the type specimens. However, some differences on body shape and empodium structure were pointed out. The developmental stages of D. rubuscolum were egg, larva, nymphochrysalis, nymph, imagochrysalis and adult, with a mean duration of 75 (±10), 56 (±9), 21 (±7), 41 (±8), 19 (±6) and 114 (±12) hours respectively. The information produced provides insight and knowledge on the occurrence of this species on blackberry in Mexico as well as on original biological aspects.",

    "abstract": "The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is one of the economically most important pests on different crops worldwide. Its management programs are normally conducted based on the usage of chemical acaricides. However, considering the side effects of acaricides and rapid resistance development, releasing the predator mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae), is an alternative method for the control of T. urticae. In this study, the effects of plant probiotic bacteria; Bacillus pumilus INR7 (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) and Bacillus velezensis Fol (Bacillales: Bacillaceae), and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) (methyl jasmonate, methyl salicylate, Indole and 3-pentanol) were investigated on the functional response of P. persimilis to T. urticae eggs laid on attached leaves of kidney bean under laboratory conditions (25 ± 1 °C, 65 ± 5% RH and a photoperiod of 16:8h L:D). Densities of 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 prey in 10 replications were offered to the 1-day-old adult female individuals of P. persimilis during a 24-h period. The results of logistic regression analyses showed a type II functional response on all treatments. The Rogers model was used to estimate the instantaneous attack rate (a) and handling time (T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). The instantaneous attack rate had no significant difference among treatments. The handling time on B. velezensis (0.3540 ± 0.0716 h) and methyl salicylate (0.3593 ± 0.0842 h) was significantly lower than in other treatments. These results suggest that methyl salicylate and B. velezensis may have a positive effect on the foraging behavior of P. persimilis against T. urticae.",

In ali, 1 560 Astigmata mites (mainly Acarus siro) were picked alive and half of them were placed into containers with mite-free hay of the heated and cooled extractor and half into the unheated extractor. Thus 780 mites were placed in each extractor, 30 to each container with 3 g of mite-free hay. The extractor was a modification of the socalled Lussenhop-device. The temperature of the heated extractor was raised gradually as follows: Starting point 30° C, second day 45o C, 3rd-4th day 55° C, 5-6th day 70° C and 7-9th days 90° C. The heat extractor was a modification of the so-called Lussenhop deviee with four 250 W lamps warming the sample from above. The extraction efficiency (85 %) for Astigmata was significantly higher in the high gradient extractor than in the unheated and uncooled extractor at room temperature (73 %). Also the repeatability of the former method was slightly better than of the latter. The results support the presumption suggested by NEF that heating has also an independent effect on extraction efficiency, in addition to its drying effect.",

In ali 1 630 water mites (Adulti) belonging to 4 families and 17 species were caught. With 7 species the most abundant family are the Pionidae. Most of the 7 ponds, which are spatially close together, show a low quotient of similarity (41-50 %), i.e. the in ven tory of species differs notably. The latter obviously depends primarily on how a recolonization through the larval stage parasiting insects takes place after a dry up .. The 3 species with the largest numbers of individuals were Thyas barbigera, Hydryphantes sp. and Piana nodata. They were the only species found in ali of the 7 analysed ponds. We caught 12 individua1s of Piersigia intermedia, a rare species in Germany. Outside findings of host (4 species of Chironomidae) parasited by Piona a/picola are reported for the first time. Further bio1ogica1 information on the water mites refers primarily to the ovigerous fema1es caught with a number of species in spring and their number and size of eggs.",

Adult, nymphal, and larval ticks were placed in capsules on mice or guinea pigs. Adult ticks attached more often and imbibed more blood from the larger guinea pigs than from smaller mice. Feeding by two adult female ticks caused 5 of 10 mouse hosts to die. Nymphs obtained more blood from mice than guinea pigs, but attachment was similar for both hosts. Larvae also imbibed more blood from mice than from guinea pigs, in addition to exhibiting a preference for mice as shown by more frequent attachment on that host than on guinea pigs. Results support epidemiological explanations for the maintenance of Colorado tick fever and Rocky Moutain spotted fever, two important diseases transmitted by D. andersoni.",

It has been reported from several countries in the American continent and in the Caribbean, attacking 68 plant species of 12 families, but mostly Fabaceae and Malvaceae. Calopogonium mucunoides Desv. is a common plant of spontaneous occurrence in Brazil, where it is often attacked by M. planki. Both the mite and C. mucunoides seem to be of American origin. The objective of this work was to evaluate the importance of C. mucunoides as a host for M. planki. Duration of the immature phase (11.5 ± 0.9 – 11.9 ± 0.2 days) was comparable to values reported for the mite on soybean, but total fecundity (18.1 ± 0.5 – 18.7 ± 2.3 eggs) was much lower. Values of life table parameters (rm, R0 and λ) were relatively low, reflecting the reduced ability of M. planki to reach high numbers on this plant, possibly as a result of their co-evolution. Yet, the present study suggests the importance of C. mucunoides in maintaining M. planki population under natural conditions, in the absence of soybean, a plant introduced to the Americas.",

    "abstract": "The salivary and coxal glands in unfed larvae of the fresh-water mite Limnesia maculata (Müller, 1776) (Acariformes, Limnesiidae) were studied using light and electron microscopy. Three pairs of the salivary and one pair of the coxal glands constitute the prosomal gland complex. The salivary glands pertain to simple alveolar glands consisting of the single acinus with prismatic cells arranged around the intra-alveolar lumen. Owing to their spatial distribution, the salivary glands may be termed as medial, ventral and lateral. While the ventral and lateral glands are arranged symmetrically, the medial glands are disposed one after another at the frontal wall of the synganglion (brain). The medial and the ventral glands possess mostly electron-dense secretory granules supposedly of protein nature. The lateral glands show variable organization mainly having electron-lucent vacuoles. No well pronounced rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies were discernible in the salivary glands. The coxal glands are well developed and composed of (i) the main portion (the so-called labyrinth) including at least two tightly opposed loops and extending backward along the brain, and (ii) the very short anterior portion/end piece transforming anteriorly into the terminal sac/bladder. The cells of the main portion are provided with apical microvilli, whereas the basal infolding/basal labyrinth is lacking. The cells of the anterior portion do not show the apical microvilli and the basal infoldings. The terminal sac is lined by a cuticle and has an ectodermal origin. The ducts of the salivary glands come together at the dorsal aspect of the bladder, to which they open forming the common podocephalic duct anteriorly. The latter opens on each side into the subcheliceral space. The well-developed podocephalic system suggests its active role in the living processes such as feeding and ion-water balance.",

The number of mites in brood cells was significatively higher in non hygienic colonies than hygienic ones (Chi2, p<0.05). However, the increase rates were no different at all six colonies selected for this study (Chi2, p<0.05). Detected mites are removed by honeybees and their reproductive cycle are stopped. If mites are not detected, they can normally complete their reproduction. At present, the hygeinic behaviour does not represent an efficient control method. This behavioural strategy only decrease the speed of mite population growth and the colonies will die if any chemical control method is not applied.",

Due to substrate specificity and pH dependency, cysteine proteinase activity appeared to be represented by cathepsin L-like and B-like activities, the first one with the most specific activity. Both activities increased in the first four days after oviposition reaching a maximum at day 2. The total ovary protein at this period developed a similar kinetic suggesting an association between cysteine proteinases and egg protein formation. The cathepsin L-like activity showed a significant increase with repletion due to the presence of a new active fraction (CP L ), obtained from an anion exchange chromatography suggesting its closer relationship with vitellogenesis. CP L was activated at acid pH with a decrease in its molecular mass (275 kDa to 40-50 kDa), determined by gel filtration chromatography.",

Changes in protein composition began at third day of egg incubation suggesting the beginning of embryogenesis. Egg proteolysis occurred at low pH and cysteine proteinase inhibitors avoid degradation at different times of incubation preferentially at advanced embryogenesis. The cysteine-dependent acid proteolysis was represented by the presence of cathepsin B and L-like activities. Both activities increased at latest stages of embryo development, reaching the highest levels with hatching, especially the cathepsin L- like activity. A chymotrypsin like activity also appeared in the eggs at late embryogenesis and its value also reached a maximum with hatching.",

    "abstract": "The crenobiontic water mite Panisellus thienemanni (K. Viets, 1920) is a rare species confined to Europe, occurring in predominantly shaded helocrenes. Larvae of this species are known to utilize two species of springtails (Collembola) within the family Tomoceridae as a host. With only sparse published data available of P. thienemanni, this paper provides an up-to-date status of its distribution in the Netherlands, and presents new data on the morphology, life cycle, and host-parasite relationship. We report the first record of the species using a host within the family Isotomuridae (Collembola), i.e. Isotomurus fucicola Schött, 1893. The finding was part of a survey in a shaded helocrene spring in the eastern part of the Netherlands, carried out in 2011 and 2012. We particularly looked at the host species being used by larvae of P. thienemanni at the site, the number of larvae attached to an individual springtail, and the attachment site of the host. Furthermore, we compared some morphological characteristics of adult males and females with descriptions in literature. We briefly discuss the not yet fully understood life cycle of P. thienemanni based on existing data, and our own observations.",

Our examinations on a series of specimens collected from several localities in Russia showed no remarkable difference compared to its original description and subsequent redescriptions including an almost smooth dorsal shield. However, we observed a strongly punctate dorsal shield in both sexes in the specimens originated from South Korea as well as from Anuchinsky district, Ussuri Nature Reserve, Vladivostok (Primorsky Krai) and Komsomolsk-on-Amur (Khabarovsky Krai), Russia, with other morphological characters and measurements of the specimens being almost identical to the other specimens examined in this study, as well as the earlier descriptions. Although, these specimens with smooth vs punctate dorsal shield are never found in a single population, we suggest this character as intraspecific variation on a provisional basis. Moreover, we observed that this species by having broader ventral shields, does not really fit the diagnosis of the genus Amblyseius in the subtribe Amblyseiina. Therefore, a short discussion about its generic placement in the subtribes Amblyseiina and Arrenoseiina is also provided.",

Keys of genera and species are given and the subgenus Idiurobia is erected to the generic status. A complete description with figures is given of some insufficently known species. The author shows that there is a parallel evolution between the myobiids and their hosts. Ali the characters have not the same value for the evaluation of the evolution in these mites. The character of the fusion of legs I seems to be the most stable. On the basis of this character it is possible to distinguish three main groups in the myobiids: one group with all the apical segments of legs I free and well developed, this group parasitizes the marsupials; another group with the three apical segments fused, this group lives in rodents; a third group with intermediate characters and that lives in insectivores and bats. Two other characters may be utilized in the evaluation of evolution: the first is the degree of reduction of tarsal claws, the second the degree of reduction of the chaetotaxy. These two characters are however less stable and they can be utilized only into a group of hosts, e.g. to compare the evolution in genera living on different families of rodents. They are without value to compare genera living in hosts belonging to different orders of hosts.",

Significant differences are found between the metric data of both larva and deutonymph from Guntheria cairnsensis (Womersley and Heaslip, 1952), so that the latter species is restored nomenclaturally.

Also crossmating between both sexes of F1 gave progeny averaging 84.7 F2 individuals/female of which 81.3% were females. This normal number of progeny/female and egg fertilization percentage unfavoured the separation of the tested mites into two different species. In addition, morphological characters such as shape of lobes of the dorsum integumentary folds and setation of tarsus and tibia I, are similar in the two species. Size of aedeagus knob and its relation to dorsal margin of the shaft are usually similar except knob anterior projection being acute in T. urticae and usually narrow rounded in T. arabicus.

In Nigeria, cattle are reared in the Savannah zone of Northern Nigeria and only brought down to the South (forest zone) where Ibadan is located, to be slaughtered for food. Cattle are not reared in the South because of the adverse effect of Glossina sp. on them. In Ibadan, there is only one rainy season per year and this period coincides with the high incidence of A. variegatum adult females on trade cattle during the rains. In this study, it was observed that climatic factors such as rainfall, temperature, humidity and sunshine affect the seasonal appearance of the adults, larvae and nymphs of A. variegatum on trade cattle.",

Amongst the results obtained, emphasis is laid on the rarity or the absence of mites in the dust extracted from four woollen mattresses produced by the local handicrafs and therefore abnormally rich in fat material. Another interesting point is the abundance of Euroglyphus maynei in the three other not locally produced mattresses and not containing this fat material. This abundance of E. maynei has allowed to obtain, for the first time, laboratory cultures of this species",
