The deterioration of composite structures is primarily caused by operational and environmental variability. To address this issue, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are being integrated into the SHM systems to enhance the performance of composite structures via digital transformation and big data analysis. Therefore, the present article aims to provide a critical review of AI models, including machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning, to preserve and sustain composite structures throughout their life. The article covers the complete SHM process for composite structures, including sensing technologies, data-preprocessing, feature extraction, and decision-making process. Thus, the health monitoring of composites is presented in consideration of modern AI techniques, accompanied by the identification of current challenges and potential future research directions.",

Displacements are then determined by solving nonlinear simultaneous equations taking the deformation of a subset into consideration. Strains are obtainable by differentiating the measured displacements. In addition to the basic principle of digital image correlation, the example of the measurement and its results are shown.",

Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) at different weight percentage (wt.%) loadings (0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 10.0%) were incorporated into the Polyamide 12 (PA12) matrix. Melt mixing followed by filament extrusion was applied. Filaments were employed to 3D print specimens. A thorough study on the electrically Conductive Polymeric Composites (CPCs) electrical percolation threshold was carried out. Mechanical and thermomechanical response investigations were also conducted. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to study the morphology of the 3D printed samples. The results showed a mechanical and thermomechanical properties enhancement for 5.0 wt.% filler’s ratio. The electrical conductivity increased by increasing the filler loading. The 10% wt.% PA12/MWCNT nanocomposite additionally exhibited an electrothermal Joule-heating behavior. The antibacterial behavior was also tested with the agar well diffusion screening method, for gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). A mild antimicrobial performance was observed. It can be concluded that the multi-functional PA12/MWCNT 3D printed lightweight CPCs developed herein could be applied in various applications, e.g. joule-heating devices, flexible conductors, and anti-static enclosures.",

Representative CVD, sintered, and composite materials were evaluated in both furnace and high pressure burner rig exposure. While protective SiO2 scales form in all cases, evidence is presented to support paralinear growth kinetics, i.e. parabolic growth moderated simultaneously by linear volatilization. The volatility rate is dependent on temperature, moisture content, system pressure, and gas velocity. The burner tests were used to map SiO2 volatility (and SiC recession) over a range of temperature, pressure, and velocity. The functional dependency of material recession (volatility) that emerged followed the form: exp(-Q/RT) * Px * vy. These empirical relations were compared to rates predicted from the thermodynamics of volatile SiO and SiOxHv reaction products and a kinetic model of diffusion through a moving boundary layer. For typical combustion conditions, recession of 0.2 to 2 μm/h is predicted at 1200-1400°C, far in excess of acceptable long term limits.",

The experimental results demonstrated that the tensile modulus and strength in the longitudinal direction are independent of the strain rate. In contrast, the tensile properties in the transverse direction and the shear properties increase with the strain rate. Moreover, it was observed that the strain-rate dependence of the shear strength is much stronger than that of the transverse strength. The tensile strength of off-axis specimens was measured using an oblique tab, and the experimental results were compared with the tensile strength predicted based on the Tsai–Hill failure criterion.

The thermal conductivity of PLA-bamboo fiber 'green' composites was significantly influenced by their density, and was in fair agreement with theoretical predictions based on Russell's model.

Drop-weight impact and static indentation tests were carried out, and induced damage was observed by ultrasonic C-scan and an optical microscope. Both tests gave essentially the same results for damage modes, sizes, and load-deformation history. First, a crack occurred in the bottom 0° layer accompanying some delamination along the crack caused by bending stress. Then, transverse cracks occurred in the middle 90° layer with decreasing contact force between the specimen and the indenter. Measured local strains near the impact point showed that the stress state changed from a bending dominant state to an in-plane tensile dominant state. A cohesive interface element was used to simulate the propagation of multiple delaminations and transverse cracks under static indentation. Two types of analytical models are considered, one with multiple delaminations and the other with both multiple delaminations and transverse cracks. The damage obtained for the model with only multiple delaminations was quite different from that obtained from the experiment. However, the results obtained from the model with both delaminations and transverse cracks well explain the characteristics of the damage obtained in the experiment. The existence of the transverse cracks is essential to form the characteristic impact damage.",

For comparison, E-glass and aramid (Kevlar®) fiber reinforced composites were also prepared using the same modified soy protein resins.

The IPN-like soy protein based resin was further reinforced using nano-clay and microfibrillated cellulose. Fiber/resin interfacial shear strength was characterized using microbond method. Tensile and flexural properties of the composites were characterized as per ASTM standards. A comparison of the tensile and flexural properties of the high strength composites made using the three fibers is presented. The results suggest that these green composites have excellent mechanical properties and can be considered for use in primary structural applications. Although significant additional research is needed in this area, it is clear that advanced green composites will some day replace today's advanced composites made using petroleum based fibers and resins.

In this paper, plasma treatment (PT) for various exposure timings (30, 60, 90, and 120 s) was performed to study the mechanical properties of jute fiber and its composites using poly (lactic acid) (PLA) as the matrix. The results were compared with alkali (AT) and plasma treated (PT) fiber composites. Bundle fiber test was carried out for untreated, AT, and PT jute fiber composites. PT fiber composites showed superior properties compared to other treatments. Micro-droplet test results showed that the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of PT fiber composite is higher than that of AT fiber composites. Mechanical properties and hardness were increased on subjecting the fiber to plasma treatment. Tensile strength, young's modulus and flexural strength were increased in an order of 28, 17, and 20%, respectively, for plasma polymerized jute fiber composites. Moreover, plasma polymerization leads to increase (>20%) in the flexural strength than untreated fiber composites. It is inferred that plasma treatment improves the interfacial adhesion between the jute fiber and PLA. These results were also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy observations of the fractured surfaces of the composites. Overall, plasma polymerization is an effective and eco-friendly method for the surface modification of the lingo cellulosic fiber to increase the compatibility between the matrix (hydrophobic) and fiber (hydrophilic).Keywords: plasma treatmentjute fiberalkali treatmentinterfacial shear strengthpoly lactic acid (PLA) AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by Korea Government (MEST) (No. 2011-0024235) and (No. 2012-0009455).",

In a laminate with a 40 μm-thick-ply, the crack gradually extended with increasing strain. Conversely, extreme crack extension was found at around 1.0% strain in a laminate with a standard thick ply. Based on the numerical analysis, the crack suppression effect is verified using a thin ply; the effect is apparently caused by a decrease in the energy release rate at the crack tip in the thin layer.",

The obtained results showed that the non-aged composite featured good fiber-resin bonding, whereas hygrothermal and thermal aging led to fiber-matrix interface damage. For thermally aged samples, dent depth rapidly increased with impact energy above the inflection point, and the corresponding amplitude was greater than those observed for non-aged and hygrothermally aged specimens. Notably, hygrothermal and thermal aging did not affect the impact-induced damage morphology and the after-impact compression failure mode. At a constant impact energy, the damage area of thermally aged samples exceeded those of non-aged and hygrothermally aged ones; moreover, thermal aging exhibited greater influence on residual compressive strength than hygrothermal aging. Finally, whereas hygrothermal aging reduced the glass transition temperature (Tg) and did not induce the formation of new materials or the occurrence of chemical reactions, thermal aging resulted in increased Tg and was accompanied by the concomitant occurrence of oxidation reactions.",

To capture both the initiation and propagation of transverse cracks, the microscopic random fiber configuration and the constraint effect from neighboring plies should be carefully considered. This study considers the representative volume element (RVE), consisting of the ‘inhomogeneous’ ply in which the solid elements individually modeled the fiber and matrix, and the ‘homogenized’ plies, homogeneously modeled by the shell elements. Matrix damage and debonding between fiber and matrix were modeled in the inhomogeneous ply to reproduce transverse crack propagation. Furthermore, in the RVE simulation, the key degree of freedom method was incorporated to evaluate the in-situ properties of each ply effectively. The validity of the proposed tool was examined by comparing the predicted cracking behavior with the results of unidirectional tensile tests on cross-ply laminates having different 90º ply thicknesses.

Process-induced residual deformations due to cure shrinkage and thermal shrinkage of cross-ply laminates under conditions similar to those in the experiment were predicted using multiscale modeling. The predicted deformation shape and maximum deformation value are in good agreement with the fabrication experiments.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the integration of recycled and natural fibers with recycled concrete aggregates to develop environmentally friendly fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC), with a primary aim of maintaining or enhancing its properties. Four concrete mixtures, namely plain concrete (C-Plain), recycled steel fiber-reinforced concrete (C-RSF), recycled plastic fiber-reinforced concrete (C-RPF), and kenaf fiber-reinforced concrete (C-KF), were formulated and analyzed for their fresh, hardened, and durability characteristics. A 50% replacement of natural coarse aggregates' weight with recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) was implemented. By standardizing fiber volume fractions at 1.0% for all FRC mixtures, the study evaluated properties such as workability, dry density, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, post-cracking flexural performance, modulus of rupture, flexural toughness, splitting tensile strength, and freeze-thaw resistance after 100 and 300 cycles. Testing involved three specimens for each parameter at 7 and 28 days. The results indicated positive effects on post-cracking flexural performance, modulus of rupture, flexural toughness, splitting tensile strength, and durability with the incorporation of recycled and natural fibers. Notably, C-RSF demonstrated the highest compressive strength (46.63 MPa), flexural toughness (64.35 kN-mm), and modulus of rupture (7.46 MPa) compared to other FRC composites. Additionally, it exhibited minimal weight loss (2.18% and 3.07%) after freeze-thaw cycles, indicating exceptional durability. C-RSF exhibited superior performance, while C-KF showed enhancement slightly below that of C-RSF. Although not reaching the level of C-RSF, C-RPF positively influenced concrete performance. Compressive response either maintained performance or exhibited marginal reduction. The findings carry significant implications for developing environmentally conscious construction materials with enhanced mechanical and durability properties, thereby advancing sustainable construction practices.",

CFRP pieces made by crushing CFRP wastes were utilized in this material. Nine kinds of CFRP/ABS compounds with different weight fraction and size of CFRP pieces were prepared. Firstly, tensile and flexural tests were performed for the specimens with various CFRP content. Next, fracture surfaces of the specimens were microscopically observed to investigate fracture behavior and fiber/resin interface. Finally, the tensile modulus and strength were discussed based on the macromechanical model. It is found that the elastic modulus increases linearly with increasing CFRP content while the strength changes nonlinearly. Microscopic observation revealed that most carbon fibers are separated individually and dispersed homogeneously in ABS resin. Epoxy resin particles originally from CFRP are dispersed in ABS resin and seem to be in good contact with surrounding resin. The modulus and strength can be expressed using a macromechanical model taking account of fiber orientation, length and interfacial bonding in short fiber composites.",

The performance enhancement provided by the STF is suspected to be due to the increased frictional interaction between yarns in impregnated fabrics. In order to explore the mechanism of this enhanced energy absorption, a computational analysis has been performed to consider the effect of STF impregnation on the ballistic performance of STF impregnated fabrics, and the results are reported here. The computational model to account for STF impregnation was implemented into the explicit analysis code LS-DYNA by employing the experimental results of yarn pull-out tests to characterize the frictional behavior of the STF impregnated fabric. The results of a ballistic impact test were used to validate the computational model that takes into account STF impregnation effect.

The coir fibers which are soaked in 5% sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature for 72 h showed the highest IFSS at 72.8% higher than untreated coir fibers. Alkali treatment of coir fibers enhanced the tensile properties of coir/PLA composites. The best tensile strength of coir/PLA composite was achieved at fiber mass content of 20% in this study. Below about 370°C, the coir/PLA biodegradable composites are found to have much higher thermal stability compared to coir fiber, but lower than that of PLA resin. Alkali-treated coir/PLA composites having improved fiber–matrix adhesion resulted in stable composites with better thermal stability than untreated coir/PLA composites. The thermomechanical stability of PLA resin is significantly improved by the addition of reinforcing coir fibers.The fractured surface morphology of the composite specimens exhibited an improvement of interfacial fiber–matrix adhesion in the composites reinforced with alkali-treated coir fibers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Flax fiber has become increasingly attractive as reinforcement in polymer matrix composites. Due to its lighter weight, flax fiber-reinforced composites can perform similar to glass fiber-reinforced composites on a specific property comparison. In order to maximize the mechanical performance of the flax-reinforced composites, different fiber surface treatments have been investigated by many studies. In this study, four different chemical modifications were selected to compare difference on the mechanical performance between flax/vinyl ester composites and E-glass/vinyl ester composites. Different unidirectional flax fiber/vinyl ester and E-glass/vinyl ester composites were produced via a modified vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding process. Higher specific properties of chemically treated flax fiber-reinforced composites over those of E-glass composites were obtained. Acrylic acid treatment increased both the interfacial shear strength and the interlaminar shear strength about 30% compared with untreated flax composites. It confirms that the specific mechanical properties of flax composites with a suitable surface modification were comparable with E-glass composites. In addition, a suitable composite processing procedure to manufacture the flax/vinyl ester composites was designed and fiber bundle pullout test for flax fiber composites were developed.

In this research work, stir casting process was used for fabricating aluminium alloy 7075 reinforced by silicon carbide (SiC) and carbon black (CB) particulates. X-ray diffraction analysis, energy dispersive X-Rays analysis and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) confirmed the presence of SiC and CB particles and there uniform distribution in aluminium matrix. Further, as-cast composites have been processed by friction stir processing (FSP) technique with the appropriate processing parameter: tool speed, feed rate and tool tilt angle. Mechanical and microstructural properties of the composites before and after FSP were investigated through universal testing machine and optical microscopy. The novel feature of as-cast AA7075/SiC/CB is that it demonstrates a 2.5 times increment in the ultimate tensile strength and at the same time, significant amount of increased ductility. Ductile failure may be possible fracture mechanism as shown in FE-SEM analysis. Further, the tribological behaviour of the synthesized composites studied under dry sliding conditions before and after FSP and the results indicates significant improvement in wearing capacity of the composites. Also, weight loss of the various composites by varying three input variable process parameters were investigated followed by analysis of variance and regression analysis. The presence of 5 wt.% SiC and 5 wt.% CB in the composites can exhibit superior mechanical as well as wear property as compared to base alloy.",

B4C have recently become attractive to researchers, engineers, and scientists as an alternative reinforcement for polymer composites due to its attractive physical and mechanical characteristics. The tensile strength of the B4C-reinforced epoxy was lower than the neat epoxy due to the poor bonding of the materials. Various surface treatments of the reinforcement were suggested in the literature to improve the bonding between the reinforcement and the matrix. B4C addition improved the elastic modulus of the epoxy. No clear trend was observed for the flexural behavior of the same. It was mainly dependent on the type of epoxy used and size and concentration of reinforcement. A higher B4C particulate addition in epoxy improved the hardness values of the composites. There was a marginal improvement in the shear strength of the B4C-reinforced composites. The commonly observed plasticization tendency of epoxy after moisture absorption was less severe when epoxy was reinforced with B4C particulates. Poor anchoring of B4C particulates in the resin hampered the wear resistance of the composite. The situation further worsens after moisture absorption. However, cavitation erosion behavior of the composite improved and limited to localized areas.",

Sugarcane bagasse microfibrillated cellulose with added filler materials were subsequently evaluated with respect to their mechanical, structural, and chemical properties. The MFC was synthesized via a facile microfibrillation process enabled by a kitchen blender at ambient conditions. The as-formed MFC was thoroughly characterized chemically to identify any chemical compositional variations, especially those observed as a result of filler addition. Changes in mechanical properties of MFCs in the presence of individual filler materials were evaluated using tensile testing and are reported at a nearly comparable strength of ~3.63 MPa. The addition of filler materials resulted in the improvement of MFC such that the MFC was easily drawn into pliable sheets.

    "abstract": "Abstract Graphite reinforced conductive polymer composites (CPCs) with high filler loadings were fabricated by compression molding technique. Various sizes and shapes of graphite particles were mixed with phenol resin to impart the electrical conductivity in composites. Fabricated CPCs showed good electrical conductivity (>100 S/cm) and flexural strength (>40 MPa) for the bipolar plate of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The electrical conductivity of CPCs was affected by the formation of conductive networks among graphite particles. CPCs made of sphere-type particles (SG-CPCs) had the same physical density regardless of particle size; and they also showed the same bulk electrical conductivity. This means that there is a close correlation between the electrical conductivity and the densification level, or density, of graphite/phenol compounds. The particle shape was also a principal factor in influencing electrical conductivity. In this study, the electrical conductivity of CPCs made of flake-type graphite particles (FG-CPCs) was higher than that of SG-CPCs due to the difference of the densification characteristic. The flexural strength of SG-CPCs tended to increase with decreasing graphite particle size because the interfacial coherence between graphite particle and phenol resin increased as graphite particle size decreased. This influence of interfacial coherence was also founded in the variation of particle shape. FG-CPCs have higher flexural strength than SG-CPCs because a flake-type particle has larger specific area than a sphere-type particle.

The fiber strength distribution used in the numerical simulation was determined from the fragmentation process in a single fiber composite. Since the experimental data obviously did not fit the normal Weibull distribution, we fitted them with the Weibull of Weibull model, considering the statistical distribution of scale parameters of fiber strength in the normal Weibull model. Moreover, the constitutive law of the matrix was derived from the stress–strain curves of the angle ply laminates, utilizing the micromechanics approach proposed by Tohgo et al. [9]. Based on these parameters, we simulated the tensile fracture of unidirectional CFRP composites with the spring element model (SEM). The predicted tensile strength by numerical simulation plus size scaling agreed well with the experimental data. The results also confirmed that the Weibull of Weibull model is important to predict size-dependent composite strength.

For thick composite components, this condition is not often respected; in fact, the cure degree trend between the core and the external surface is different causing structural and geometrical/dimensional unconformities. In most cases, these problems can be solved through a redesign of cure process in terms of thermal cycle, in fact that one recommended by furnisher is usually suitable for thin components. The optimization of cure thermal cycle should include several performance criteria for the production system such as the targeted cure degree, the targeted maximum temperature of the part and the duration of the cure cycle, as well as the production system limitations such as the maximum allowable heating rate, the maximum allowable cooling rate and so on. A previous work shows a method to optimize the cure degree of a thick composite component. The present work presents an indirect way to validate the proposed method: some experimental tests have been carried out by implementing the cure cycle identified by this method, the values of temperatures have been recorded by thermocouples and the obtained temperature trend has been compared with that due to numerical approach. Further considerations on the cure degree and the cure rate have been deduced. The experimental results show a good agreement with the numerical ones.",

Fiber failure then initiated at the side edge and propagated through the whole cross section. A two-dimensional kink-band developed as a result of two-dimensional fiber microbuckling. The out-of-plane and in-plane band widths and band angles were almost the same.

First, constant amplitude fatigue tests are performed at room and high temperatures (HT), respectively, on the specimens immersed in hot water until saturation as well as on the specimens kept in a dry place. The results indicate that the fatigue lives of wet specimens are shorter than those of dry specimens, regardless of stress ratio as well as test temperature. The fatigue strength is reduced by about 11% due to water absorption at room temperature (RT), regardless of stress ratio. A similar reduction in fatigue strength can be seen in wet specimens at HT as well. Then, the full shapes of constant fatigue life (CFL) diagrams for the woven carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminate in dry and wet environments are identified using fatigue test data obtained at different stress ratios and at different test temperatures. The results show that the experimental CFL diagrams are asymmetric and nonlinear, and the shape of CFL envelope gradually changes. Finally, the CFL diagrams for the woven CFRP laminate under uniaxial fatigue loading in different hygro-thermal environments are predicted using the anisomorphic CFL diagram approach for composites that was developed in an earlier study. Comparison with experimental results demonstrates that the anisomorphic CFL diagram approach is a promising step in predicting the CFL diagram for the woven CFRP laminate not only in a dry environment but also in a wet environment, regardless of test temperature.",

After completing the scanning, a wavenumber filtering is applied to determine dominant wavenumber components of the measured wavefield, which could be used for indicative of structural damage. Mapping processes based on local wavenumber filtering is then carried out for damaged area visualization. Also introduced are the comparison of two methods for damage identification and visualization: the local wavenumber mapping and acoustic wavenumber spectroscopy. To demonstrate the proposed techniques, several experiments are performed on composite structures with different types of damage, including debonding and delamination on composite plates.

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent research activities in advanced composites technologies conducted in Japan are reviewed and introduced. New research topics in reinforcing fibers described are low modulus pitch-based carbon fiber and PBO fiber. The second of these is very topical at the present time: nano-technology based composites use materials such as carbon nanotube, or carbon nano-fiber, or nanoclay. Because the Composites Technology Center in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) leads many new research fields in composites, the present review paper shows a slight bias towards the outputs of JAXA. The most remarkable outcome in this field at present is a compression strength improvement by loading cup-stack type carbon nano-fiber (CSCNF). Prepreg containing this CSCNF has been developed and has already been rerleased into the market. The third topic is related to newly developed high performance polymers including heat resistant polyimide, Tri A-PI and its family. The most recent product is a heat resistant polyimide that is highly soluble in some organic solvents; this material is suitable for preparation of imide wet prepreg. Composites fabricated through this prepreg route exhibit no voids and defects compared to the traditional amid-acid polyimide prepreg route. Another new topic in polymers is related to Japan's national project, radiation cure polymers and their processing. Electron beam cure, ultra-violet cure and visual light cure resins and their processing technologies have been developed in this national project. The next topic is a development of the low cost composites technology mainly for aircraft components. JAXA's activities related to this field are introduced first based on two new key technologies — Z-anchor® and stitching. New findings about the mechanism of interlaminar reinforcement by stitching are slightly focused. Finally, remarkable theoretical findings about composite mechanics in recent years are described. A clarification of mechanics of compression after impact behavior by using a newly developed cohesive zone element is reviewed first in this category. Matrix crack growth theories in the laminae adjacent to the initially cracked layer are introduced next where a motivation of this research is a cryogenic composite tank for future space transportation systems. The final topic is a development of the theory of structural health monitoring by using small diameter FBG sensor. By an evolution of these theories structural health monitoring has almost reached the level of practical applications.

    "abstract": "Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have good electrical conductivity. Addition of a few percent of carbon nanofibers to polymers yields electrical conductivity but hardly affects the mechanical properties of the polymers. These conductive polymers may be useful for sensing applications, such as strain sensors and chem-resist sensors. Many researchers have reported on the electrical conductivity, but the electrical resistance change under strain, i.e. piezoresistivity, of the carbon nanofiber filled resin has not been fully investigated. In this study, the electrical resistance change under strain of CNF/flexible-epoxy composites was investigated experimentally and analytically. Experimental results show that the electrical resistance change under strain is non-linear and much larger than that in metal, and the sensitivity of the electrical resistance change to strain decreases as the weight fraction of CNF increases. The mechanism of the electrical resistance change under strain of CNF/polymer composites was discussed by using electrical circuit simulation based on a percolation network model and tunneling effect between CNFs. The results imply that the non-linear behavior is caused by tunneling resistance change between CNFs, and that the decrease of sensitivity with increasing weight fraction of CNF is caused by the nature of the percolation network.",

    "abstract": "The recent earthquakes have shown that the vulnerability and the defects of the concrete joints in beam– column framed structures were the main causes for many building collapses. Such vulnerability and defects are in general the consequences of many factors. External strengthening with composite materials represents an alternative and a sound and efficient technique to improve the performances and aptitude to withstand seismic action. However, while the use of such strengthening technique offers many advantages, it has some disadvantages, particularly a remarkable loss of ductility. The present study examines the effects of an external strengthening of reinforced concrete beam–column joints against cyclic loading using CFRP laminates and GFRP sheet. The experimental program is constituted of three beam–column reinforced concrete joints at a scale of one to three (1/3) tested under the effect of a prestressing axial load acting over the column. The beams were subjected at their ends to a reverse cyclic loading under displacement control to simulate a seismic action. Strain and cracking fields were monitored with the help a digital recording camera. Following the analysis of the results, a comparison was made concerning the performances in terms of ductility, strength and mode of failure of the different strengthening solutions.",

    "abstract": "Surface organic molecule modification of nanosized alumina particles is an effective way to improve its dispersion in polymer and to enhance the properties of polymer nanocomposites. In the present study, γ-aminopropyl triethoxysilane was used as a surface modification agent to react with the hydroxyl group on the surface of nanosized alumina. The properties of the modified alumina particles were characterized by FT-IR spectra, particle-size analyzer and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The nanocomposites of the epoxy resin filled with nano-sized alumina before and after surface modification were fabricated by physical blending. The mechanical behaviour and heat resistant properties of the composites were investigated. The results showed that the effective chemical bonds were formed between nano-alumina particles and γ-aminopropyl triethoxysilane after modification. Compared to the non-modified particles, the modified alumina nanoparticles exhibited a good dispersibility, and distributed uniformly in the epoxy matrix. The epoxy matrix filled with the modified nanoparticles showed a shorter gel time and a higher curing degree. The composites filled with modified nano-alumina revealed the optimum improvement of heat resistance. The composites with 3 wt% weight fraction modified particles had higher thermal decomposing temperature and glass transition temperature, and they were raised by 11 and 10°C relative to that of the neat resin, respectively. The modified alumina nanoparticles had better enhancement effect on epoxy matrix. The ultimate flexural strength and flexural modulus of the composites with 3 wt% modified particles increased by 55 and 77.1%, respectively; the impact strength of the composites containing 5 wt% modified particles increased by 24.7% relative to the neat resin, and the impact fracture surface presented ductile fracture features.",

    "abstract": "In this research, the free vibration of thick functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced rectangular composite plates is investigated. For this purpose, the three-dimensional elasticity theory, as an appropriate theory for thick plates, is used. In order to discretize the governing equations, the differential quadrature method (DQM) is adopted to solve the governing equations. In the present work, no approximation is used and the DQM is adopted in all directions. Although this may cause the MATLAB code to be longer but it may eliminate extra frequencies which not really exist. The material properties of functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite plates are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction, and are estimated through a micromechanical model. Numerical results of the present paper are also compared with the results of both isotropic and orthotropic rectangular plates. Additionally, the influences of different parameters such as boundary conditions on the numerical results are also investigated. It is hoped that this research will lead to more detailed models on rectangular composite plates reinforced by carbon nanotubes.",

    "abstract": "This paper explains a new method to measure the fiber orientation in carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminates from X-ray CT images. In the method, the fiber orientation is analyzed by the application of digital image correlation (DIC) method to the acquired tomographic images. Using DIC, the brightness pattern, which results from the radiodensity difference between fiber and resin, is compared between two different planes in the thickness direction. Then, the three-dimensional displacement of the brightness pattern, which indicates the fiber orientation, can be measured. This study applied the proposed method to a quasi-isotropic CFRP laminate. After X-ray CT imaging, the sample was sectioned and polished. The fiber orientation was then measured experimentally using microscopy. The fiber orientation calculated using the proposed method agrees very well with the experimentally measured one. After demonstrating the validity of the proposed method, we applied it to a plain woven CFRP laminate. Results revealed that an invalid fiber orientation might be calculated for fibers parallel to the plane of the CT image, or for the fiber orientation of the pattern around the outer edge of CT images.",

The MMF theory includes micro-scale stress amplification within each constituent material (fiber and matrix) and failure criteria for the judgment of the constituent failure. The unit cell model with the face-centered array distribution of carbon fibers is constructed to analyze the micro-scale stress amplification factors in the fiber and matrix. Noninteractive failure criteria are proposed to judge the failure of the fiber and matrix. During the process of loading, the constituents’ failure can be identified by the MMF failure criteria, and then the material properties degradation scheme is evaluated according to the failure modes of constituents and applied for each element to continue the progressive failure analysis for the composite materials. The user-defined material subroutine for the micro-scale stress amplification in the constituents, failure judgment of the constituents, and degradation of ply properties is developed using the Abaqus Fortran scripts. Micro-scale stress of the constituents is visualized for detailed analysis. The initial failure, subsequent propagation, final failure, and the strength of open-hole compression (OHC) structure of the carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites are studied based on MMF theory. The ultimate load and failure behavior of the OHC structure obtained from both theoretical analysis and tests are compared and analyzed.",

Once the FBG signals were measured from an arbitrary impact event, the root mean-squared (RMS) values were calculated between the obtained signals and all reference signals. Then, the training point that has the minimum RMS values was determined as the resultant impact location. In order to validate the applicability of this algorithm in the external environment, impact localization was performed under a dynamic loading condition. The dynamic loading condition was simulated by exciting the test article using a shaker. The results of validation tests show that the proposed algorithm could successively estimate the impact locations under a dynamic loading condition.",

The kenaf fibers were used as primary reinforcement, and the contents were fixed to 40 wt.% of the total, and the average fiber length was 3 mm long. It was noticeable that the flame retardancy of kenaf/PLA green composite with ATH was improved by 66%, and the storage modulus and tensile modulus were enhanced by 136 and 59%, respectively, compared with the kenaf/PLA counterpart without ATH.

A mathematical model for damage assessment in three-body abrasion is developed and validated by a well-designed set of experiments. The design of experiment using Taguchi's orthogonal array is applied to find out minimum specific wear rate. Steady state condition is also applied to find minimum specific wear rate for particular weight fraction keeping other parameters as constant. The experimental results show that the abrasive wear of the composites shows dependence on parameters like applied load, sliding speed, and abrasive particle size. Wear rate of long as well as short glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composites increases with increase in normal load and abrasive particle size, whereas the wear rate decreases up to 40 wt.% of fiber loading and then further increases with increase in sliding speed. The SEM micrograph studies reveal the dynamics of three-body abrasive wear and underlying micro-mechanisms that serve as determinant for wear performance of such composites. The three-body abrasive wear rate in given formulation increases with normal load and abrasive particle size. The mechanical characteristics observed a positive trend with the increase in fiber composition and also help in analyzing the specific wear rate of composites.",

To this end, with reference to the results of the numerical material testing on the periodic microstructures of FRP, we propose an anisotropic elastoplastic-creep-damage combined constitutive model to represent the macroscopic material behavior and illustrate the characteristics of the inelastic deformations that resemble the material behavior assumed for plastics at micro-scale. With the identified macroscopic material parameters, the macroscopic structural analysis, which is followed by the localization analysis consistently, can be an actual proof of the utility value of the decoupling method in practice.",

While the 0º tensile strength is found to be independent of the cooling rate, the 90º tensile strength is strongly influenced by the matrix type and cooling rate. The matrix modulus increases as the cooling rate is decreased; the degree of crystallinity also increases.

In this study, we analyzed the fracture behavior of CFRP specimens before and after bending to different curvature radii. From the experimental results, a fracture criterion that described the behavior of the materials by considering tensile and compressive loads was developed. The fracture mechanism was the same for CFRP specimens with different curvature radii. These results increase our understanding of the mechanical properties of CFRP materials used in 3D printing.",

    "abstract": "In this study, bio-waste catla fish scale (CFS) was used as a reinforcing agent in polypropylene (PP) for the fabrication of biomaterials by using a twin-screw extrusion technique. Tensile strength, elongation-at-break and heat deflection temperature (HDT) of the composites decreased upon the addition of CFS, however, Young's modulus improved, significantly. The flexural strength, density, and hardness of the composites increased by 5%, 1%, and 11%, respectively, with increasing the CFS content. The impact strength and the melt flow index (MFI) noticeably increased with increasing CFS loading. These results signified the fact that the CFS/PP composites from CFS biowaste showed improved mechanical properties and it can be a potential alternative biomaterial for various biomedical applications. In addition, the application of CFS as a filler in polymers can be viewed as a sustainable approach that incorporates biowaste-based value-added material and can simultaneously mitigate the sewage problems in a smart manner in the marine environment.",

For the variable working conditions, the samples are printed to ASTM D-790.

The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and 3-dimensional optical pictures examine the flexural quality, crack mechanics, and impact of various printed conditions for three-point flexural tests. A layer thickness of 0.14 mm was recorded for the maximum flexural quality of 68.6 MPa. The fracture mechanism is considered as identical under any machining conditions. Layer height predominantly determines the material's flexural property and the uniform dispersion of the copper molecule over the crack surface which is confirmed by surface topography.

However, the incompatibility between natural fibre and polymer matrices and the higher water absorption percentage of natural fibre is restricting their utilization in structural and semi-structural applications. To overcome these limitations, surface treatment of natural fibre and nanofiller addition into the polymer matrices have become among the most valuable ways to improve natural fibre composite performance. This work examined the alkaline-treated and untreated flax/polylactic acid (PLA) fibre reinforced epoxy hybrid nanocomposites, in which alumina and magnesia were used as nanofillers. The effect of surface treatment and nanofillers was explored in terms of mechanical properties (compression and interlaminar shear), water absorption behaviour, and morphology of composites. Substantial enhancements in compressive and interlaminar shear strengths were reported, as well as a notable reduction in the amount of water absorbed. The optimal nanofiller concentration was 3% in alkaline-treated and untreated flax/PLA fibre reinforced epoxy hybrid nanocomposite. The results reveal that nanofillers combined with surface treatment can appreciably improve developed laminates' mechanical and water absorption properties, making them feasible for furniture, packaging, automobiles, and structural applications.",

Additionally, the study explores the effects of volume fraction index, loading conditions, boundary conditions, and aspect ratio on the static analysis of the shear-deformable FGM aircraft wing.

For this purpose, parameters of atmospheric plasma (APL) surface treatment were evaluated in comparison to chemical cleaning and peel-ply applications, taking into account its effects on surface properties and adhesive bond strength. A comprehensive variety of surface characterization techniques were utilized to analyze surface modifications, including water and diiodomethane contact angle measurements for assessing surface hydrophilicity, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy with Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) for analyzing chemical composition and functional groups, and Profilometry, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for evaluating surface topography and morphology. Experimental results indicated that the reduction in the contact angle following plasma treatment correlated with the elevated oxygen concentration and the presence of polar functional groups (e.g. -OH, -NH2, -NH3, C=O, O-C=O) on the composite surface. Plasma treatment, especially at low nozzle speeds, increased surface roughness on the bag side surfaces. This prevented adhesive penetration and led to gas entrapment, resulting in adhesive failure mode and reduced single lap shear strength for the bag side. In contrast, on the tool side surfaces, the plasma treatment led to a remarkable 19.7% enhancement in shear strength, highlighting its effectiveness.",

By suppressing delamination from the ply drop-off, more optimized structural design and further weight reduction are possible. Ply Curving Termination (PCT), which locally changes the fiber direction at the edge of the dropped ply, is one of the promising delamination suppression mechanisms. To improve the technical maturity of PCT, this study conducted tensile fatigue tests using asymmetric taper configuration. Damage initiation, delamination propagation, and final failure were evaluated in detail by changing the PCT fiber angle and loading level, confirming that large PCT angles are effective in improving the fatigue properties of tapered laminates and that controlling the location of initial damage is necessary to maximize the effectiveness of PCT. Based on the findings, an effective design guideline for tapered laminates with PCT was presented.",

The emergence of composite 3D printing technology that enables the simplification and automation of composite manufacturing processes presents the possibility of replacing the manufacturing process of secondary structures in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To evaluate the applicability of the technology, a solution for automated non-destructive testing (NDT) that can be applied after the 3D printing process is needed. This study proposes an advanced approach to utilizing laser ultrasonic testing (LUT) for complex-shaped structures fabricated through continuous fiber 3D printing. To ensure accurate defect detection and localization, which are crucial factors in NDT, we propose a method that utilizes a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot arm to control the position of the inspection target. By calculating the scan points and path through coordinate transformation and spatial rotation using a quaternion, all surfaces of the targets were inspected. This maintains a constant stand-off distance (SOD) while the sensing laser was vertically incident on the target surface, resulting in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ultrasonic signals. Inspection results have demonstrated the proposed technique to be suitable for detecting defects in complex-shaped 3D-printed structures.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, Al-based hybrid nanocomposites were developed by powder metallurgy technique using binary hybrid nanofillers consisting of exfoliated MoS2 and GnP as nanofillers. The impact of the MoS2-GnP hybrid nanofiller on the microstructure, mechanical and tribological properties of the Al-based hybrid nanocomposites have been studied. Initially, bulk MoS2 was exfoliated by milling in a high energy planetary ball mill for 30 h and the GnP was synthesized by subjecting the graphite intercalation compound to a thermal shock and subsequently ultrasonicating the thermally exfoliated GnP. The effective exfoliation and structural refinement of both MoS2 and GnP have been confirmed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analysis. Exfoliated MoS2 and GnP were later blended in different ratios of their weight fraction by ultrasonication in an acetone medium. The Al matrix was then reinforced with the various binary hybrid nanofillers consisting of MoS2 and GnP. Wear analysis revealed mechanisms such as abrasion, adhesion, ploughing, delamination, microcracks, deep grooves, and nanofiller pullout in the case of all the nanocomposites. The Al-1 wt.% MoS2(0.3)GnP(0.7) nanocomposite shows superior properties, including the highest relative density (~93.15%), hardness (~476.28 MPa), compressive strength (~337.76 MPa) and outstanding wear resistance among all the Al-MoS2-GnP nanocomposites. Notably, it was observed that straying from the optimal reinforcement loading level can have a detrimental effect on the physical, mechanical, and wear properties of the nanocomposites, resulting in diminished performance and reduced material integrity. The significant improvement in the wear properties of the Al-1 wt.% MoS2(0.3)GnP(0.7) nanocomposite can be attributed to the self-lubricating properties of MoS2 and GnP.",

Following this, the present study evaluates the effects of the remaining PCT geometry parameters; PCT length and PCT radius. Static tensile tests and detailed internal damage observation using X-ray CT are used to evaluate how the strength and fracture process changes with these PCT geometry parameters. Finite element analysis is then used to discuss the shear lag effect by which the fracture behavior changes. It is emphasized that the stiffness increasing gradient at the PCT region due to fiber curving affects the stress distribution and changes the damage initiation behavior. Finally, integrating the findings obtained, points to note when designing to maximize the effectiveness of PCT are discussed.",

Then, the damage behavior of the specimen was observed with a microscope, soft X-ray photography and a 3D ultrasonic inspection system. In this study, to evaluate quantitative characteristics of both transverse crack propagation and delamination growth in the high-cycle region, the energy release rate associated with damage growth in the width direction was calculated. Transverse crack propagation and delamination growth in the width direction were evaluated based on a modified Paris law approach. The results revealed that transverse crack propagation delayed under the test conditions of less than σ max/σ b = 0.3 of the applied stress level.

As appropriate matrices for injection molding and press molding, polypropylene (PP) and polycaprolactone-cornstarch (PCL-C) were selected, as a typical recyclable resin and biodegradable resin, respectively. The mechanical properties of BF/PP composites were investigated in view of fiber mass fraction and injection molding conditions. And the mechanical properties and the biodegradation of BF/PCL composites were also evaluated. In the case of injection molding, the flexural modulus increased with an increase in fiber mass fraction, and the mechanical properties decreased with an increase in cylinder temperature due to the thermal degradation of BF. The optimum conditions increasing the flexural properties and the impact strength were 90°C mold temperature, 30 s injection interval, and in the range of 165 to 185°C cylinder temperature. On the other hand, as to BF/PCL-C fully-green composites, both the flexural properties and the impact strength increased with an increase in fiber mass fraction. It is considered that the BF compressed during preparation could result in the enhancement in mechanical properties. The results of the biodegradability test showed the addition of BF caused the acceleration of weight loss, which increased further with increasing fiber content. This reveals that the addition and the quantities of BF could promote the biodegradation of fully-green composites.",

The governing equations for the piezoelectric laminated plate derived from the principle of virtual work in terms of the electric enthalpy have the same forms as those for a conventional composite laminated plate. We use rectangular sandwich plates of Al/PZT/Al and PZT/Al/PZT with four simply supported edges to demonstrate the prediction of the maximum bending stress in the PZT layer.

    "abstract": "Abstract Coir fiber reinforced polypropylene composites were manufactured using a single extruder and an injection molding machine. Raw coir was chemically treated with benzene diazonium salt to increase its compatibility with the polypropylene matrix. Both raw and treated coir fiber was utilized and five levels of fiber loading (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 wt%) were used during composite manufacturing. Microstructural analysis (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy) and mechanical (tensile, flexural, impact, hardness and water absorption) tests were conducted. Chemically treated coir fiber reinforced specimens yielded better mechanical properties compared to the raw ones. For the fiber loaded samples, 30% fiber reinforced composites had the optimum set of mechanical properties. Authors propose that the bonding between the polypropylene matrix and chemically treated coir fiber must be increased in order to have improved mechanical properties at higher fiber content.

The PVDF composite films were prepared by solution casting method, stretched uniaxially and poled in silicon oil. The nanofiller contents range from 0.05 to 0.3 wt.%. Open circuit output voltage and energy harvesting tests indicate that both the PVDF/MWNT and PVDF/VGCF composite films approached the maximum output at the nanofiller content of 0.05 wt.%. Compared to the neat PVDF films, the maximum increasing rates of open circuit voltage and harvested power density are 24% and 47% for the PVDF/MWNT films and 15% and 78% for the PVDF/VGCF films, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis showed an increase in content of the β phase in the PVDF composites; thus, the piezoelectric properties, which are dependent on β phase content, were enhanced. Stretching of the films leads to the transformation of PVDF from α phase to β phase form. Moreover, the addition of nanofillers, such as MWNT and VGCF, improves this transformation since the nanofillers provide a phase transformation nucleation function.",

High-speed video images showed that unstable growth of the delaminations near the surface was observed prior to the final failure, accompanying buckling of the delaminated layer.

However, waviness and poor packing of CNTs in the sheets are two main weaknesses restricting their reinforcing efficiency in composites. This report proposes a simple press-drawing technique to reduce wavy CNTs and to enhance dense packing of CNTs in the sheets. Non-pressed and pressed CNT/epoxy composites were developed using prepreg processing with a vacuum-assisted system. Effects of pressing on the mechanical properties of the aligned CNT sheets and CNT/epoxy composites were examined. Pressing with distributed loads of 147, 221, and 294 N/m showed a substantial increase in the tensile strength and the elastic modulus of the aligned CNT sheets and their composites. The CNT sheets under a press load of 221 N/m exhibited the best mechanical properties found in this study. With a press load of 221 N/m, the pressed CNT sheet and its composite, respectively, enhanced the tensile strength by 139.1 and 141.9%, and the elastic modulus by 489 and 77.6% when compared with non-pressed ones. The pressed CNT/epoxy composites achieved high tensile strength (526.2 MPa) and elastic modulus (100.2 GPa). Results show that press-drawing is an important step to produce superior CNT sheets for development of high-performance CNT composites.",

In the proposed XFEM-CE approach, the matrix cracks are explicitly modeled by the XFEM through nodal enrichment and element partition, and the inter-ply delaminations are modeled by cohesive elements through traction–separation law. An XFEM-based cohesive element enrichment scheme is developed in order to properly model the interactions between the delaminations and matrix cracks. It is critical to enrich the cohesive elements at the local juncture where cracks meet, in order to obtain the correct crack path interactions. Examples are presented for failure analysis of double-cantilever-beam and end-notch-flexure laminates with different layups. The results show strong explicit matrix crack–delamination interactions in these laminates. This work presents another significant development of a computational platform for realistic modeling of progressive damage in composites.",

A detailed parametric study is conducted to explain the effects of aspect ratio, elastic foundation, surface stress and agglomeration on the biaxial buckling of nanocomposite plate. The results show that surface stress effect plays an important role at nanoscale.

The representative compressive strength of the T300 carbon fiber was nearly the same as the tensile strength. The compressive strength of the T300 carbon fiber was almost same as that of the high-tensile strength T800S carbon fiber. Finite element analysis was performed to investigate the validity of the test method.

Scanning electron microscope images of fracture surfaces provide evidence that the MWCNTs bridged and pulled out at the interface of composite laminates. It was also demonstrated that the optimum weight percentage of MWCNTs needed to improve the mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness was 0.05%, due to the fact that higher concentrations promote the agglomeration of MWCNTs weakening the laminate interfaces.",

The acoustic emission signals were captured by the commercial high-speed optical fiber sensing system. From the impact signals on the baseline locations (30 points), the regression model was constructed for estimating the distances of impact location from each sensor on the target area.

In order to extensively use carbon fibers, it is important to accurately understand and account for their highly anisotropic characteristics. The anisotropy of carbon fibers can be expressed as elastic constants, however evaluation of these constants is very difficult. This study reviews literatures that have analyzed the elastic constants of carbon fibers to clarify the elastic constants of various carbon fibers. This knowledge will lead to more accurate deformation and stress state calculations for structural materials, aiding future development of even higher performance composite materials. The accurate determination of the elastic constants of carbon fibers is also expected to lead to advances in the manufacturing process of carbon fibers and further improve their mechanical properties.Keywords: elastic constantscarbon fiberresonant ultrasound spectroscopyanisotropyshear modulusPoisson's rationanoindentationnonlinearity Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to express our gratitude to Joseph McDonald of TORAY Composites America Inc. for their invaluable assistance with the English language editing of this paper.",

In this work we present materials informatics-based approach, where statistical and machine learning models like correlation matrix, multiple linear regression, principal component analysis and artificial neural network were employed to find the relationship between features and thermoelectric performance.

Thermal, water, biological and γ radiation effects on the composite properties were analysed. Mechanical properties such as tensile, flexural and impact properties of thermal and water aged samples were investigated. The extent of biodegradation and γ irradiation effects was estimated from variations in tensile and impact properties. The tensile and impact fracture mechanism and changes in fiber-matrix adhesion were studied using scanning electron microscopic analysis. The changes in the tensile and flexural stress-strain characteristics as well as deformation behaviour of aged composites are well explained by respective stress-strain curves. Mechanical performance of the composites decreased upon thermal ageing. Marked decrease in these properties of the composites is observed upon radiation ageing. However water immersion leads to an increase in strength properties in some treated composites such as on acetylation, silane, acrylonitrile grafting, isocyanate, permanganate treatment, alkali treatment etc. It is found that oil palm fiber increases the biodegradability of the composites.

Disposal of FRPs by combustion discharges carbon dioxide in the air because the resin of FRPs is made of fossil fuel. When they are disposed of in the ground, FRPs remain semi-permanently without decomposing. In response to these problems, green composites are now being developed and are extensively studied as a material that produces a lower environmental burden. In this paper, green composites using kenaf fiber yarn bundles and PLA (poly(lactic acid)) are fabricated and their tensile properties are evaluated in the experiment. The tensile Young's modulus of all of the laminations is larger than that of PLA alone and the tensile strength of some laminations is larger than that of PLA alone. In particular, the value of UD composite of 0° shows double the tensile strength of PLA alone. Furthermore, the molding conditions for fabricating with a hot press are investigated and the heat resistant tensile properties of green composites are also reported.

Unfortunately, although increasing filler level in papers can improve the paper properties such as brightness, opacity, stiffness gloss, smoothness, porosity, and printability, as well as decrease cost, some strength of the paper is negatively affected. In this research, needle-like aragonite was synthesized using Ca(OH)2 and CO2 as reactants in the presence of MgCl2 and characterized with scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The physical and optical properties of the paper handsheets containing these needle-like aragonite fillers were evaluated. Results indicated that tensile strength, Z-direction tensile strength and folding endurance of the paper were improved by the needle-like aragonite crystals compared to the paper using commercial PCC (precipitated calcium carbonate) as filler. The stiffness of the paper handsheet on the machine direction was increased, but no evident difference in the cross direction was found. The improvement of paper strength mainly resulted from the twining effect between the aragonite whiskers and paper fibers. The optical properties of the paper were slightly decreased with the use of the needle-like aragonites compared to commercial PCC. These results suggest that paper cost can be decreased by increasing the content of needle-like aragonite filler while paper strength will not be decreased compared to PCC filler.",

The first layer is a pure E-glass fabric/epoxy composite laminate and the second layer is a carbon nanocomposite laminate. Composite prepregs of carbon nanomaterials containing carbon black (CB), carbon nanotubes (CNT), and carbon nanofibers (CNF) were used. Numerical models of the complex permittivity of carbon nanocomposites were incorporated into the design process to determine the optimal thicknesses of both the first and the second layers and the optimal filler content of the second layer. By changing the locations of the two peaks in the frequency domain, various radar absorbing structures with different absorbing performances were designed. At the same time, the influence of the electromagnetic characteristics of each carbon nanomaterial on the thickness and the absorbing performance was investigated. The thickness and 10-dB bandwidth were 4.680 mm and 7.5 GHz for CB-composites, 4.090 mm and 7.7 GHz for CNF-composites, and 4.277 mm and 7.4 GHz for CNT-composites, respectively. The broad bandwidth of the CNF-composite as compared to its thickness was attributed to its high dielectric constant as compared to the lossy term of its complex permittivity.

This study investigated the influence of woven fabrics' geometric anisotropy on inter-bundle void formation due to air entrapment at the flow front during RTM. The void content–resin flow velocity relationship was measured in warp (narrow and thick bundle) and weft (wide and thin bundle) directional impregnation. In experiments, warp directional impregnation indicated higher critical resin flow velocity of void formation and void content under a given resin flow velocity than in weft directional impregnation. Void formation was also largely affected by capillary fingering, where warp directional impregnation indicated a higher critical flow velocity of fingering formation. This may be because the gap between the fiber bundle and the mold surface is smaller in the warp direction; thus, the capillary force is higher, and fingering is facilitated compared with weft directional impregnation. Additionally, this may lead to a higher critical velocity of void formation and higher void content at a given flow velocity in warp directional impregnation.Keywords: resin transfer moldingvoidimpregnationglass fiberpolyester resinanisotropy",

The fatigue strength at 106 cycles was 55% of the ultimate strength, which is an almost identical percentage to that of GFRP. The fatigue failure of composite specimens was probably caused by the breakage of jute filaments at the tips of fatigue cracks in PLA.

In the thermal residual stress analysis, the actual thermal residual stress is calculated by considering the relaxation modulus and the time–temperature superposition principle for the resin. Damage initiation criteria for both dilatational and shear cases, based on continuum damage mechanics, are considered for the resin. Interfacial debonding is simulated using a cohesive zone model, and the interfacial strength is taken as the strength of the cohesive zone element at the simulated fiber maximum stress corresponding to the experimental value.",

    "abstract": "Carbon-based nanofillers, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene sheets are considered as effective nanoreinforcements due to their unique structures and material performance. However, the utilisation of such nanofillers can be hindered owing to a high level of nanotoxicity via human inhalation and high material cost for CNTs, as well as the tendency to form agglomerates of graphene sheets in polymer matrices. Bamboo charcoals (BCs) are eco-friendly and sustainable carbon-based particles, which possess good affinity with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), one of popular water soluble biopolymers, to achieve excellent properties of PVA/BC nanocomposites. In particular, porous structures of BC particles enable polymeric molecules to easily penetrate with the strong internal bonding. In this study, fully eco-friendly PVA/BC nanocomposite films were successfully fabricated using a simple solution casting method to achieve the high dispersibility of BCs. With the inclusion of only 3 wt% BCs, tensile modulus and tensile strength of PVA/BC nanocomposite films were enhanced by 70.2 and 71.6%, respectively, when compared with those of PVA films. Better thermal stability is manifested for resulting nanocomposite films as opposed to that of pristine PVA, which is evidenced by the maximum increase of 17.8% in the decomposition temperature at the weight loss of 80%. It is anticipated that BCs can compete against conventional carbon-based nanofillers with a great potential to be developed into eco-friendly nanocomposites used for thin-film packaging application.",

The matrix yielded locally with the increased axial compression, and fibers started to fall due to insufficient support by the yielded matrix. A kink-band was formed with an increase in the yielded area, and thus, the initiation of a kink-band was defined as the local yielding of the matrix. It was also shown that the kink-band was formed at the longitudinal location at which the average of initial local fiber misalignment angles in the cross-section was relatively large.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLiquid composite molding processes are widely accepted in the aeronautic industry to manufacture large and complex structural parts. In spite of their cost-effectiveness, void defects created during the manufacturing process are a major issue of these processing techniques because they have detrimental effects on the mechanical performance. The reliable modeling is still a difficult task and experimental observations are usually adopted for the analysis of void formation mechanism, however, because many different physics are simultaneously involved during the mold filling process and the resin curing process. The complexity of the void formation physics implies the need for an in situ measurement of void formation not in the final part but in the mold filling procedure during the manufacturing process to better understand the void mechanism. In this regard, we present a sensor system measuring the electric conductivity for the in situ monitoring of void formation during the mold filling process. We also propose a theoretical model to predict void formation in a quantitative way with the properties of the resin and the fiber reinforcement. The model prediction is compared with the experimental data obtained by the sensor system to validate the model.Keywords: liquid composite molding processesvoid defectsin situ measurementtheoretical modelelectric conductivity AcknowledgementsThis work has been performed in collaboration with SAFRAN/Aircelle under the research program of 'RTM Structural'.

Some matrix resins of CFRTP are crystalline polymers such as polyamide (PA), polyetheretherketone (PEEK), and polyimide. In this study, carbon fiber reinforced polyamide 6 was used, and the effect of crystal state of PA6 on the mechanical properties of CFRTP was investigated. To understand the crystal state of PA6, Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was carried out, and an increase in the heat treatment time increased the crystallinity of PA6. The results of bending tests showed that there was a relationship between bending strength and crystallinity, however, longer heat treatment time decreased Young's modulus. The results of acoustic emission (AE) analysis and fractography showed that 30-h heat treatment made the matrix resin of CFRTP more brittle. To investigate the reason for this behavior, the DSC analysis of CFRTP was carried out. After the 30-h heat treatment, the crystal state was different compared to that of other materials. Therefore, bending properties are affected by the crystal state. Consequently, the crystal state must be considered to create CFRTP with desired properties.",

Generally, fatigue is related to the entropy, which comprises the mechanical entropy, calculated from the dissipated energy and temperature, and thermal entropy, calculated from the relationship between specific heat capacity and temperature. According to previous studies, mechanical entropy generation and thermal entropy generation are equal. Herein, 100 cyclic loading tests are conducted on epoxy resin specimens consisting of 4,4'-DDS and bisphenol a diglycidyl ether. The dissipated energy is determined based on stress – strain curves, and mechanical entropy generation is quantified. An equation for the relationship between the specific heat capacity and temperature is developed based on the Debye model, and the increase in specific heat capacity is calculated for equal mechanical and thermal entropy generations. Generally, differential scanning calorimetry is used for specific heat capacity measurements; however, because these measurements are performed by cutting the specimen, a nondestructive measurement method is required. In this study, the specific heat capacity is measured using lock-in thermography (LIT), and the measured and estimated values are comparable. Thus, fatigue can be estimated by quantifying the thermophysical properties, and the lock-in thermography method is a suitable thermophysical property measurement method for this application.",

A compaction force was applied through the nozzle tip by setting the layer height to reduce the voids. Microscopic images of specimen cross-sections and surfaces indicated a reduction in fiber waviness and voids after these treatments, and three-point bending tests demonstrated improved mechanical properties.

There is a dearth of comprehensive research concerning the axial compressive performance of retrofitted CFRP bars reinforced concrete (RC) columns. To fill this gap a thorough investigation was carried out to understand failure mode, load–displacement response, axial deflection, axial load-bearing strength, ductility index (DI), stiffness index (KI), and strength index (SI) of retrofitted CFRP bars RC columns. The experimental matrix comprised 14 short circular columns, seven reinforced with CFRP bars and hoops and the other seven with steel bars and hoops. Initial damage was induced through axial loading until a 35% reduction in peak axial strength was observed, after which damaged columns were repaired and retrofitted using CFRP sheets. The parameters of the study include concentric and eccentric compressions, transverse reinforcement spacing, CFRP wrapping, steel, and CFRP reinforcements. According to the findings, lowering transverse hoop spacing enhanced the utmost capacity and ductility of both types of retrofitted columns. The average peak strength and corresponding axial displacement of CFRP RC columns were 22.63% and 14.87%, and ductility (at a 20% load decrease) was 118% higher after CFRP retrofitting. The axial stiffness of damaged CFRP bars RC columns after strengthening with CFRP sheet were not fully rehabilitated and on average SI under concentric loading was 3.22% lower while DI under eccentric loading was 2.71% higher than steel RC columns.",

Such properties as tensile strength, chord or tangent modulus, strain at tensile strength and absorbed energy per unit volume are obtained. Experimental difficulties on stress and strain measurements and specimen fastening are overcome by introducing special instrumental arrangements and an expansive-cement fastening technique. For all cables, at quasi-static (10-5 s-1) and intermediate (10-2 s-1) strain rates, the stress-strain relation is linear. On the other hand, at a dynamic (102 s-1) strain rate, the stress-strain relation is non-linear and all cables tend to increase their elastic modulus and tensile strength. This obviously leads to increase of the absorbed energy per unit volume under dynamic tension. However, the strain at tensile strength remains almost the same at all strain rates. Thus, from a consideration based on the fracture strain criterion, it is concluded that strain rate insensitivity is assured for all cables.

The imide oligomers were synthesized from the reaction of 2,3,3′,4′-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (a-BPDA), 4,4′-oxydiaminine (ODA), and phenylethynyl phthalic anhydride (PEPA). Because of amorphous structure, the melting point and melt viscosities of the polymer are relatively lower as compared with similar polyimides such as LaRC™ PETI-5. In spite of the lower molecular weight of the imide oligomer (<2500 g/mol), the cured polymer exhibits excellent mechanical properties because of the irregular and asymmetric structure as well as flexible end-capper. Carbon fiber reinforced composites were fabricated by routing prepreg consolidation. The composites exhibit excellent mechanical properties with high glass transition temperature (>320°C).",

Compression, tension, and plate-shear tests provided their stress–strain relationships, elastic modulus, and strength. The test results are compared and discussed. The major results obtained are: (1) Filling the aramid honeycomb cells with TEEK-L can improve the basic mechanical properties of an aramid-honeycomb core-material, in particular making them higher than the values expected from the principle of superposition for compression tests and equal to the values expected from superposition for plate-shear tests. (2) The basic mechanical properties of the TEEK-L filled aramid honeycomb are superior to those of AIREX R82 110 and equivalent to those of ROHACELL WF 110, where the three materials have equal densities. (3) The basic mechanical properties of TEEK-L are inferior to those of AIREX R82 60 and ROHACELL WF 51, when materials with equivalent densities are compared.

The Young's modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and density of the disk are assumed to vary exponentially in the radial direction only while the Poisson's ratio is assumed to be constant. The incompatible eigenstrain developed in the FGM disk due to nonuniform coefficient of thermal expansion and change in temperature is taken into account. Based on the two-dimensional thermoelastic theories, the axisymmetric problem is reduced to the solution of a second-order ordinary differential equation. Using the variational approach and Ritz method, a finite element model is developed for numerical solution of the problem. The model is verified for a homogeneous circular rotating disk and demonstrated for an Al2O3/Al FGM disk. Some numerical results of thermoelastic field in the Al2O3/Al FGM disk are presented and discussed. It is found that the thermoelastic characteristics of an FGM disk are largely dependent on temperature distribution profile, radial thickness of the disk, angular speed of the disk, and the inner and outer surface temperature difference, and can be controlled by controlling these parameters.",

Unlike conventional methods using orientation tensors, this approach represents all fibers and resin as an assembly of particles, and automatically analyzes the interaction between fiber and resin and between fibers. In addition, this method can follow the motion of a specific fiber, which is a significant advantage over orientation tensors. This study simulated the injection molding of short-fiber-reinforced plastics; the thermoplastic resin was considered as an incompressible viscous fluid and the fibers were modeled as rigid bodies. The numerical result illustrated that the molding material was unidirectionally reinforced by short fibers since the fibers rotated and were aligned parallel to the flow direction due to the velocity gradient near the wall boundary. Moreover, the stagnation of resin at a corner was predicted. The results agreed well with previous studies, and the present approach was confirmed. Beyond this, we predicted the accumulation of fibers near the wall due to the velocity gradient, which could not be represented by conventional simulations based on orientation tensors.",

To properly verify a prediction model for the void content based on the occurrence of voids due to the air-trapping mechanism, the void content must be measured immediately at the point of air-trapping. In the present study, we created an in situ method for measuring the void content during resin impregnation by combining image analysis with a technique that visualizes the resin flow and void formation during one-dimensional RTM. Using this proposed method, we measured changes in the distribution of the void content at the air-trapping site and following resin curing. As a result, an inversion phenomenon was observed, in which the void content decreased a short distance from the resin inlet due to the time that elapsed, whereas it increased at a longer distance. This phenomenon can be explained by the ease with which the void moved and by the effect of molecular diffusion. In addition, by measuring the change in void content during the time that elapsed from air-trapping until resin curing, we clarified the behavior of the void change and the factors that affect the void content following void formation.",

The mode-I delamination resistance of 5HS specimens, which was evaluated using a double cantilever beam (DCB) method, depends on the weave pattern and the ply stacking sequence at the delamination growth plane. Higher toughness was observed for crack propagation between surfaces with more transverse bundles (L–T and T–T plane) than those with more longitudinal bundles (L–L plane) because of transverse tow delamination pinning the crack and causing it to arrest. The intrinsic mode-I fracture toughness values of the 0°/0°, 0°/90° and 90°/90° fiber combinations were estimated from the G IC values obtained from three kinds of 5HS specimens which have different mid-plane stacking patterns (L–L, L–T and T–T). The G IC of 0°/0° combination corresponded to that of unidirectional specimen. The G IC of 0°/90° combination was almost identical to that of 90°/90° combination. Results suggest that the interlaminar fracture toughness of woven fabric composites can be estimated from the G IC of 0°/0° and 0°/90° (or 90°/90°) combinations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the case of composite structures, low-velocity impact events can cause various types of damage that are mostly hidden inside the laminates or occur on the side opposite to the impact. Thus, damage cannot be easily detected by visual inspection or conventional NDT techniques. Moreover, if the damage occurs between the scheduled inspection periods, the possibilities of extensive damage or catast rophic failure can be increased. For these reasons, built-in NDT systems, such as the real-time impact monitoring system, are required in most composite structures for high reliability and ease of maintenance. In this paper, such an impact monitoring system, including impact location detection and damage assessment techniques, wasstudied for composite flat and stiffened panels. In order to acquire the impact-induced acoustic signals, four multiplexed fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and commercial high-speed FBG interrogator were used. In signal processing for the detection of impact locations and damage occurrences, neural networks and wavelet transforms were adopted. Finally, these algorithms were embodied using MATLAB and LabVIEW software to obtain a user-friendly interface.",

A 3D correlation plot between AE amplitude and duration against time for each loading condition was produced and analysed. The AE measurement of both hydrostatic and pure axial loading suggested that matrix cracks were initiated early in the tests and possible had progressed into delamination failure just before UEWS point was reached at 200 MPa of hoop stress and 63 MPa of axial stress, respectively. No clear damage initiation and progression was observed for pure hoop loading condition. Significant AE events were only noted when buckling induced delamination and debonding failure, which followed by fibre fracture at the outer surface of the pipe.",

The worn surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscope to understand the mechanism. Experimental results showed that the optimal Gr was more beneficial than CNTs in improving the tribological properties of the CFRP composites when they were singly incorporated. It is well worth noting that the friction and wear behavior of the CNTs-filled CFRP composites were improved further when Gr was added, indicating that there is a synergistic effect between them. Tribological tests under different sliding conditions revealed that the Gr and CNTs-filled CFRP composites seemed to be the most suitable for tribological applications under higher sliding speed and load, and oil lubrication.",

The method is based on the assumption that CFRP laminates are homogeneous orthotropic materials. Actual CFRP laminates are, however, heterogeneous materials, having resin-rich layers and carbon fiber layers. In the present study, the electric conductance is calculated on the assumption that CFRP laminates are homogeneous using electrical resistance data measured by a four-probe method, and used for electric current analysis. A new specimen design is proposed to allow the electric current distribution of CFRP laminates to be investigated experimentally. The results obtained confirm that our analysis method is accurate for determining the electric current density of actual CFRP laminates.

    "abstract": "The use of composite materials in offshore engineering for deep sea oil production riser systems has drawn considerable interest due to the potential weight savings and improvement in durability that can be achieved. The design of composite risers consists of two stages: (1) local design based on critical local load cases (LCs) to obtain the geometric configuration of the riser which will be analysed in the global design stage, and (2) global analysis of the full length composite riser under global loads including top tension force, platform motion, hydrostatic pressure, gravity, buoyancy, wave and current loads to determine and assess critical locations. This study describes the methodology, LCs, analysis procedure and results of the global design of the composite riser based on the geometries of the tubular optimised in the local design stage. The results show that a careful local design of the tubular using inclined reinforcements in addition to axial and hoop reinforcements can offer substantial weight savings and at the same time ensure that the structure is capable of withstanding the global loads applied on it.",

The fracture surface observations indicated that resin mesh melted from the edges of the specimen, whereas the unmelted regions remained at the centre of the welding surface. It was necessary to supply a sufficient amount of resin to the welding surface and select a resin mesh suitable for the welding conditions to minimize variations in the bonding strength. Under the welding conditions used herein, the specimens with the coarsest resin mesh showed an average single-lap shear strength of 34 MPa and a coefficient of variation of 0.1.

Four kinds of plain weave woven-fabric CFRP laminated specimens are prepared and subjected to cyclic tensile loading that does not cause any damages, and the electrical resistance changes of the specimens are measured experimentally by the four-probe method. As a result, the present study shows that the electrical resistance of a specimen comprised of six ±45° plies decreases remarkably with increasing number of loading cycles. The decrease is caused by shear plastic deformation of ±45° plies. The thickness shrinkage caused by shear plastic deformation increases the number of fiber contacts, and this decreases the interlaminar contact resistance between the plies. For a single ±45° ply, the same electrical resistance decrease caused by the shear plastic deformation is observed, and the magnitude of the decrease is smaller than that of the six-ply laminate tested. This is because the effect of interlaminar contact resistance decrease does not exist for a single ±45° ply. For the six 0°/90° plies, the present study shows that electrical resistance in the through-thickness direction is decreased by out-of-plane plastic deformation of carbon fiber and misalignment of the plies.",

No visible void or delamination was observed in composite laminates, and the thickness of each layer was almost equal to that of the prepreg. To evaluate the elastic moduli, E11, E22, and G12, of each ply in the laminates, on-axis and off-axis tensile tests (0°, 45°, 90°) were conducted of aligned CNT/epoxy lamina specimens. The Young's modulus of CNT/epoxy cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates agreed with the theoretical values, which were calculated using classical laminate theory and elastic moduli of CNT/epoxy lamina. The respective failure strains of [0°/90°]s, [60°/0°/−60°]s, and [0°/45°/90°/−45°]s laminates are 0.65, 0.92, 0.63%, which are higher than that of 0° composite lamina (0.5%).

Strengths in Hashin damage theory used in the macroscale analyses were determined by microscale analyses. Failure envelope in transverse direction and fiber-axial shear strength were obtained by 3D periodical unit cell analyses with considering the strain-rate dependence of resin strength. In addition, tensile and compressive strengths in fiber-axial direction were determined using the simultaneous fiber failure model and the fiber microbuckling model, respectively. Results of macroscale SHPB analyses were compared to test results. In terms of fracture process, analysis results did not match to test results because we conducted simulations without considering fracture energy. In terms of failure strength, failure load and failure occurred point, we could confirm rather good agreement between analysis results and test results.",

Moreover, the elastic modulus (E) of the tread composites was proportionally related to the tire noises, suggesting that reduced elastic and viscoelastic moduli are desired for low-noise tires.

The effect of various fiber orientations of the plies with glass fibers of 0°/90°/±45°, 0°/90°, and ±45° alignment has been evaluated. The highest fatigue strengths have been recorded for composites with 0°/90° glass fiber ply orientations. Composite with ±45° alignment has the lowest fatigue strengths in S-N curves. Stiffness degradation of the composites with 0°/90° and 0°/90°/±45° at medium fatigue stress levels was calculated and showed higher degradation for stacking having more off-axis plies, i.e. 0°/90°/±45° alignment. Temperature increase during fatigue testing was measured using an IR camera for a medium fatigue stress level for 0°/90°/±45° alignment. Temperature increases were calculated for all stress amplitudes for composites with 0°/90°/±45° and 0°/90° alignment cross-ply sequences. The temperatures obtained were all below the glass transition temperature of the material.

However, stress concentration at the ply drop-off can cause interlaminar delamination from the ply edge. In this study, Ply Curving Termination (PCT), which is introduced by locally curving fibers at 0° ply edges, is used to enhance tensile strength of the ply drop-off. To clarify the dependence of the PCT strength on the curved fiber angle (PCT angle), static tensile tests using ply drop-off specimens are conducted, followed by detailed damage observations using X-ray CT. The results indicates that the strength significantly increases with PCT but the fracture behavior differs depending on the PCT angle. Interestingly, specimens with large PCT angles fail from the position where the fibers curve, away from the ply edge. This PCT-specific failure mechanism is then elucidated using finite element analysis and the virtual crack closure technique, indicating that shear lag caused by the stiffness change due to fiber curving is important. Finally, using the revealed PCT failure mechanism, PCT angles that are the most effective in enhancing tensile strength is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Moisture effects on Mode II interlaminar fracture in T300/914C and T300/M10 carbon/ epoxy composites were investigated by using ENF specimens exposed to different hygrothermal conditions. Crack growth behavior, interlaminar shear strength, glass transition temperature and fractographs of the materials were examined toward establishing the possible mechanisms of moisture effects. It was found that Mode II fracture toughness of T300/M10 is more sensitive to moisture than that of T300/914C. For T300/914C, the matrix was plasticized by water and thus GIIc increased slightly. With further moisture absorption, swelling action weakened the interface and led to reduction of fracture toughness. For T300/M10, moisture primarily weakened the interfacial strength and resulted in decrease in GIIc. It seemed that water plasticization contributed to the enhancement of delamination toughness of the fiber-matrix system with strong interface, and degraded the toughness of the system with weak interface due to a decrease of the fracture area. However, for both of the two systems, the swelling action, which weakened the interface bond, always reduced the delamination resistance.",

Temperature dependent material constants, tensile strength and interlaminar fracture toughness are experimentally obtained, together with detailed observations of matrix cracks and delaminations. Up to about 20% reduction in cryogenic static tensile strength is observed for most of the material systems tested. The damage initiation stresses also decreased under cryogenic conditions. The results indicate that matrix cracks may be one of the major critical issues when current material systems are applied to cryogenic propellant tanks. Numerical predictions of the delaminations and matrix cracks are conducted to theoretically support the experimental consequences.

In the experimental investigation, constant amplitude loading, multiple-level loading and random loading have been considered step by step during the fatigue tests. In particular, a residual strength degradation model was presented for predicting the fatigue life of composites subjected to constant amplitude fatigue loading. The accumulation of fatigue damage was determined, using the residual strength degradation model. The residual strength distribution after an arbitrary fatigue cycle can be represented by a two-parameter Weibull distribution function. A fatigue reliability analysis method for arbitrary load history was thus developed through the Weibull distribution function. Good correlation between theory and experiment was obtained for constant amplitude loading, two-level loading, three-level loading and random loading. The result of the present study can be used as a basis for the reliability design of mechanical components made of Gr/PEEK composites.",

The method is a well-improved test method of the split cantilever test method and easy to conduct, while a computational analysis is necessary to specify the critical toughness values. The aim of the test is to obtain mixed mode fracture toughness. The twisting force that exists in the case of the split cantilever test method is avoided by making the specimen symmetric by introducing two symmetrically located delaminations. By the present method, the two cracks grow stably keeping their configuration with the increase of applied displacement, that is, stable self-similar crack growth is realized. The energy release rate can be numerically evaluated from the experimentally obtained data, such as, the applied load (or applied displacement) as well as the crack configuration. The energy release rate varies along the curved crack front and the dependence of the mixed mode critical energy release rate on the ratio of the mode components can be obtained by one test trial. The method can be conveniently used to roughly estimate the failure criterion for mode II and III mixed mode Interlaminar fracture.",

By varying the skin thickness (t) and the span length between supports (l), experimental tests were carried out in order to find the relationship between the geometrical configuration of the sandwiches and the failure mechanism. By plotting failure mechanism on a graph of l against t, a failure map was created identifying the three typical failure mode regions of these sandwiches. The graph clearly shows the failure mode corresponding to each combination of l and t. To help optimise the use of these sandwich beams as structural elements, a theoretical failure mode map was constructed. The theoretical model results were consistent with the experimental ones, and so we can conclude that the theoretical model is a reliable predictor of failure mechanisms in sandwiches with defined geometry.",

The objective functions are the natural frequencies of the laminated plates, and three types of optimization problems are studied where the fundamental frequency and the difference of two adjacent frequencies are maximized, and the difference between the target and actual frequencies is minimized. The design variables are a set of discrete values of fiber orientation angles with prescribed increment in the layers of the plates. The four lamination parameters are used to describe the bending property of a symmetrically laminated plate, and are optimized by a gradient method in the first stage. A new technique is introduced in the second stage to convert from the optimum four lamination parameters into the stacking sequence that is composed of the optimum fiber orientation angles of all the layers. Plates are divided into sub-domains composed of the small number of layers and designed sequentially from outer domains. For each domain, the optimum angles are determined by minimizing the errors between the optimum lamination parameters obtained in the first step and the parameters for all possible discrete stacking sequence designs. It is shown in numerical examples that this design method can provide with accurate optimum solutions for the stacking sequence of vibrating composite plates with various boundary conditions.

Drop-weight impact damage was induced to a composite specimen with impact energy of 6.7 J/mm in accordance with ASTM D7136. Postimpact fatigue tests were conducted using a test fixture defined in ASTM D7137 under compression–compression loading (R = 10) at room temperature. The maximum compressive stress (S min) was 200, 210, 220, 230, and 240 MPa, and the total number of specimens was 31. The compression-after-impact strength and fatigue lifetime show considerable scattering. This result is apparently derived from the variation in impact damage size. A simple statistical model based on the weakest link theory was proposed for predicting the lifetime of impact-damaged composite laminates. Results show that the experimentally obtained data were confirmed consistently using this model. The ratio between the endurance limit at 106 and 107 cycles and the initial static strength was estimated as 0.74 and 0.68 as B-basis allowable values.

The melting temperature of PLA was shifted to a lower temperature because of the dispersion of HA particles. However, the cold crystallization temperature shifted to a lower temperature at high HA composition, suggesting that HA particles acted as a nuclear agent. x c,PLA of the composites with bimodal particle size distribution showed the lowest of all three composites, suggesting that mobility of PLA polymer chain was reduced by bimodal particle size distribution, which means the increase of restriction at interface between polymer matrix and particle. Melt flow rate (MFR) increased because of dispersed HA particle. The reason was thought that hydrolysis degradation of PLA occurred during melt-mixing process is accelerated by HAp particle dispersion. The MFR of composites increased concomitantly with increased particle size. Mechanical properties such as flexural strength and the modulus of bimodal-HA/PLA composite with both 5 and 1 μm of representative size were higher than those of monomodal-HA/PLA composites with 5 or 1 μm of representative size within the range of the results of this paper. Fracture surfaces were affected by the particle size distribution.

At current study, wood powder/polypropylene composites (wood/PP) with different filler contents were molded by injection molding process to investigate the effect of filler content on the physical and mechanical properties of the composites. Additionally, the comparison of physical and mechanical properties between talc/PP (which has been widely used in the automotive products) and wood/PP has been carried out based on the tensile, bending, Izod impact tests and the scanning electron microscope observation on the fracture surfaces. Results showed that the highest mechanical property of wood/PP was determined at 30 wt.% wood content. More interesting is that, at the same composite density up to 30 wt.%, the mechanical property of wood/PP was much higher than that of talc/PP. Theoretically, Nielsen equation is often used to predict the elastic modulus of filler reinforced plastics, and in this study, the predicted values were in good agreement with experimental values up to 30 wt.%, after that, they were higher to the experimental values of wood/PP composite. It is considered that is due to the discounted of the distribution and orientation of the filler in the matrix in Nielsen equation.",

During the fabrication process, the fibrous preform is subject to through-thickness and in-plane deformations. These deformations may affect the quality of the components and their mechanical performance. Hence, the compaction behavior of the reinforcement is crucial in order to predict its deformation during processing. The present work deals with the first stage of LCM manufacturing, during which the dry preform is draped into the rigid base mold and then compressed during closure of the upper mold. Under traditional manufacturing conditions, the preform is subjected to a single static compressive load. In the current study, controlled vibrations are applied to the preform before static compaction. These vibrations have a strong impact on nesting and on the further static compaction behavior of the reinforcement. The scope of this investigation is to study the influence of vibration parameters such as amplitude and frequency on the compaction of continuous fiber beds used to reinforce high-performance composites. Mechanical tests were performed using a special DMA instrument that allows characterizing the dynamic compaction of fibrous reinforcements at high frequency.",

    "abstract": "NomexTM honeycomb core composite sandwich panels are widely used in aircraft structures. Detailed meso-scale finite element modeling of the honeycomb geometry can be used to analyze sandwich inserts, vibration response, and complex combined loading cases. The accuracy of a meso-scale honeycomb modeling technique for static load cases was evaluated. A rectangular honeycomb core was modeled with perfect hexagon honeycomb cells. Compression and shear tests simulations with linear and non-linear solutions were performed for four core densities. The simulated moduli and buckling strengths were recorded. These results were compared to property data published by honeycomb manufacturers. The simulated maximum honeycomb wall stresses at the manufacturer predicted core strengths were also recorded. The honeycomb walls' first compression deformation mode shape was observed. Sinusoidal small imperfections were then introduced in the honeycomb geometry based on that deformation mode shape. These imperfections provided a better match to manufacturer compressive modulus data while having a limited impact on the shear moduli. The simulated properties did not exactly match manufacturers' shear and compression data together for all the core densities. Modeling the honeycomb cells with rounded corners and with increased thickness at the cell junctions are potential strategies to improve the accuracy.",

In particular, this paper experimentally tests an existing model formulated for shear modulus by redefining for in the tensile storage modulus. Experiments to characterize viscoelastic behaviour were performed in a dynamic mechanical and thermal analysis (DMTA) instrument in the frequency domain. Master curves are then created from DMTA using general time–temperature–cure superposition. The master curves are then normalized using the model so that the master curve does not depend on the properties in the rubbery region. This results in a unique master curve that describes the viscoelastic behaviour of the LY5052 epoxy resin for the given conditions. Once the relationship between the rubbery modulus and the degree of cure has been established, the amount of experimental characterization can be reduced. This could lead to the development of simplified experimental methodologies and simplified models to characterize the viscoelasticity of low molecular weight resins like the LY5052 epoxy resin system.",

A thorough investigation on the mechanical endurance of sandwich structures reinforced with woven spacer fabrics reveals that their compression and shear properties are at stake with the increase in their core heights. In this work, a new concept for the sandwich structure, 3D spacer fabrics with integrally woven connecting walls in three different configurations were designed and fabricated. Further, the woven samples were consolidated into composite structures using epoxy resin and their improved structural effectiveness was studied by loading them under compression and bending loads. From these test results, it was evident that suitable modification of woven connecting wall configuration can successfully produce energy absorbent ultra-lightweight hollow structures. T-peel test carried on a replicate model of the junction formed in the structures revealed that the structures show node lamination prone failures.

This multiscale modeling consists of two finite-element analyses (FEA) on different scales. One is macroscopic FEA, based on the assumption of homogeneous materials, and the other is microscopic periodic unit-cell (PUC) analysis using a micromechanical model. The macroscopic FEA is performed by applying uniaxial tension to off-axis laminates, in which we employ an anisotropic elasto-plastic constitutive law to obtain accurate deformation fields in laminates. In the microscopic PUC analysis, the strain history at a point in laminates obtained from the macroscopic FEA is applied as external forces, and crack initiation is predicted using two failure criteria for the matrix resin. The first is the dilatational energy density criterion under elastic deformation, and the second is a ductile damage growth law under plastic deformation. The simulated predictions are compared with the experiments results.Keywords: composite materialscrack initiationmultiscale modelingdilatational energy densityductile damage growth AcknowledgmentsT.O. thanks Toray Industries, Inc. and Toray Composites (America), Inc. for support of this study.",

Previous investigations have shown that Lamb Waves (LW) are very well suited for the use in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) due to their relatively undamped propagation over long distances. Therefore the numerical modelling of a non-contact and automated system for non-destructive testing of C-FRP laminates was investigated in the present study. The method is based on the propagation of LW, which are excited by an actuator-driven piezo transducer and interact with defects in the structure. In contrast to classical Structural Health Monitoring, a scanning inspection system is used instead of a sensor permanently integrated into the structure to detect the measurement signals. For the representation of the wave propagation a three-dimensional simulation model with the commercial FEM software PZFlex was modelled. The wave interactions in defective C-FRP coupons are investigated and visualized through different output formats like A-, B- and C-Scans. Additionally the model allows the determination of the dispersion characteristics of the LW in the examined laminate. The validation of the numerical results was successfully carried out at different levels with the help of experimental investigations.",

In the present study, we have evaluated the effects of nanoscale hybridization of graphene oxide (GO) and multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) on the electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of polyetherimide (PEI) nanocomposites reinforced by GO-MWCNT hybrid. Synthesis of GO-MWCNT hybrid was confirmed by various spectroscopic measurements. The inclusion of GO-MWCNT hybrid to PEI endows optimum dispersion and better interfacial interactions between GO-MWCNTs and PEI matrix and thus remarkably improved the conductivity, tensile properties and thermal stability of PEI. When the mass ratio of GO to MWCNT is 1:1 and the total filler loading is only 2 wt%, the DC conductivity of the nanocomposite films enhanced by 6 orders of magnitude, the tensile strength increased by fourfold and the Young's modulus increased by sixfold compared to those of pure PEI. The reinforcement efficiency of the GO-MWCNT (1:1) hybrid in terms of the modulus of the nanocomposite was predicted using modified Halpin–Tsai modelling and compared with the experiment results.

In this study, finite element analyses for ultrasonic welding of CFRPs were performed using a two-dimensional model. The effects of the shape of the ED on the temperature increase, deformation history, and dissipated energy behaviors are discussed. Flat and triangular ED shapes are considered. From the results, it is easier for a triangular ED to increase the temperature than for a flat ED, and hence, the consumed energy and time are less for a triangular ED than for a flat ED. However, in the triangular ED, the temperature is distributed significantly, that is, there is a very high temperature at some point and a very low temperature at other points. Thus, unexpected chemical reactions, such as oxidation, may occur. This study concludes that a triangular ED is not always better than a flat ED. In any case, it was found that an abrupt temperature increase was caused by a synergistic effect. That is, the increase in temperature causes the viscoelastic and frictional dissipated energy to be remarkable, and the increase in the dissipated energy increases the temperature.",

    "abstract": "AbstractExcellent mechanical strength and biodegradable characteristics of magnesium alloys have sparked considerable interest in orthopedic applications. The utilization of magnesium alloys in orthopedic applications has been restricted due to their brittleness caused by high corrosion rate in biological environments. One of the best techniques for increasing corrosion resistance of these alloys is surface coating. For the first time, the present work aims to dip-coat zein-bioactive glass (BG) nanocomposite on AZ31B magnesium alloy. The alloy surface was also coated by native zein as a control coating. BG nanoparticles required for zein and BG (zein_BG) composite were synthesized by a bio-inspired method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a template. The formation of BG particles was affirmed by FTIR showing characteristic Si-O-Si and Si-O– peaks. Nano-size of BG particles with an average diameter of 6.67 ± 0.06 nm was reported by TEM. SEM micrographs revealed successful deposition of zein and zein_BG coatings on the magnesium alloy surfaces. High-resolution XPS analysis on zein_BG-coated Mg alloy immersed in HBSS revealed the corrosion deposition of Mg(OH)2, MgHPO4.H2O, CaHPO4.H2O, SiO2, MgCO3, and CaCO3 on the substrate surface. More than twofold wettability, 95% adhesion strength and 14-fold increase in surface roughness were reported for zein_BG-coated magnesium alloy compared to the bare surface. Measurements of weight loss in zein and zein_BG-coated alloy substrates in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) for 10 d at 37°C showed a drastic decrease in weight loss of substrates after coating. As a result, zein_BG-coated substrate was observed to possess the maximum protective efficacy (95.99%) against corrosion. Interestingly, electrochemical measurements revealed a vast decrease in corrosion current density (2.41 E−6 A.cm−2) of zein_BG-coated substrate compared to the uncoated substrate (3.04 E−4 A.cm−2). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) confirmed capacitive behavior of zein_BG-coated alloy substrate. These findings demonstrated that simple zein_BG composite dip coating was a successful corrosion-resistant implant coating on magnesium alloy surface for orthopedic applications.Keywords: NanocompositeBioactive GlassDip CoatingCorrosion Resistance;Mechanical Properties Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Authors ContributionNarjes Ibrahem Khaled : Methodology, Investigation, Validation, Writing – review and editingDeenan Santhiya: Resources, Supervision.

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the most important issues in producing composite materials is fibre sizing, due to the usual incompatibility between the fibres and the matrix. In the present work, the evaluation of an alkaline surface treatment of sugar cane bagasse fibres through Scanning Electron Microscopy(SEM), X-ray microanalysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) is reported. The results show that the treatment with calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] chemically modifies the surface of the bagasse fibre producing a calcium carbonate deposit on the surfaces, whereas sodium hydroxide [NaOH] has little or no effect. The main action of NaOH on the fibre is to remove the lignin binder of the cellulosic material. Keywords: Sugar cane bagassesurface studiesalkaline treatmentcellulosic materialsfibre sizing",

For the 0/0 interface, the interlaminar fracture toughness under dry, 50% relative humidity equilibrium, and wet conditions were also measured. Fiber orientations at delaminated surfaces were found to affect the interlaminar fracture toughness at initiation (G1C and GIIC) slightly, and the interlaminar fracture toughness during propagation (GIR and GIIR) strongly. Also, the degree of moisture absorption affected GIC slightly, anf GIR strongly. In Mode II, GIIC was strongly affected by the degree of moisture absorption. Contrary to this, GIIR was not affected by moisture absorption.",

Hence, mixtures of SiO2 /B2O3 at various ratios were examined in regard to their high temperature durability. As a result of oxidation tests, pure B2O3 over-coated on a SiC-coated C/C composite was eventually confirmed to exhibit sufficient sealing capability up to 1800 K. This result was shown to be derived by the chemical reaction between B2O3 and SiC. By this reaction, a sufficient amount of SiO2was thickly and uniformly formed on the surface of the SiC coating.

The preforms were fabricated with carbon fibers by using the new performing process and molded using resin transfer molding (RTM) process with epoxy resin into I-beam frames and panels for investigating mechanical testing and production cost.

Prior to composite fabrication, a bundle of raw henequen fibers were treated at various E-beam intensities from 10 kGy to 500 kGy. The effect of E-beam intensity on the interfacial, mechanical and thermal properties of randomly oriented henequen/polypropylene composites with the fiber contents of 40 vol% was investigated focusing on the interfacial shear strength, flexural and tensile properties, dynamic mechanical properties, thermal stability, and fracture behavior. Each characteristic of the material strongly depended on the E-beam intensity irradiated, showing an increasing or decreasing effect. The present study demonstrates that henequen fiber surfaces can be modified successfully with an appropriate dosage of electron beam and use of a low E-beam intensity of 10 kGy results in the improvement of the interfacial properties, flexural properties, tensile properties, dynamic mechanical properties and thermal stability of henequen/polypropylene composites.

The critical fiber-length for the transition is a key parameter for the manufacturing of flexible and high-strength CFRP composites with thermoset resin, because below this limit, we cannot take full advantage of the superior strength properties of fibers. For this discussion, we presented a numerical model for the microscopic damage and fracture of unidirectional discontinuous fiber-reinforced plastics. The model addressed the microscopic damage generated in these composites; the matrix crack with continuum damage mechanics model and the fiber breakage with the Weibull model for fiber strengths. With this numerical model, the damage transition behavior was discussed when the fiber length was varied. The comparison revealed that the length of discontinuous fibers in composites influences the formation and growth of the cluster of fiber-end damage, which causes the damage mode transition. Since the composite strength is significantly reduced below the critical fiber-length for the transition to fiber-avoiding crack mode, we should understand the damage mode transition appropriately with the analysis on the cluster growth of fiber-end damage.",

First, semi-cylindrical RAS with a periodic square patterned layer using a conducting polymer was designed and simulated by a commercial 3-D electromagnetic field analysis program. The designed semi-cylindrical structure with low RCS was then fabricated using fiber-reinforced composites and conducting polymer materials. Finally, the radar cross-section was measured in order to evaluate the radar absorbing performance of the fabricated RAS at a compact range facility. The measured radar absorption of the fabricated RAS showed that the target's RCS declined in a range of 65% to 94% within the X-band relative to a non-radar absorbing specimen.

    "abstract": "Sandwich-structure materials consist of a high-strength skin material and a lightweight core material. The advantages of sandwich structures are known to include excellent mechanical properties and low weight. Sandwich structures are lightweight because of their lightweight core; meanwhile, the skin structure provides mechanical strength and bears bending stress. Carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is a high-specific-strength and high-specific-rigidity material. In recent years, CFRP sandwich structures have been used in aerospace applications due to their lightweight properties. However, soft-core members such as plastic foam materials have low rigidity and therefore may not exhibit adequate function as a sandwich structure. Webs can make up for the lack of rigidity of soft core members. Consequently, sandwich structures with reinforcement webs offer higher strength than sandwich structures without reinforcement webs. This study focused on reinforcement webs suitable for use in CFRP sandwich structures by evaluating the bending characteristics of CFRP sandwich structures with reinforcement webs. Experimental results demonstrated that CFRP sandwich structures with reinforcement webs had improved bending strength. The effects of the spacing interval of reinforcement webs and the number of layers of carbon fiber fabric on the bending characteristics of CFRP sandwich structures were also examined. Finally, an optimal condition model was created for CFRP sandwich structures with reinforcement webs.",

Joints were repaired using precured or cocured composite patches. The bond strengths of the different joints were compared. We also investigated whether the incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the adhesive bondline affected bond strength. We found that the induction-cured samples exhibited bond strengths similar to those of the corresponding oven-cured samples; this was true for both the baseline and the CNT-reinforced samples. Further, the samples processed using cocured patches exhibited higher bond strengths than did the corresponding samples processed using precured patches. In the case of both the precured and the cocured patch samples, the dispersion of 0.5 wt% CNTs in the adhesive bondline increased the bond strength slightly. The effect of the two different types of patches placed on top of the aluminum substrate on the rate of temperature increase by induction curing was shown experimentally, and, numerical simulations were performed to verify the experimental results. The results from this study show that the induction curing and co-curing method may be regarded as a sound and efficient method for composite patch bonding repair.",

Materials with self-healing ability are capable to partially or completely repair damages, thus increasing the life of the structural component. One of the self-healing approaches involves the use of solvents as healing agent, which reacts with the polymer healing microcracks. The objective of this research is to investigate a procedure to encapsulate solvents into halloysite nanotubes (HNT) to promote self-healing ability in epoxy. Autonomic healing would be triggered by crack propagation through the embedded nanotubes in the polymer, releasing the liquid solvent into the crack plane. Two solvents were considered in this work: dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and nitrobenzene. A procedure was developed to fill HNT with the solvents, which were then coated using the layer-by-layer technique of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Solvent encapsulation was verified by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared analysis, thermogravimetry, specific surface area (BET), and scanning electron microscopy. The results suggest that the procedure was successful to encapsulate DMSO into the nanotubes.Keywords: self-healing materialscomposite materialsnanotubeshalloysite",

This joint system offers comparable strength to that of adhesive and metal bolt joints, while adding negligible weight to the parts.

    "abstract": "This investigation is focused on identifying a new variety of natural fiber (Dharbai fiber) for reinforcement in polymer matrix composites. An investigation on extraction procedure of Dharbai fibers has been undertaken. The chemical properties of Dharbai fibers were determined experimentally as per TAPPI standards. The FT-IR Spectroscopy was used to study the chemical structure of Dharbai fibers and the tensile properties of these fibers were studied using single filament test. The fibers extracted were reinforced in polyester matrix by varying the fabrication parameters namely fiber weight content (%) and fiber length (mm). The effect of fiber weight content and fiber length on the mechanical properties of Dharbai fiber-polyester composites were evaluated as per ASTM standards. Scanning electron microscope was used to characterize the interfacial bonding between Dharbai fibers and polyester matrix. This study confirmed that, the Dharbai fibers could be used as an effective reinforcement material for making low load bearing polymer composites.",

The time–temperature superposition principle is typically used to estimate the long-term viscoelastic behavior. In addition, Mises criterion and Tresca criterion have been proposed to estimate the yield or failure stresses in a multiaxial stress state and Christensen failure criterion can be applied in the case of different tensile and compressive strengths. In this study, using molecular dynamics method, uniaxial and biaxial tensile and compression test simulations were performed for polypropylene at various strain rates and temperatures. It was observed that the compressive fracture stresses were higher than the tensile fracture stresses. In addition, the fracture stress was high at a low temperature and high strain rate and these fracture stresses are in good agreement with Christensen failure criterion curves. Furthermore, the long-term viscoelastic behavior can almost be predicted from the short-term viscoelastic behaviors at three different temperatures using time–temperature superposition principle. But, the simulations at a wide range of temperatures is important to predict the more accurate long-term viscoelastic behavior.",

This enables high structural accuracy under large temperature fluctuation like space. On the other hand, when the laminate is subjected to thermal cycles, cyclic thermal stress occurs and causes microscopic damages. In this study, we characterized damage progress in CFRP laminates and resultant variation in mechanical properties under cyclic thermal loading. Three types of matrices, such as polycyanate ester, polyimide and epoxy resin were used to prepare CFRP laminates. Specimens were subjected to thermal cycles from −197°C to 120°C. The test was periodically stopped for surface observation and flexural loading. Transverse cracks in 90° plies accumulated with thermal cycles, whereas flexural modulus remained constant. We also numerically evaluated temperature gradient and resultant thermal stress distribution during cooling by finite element analysis. The result indicates higher transverse stress appeared in the surface of the specimen and saturated to constant value which corresponded with the value calculated based on classical lamination theory.",

The effects of temperature change and adhesive thickness on the shear and peel stresses in the adhesive layer of the bonded joint, with and without external forces, are examined based on the theoretical analysis. The results calculated for the condition involving a mechanical load application to the bonded joint and a decrease in temperature indicate that the absolute value of the shear and peel stresses peak at both ends of the adhesive layer, and that the absolute value of the peak stresses increases in the case of a thinner adhesive layer.

Composite primary structures that are L-shaped or T-shaped have a right-angled corner, and phased-array ultrasonic inspection or water squirt robotic C-scan is mainly used for the corners. However, using a customized transducer has restrictions depending on the size and shape of the corner. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on rotational laser ultrasonic inspection for even narrow corner sections regardless of size and angle. In the rotational scanning method, the target structure is rotated for inspection, which is different from conventional scanning methods in which transducers or a scanning head are moved along the inspection area. The rotational scanning method is designed to solve the problem of signal-to-noise ratio deterioration that occurs when the ultrasonic sensing laser scans a curved surface. The corner sections of two L-shaped specimens fabricated by autoclave curing and resin transfer molding were inspected using the rotational scanning method. Using the proposed method, all of the artificial defects inserted into the corner section of the specimens were clearly visualized. Then, the inspection results were compared with water squirt C-scan inspection results. The test results showed that the proposed method is highly reliable and useful for inspecting the corner sections.",

In this study, we used the electrical resistance change method to monitor CFRTPs. The electrical properties were measured in terms of fiber orientation and electrode distance. In addition, a cyclic test was performed to reveal the change in the electrical resistance. Our results reveal that the volume resistance along the 90° orientation has a larger standard deviation than those for the other specimens. The change in resistance exhibited reverse piezo-resistivity at the low stress range in the cyclic tests. The reverse piezo-resistivity occurred due to fiber waviness, which is generated during the 3D printing process.",

Until now, aramid nanofibers were hybridized into the epoxy resin by adding water into an aramid nanofiber solution to obtain free-standing powders. Unfortunately, such a water-based method for inducing the gelation hinders high-level dispersion due to the re-agglomeration of the nanofibers by protonation. This study presents a novel technique utilizing a solvent-exchange method to maximize the dispersion degree of aramid nanofibers, thereby increasing the mechanical properties of epoxy nanocomposites. The mechanical properties of aramid nanofiber-reinforced epoxy nanocomposites by the solvent-exchange method were improved significantly (3.4 GPa in Young's modulus and 90.0 MPa in tensile strength – improvements of 28.8% and 27.7%, respectively) although a high viscosity epoxy resin (bisphenol-A type) was considered. Therefore, the suggested solvent-exchange method is an efficient manufacturing process to produce highly dispersed aramid nanofiber/epoxy nanocomposites.",

Single-lap shear strength tests were performed on the dried and saturated specimens at 25 °C and 100 °C to 180 °C at 20 °C intervals. At 160 °C, the strength of the CF/PEKK thermoplastic composites rapidly declined to 76% (dried specimens) and 78% (moist specimens). The fracture surfaces and failure modes were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy images, which confirmed an increase in the degraded areas and naked fibers at higher testing temperatures. In addition, it was found that exposure to a moist environment changes the failure mode from fiber bundles and fiber/matrix failure to naked fiber and matrix failure owing to the reduction in interfacial adhesion properties. The findings confirmed that hygrothermal conditions directly affect the degradation of the CF/PEKK thermoplastic composites and that a rapid reduction in the single-lap shear strength occurs above Tg.",

The rim comprised press fitted multiple concentric rings(multi-ring) to prevent radial tensile failures at high rotational speed. Rings were fabricated by a filament winding process using high strength carbon fiber. The configuration of the hub was like a steering wheel with 4 spokes. The cross-section area of these spokes was changed to withstand a centrifugal force. Spin tests of flywheel rotors were performed, using an air turbine driven spin tester in a vacuum chamber. The rotor was spun to maximum peripheral speed at 1310 m/s, whose stored energy was 354 Wh, and the specific energy density was 195 Wh/kg.

The confined and unconfined (control) specimens were loaded in uniaxial compression. Axial load and axial and lateral strains were obtained in order to evaluate stress-strain behavior, ultimate strength, stiffness, and ductility of the wrapped specimens. Results show that external confinement of concrete by FRP composite sheets can significantly enhance strength, ductility and energy absorption capacity. An analytical model to predict the entire stress-strain relationship of concrete specimens wrapped with FRP composite sheets was developed. Comparison between the experimental results and those of analytical indicates that the model provides satisfactory predictions of the stress-strain response. The paper also presents the performance of the wrapped concrete specimens subjected to wet-dry environments. The specimens were exposed to 300 cycles of wetting and drying using salt water. Results show that the specimens wrapped with carbon and aramid fibers experienced no reduction in strength due to wet/dry exposure, whereas those wrapped with glass fiber experienced a significant reduction in strength.",

Unfortunately, GAs often require large computational resources for individual evaluation. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes use of lamination parameters in an optimization process approach with GA. The optimization process requires precise approximation of design space using response surfaces to obtain the true optimal result. However, stacking sequence optimizations are discrete optimization problems and it is difficult to judge optimality of an obtained result on the lamination parameter space. For zooming response surfaces, we require an optimality check method. In this study, laminates adjacent to the obtained optimal result are introduced on the lamination parameter space and an optimality-check-test method is proposed. The test method is applied to a buckling load maximization problem of a laminated composite plate; its effectiveness is confirmed by example.",

The present study employs an electric resistance change method for detection of delaminations. Although the method is effective in monitoring delamination cracks, it requires many experiments to solve inverse problems. An analytical method for preparation of data sets of the electric resistance changes is desired because the experimental cost is high. However, actual delamination cracks usually include matrix cracking. Therefore, this study uses FEM analyses to investigate the effect of matrix cracking on electric resistance changes between electrodes.

The arrester has a semi-cylindrical shape and is arranged in the foam core and is attached to the surface skin. Here, energy release rates and complex stress intensity factors are calculated using finite element analysis. Effects of the arrester size and its elastic moduli on the crack suppressing capability are investigated. Considerable reductions of the energy release rates at the crack tip are achieved as the crack tip approached the leading edge of the crack arrester. Thus, this new concept of a crack arrester may become a promising device to suppress crack initiation and propagation of the foam core sandwich panels.

Moisture diffusivity in CFRP was determined by measuring a specimen's weight during the moisture absorption test. Three types of CFRP specimens were prepared: a unidirectionally reinforced laminate, a quasi-isotropic laminate and woven fabric. Each CFRP was processed into two geometries — a thin plate for determination of diffusivity and a rod with a square cross-section for the discussion of two-dimensional diffusion behavior. By solving Fick's law expanded to 3 dimensions, the diffusivities in the three orthogonal directions were obtained and analyzed in terms of the anisotropy of CFRP moisture diffusion. Coefficients of moisture expansion (CMEs) were also obtained from specimen deformation caused by moisture absorption. During moisture absorption, the specimen surfaces showed larger deformation near the edges due to the distribution of moisture contents. This deformation was reasonably predicted by the finite element analysis using experimentally determined diffusivities and CMEs. For unidirectional CFRP, the effect of the fiber alignment on CME was analyzed by micromechanical finite element analysis (FEA) and discussed.",

DNS approach is based on the full microscopic concepts, which can provide detailed information about the local interaction between the constituents and micro-failure mechanisms by separate modeling of each constituent. Various composite materials such as metal matrix composites (MMCs), active fiber composites (AFCs), boron/epoxy cross-ply laminates and 3-D orthogonal woven composites are selected as verification examples of DNS. The effective elastic moduli and impact structural characteristics of the composites are determined using the DNS models. These DNS models can also give the global and local information about deformations and influences of high local in-plane and interlaminar stresses induced by transverse impact loading at a microscopic level inside the materials. Furthermore, the multi-scale models based on DNS concepts considering microscopic and macroscopic structures simultaneously are also developed and a numerical low-velocity impact simulation is performed using these multi-scale DNS models. Through these various applications of DNS models, it can be shown that the DNS approach can provide insights of various structural behaviors of composite structures.",

The temperature changes indicated the differences between the dry preform and the outside of the vacuum bagging. After the molding, four-point bending was applied to the panel for the verification of its structural integrity and the sensor capabilities. The optical fibers were then used for the newly-developed PPP-BOTDA (Pulse-PrePump Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analysis) system. The long-range distributed strain and temperature can be measured by this system, whose spatial resolution is 100 mm. The strain changes from the FBGs and the PPP-BOTDA agreed well with those from the conventional strain gages and FE analysis in the CFRP panel.

The natural frequencies of a material, or a system, are a function of its elastic properties, dimensions and mass. This concept is used to calculate theoretical vibration modes of the composites. The damping properties in terms of the damping factor are determined by the half-power bandwidth technique. Numerically analyzed and experimentally measured time response curves are compared. It is seen that polymer matrix composites have temperature dependent mechanical properties. This relationship is functional and they have different effects against temperature.

The CFRP has a potential of weight reduction in the automotive structure, which can contribute to the improvement of mileage as well as the reduction of carbon dioxide. On the other hand, the safety issue in case of collision should be also clarified when employing the CFRP as automotive structures. In this paper, hybrid beams which consisted of an Al alloy beam and a CFRP laminate were examined by both experiments and numerical analyses as candidates to replace the conventional steel door guarder beam used inside the automotive door. The experimental relations of impact loading to the displacement for the Al beams with different thicknesses, widths and types of CFRP showed good agreement with those from numerical results. In order to increase the impact energy absorption, other hybrid beams were devised and calculations performed by using the same parameters in the same numerical method and their results also agreed with those of experiments executed after the calculation. These facts show that the numerical method developed here can be generally used for estimating the impact behavior of CFRP/Al hybrid beams. Furthermore, a suggestion for how to install the hybrid beam to automotive doors was proposed by the numerical method. As a result, the effectiveness of our simulation technology is demonstrated here.",

By comparing the off-axis compressive and tensile behaviors at an equal strain rate, the effect of different loading modes on the flow stress level, rate-dependence and nonlinearity of the off-axis inelastic deformation is elucidated. The experimental results indicate that the compressive flow stress levels for relatively larger off-axis angles of 30°,45° and 90° are about 50 percent larger than in tension for the same fiber orientations, respectively. The nonlinear deformations under off-axis tensile and compressive loading conditions exhibit significant strain-rate dependence. Similar features are observed in the fiber-orientation dependence of the off-axis flow stress levels under tension and compression and in the off-axis flow stress differential in tension and compression, regardless of the strain rate. A phenomenological theory of viscoplasticity is then developed which can describe the tension–compression asymmetry as well as the rate dependence, nonlinearity and fiber orientation dependence of the off-axis tensile and compressive behaviors of unidirectional composites in a unified manner. It is demonstrated by comparing with experimental results that the proposed viscoplastic constitutive model can be applied with reasonable accuracy to predict the different, nonlinear and rate-dependent behaviors of the unidirectional composite under off-axis tensile and compressive loading conditions.",

On the other hand, the foam core sandwich failed at the 100% failure strain of the face skin in the compression test. In the case of the aluminium core sandwich, nonhomogenous load distributions and fiber contents may affect the lower failure strain. Therefore, the specific compression strength of the foam core was 72% higher than the compression strength of the aluminum core. Failure mode analysis of sandwich panels made of aluminium honeycomb cores shows that shear failure leads to final failure. However, the specific flexural strength of the sandwich panels with aluminum cores had a slightly higher value than that of the sandwich panels with foam cores. Because the sandwich panel with aluminium cores had higher critical stress for the face wrinkling than the sandwich panel with foam cores due to higher compression modulus of aluminium cores than foam cores.Keywords: sandwich panelhoneycombfoamstrengthcompression testflexural test",

Tensile and shear strength increased with increasing molding temperature, whereas they are little affected by molding pressure and time.

The GEP224 glass fabric/epoxy was selected as the structural material of a composite bogie frame to save its weight. In order to obtain the fatigue characteristics of the GEP224 glass/epoxy composite material, the tension–compression fatigue test was done with three different stacking sequences of warp direction, fill direction, and warp/fill direction, respectively. A fatigue test was conducted with a stress ratio, R of 0.1 and −1, and up to endurance limit of 107 with frequency of 5 Hz. The fatigue strength of the GFRP composite bogie frame was evaluated on the basis of the S-N curve and Goodman diagrams obtained from GEP224 glass/epoxy composites according to the JIS E 4207 and UIC 515/615-4. The result shows that fatigue strength of the GFRP composite bogie has satisfied the design requirements. Also, the GFRP composite bogie frame had a good fatigue performance in comparison with conventional metal bogie frame, considering its weight.",

Compatibilization process has been done by melt mixing the PLA/starch and GMA with a twin screw extruder and exposing the PLA/starch/GMA mixture to electron beam at room temperature. The exposure process was carried out to induce definite interfacial adhesion at the interface between PLA and starch through electron beam-initiated graft copolymerization by the medium of the GMA. To testify the effect of this compatibilization strategy, rheological, mechanical, and morphological properties of the composite were analyzed. The scanning electron micrographs of the cryofracture and tensile fracture surfaces of the composites revealed that the interfacial adhesion between PLA and starch was greatly improved by this strategy. Fourier transform infrared study confirmed the grafting reaction between PLA and starch. The reaction schemes were proposed to understand the reaction mechanisms at the interface.",

The load-bearing antenna approach takes advantage of a combination of structural and electrical functions. Their integrated, multi-functional smart skin structure is responsible for simultaneously supporting external loads and communicating data in operational conditions. This study presents a conformal load-bearing structure for array antenna. An array antenna transmits information with appropriate arrangement of radiating elements; positions and gaps are designed for optimal antenna performance. In this paper, the requirements and considerations to design the conformal load-bearing array antenna structure (CLAAS) are introduced and a structural design process for a multi-layered structure is presented. A grid structure is proposed to support multiple array antennas and to maintain solid gaps between them. This structure may also be effective in reducing out-of-plane deformation, which is directly linked to performance. Owing to its high specific strength, along with its light weight, a composite material is used. To verify the structural integrity of the presented CLAAS, static and modal analyses are executed under aircraft load conditions.",

Measurements show that the STL per areal density of flax/polypropylene is two times higher compared to aluminum. A noteworthy result is that upon hybridization with 13% carbon fibers (carbon-flax/polypropylene), the STL per areal density increases by 2.4 times. This study also presents the finite element (FE) simulation of sound transmission through the composites. Good agreement between FE predicted and experimentally measured STL is obtained. Moreover, parametric sensitivity studies are performed using the developed FE model to examine the effect of possible variation in the mechanical properties of the natural fiber composites on the STL performance. It is found that within 15% variation, no significant effect on STL is obtained and that STL is only sensitive to the in-plane elastic moduli.",

The model predictions are based on microstructural characteristics such as the aspect ratio and orientation of the whiskers and the constituent volume fractions. Other material characteristics are assumed, such the cylindrical shape of voids in the matrix and the perfect bonding condition of the whiskers. The experiments indicate (1) that the modulus in the 0-deg. printed direction can be at least twice the modulus in the 90-deg. printed direction and (2) that whisker alignment is improved during printing. Two models accounting for imperfect whisker alignment are used to predict the modulus of the 0-deg. material reasonably well, although the 90-deg. modulus is over-predicted by both models. The 0-deg. direction is roughly two times stronger than the 90-deg. direction in tension.",

    "abstract": "The use of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials in offshore engineering for deep sea riser systems has drawn considerable interest due to the potential weight savings and improvement in durability that can be achieved. The design of FRP composite risers consists of two stages: (1) preliminary local design based on critical local load cases (LCs) and (2) global analysis of the full length composite riser under global loads including platform motion, hydrostatic pressure, gravity, buoyancy, wave and current loads to determine and assess critical locations. The preliminary local design stage is necessary to obtain a first estimate of the laminate configuration – fibre orientations and layer thicknesses of the tube wall, since the deformations and hence the forces and bending moments due to the global loads, depend on the geometric configuration. This paper describes the methodology, LCs, analysis procedure and results of the first stage, the local design of the composite riser. The local design is conducted using five different LCs as prescribed by the standards. In this study, geometric configurations of eight different composite body and liner combinations were optimised to provide minimum structural weight. Previous composite riser designs have mainly focused on axial and hoop reinforcements; in the present study, fibre reinforcements at other orientations are included. The highlight of the current study is that it shows that the use of off angle fibre orientations in addition to axial and hoop reinforcements offer substantial weight savings.",

Stress–strain curves including the compressive modulus obtained using the NAL-II method showed good agreement with those obtained using the ASTM D6641. The NAL-II method gave slightly higher (approximately 10%) compressive strengths than the ASTM D6641 method, probably because of suppression of bending (buckling) before failure.

    "abstract": "L-shaped composites are fundamental parts of complex-shaped structures, and it is well-known that shape distortion (i.e., spring-in deformation) arises after curing due to the orthotropic nature of composites. This residual deformation increases the manufacturing costs, attracting significant attention to the mechanisms of spring-in deformation. Meanwhile recent aerospace-grade composites include inter-laminar toughened layers composed of thermosetting resin and thermoplastic particles to enhance the inter-laminar fracture toughness and to improve the impact resistance. Even though the inter-laminar resin layers can affect the process-induced strain and deformation, their effects have not yet been studied in detail. Therefore, this current study performed fiber-optic-based internal strain measurement and evaluated the residual deformation of L-shaped parts with inter-laminar resin layers. Through-thickness cure shrinkage strain at the corner part was relaxed and the spring-in angle decreased by holding the parts at the cure temperature, indicating that viscoelasticity of the thermoplastic particles is important. Viscoelastic finite element analysis supported this finding and indicated that the effect of inter-laminar toughened layers on the residual deformation should be considered to optimize curing processes.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to use microwave sintering technique to fabricate Al-Graphene oxide (Al-GO) composites with different concentration of GO (i.e. 0.5 wt %, 1 wt%, and 2 wt%) at 600°C for 15 min. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were utilized to investigate the microstructural development. Uniform dispersion of GO was obtained in Al-0.5GO composite whereas other concentration of Al-GO composites suffered from agglomeration of GO particles. In addition to microstructure, the hardness, compressive strength, and corrosion resistance of the Al-GO composites were also examined. A remarkable improvement in compressive strength (up to 200%) was attained in Al-0.5GO composite while further addition of GO deteriorated the mechanical strength and hardness due to agglomeration and increase of the microporosities. In spite of significant enhancement in compressive strength with optimum amount of GO nanoplatelets (i.e. 0.5%), the corrosion resistance of the Al-GO composites was degraded by the addition of GO nanoplatelets mainly due to the increased amount of microporosities and surface roughness originating from agglomeration of GO nanoplatelets.",

Based on mechanical theories of composite laminates and an elastic plate with a circular hole, the relationship between the relaxed strains on the surface of laminates and the residual stresses in laminates was established. This newly deduced theoretical formula was adapted into the incremental hole-drilling method and allowed us to further study the residual stresses in the through-thickness direction for various composite laminates. Related numerical modeling of composite laminate with a hole was built to calibrate the coefficients within the formula. Experiments were conducted and the residual stresses in composite laminates [02/θ2]s are presented.

    "abstract": "Solid particle erosion in industrial applications has been a serious problem in many engineering fields. Earlier studies on fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composites were mainly focusing on the erosive wear behavior at several different impact angles. However, the effect of fiber orientation on FRP composites has not been thoroughly investigated. Since fiber orientation is one of the important factors in which causing erosive wear damages to FRP composites, in order to understand the virtue of this problem, it is important to investigate the effect of fiber orientation at different impact angles. In this research, the effect of fiber orientation of unidirectional fiber-reinforced plastic composites on erosive wear behavior was studied. Sandblasting-type erosion tests were conducted on the FRP composites with fiber orientation ranging at three impact angles to clarify the relation between fiber orientation and erosive wear behavior. The Dyneema fiber (ductile material) and the carbon fiber (brittle material) were used for the reinforcement fiber in FRP. From the result, it is confirmed that CFRP composites with higher fiber orientation angle erode faster than the composites with lower fiber orientation angle. But the erosion characteristic of DFRP was almost the same regardless of the fiber orientation angle. The damaged surfaces of the FRP composites were then analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and the possible erosion wear mechanisms were investigated.",

Two semi-empirical fitting equations were formulated to calculate the mean and variance of the elastic modulus, thus reducing the need for onerous experiments. The effects of strand morphology on the stochasticity of the elastic properties are discussed in detail for the first time. The results of the analytical model showed significant applicability and good agreement with the experimental data under various conditions, and the formulated equations were able to provide satisfactory values for the mean and variance of the elastic modulus with different strand properties and strand/specimen morphologies. The role of the strand morphology (thickness, width, and length) was analyzed from a statistical perspective and the thickness ratio of the strand to the specimen was found to be the most effective factor for reducing the stochasticity of ROS.",

Distribution of the space magnetic field and induced current density was numerically investigated. The simulation results showed that deformation of the magnetic field distribution occurs in the case of inserting an anisotropic plate. Meanwhile, it makes the magnetic field distribution directional and its direction will be changeable and controllable by rotating angle θ of the anisotropic plate. Furthermore, redistribution of the induced current density can be observed in the test piece, which results in two identical peak areas, and they are symmetric with respect to an axis perpendicular to the rotation angle. Subsequently, output voltage of the EC probe was calculated to quantitatively analyze the sensitivity for identifying crack orientation. Findings show that the output voltage from the probe was affected by the angle between the conductivity angle θ of the anisotropic plate and the crack orientation.",

In this article, we explore three main concepts to solve this problem: improving the dispersion uniformity of CNTs in Al powder without damaging its structure by solution coating technique, fabricating a hybrid composite by reinforcing Al with nano-TiC-CNT, comparing the properties of nano-TiC-CNT and micron-TiC-CNT hybrid composites. Microstructure observation by SEM, TEM, and XRD revealed well-dispersed and preserved CNTs without the formation of a second phase. The Al-0.5CNT composite showed good tensile strength and elongation at break of 278 MPa and 14%, respectively. Further improvements in tensile strength and ductility of 285 MPa and 23%, respectively, were measured after the addition of 2.5 wt%; (1.4 vol%) TiC nanoparticles to Al-0.5CNT composite. However, the introduction of 2.5 wt-% TiC macroparticles only improved the tensile strength by 48% but elongation at break was up to 32%. The improved strength and ductility are attributed to the introduction of geometrical necessary dislocation and Orowan looping of dislocations leading to back stress strengthening. The new Al composite is expected to find application in automotive and aerospace component manufacture and thermal management.Keywords: Aluminium matrix compositestitanium carbide nanoparticlescarbon nanotubes (CNT)strength-ductilitysolution coating process Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

The sandwich honeycomb composite, which combines two composite skins with a metal honeycomb, is the preferred structure in aerospace and railway applications due to its rigidity at minimal weight. As a functional composite material that provides heat flux to passengers, a multilayer sandwich Nomex honeycomb core composite with heating elements has been developed. In this design, the heating element is inserted into the inner composite material as a heat generation component, producing heat transferred to the other side of the panel. The thermal and structural behaviors of the sandwich composite with heating elements are orthotropic and require careful assessment to understand the material characteristics of the developed composite parts. In this study, conduction heat transfer in the functional honeycomb composite is simulated using the Finite Element Method (FEM) and validated with experimental results. The study proposes three steps to solve the problem: determining the heat-transfer parameters, simplifying the Nomex honeycomb core, and conducting a full-scale heat-transfer simulation. This research aids operating systems in controlling the heat generator input to prevent dangerous conditions.

The dynamic and static characteristics of the proposed STFFC were evaluated through a series of experimental tests including tensile, modal, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), low-velocity impact (LVI), and compression after impact (CAI) tests. The shear thickening fluid (STF), which was prepared by dispersing nano-silica particles in a solvent of polyethylene glycol (PEG), exhibited an abrupt increase in storage and loss modulus upon exceeding a critical shear strain. The result of the modal test revealed that the addition of STF-impregnated fabric into the CFRP composite led to greater damping ratios of 17.71–417.86%, despite the degradation of tensile strength by 10.81% and Young's modulus by 12.49%. DMA results show that the STFFC has a larger tan δ except for between intersections of 118 °C, and 161 °C. For impact responses, the STFFC resulted in a lower contact force, with a reduction of 2.41–3.30%, and an increase in absorbed energy of 2.87–5.00%. Meanwhile, the CAI strength of the STFFC was degraded by 3.62 to 6.20%. Despite the reduction of tensile, impact, and CAI characteristics of the STFFC, it is noteworthy that the CFRP composites exhibited relatively minor degradation even with the application of STF. The results of the study suggest that embedding STF-impregnated woven carbon fabric can enhance the potential of CFRP composites, making them even more promising solutions for various applications.",

    "abstract": "When concretes reinforced by CFGFRP (carbon fiber-glass fiber reinforced plastics) composites containing three types of carbon fiber bundles with different ultimate elongation values are subject to two-point loading tests, the electrical resistance increases linearly with the increase of load, strain and deflection of CFGFRP-reinforced concretes during loading and unloading but when the maximum value of the previous load is exceeded, the increase of electrical resistance becomes non-linear. This behavior is an effective way of knowing the magnitude of the maximum load during loading and unloading. The change in electrical resistance of CFGFRP reinforced concretes during loading increases largely when the carbon fiber bundle is fractured and is maintained thereafter against the increase of external load due to the presence of glass fibers. This behavior can also be used to prevent fatal fracture. Change in electrical resistance can supply better information for damage in concrete structures than strain or deflection. Information on the location of damage can be obtained by comparing the change in electrical resistance of the reinforcing composite at different locations. Concretes using CFGFRP composites as reinforcements are a promising material possessing diagnostic abilities to detect potential damage and to prevent fatal failure.",

In the FCP response, a fatigue crack deceleration stage (range I) and an acceleration stage (range II) could be distinguished. The former was explained by the development and 'stabilization' of the damage zone. The latter range could be adequately described by the Paris-Erdogan power law. Increasing fiber loading resulted in improved resistance against FCP. Incorporation of longer fibers yielded an even higher FCP resistance. The use of LGF reinforcement also resulted in a quasi-isotropic FCP behavior, whereas a clear dependance of the propagation rate on crack direction could be observed for SGF-filled composites. All these differences could be interpreted by differences in microstructural parameters of the LGF in comparison to the SGF systems. Failure processes were studied by light and and scanning electron microscopy, and are discussed. Increased matrix ductility at higher FCP rates and corresponding changes in the fiber-related events, especially in fiber pull-out length, were attributed to crack tip heating effects.",

By applying this test method, the effects of quenching and annealing on the pull-out of carbon fiber (CF) from polycarbonate (PC), poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS), poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) and polypropylene (PP) matrices were investigated. Studies of pull-out specimens before and after the pull-out test were also performed using an optical microscope with crossed polaroids. With the CF-PC system, rapid quenching developed a localized birefringent region spreading to a wider area in the polymeric material of the fiber exit points of the matrix, and decreased the fiber pull-out resistance. With the CF-PPS and CF-PEEK systems, annealing developed the transcrystal of polymer matrix along the fiber surface, and significantly increased the fiber pull-out resistance. The fiber pull-out from the annealed PPS and PEEK matrices occurred as the result of adhesive failure in the matrix. With the CF-PP system, the fiber pull-out resistance decreased with increasing crystallinity of matrix. This extraordinary behavior is discussed in relation to the fast crystallization of PP and the specific configuration of the pull-out specimen.",

    "abstract": "Abstract When ceramic matrix composites are subjected to fatigue loading levels sufficient to initiate microstructural damage to the constituents, the mechanical response of the laminate, e.g. the residual strength, stiffness and life of the composite, is governed by the physical state of the fiber/matrix interface. During loading, the chemical bonds, which develop between fiber and matrix during processing, are broken. This 'debonding' results in a significant decline in load transfer between the two constituents and leads to a measurable increase in laminate compliance. With continued cyclic loading, the interface debonds grow in length which further degenerates the composite strength. Moreover, within the debonded regions, frictional sliding between the fiber and matrix is permitted and leads to surface wear of the constituents [1]. Ultimately, the progression of this damage mode leads to a further decline in the interfacial shear stress and load transfer between the constituents. Knowledge of the progression of both damage mechanisms, debonding and the reduction in interfacial shear strength, is critical to characterize ceramic composites since these mechanisms govern, in large part, the degradation in laminate properties. Unfortunately, experimental observation of these kinds of damage is not an easy task. However, attempts to measure these properties experimentally using single fiber and microcomposite tests have been conducted [2, 3]. Moreover, several techniques for estimating interfacial properties computationally using various models have been presented in the literature [4-8]. As in this study, several micromechanics models use hysteresis measurements to gain insight into the state of the fiber/matrix interface [4-6, 8]. The authors use the hysteresis data for a myriad of purposes ranging from the derivation of empirical constants to validation of simplified failure criterion. The current study is unique in that assumptions are not made regarding either the failure of the interface (debonding), nor the associated degradation in shear resistance during fatigue. The present study attempts to infer a logical progression of both mechanisms without specific failure criteria. Rather, the analysis is a 'what must they be' comparison between the experimental measurements of hysteretic energy loss within a given fatigue cycle and the numerical predictions from the one-dimensional shear-lag analysis. The strength of the model and its application as presented herein resides in its simplicity allowing the validated approach to be incorporated into more rigorous micromechanics models which more accurately model the instantaneous state of stress within the laminate as has been the evolution of the early shear-lag models.

In order to withstand this high temperature, attempts were made to utilize threedimensionally reinforced C/C composites. The most serious problem encountered in the application of C/Cs to the turbine disk was the loss of fragments of the composite located near the outer periphery due to strong centrifugal force, which resulted in severe vibration due to rotational imbalance. The heat exchangers and plug nozzle have complex shapes in order to realize a large heat exchanging area. Joined structures were explored for these components. The principal effort in these applications has been placed on finding structures requiring low joining strength and developing materials with low gas leakage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, fiber optic strain sensors have been applied to internal strain and damage monitoring of composites because of their small size, light weight and flexibility. Braided fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) are compatible with fiber optic sensors because optical fibers can be integrated directly and easily into fabrics. In the present paper, the strain monitoring of braided glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) was conducted by using embedded fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and extrinsic Fabry–Perot interferometric (EFPI) sensors during the cure process, tensile tests and fatigue tests. From the experimental results of cure monitoring, it was found that both sensors can be used only for monitoring of thermal residual strain during cooling process. From the results of tensile tests, it was found that both sensors could measure strain correctly until damage initiation of braided GFRP. It also appeared that FBG sensors could monitor damage to FRP by observing the reflected spectral shape. From the fatigue tests, it appeared that the strain measured by embedded FBG sensors was affected by fatigue damage. Therefore, it is concluded that internal strain monitoring of braided FRP using fiber optic strain sensors is very useful for cure and health monitoring.

Three forms of corrosion were found, namely surface reaction type, corrosion layer forming type and penetration type. In surface reaction type corrosion, which was recognized in the corrosion of epoxy resin cured with phthalic anhydride in alkaline solution, the ester bonds in the resin were attacked by hydrolytic reaction with liquid and then dissolved from its surface uniformly. In the corrosion layer forming type corrosion, observed in the corrosion of unsaturated polyester in alkaline solution, the ester bonds in the main polymer chain were corroded by the same mechanism, but crosslinked polymer chain remained. Then the corrosion residual layer was formed. In penetration type corrosion, a large quantity of environmental liquid was absorbed until an equilibrium state was reached, and then the strength of the specimen decreased quite remarkably. This type of corrosion was observed in the corrosion of orthophthalic type polyester in boiling water and epoxy resin cured with amine in sulfuric acid. As a result of measurements of corrosion depth (which is different from the swelling depth or penetration depth of liquid) with immersion time, it was found that the concept of corrosion rate could be applied even in polymeric material. The corrosion rates were dependent on the chemical structure of resin, the reactivity between resin and environments, and the penetration ability of environments into the resin etc.",

The method demands an approximation of a design space with a response surface comprising quadratic polynomials for pruning fractal branches of stacking sequences. Approximation of the objective function with quadratic polynomials was confirmed for buckling load maximizations and flutter speed limit maximizations using lamination parameters as predictors. In the present study, flutter speed maximization with a constraint of buckling load is employed as an example of stacking sequence optimization by means of the fractal branch and bound method with a strength constraint. The present paper describes the theoretical background of the fractal branch and bound method. Then approximations are performed using quadratic polynomials with lamination parameters as predictors. After that, effectiveness of this method for supersonic panel flutter of composite laminates was investigated using two cases. Results indicate that the method was applied successfully; a practical optimal stacking sequence was obtained using modified response surfaces.

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper describes a creep rupture model that takes into account the interfacial debonding and its propagation around broken fibers in unidirectional fiber-reinforced polymers. The interfacial debonding is accompanied by fiber breaks under a longitudinal tensile load, and the interfacial debonding length depends on both the fiber stress at the moment of the fiber breaks and the properties of the interfacial adhesion. In this paper, the interfacial debonding length, its propagation as a function of time, the probability of fiber breaks and an interfacial shear stress are investigated by fragmentation tests with a single glass fiber embedded in each vinylester resin specimen. Subsequently, it was found that a relationship between the fiber strength and the fiber effective length, the length of the debonding length and stress recovery length subtracted from one fiber length, was log linear, and that the larger the fiber stress, the longer was the interfacial debonding length. Next, creep tests were performed to investigate the creep constants of the vinylester resin, and interfacial debonding propagation tests were also performed to identify the interfacial debonding-propagation behavior as a function of time using single fiber composites subjected to constant strains. We modified the creep rupture model by taking into account the interfacial debonding length, which has a time-dependent characteristic, into a conventional Curtin–McLean creep rupture model. It was found that the predicted creep rupture time of the modified model was shorter than that of the conventional model and that there was no threshold creep stress in the modified model unlike in the conventional model because the interfacial debonding propagation makes the prediction creep rupture time lower as time progresses.

Specimens failed initially due to matrix cracking at the fillet region of the web-to-flange interface. Onset of ultimate failure was attributed to fiber insertion bridging leading to insertion breakage and pullout. The mechanical behavior under an applied shear load was marked by nearly linear behavior up to ultimate failure.

A partial debonding between a skin panel and a flange and multiple delaminations in the skin panel were chosen as the localized damage. The three-dimensional composite elements used to analyze the compressive behavior of the stiffened panel with multiple delaminations was found to be suitable for this kind of complex composite structure. The contact problem between the skin and flange panels was approximated by a spring element with no restraint of the positive relative displacement and a strong restraint of the negative displacement. At the delaminations in the skin panel, which tended to close during compression, the normal relative displacement was constrained to prevent the delaminated portions from overlapping; this constraint made the convergence of the solution quite smooth compared to the case where the contact problem was exactly considered. When a debonded area only was located at the edge of the flange, no notable reduction of compressive buckling load was found until the size of the debonding reached a half wavelength of the buckling mode. The compressive buckling load dropped significantly when multiple delaminations, which were small in comparison to the half wavelength of the buckling mode, accompanied the skin-flange debonding. The energy release rate distributions at the damage edges, calculated using the virtual crack closure technique, increased quite rapidly, particularly in the transverse direction after buckling became sufficient to increase the delamination.",

If the arrested crack can be instantaneously detected, the damage tolerance of foam-core sandwich structures can be dramatically improved. This study establishes an innovative crack detection technique using two fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors embedded at both edges of the arrester. The change in strain distribution in the crack arrester induced by arresting the crack is evaluated using reflection spectra from the FBG sensors. The proposed technique enables an effective application of the crack arrester and significantly improves the reliability of foam-core sandwich structures.

This work is to propose a structural design and analysis procedure for development of a 500 W class small wind turbine system which will be applicable to domestic use at a relatively low speed region like Korea. Structural analysis including load case study and stress, deformation, buckling, vibration and fatigue estimation was performed. In addition, the blade should be safe from the impact damage due to FOD (foreign object damage) including bird strikes. MSC Dytran was used to analyze the bird strike phenomenon on the blade, and the applied method, Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian, was evaluated by comparison with the previous study results. Finally, the structural test was carried out and its test results were compared with the estimated results for evaluation of the designed structure.",

    "abstract": "Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) has electrical conductivity in both the parallel and transverse directions of the fiber. Because an electrical network may be changed with the applied strain, the electrical conductivity of the CFRP will also be changed for the piezoresistivity. Strain monitoring of CFRP can therefore be conducted, not by using an additional sensor, but by measuring the change in electrical resistance. There have been many studies on the gauge factors of unidirectional CFRPs, although significant mutual differences have been determined in the results reported. It is thought that the differences may be caused by the strong electrical anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the unidirectional CFRP. In this study, a new concept was introduced to precisely measure the gauge factors of a unidirectional CFRP. A finite element analysis was utilized to take into consideration a non-uniform electrical potential field in a unidirectional CFRP. The gauge factors were obtained as a result of minimizing the error sum of the squares of the electrical potentials between the experimental and analytical results. The gauge factor in the fiber direction was affected by this factor in the thickness direction depending on the specimen configuration. The results of the finite element analysis showed the possibility of a unidirectional CFRP showing both positive and negative gauge factors in the fiber direction.",

The piezoelectric paint is composed of the Pb(Nb,Ni)O3-Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PNN–PZT) powder and epoxy resin. The PNN–PZT is a kind of soft piezoelectric material that offers many advantages such as high piezoelectric properties, easy poling, and so on. The PNN–PZT/epoxy paint sensor can be easily applied to various engineering structures, even to those having a complex geometry or curved shapes because of its flexibility. In this study, the PNN–PZT/epoxy paint was coated on a composite-wing model. One electrode was made on the upper surface of the piezoelectric paint, while the graphite/epoxy composite structure itself was used as the other electrode. Then poling was conducted at room temperature (20 °C) under a 4 kV/mm electric field for 10 min. When the composite-wing model was subjected to free-vibration, its vibration response was monitored by measuring the output voltage of the piezoelectric paint sensor; when the composite-wing model was impacted by an impact hammer, its impact signal was also measured by the piezoelectric paint sensor. The vibration and impact test results showed that the PNN–PZT/epoxy paint sensor captured the dynamic responses of the composite-wing structure very well. We believe that the piezoelectric paint sensor can be useful in many engineering applications such as real-time vibration and impact monitoring, damage detection, nondestructive structural health monitoring, and so on.",

Therefore, we proposed a new method to calculate the natural fiber cross-sectional area by measuring their projection widths to estimate the proper tensile properties. This method was used to investigate the effects of cross-sectional area variation on tensile properties. Additionally, to estimate the proper Weibull parameters of natural fibers apart from the cross-sectional area variation, we proposed a strength distribution function that incorporates cross-sectional area variation, based on a Weibull distribution.

The model uses a test-based critical damage zone and stress-based failure criteria. A total of 45 carbon-epoxy composite (USN) laminate scarf-repaired specimens were first tested with two different defect sizes, four scarf angles, and three overlap layer sizes. The Tsai-Wu and Tsai-Hill criteria were used for the laminate, and the maximum shear stress criterion for the adhesive was adopted to predict failure onset. The predicted failure loads were compared to test results and a good agreement was obtained with a 9.2% maximum deviation for almost all parameters with the exception of a case with an unrealistically large scarf angle.

In this study, we developed eddy current techniques that enable non-contact visualization of waviness distribution.

Finite element analyses show that the shape of the in-plane waviness can be visualized in the distribution of the magnetic field from the eddy current. However, with increasing distance between the surface of the tested material and measurement plane, the visualization increasingly underestimates the in-plane waviness angle. To avoid this underestimation, we propose a magnetic imaging method that can reconstruct the magnetic field at the surface. The surface magnetic field was reconstructed by using the magnetic field data measured away from the surface. Experiments were performed on a cross-ply laminate with artificially induced in-plane waviness. The distribution of in-plane waviness can be successfully visualized from the measured magnetic field. Using this magnetic field imaging method to enable non-contact measurements, the angle of waviness can be measured with an error of only 1°.",

    "abstract": "Carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminate structures manufactured using prepregs usually contain fiber discontinuities that result from the prepreg cutting for design and cost-efficiency. In this study, the sampling moiré method was used to measure the microscopic strain of unidirectional CFRP laminates with fiber discontinuities to investigate the deformation behavior that causes damage. In addition to the strain distributions of the laminate before and after cracking, the strain results due to thermal residual stress relaxation and residual plastic deformation during cracking were also obtained. The experimental results of this study were in good agreement with the finite element method results. Our results revealed that the sampling moiré method is an accurate method of measuring microscopic strain that can be used to evaluate the mechanical properties, damage behavior, residual strains in laminates with fiber discontinuities, and other different materials and structures.",

Compared to the RTD condition, the shear strength of the joint under the CTD and TS conditions shows increases of approximately 50.0% and 9.09%, respectively, but lower values are obtained under ETD (18.18%), ETW (72.73%), and SS (27.27%) conditions. Failure modes of lap-joint are analyzed on fractured surfaces and confirmed by finite element simulation in which the cohesive failure mode mainly occurs with the highest distributed stresses. However, an experimental adhesive failure mode partially appears under the ETD, ETW, and SS conditions. Furthermore, as the less prevalent conditions, the dependencies of the shear strength and failure mode on the exposure time under SS and TS conditions are more thoroughly evaluated based on the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to show microstructures and chemical compositions of the fracture surface, respectively. The effects of environmental conditions, particularly under SS and TS conditions, could provide new insight into designing specific bonded joints.",

    "abstract": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is a composite material whose base material is plastic and reinforcement material is carbon fibers. CFRP is widely used in various fields for laminating prepregs. The laminated plate tends to sustain damage, such as delamination, fiber breakage, and base material breakage; hence, we must conduct high-precision and efficient nondestructive testing (NDT). Examples of NDT are ultrasonic examination, X-ray tomography, and infrared stress analysis. With most NDT methods, it is difficult to easily obtain detailed correct information of defects, such as their depth, position, and size. To solve this problem, we develop a machine-learning-aided inverse analysis model that predicts the spatial information of defects from the sum of the principal stresses on the surface calculated from the temperature change measured by infrared analysis, and we propose it as an alternative method to the existing damage analysis. Applying the proposed method to the simulated stress distributions of quasi-isotropic CFRP laminates with defects, the results showed over 99% success to recognize the detail information of defects. Additionally, we examine the properties of the dataset using a forward analysis model and a variational autoencoder. Our method with a convolutional neural network enables us to successfully estimate the information of defects at high speed. Experimental data can be applicable as well as the simulation results to our proposed method, and we believe our method will be a powerful supporting tool for the current NDT for CFRPs.",

The main advantage of nanofillers reinforcement in the polymer matrix for underwater application has been highlighted in terms of lower water intake as well as less debonding in ionic medium. The different types of fibre-reinforced polymer nanocomposites have been fabricated in order to understand the role of nanofillers at polymer matrix inside the saline water. The bonding of protective coating with the resin surface was found to be affected in salt water whereas the nanofillers were found to diffuse into the empty space of polymer matrix and provide comprehensive chemical resistance in ionic environment. It has been established that the gel coating of the composite was not stable under the dynamic water flow and pressure. On the other hand, nanofillers has been found to comprehensively plugged the voids in polymer and fibers interfaces which showed much higher stability in marine environment by delaying the ageing of structures for offshore applications.",

Based on the melt-curing characteristics of thermoplastic composites, combining the full-thickness reinforced joining technology with induction welding can provide an effective way for high-strength joining. In this paper, the full factorial experimental design method is used to deeply explore the influence law of welding time, consolidation force and heating current on the tensile properties of welded joints. Combined with Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and BP neural network, a welding joint tensile strength prediction model was constructed. In addition, a multi-objective model based on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was developed. The multi-objective optimization method of TOPSIS was used to select the optimal parameter combinations with ultimate tensile strength and first debonding strength as the optimization objectives: welding time of 29.995 min, consolidation force of 638.669 N, and heating current of 443.351 A. Experimental studies have shown that the optimized welding joints have an increase in ultimate tensile strength of up to 32.4 % and an increase in first time debonding strength of up to 47.0 % with respect to the non-optimized welding joints.",

These composites have been characterized for mechanical, thermal and flame retardancy properties. The modulus values improved while tensile strength and elongation reduced as the content of fillers increased. The composites loaded with functionalized MWCNT exhibited better performance than the Silane Treated Nanoclay loaded counterparts. With addition of 20% EFR content, reduction in tensile strength of about 66% was observed when the composites were loaded with either of the nano fillers. The tensile fractured morphology was studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy. The dispersion of nanoparticles in the composites was observed through Transmission Electron Microscopy. The optimal flame retardancy via. Cone Calorimetry was observed when 1:1 ratio of nano fillers were used, indicating synergism.

However, conventional IPMC fabricated from commercial Nafion membranes are typically limited to a minimum thickness of 50 μm, which significantly restricts their compatibility with human skin. In this study, we developed a novel fabrication process for thin IPMC with thickness of less than 50 μm. We successfully cast Nafion films with thicknesses of 30 μm, 40 μm, 50 μm, and 60 μm by using the glass-slide drip-casting technique. Then Pd-Au composite electrodes were deposited on their surfaces by electroless plating (immersion reduction, IR) and electroplating. We analyzed and evaluated the electrochemical performance and bending sensing performance of IPMC with different thicknesses. The specific capacitance of the IPMC with a thickness of 60 μm was 3 times higher than that of the sample with a thickness of 30 μm, and the sensing performance was 4.25 times higher. Compared with the IPMC prepared from a commercial Nafion film (50 μm) of the same thickness (bending output voltage of 0.4 mV), the IPMC prepared by this process showed superior sensing performance (bending output voltage of 0.8 mV). After 1000 bending cycles, the signal attenuation rate remained below 5%. This work provides important technical support for the research and development of ultra-thin flexible sensors.",

Two 6.8-liter Type 4 cylinders with identical geometry and fiber stacking sequence were analyzed using pulse-echo ultrasonic propagation imaging. One cylinder was wound under constant internal pressure, while the other used increasing pressure to influence residual stress and influence imperfections. This difference led to distinct failure mechanisms in burst tests. The study focused on identifying porosity and resin-rich areas, visualized through ultrasonic wave propagation imaging and variable time-window amplitude mapping. Results revealed that the cylinder wound with increasing pressure had better composite consolidation but more resin-rich areas in the hoop windings. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of pulse-echo ultrasonic imaging as a non-destructive method for detecting manufacturing-induced imperfections and highlight the importance of optimizing filament winding parameters to enhance composite quality.",

Recently developed toughened CFRP materials, which are expected to show good cryogenic properties, are considered promising candidates for these kinds of applications. The present study investigates cryogenic properties of candidate materials and structural elements, including Y-joint structural models. 300 mm diameter filament wound tank and 600 mm diameter lay up tanks were fabricated and tested. Based on these experimental data, the feasibility of a CFRP cryogenic tank is discussed and future research tasks are proposed.

Experimental results show no obvious delamination opening or growth until the failure of the plate. The existence of the delamination, however, results significant influences on the compressive properties of the plate due to the decrease of the bending stiffness at the delaminated area, that is, considerable loss of the buckling load, failure strength and even the mechanisms of compressive behaviors. Antisymmetric deformation is observed not only in the postbuckling stage but also at the buckling, which can be neglected in the case of highly orthotropic square plate. The analysis based on the simplified assumption of closed delamination explains qualitatively well the experimental results, including secondary buckling.",

Secondly, shrinkage strain and transverse strength are measured for carbon/epoxy unidirectional laminates. Thirdly, the effect of temperature and duration of thermal history on transverse cracking in cross-ply laminates is experimentally investigated. The change in the residual stress due to post-cure is also estimated for the cross-ply laminates. Transverse cracking in the cross-ply specimens after thermal history initiates at lower stresses than the critical stresses in virgin specimens. It is found that thermal history increases the hardness of resin; however, it does not change the chemical structures in resin. The decrease in the strength is mainly caused by degradation of the fiber/matrix interface.",

Using helium gas and a helium leak detector, through-the-thickness gas permeability in CFRP laminated tubes with or without matrix cracks was measured at room temperature. The effect of loadings on the in situ gas permeability was also clarified. It is shown that, although gas permeability through CFRP laminates increases on account of the existence of matrix cracks and tensile loadings, these effects turned out not to be crucial in comparison to the leakage through multi laminar matrix cracks, which is three or four orders higher than the diffusion-controlled permeation. These results suggest that the existence of no less than one intact layer is important for the feasibility of composite propellant tanks. Finally, a diffusion model including the combined effects of damages and loads is applied to the experimental results and a successful characterization of gas permeability is presented.

The shell geometry used in the present formulation is derived using an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system. Based on the principle of virtual work the non-linear finite element equations are derived. Arc-length method is implemented to capture the load–displacement equilibrium curve. The vibration characteristics of post-buckled shell are performed using tangent stiffness obtained from the converged deflection.

Structures with varying clay contents (1–3 wt%) were manufactured. Both pristine and SGRP nanocomposites were then subjected to mechanical testing. For the specimens manufactured by DMT, the tensile, flexural, and compressive modulus increased with increasing the clay content. Similarly, the tensile, flexural, compressive, interlaminate shear and impact strength increased with the addition of 1 wt% clay; however the trend reversed with further increase in the clay content. Specimens manufactured by HSMT showed superior properties compared to those of nanocomposites containing 1 wt% clay produced by DMT. In order to understand these phenomena a morphological study was conducted. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs revealed that HSMT led to better dispersion and changed the nanoclay structure from orderly intercalation to disorderly intercalation giving multi-directional strength.",

From the change in the reflection spectrum of the FBG sensors, the debonding between the face-sheet and the core and the deformation of the face-sheet due to impact loading could be well detected. Then, the authors developed the SMA honeycomb core and bonded CFRP face-sheets to the core. When an impact load was applied to the panel, the cell walls of the core were buckled and the face-sheet was bent. However, after the panel was heated over the reverse transformation finish temperature of the SMA, the core buckling disappeared and the deflection of the face-sheet was relieved.

The biodegradability was evaluated with a buffer solution containing esterase. The addition of PBT into a PLA polymer matrix induced the cold crystallization of the PLA phase. The crystallization rate of the PLA phase was accelerated significantly when both PBT and PPDI reacted with PLA simultaneously. But the chain extension caused by PPDI decreased the crystallinity of PLA and PBT phases. The phase separation between PLA and PBT in PLA/PBT blends increased the interfacial area exposed to hydrolysis, resulting in the improved degradability of the PLA phase. In contrast, the improved interfacial adhesion between PLA and PBT caused by the reaction with PPDI reduced the area that was exposed to enzyme and the degradation rate of the PLA phase.

    "abstract": "Abstract A thin circular rotating disk having a concentric hole and a functionally graded material (FGM) coating at the outer surface is considered with a view to analyzing the thermoelastic characteristics due to a thermal load and rotation of the disk. The FGM coating is assumed to have exponentially varying Young's modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and density in the radial direction of the disk. The Poisson's ratio is assumed to be constant throughout the disk. The incompatible eigenstrain developed in the disk owing to the nonuniform CTE and variation of temperature is taken into consideration. Using the two-dimensional thermoelastic theories, the two-dimensional plane stress axisymmetric problem is formulated as a second order differential equation. A finite element model is developed using the variational approach and Ritz method to obtain the numerical solution of the differential equation. The validity of the finite element model is justified for a rotating circular disk of homogeneous material by comparing the finite element results with analytical solution obtained by Timoshenko. Then the finite element model is applied to the problem of an Al disk with an Al2O3/Al FGM coating at its outer surface. The numerical results of the thermoelastic field demonstrate that the temperature distribution profile, angular speed of the disk, and FGM coating thickness are the crucial factors to be considered in controlling the thermoelastic characteristics of a rotating disk with an FGM coating.

    "abstract": "Fatigue strength of a short carbon fiber reinforced polyamide (SCF/PA) composite fabricated using a press forming technique is examined. Unlike an injection-molded SCF/PA composite, this one exhibits in-plane isotropy as well as through-thickness uniformity. Fatigue tests on the SCF/PA composite are carried out at different stress ratios and temperatures, respectively. The fatigue test results show that the S–N relationship for the SCF/PA composite significantly depends on stress ratio, and fatigue degradation occurs most rapidly at the critical stress ratio, regardless of test temperature. The fatigue stress for a given life decreases with temperature. The reduction in fatigue strength with temperature correlates well with the reduction in static strength with temperature. Accordingly, the effect of temperature on fatigue life for each of different constant values of stress ratio can approximately be removed by normalizing fatigue stress with respect to static strength. The full shape of constant fatigue life diagram for the press-formed SCF/PA composite is identified for each of different test temperatures. It is shown to incline toward the direction of positive mean stress, regardless of test temperature. A difference in shape of CFL diagram between the press-formed and injection-molded composites is addressed. This study demonstrates that the anisomorphic constant life diagram approach with temperature as the parameter allows adequately predicting the constant fatigue life diagram and thus the S–N curve for the SCF/PA composite over the whole range of mean stress at any temperature in the tested range.",

In this study, we developed a fiber-optic-based life-cycle monitoring system to measure through-thickness strain development. First, we addressed the mechanism of strain development using a theoretical approach and finite element analysis (FEA). We confirmed that geometrical constraint arising from the cylindrical shapes causes significant out-of-plane stress in the through-thickness center, and the stress increases with increased thickness and stiffness. A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor was then embedded at the through-thickness center of a pipe during lay-up. Non-axisymmetric strain change in the FBG sensor was continuously measured using the birefringence effect throughout the life cycle, including curing and simulated operation in a low-temperature environment. Through comparison between pipe and plate specimens, it was clearly demonstrated that the system could sensitively capture through-thickness strain development and detect delamination failure in the pipe. In addition, FEA was conducted and the result agreed well with the experiment data, confirming the validity of the experiment results.",

    "abstract": "Composite aircraft structures such as fuselage and wings are subject to impact from many sources. Of particular interest are impacts which can impart severe damage that is difficult to visually detect, or is even not visually detectable. Such damage modes include delamination, separation/delamination of stringers and stiffeners from skin, and fracture of internal stiffening components such as stringers and frames. Extensive damage can be produced by blunt impact sources involving wide-area contact, which reduces the propensity to leave visible signs that damage has formed, especially with high-strength composite outer skin. Ground service equipment (GSE) is a realistic and oft-occurring source of blunt impact damage due to: (i) the interactions between GSE and aircraft typically involving a soft rubber bumper material, (ii) the close proximity with which GSE operate around aircraft, and (iii) the high mass of GSE involves very large impacting energies despite their slow speeds. Blunt impact damage can produce both local and non-local damage since, as the contact area increases, higher energy levels are involved for blunt impact damage to occur. Therefore, inspections to find damage from GSE impact events require that locations relatively far away from the impact sites must also be inspected.",

As the CNF concentration increased, the maximum stress increased, whereas the change in resistance Δρ decreased gradually and the contact resistivity sensitivity increased as well. Micro-damage sensing of micro-carbon fiber/CNF–cement composites was also investigated by electrical resistivity and AE. When the first fracture of micro-carbon fiber occurred, the electrical resistivity increased 'infinitely' with increasing lower CNF concentrations. For high 5 wt% CNF, however, the fracture of micro-carbon fiber could be detected just in one large step increment change in the electrical resistivity as well as consistent AE events. The percolation structure of CNF is not well formed in the cement matrix due to relatively-low electrical conductivity. The chosen CNF–cement composites are not suitable for conductive and sensing applications because of their many vertical microcracks.",

Their combustion disposal discharges the carbon dioxide in the air because resins of FRPs are made of fossil fuel. In the case of disposal into the ground, these FRPs remain semi-permanently without decomposing. Therefore, green composites are now developed and are studied as one of less the environmental burden materials. In this study, two kinds of continuous green composite sheets, which were composed of Kenaf fibers or Linen fibers as reinforcement and biodegradable poly butylene succinate (PBS) resin as a matrix, were fabricated with a pultrusion molding. Since the PBS resin is a thermoplastic resin, the PBS/KENAF or PBS/LINEN composite sheets can be treated as intermediate materials such as Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic prepregs. In order to apply the PBS/KENAF or PBS/LINEN composite sheets to structural components, quasi-isotropic plates and cylindrical shells were fabricated and evaluated.",

The characteristics of high performance fibers, such as high strength, exceptional thermal conductivity and electrical insulation may also include negative thermal expansivity. Therefore, it should be possible to develop fiber reinforced composites with negative thermal expansivity by using an optimum combination of particular fiber reinforcements and a polymer matrix. This paper describes the development of such high performance fiber reinforced composites with negative or low thermal expansivity using four high strength fibers — polyethylene fiber (Dyneema), poly-p-phenylenebenzobisoxazole fiber (Zylon), aramid fiber (Technora) and carbon fiber (Torayca). The results showed that the newly developed Dyneema fiber and Zylon fiber composites exhibited significant negative thermal expansivity. Structural products of a stable size over a wide temperature range can be obtained by this method of controlling the coefficient of thermal expansion.",

Next, we investigated why the tensile capacity (strength) of each component is not fully realized for seemingly simple structures consisting of two steel layers and a core polymer layer when assuming relatively weak adhesion. The resulting interfacial properties of the sandwich composites were characterized and incorporated into a cohesive zone model for finite element simulation. The simulation results revealed that, in contrast to the strong adhesion case, weak adhesion leads to stress concentration around failed cohesive elements, resulting in earlier failure of constituent layers and thus a lowering of the overall tensile strength of the composite.",

In the cure-shrinkage strain part, the strain distribution caused by different temperature histories was observed. We confirmed that the lower viscosity part was influenced by the cure shrinkage of the other part and that these phenomena can be analyzed by the visco-elastic cure model. In the thermal-strain part, the amount of total shrinkage strain and the apparent coefficient of temperature expansion distribution were observed in the thickness direction. Warpage of the specimen was also observed. These results were confirmed to be caused by the distribution of temperature and of the fiber volume fraction, Vf.",

The location and force history of the impact are identified using an identification method based on experimental transfer matrices which relate the impact force to the corresponding strain responses. Here, experimental transfer matrices are determined from the measured data acquired by impact tests that do not wreak impact damages. The location of the impact damage is predicted from the identified impact location.

Fibers fractured periodically in the pillar. In contrast, fronds were delaminated without fiber fracture. The pillar carried almost all the applied load; however, the progressive crushing stress was much lower than the static compressive strength. The intervals of the periodic fiber fracture in the pillar were 50–100 μm which coincided with kink-band width of the compressive failure. Since the interval of the periodic fiber fracture varied along the pillar thickness because of the bending deformation, compressive stress also varied along the pillar thickness. The crushing stress was, therefore, much lower than the static compressive strength.Keywords: CFRPprogressive crushingcrash energy absorptionkink-band",

To design the BRASC, the objective function for broadband absorption performance is coupled with transmission line theory. The absorption bandwidth of the designed BRASC with a − 10 dB criterion is 8.2 GHz. The absorption performance of the oblique incidence in both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations is excellent in maintaining the −10 dB up to 60°. The measurement results of the fabricated specimens confirm that the overall tendency of the measurement results matches well with the analysis results. The engine duct replaced with the BRASC is analyzed to confirm the effect of RCS reduction on the engine inlet. RCS simulation shows that the proposed BRASC effectively reduces the RCS over a wide frequency range. Because the S-shaped duct, which is used in low observable aircraft for RCS reduction, causes multiple scattering at oblique incidence, the absorbers applied to the engine duct should maintain a stable oblique incidence performance. Hence, the proposed BRASC may be a promising candidate for engine inlets with small RCS.",

This study evaluates the effect of the moisture content of prepreg sheets on the life-cycle behavior of the prepreg-based CFRP. After evaluating the moisture absorption and desorption characteristics of the prepreg sheets, the cure-induced strain and moisture absorption and desorption deformations were measured, employing embedded optical fiber sensors. Furthermore, to investigate the relationship between the moisture absorption and desorption behaviors and the chemical structure of the matrix resin, its structure was analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Since absorption and desorption are dependent on the matrix resin, two types of resins were evaluated: epoxy resin and a low moisture absorption cyanate resin. Finally, recommendations for the manufacture and operation of CFRP space structures are offered, with respect to maintaining their long-term shape stability.",

Further, three-point bending tests using the acoustic emission technique were performed. Results indicated that a short period of heat treatment increased the CFRTP bending strength; however, for an excessively long heat treatment (30 h), the CFRTP bending strength decreased. To understand cause for the increase and decrement in the bending strength via heat treatment, surface observations using a laser microscope and thermal property measurement using differential scanning calorimetry were performed. Results showed that the 30-h heat-treated specimens exhibited fiber-matrix debonding before bending tests because of matrix shrinkage caused by crystallization and thermal degradation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed that the cause of deterioration was oxidation, and oxidation cleaved the molecular chains and embrittled the matrix. Consequently, we could control the bending properties by crystallization, and the relationship between crystallization and strength agreed with the formulated constitutive equation. However, we must address the thermal degradation when the materials are subjected to heat treatment.",

The PLA specimens irradiated with UV-C for 0–15 days were not only oxidized on the surface, but also showed a decrease in the thermal and mechanical properties as the number of days of UV-C exposure increased, due to the cleavage of PLA chains. On the other hand, for the PLA/CF specimens, although surface oxidation was induced by UV-C irradiation, they did not undergo chain breakage, and their thermal and mechanical properties were retained. Therefore, carbon fibers play an important role not only as a reinforcement for PLA but also as a barrier to UV degradation. Furthermore, our results suggest that 3D fluorescence spectroscopy can be useful for the evaluation of accelerated degradation of polymer samples.",

The energy release rates at the interface between the inner adherend and the adhesive layer were used to determine the contributions of the stiffness change, thermal contractions, and elastoplastic properties of the materials to the strength reduction at cryogenic temperature. The numerical results with decreasing plastic behavior owing to the low-temperature environment revealed that the mode I energy release rate at the interface increased by about 250%, even though the mode II energy release rate decreased by about 50%. By contrast, the change in energy release rate with elastic stiffening and adhesive shrinkage with decreasing temperature waslimited to about 20%. A reduction in the plastic characteristics of adhesive materials is thus a dominant factor in the strength reduction of double-lap composite bonded joints in a low-temperature environment.",

However, it is still difficult to control the porous microstructure to absorb a specific frequency range, although mechanical rigidity and improved sound absorption performance were achieved by manufacturing polyurethane foam for auxetics. Hence, we report, for a first time, a multi-auxetic porous microstructure fabricated via a triaxial thermal compression method applied simultaneously with two or more different compression ratios. The upper and lower parts of the multi-auxetic foam have two or more different positive or negative Poisson's ratio, respectively. Consequently, the manufactured multi-auxetic foam has a single negative Poisson's ratio property with enhanced sound absorption performance in the low-frequency range by twisting and forming a long sound wave path. Moreover, it was confirmed that the multi-auxetic sound absorber has an adjustable sound absorbing performance in a specific frequency range according to the difference in variety of pore sizes for each upper or lower part as well as the direction of incidence of the sound waves. This work suggests that the multi-auxetic porous microstructure can be mass-produced by a simple and fast manufacturing method, and it can be provided at a low price by manipulating the cellular structure of the conventional material.",

However, ply discontinuities can introduce stress concentrations, potentially damaging the material and adversely affecting its mechanical properties. Evaluating the impact of ply discontinuities on the mechanical properties of CFRP laminate is, therefore, crucial. Extending the applicability of a variational stress analysis based on Hashin's original approach, this study presents a method to predict local Young's moduli in unidirectional CFRP laminate with ply discontinuity. The complementary energy for the specific length of the laminate in the longitudinal direction was used to derive the local Young's moduli. An experimental study and a finite element analysis (FEA) were conducted to validate the results. In the experimental study, strain gauges of various lengths were placed on the ply discontinuity area; the measured Young's moduli varied with the gauge length. The numerically derived local effective Young's moduli showed a relatively positive agreement with the experimental and FEA results, especially for lower values of applied stress. For more accurate predictions, future analyses should consider the impact of delamination on the Young's moduli.",

The long-term viscoelastic properties were storage modulus, creep compliance, and relaxation modulus. Three test modes were performed in DMA to obtain each result. Smoothly overlapped master curves were obtained in all results. From the master curves, the viscoelastic properties of the material were predicted for 1 year, 10 years, and more extended periods. For 10 years, it was estimated that the storage modulus, creep compliance, and relaxation modulus changed by 7%, 132%, and 48%, respectively. When tests are conducted, considering future design variables, such as temperature, humidity, and out time, the results can be utilized to predict the long-term performance of tow prepreg and optimize composite manufacturing processes.",

In this study, the multilayer radar absorbing structure (RAS) was designed and fabricated using a continuous fiber 3D printing process based on material extrusion (ME). However, a large thickness error occurred during the 3D printing process. The thickness error in the multilayer RAS, which is a resonant electromagnetic wave absorber, causes a large error in the electromagnetic wave absorption performance. To address this issue, the thickness correction method based on unit thickness was proposed. The unit thickness, which is the basic thickness of the multilayer RAS, was calculated to account for the thickness increase during printing. The redesigned RAS based on the calculated unit thickness effectively corrected the thickness error. The total thickness and thickness of each layer of the corrected RAS were measured and found to be similar to the design value. The measured electromagnetic wave absorption performance closely matched the analyzed value, confirming the effectiveness of the unit thickness-based correction method in improving the ME-based 3D printing process for fabricating RAS.",

The results showed that the WXC/Co transition layer could be tightly bonded with the diamond and matrix, reduce defects, and inhibit the thermal damage of diamond to a certain extent. Meanwhile, compared with the composites with uncoated diamond (>0.3), the friction coefficient of the composites reinforced by WXC/Co coated diamond was reduced to approximately 0.25, the plane area of the abrasion contour was reduced by 83.9%, the wear mechanism was changed from three-body + adhesive wear to abrasive + adhesive wear, and the grinding precision and grinding efficiency were effectively improved.

The composites were fabricated through pyrolytic carbonization followed by controlled silica integration at various weight ratios. Structural analyses using XRD, FTIR, SEM – EDS, and BET confirmed the formation of porous frameworks and homogeneous silica distribution, particularly in low-silica samples. Electrochemical studies were carried out through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Among all formulations, the carbon – silica composite with a 95:5 ratio demonstrated optimal performance, delivering a specific capacitance of 87.61 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and retaining 94.1% capacity after 1,000 cycles. CV profiles revealed quasi-rectangular shapes indicative of ideal capacitive behavior, while GCD curves showed nearly symmetrical triangular profiles, reflecting high charge – discharge efficiency. EIS measurements indicated minimal internal resistance and enhanced ion diffusion across the electrode – electrolyte interface. The synergy between well-dispersed silica dispersion and pore architecture contributed significantly to electrochemical stability and charge transport. These findings demonstrate a scalable and sustainable approach for valorizing agricultural and mineral waste into efficient energy storage materials, offering a cost-effective and eco-conscious solution for next-generation supercapacitor applications.",

A previous study by the authors presented a new wireless strain monitoring method that adopts the tire itself as a sensor with an oscillator circuit. This method is simple and useful, but it requires a battery to activate the oscillator circuit. The present study proposes and investigates a new passive wireless strain measurement system using capacitance change of tires. The system consists of external antennas and strain sensor with an inductance capacitance (LC) resonant circuit. This wireless system uses electromagnetic coupling between two inductors of the antenna and the sensor. This method allows use of a part of an actual tire as a capacitor of the LC circuit. Tire deformation changes the sensor's resonant frequency. This resonant frequency change is measured as a change in the phase angle of the antenna using electromagnetic induction. Tensile tests are performed and the antenna phase angles are measured during the tests. Consequently, experiments show that this method is effective for passive wireless strain monitoring of tires.

The technique, Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM), newly introduced to civil infrastructure was implemented in the field within two days without any traffic interruption. As an alternative to traditional hand lay up, VARTM has several processing advantages, like saving the processing time, uniform resin application, intimate contact between each layer of CFRP and concrete substrate ensuring good consolidation to remove void or dry spot, higher fiber volume fraction (about 70%) and greater wettability of the fiber, etc. The performance of the strengthened structures depends on the above potential factors to obtain high structural performance. VARTM uses single-sided molding technology to infuse resin over fabrics wrapping large structures such as bridge girders and saving tooling and processing time. Recently, the VARTM technique has been implemented in strengthening of an I-565 highway bridge girder in Huntsville, Alabama. Laboratory investigation included the construction of small concrete prisms to study the bonding behavior of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) and strengthened concrete beams using VARTM to simulate the performance with and without strengthening. To the end, the process of field demonstration of this newly introduced technique to civil infrastructure has been presented. Keywords: VARTMBRIDGE STRENGTHENINGCFRPGIRDER",

An oblique coordinate system along the matrix cracks is introduced in conjunction with the derivation of oblique coordinate tensor components. Using displacement/strain covariant components and force/stress contravariant components, it is shown that the obliquely crossed crack problem with any oblique angle can be treated as the orthogonally-crossed crack problem, which ensures that obliquely-crossed cracked laminates can be regarded as orthogonally-crossed cracked laminates with appropriate transformation of properties. This approach is combined with twodimensional shear-lag analysis and analytical solutions of [ m/90n]s and [S/ m/90n]s laminates with matrix cracks in both- and 90-plies under general in-plane loadings are obtained in terms of oblique coordinate components. Calculated stress distributions are compared with 3D FEM results and the effectiveness of the present analysis is verified.

The authors previously reported delamination monitoring using the electric resistance change method; which provides excellent estimations.

To overcome these problems, the present study adopted an electric potential change method. Since this method had poor estimation performance in our previous study, here we employed a normalization method that showed significant improvements in the estimations using the electric resistance change method. Moreover, the effect on the estimation performance of delamination with a zigzag shape caused by matrix cracking is investigated using FEM analyses. In the results, the electric potential change method shows good performance of estimations for delaminations located near the edges of the specimen but poor performance near the middle of the specimen. The zigzag shape has a large effect on the performance of the estimations when the delamination crack locates near the middle of the specimen. FEM analysis shows that a small electric current through the thickness direction near the middle of the specimen causes large effects on estimation performance.",

The goal of this research is to improve the present safety level of aircrafts by ensuring structural integrity and reducing maintenance/operation costs of advanced composite materials that will be employed for the primary structures of the new generation aircraft. Our novel sensor system employing a PZT actuator and an FBG optical fiber sensor can detect several types of damage, such as delamination and debonding, which are expected to occur in the highly efficient bonding structures of an aircraft wing box when the main/tail wing section is designed using composite materials. In this system, elastic waves will be transmitted into the structure by PZT actuators and received by small-diameter FBG optical fiber sensors that are embedded in the critical section of the primary structure of an aircraft. The onset and growth of damage can be detected with a very high accuracy through the change in the received elastic waves. In this study, a conceptual design was implemented in order to employ the novel system. We also selected the optimum application candidate area in order to verify the effects of the system. Further, the investigation and experiment on the novel sensor system that uses a bonded PZT actuator and an FBG sensor was carried out, and the basic damage detection technique was established based on the experimental results of the received elastic wave. Furthermore, compressive tests were carried out using the coupon specimen with an embedded small-diameter or standard-diameter optical fiber sensor. It was verified that the coupon specimen with an embedded small-diameter optical fiber suffered no degradation of its material properties.

    "abstract": "Detecting delaminations of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates is a difficult task for visual inspection. Delaminations cause large reductions in strength and stiffness of CFRP laminates, bringing deterioration of the structural reliability of a CFRP. Monitoring for delamination is, therefore, indispensable to maintain the reliability of a CFRP structure. In a previous study, we adopted the electric potential change method to detect delamination. This method shows good estimation performance for delamination cracks located near the edges of a specimen, but poor performance near the center where large errors that depend on the delamination shapes are created. A zigzag delamination caused by matrix cracking has a large effect on estimation performance; so the electric potential change method was not applicable to monitoring for delamination. In this paper, a mechanism that brings large errors of estimation due to the shape of the delamination is detailed. FEM analyses show a small electric current in the thickness direction in the center segment of a specimen causes large effects on the estimation performance. The problem is overcome by means of a newly proposed concept, a two-stage method. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using FEM analyses.",

It is well known that stacking sequence optimizations are indispensable for laminated composite structures. Stiffened composite panels usually have more than two stacking sequences because they consist of a panel skin laminate and stiffener laminates. This means that the stacking sequences need to be jointly optimized to achieve structural optimization of the stiffened composite panel. The authors have proposed a new stacking sequence optimization method, called the fractal branch and bound method, for optimizing a single laminate. In the present study, the fractal branch and bound method is extended to optimizing multiple stacking sequences. The extended method is applied for obtaining two optimal stacking sequences for the maximization of the buckling load of a hat-stiffened composite panel.

The mechanical properties of the PCL/MWCNTs composites were effectively increased due to the incorporation of MWCNTs. The composites were characterized using scanning electron microscopy in order to obtain information on the dispersion of MWCNT in the polymeric matrix. In case of 1.2 wt% of MWCNTs in the matrix, strength and modulus of the composite increased by 12.1% and 164.3%, respectively. In addition, the dispersion of MWCNTs in the PCL matrix resulted in substantial decrease of the electrical resistivity of the composites as the MWCNTs loading was increased from 0 to 2.0 wt%. Furthermore, thermal stability of the PCL and PCL/MWCNTs-COOH composites were investigated using the data acquired from the thermogravimetric analysis. The detailed kinetics of the thermal degradation of the composites was investigated by analyzing their thermal behavior at different heating rates in a nitrogen atmosphere.

The electrical properties, such as electrical resistivity, alternating current impedance and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effect, were measured for the composites. The electrical resistivity of the composites showed a percolation type of conduction behavior and no difference between parallel and perpendicular to the injection direction was observed for CFRP content higher than the critical value. Measurement of alternating current impedance revealed that the conduction mechanism is attributed to the direct conductive paths generated by distributed carbon fibers; however, strong frequency dependence of the impedance was observed for the CFRP content near the critical one. The frequency dependence of the impedance is caused by the inter-fiber connection and can be expressed as a simple equivalent circuit. The absorption component of shielding effect (SE) was smaller than the expected value estimated from its resistivity. The decline of SE is thought to be caused by the decrease in effective thickness due to fiber orientation.",

Results of differential scanning calorimetry indicated that the PLLA crystallinity increased with increasing heat treatment temperature. Bending and compressive tests were conducted on the specimen with different β-TCP contents and crystallinities. The results show that the bending and compressive moduli increased with increasing β-TCP contents and crystallinity. On the other hand, bending strength decreased with increasing β-TCP contents. Maximum bending strength was obtained at the heat treatment of 70°C for 24 h, whereas compressive 0.2% proof strength increased with increasing heat treatment temperature. This difference is attributed to the difference in the microscopic damages.",

The porous matrix yields open air passages through its thickness which can be utilized for transpiration cooling. On the other hand, the latter matrix is so dense that the air passages are sealed. A quantity of the matrix was varied by changing the number of repetition cycles of the polymer impregnation pyrolysis (PIP). Strength degradation of composites under thermal cycling conditions was evaluated by the 1200°C/RT thermal cycles with a combination of burner heating and air cooling for 200 cycles. It was found that the SiC/SiC composite with the porous matrix revealed little degradation in strength during the thermal cycles, while the other sample showed a 25% decrease in strength.

The tests were performed by using two types of experimental methods. One is the tension-type split Hopkinson bar system and the other is the universal high-speed tensile-testing machine. In the results, it was demonstrated that the tensile strength and fracture strain of E-glass fiber increased with the strain rate. The absorbed strain energy, therefore, significantly increased. It was also shown that the strain rate dependency of E-glass fiber tensile strength was strongly affected by fiber diameter. The smaller diameter of E-glass fiber has the stronger strain rate dependency. Finally, the impact tensile strengths of high-strength glass and carbon fibers were investigated. It was confirmed that the tensile strength of the high-strength glass fiber also increased with the strain rate, but the tensile properties of carbon fiber were almost independent of the strain rate.",

Direct current is applied and electric voltage changes are measured at each electrode. Comparing measured results with analytical results obtained from the anisotropic electric potential function, the electric conductance ratio can be obtained. Using this electric conductance ratio, the differences between the electric voltages on the surface are small and hence scaled to observe these variations. These differences in the electric potential enable the delamination location and delamination size to be determined. Uniform doublet analysis enables a relationship between the measured results and actual delamination location and delamination size to be established. The method is applied to some numerical analyses. A unidirectional carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer beam with a delamination crack is selected as a typical example encountered in analysis. The results show that the new method is quite effective for simple delamination crack monitoring.",

However, the overall mechanical performance of SMA composites depends immensely on the quality of the interaction between SMA and polymer matrix. Therefore, it is necessary to find out an approach to enhance the interfacial property of this composite. In this paper, we modified nickel–titanium SMA wire with nano-silica particles before and after acid treatment. The modification effect on the interfacial strength between SMA and epoxy resin was evaluated. Contact angle analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation, and single fiber pull-out test were carried out. The bonding characteristics between modified wire and liquid/cured resin were investigated. We then embedded SMA wire into woven glass fabric/epoxy composite laminates, and manufactured this hybrid composites via vacuum assisted resin transfer molding processing. Three-point-bending test of the hybrid composites was performed to validate the modification effect. Fiber pull-out experiment demonstrates that the interfacial shear strength increases by 6.48% by nano-silica particles coating, while it increases by 52.21% after 8 h acid treatment and nano-silica particles coating simultaneously. For hybrid composites, flexural strength of the two specimens increases by 19.8 and 48.2%, respectively. In SEM observation, we observed large debonding region in unmodified composites, while interfacial adhesion between modified wire and epoxy keeps strong after flexural damage.",

Crushing failure mode had been observed in comparing those braid parametric effects. Moreover, the analysis of variance was used to analyse the main and interaction effects subjected to specific energy absorption (SEA) response for the test. Three crushing modes had been observed. The splayed and diamond shape of progressive folding were reported for the braid angles of ±30° and ±45°, respectively, and fibre micro-cracking mode effects for the ±60° braid angle. Furthermore, SEA increased with the decrease of braid angle and increase of diameter-to-thickness ratio. On the other hand, the highest braid angle demonstrated the lowest crush efficiency and poor triggering crushing progression.",

But the optimization of such complex EM structures and validation of the adopted optimization strategy is still a very challenging task for the researchers. Therefore, in this study, an effective effort has been made for the optimization and the corresponding validation for Single Square FSS (SS-FSS) impinged and cascaded radar wave absorbers using advanced computational EM software's like FEldberechnung fur Korper mit beliebiger Oberflache – a German acronym (FEKO) and high frequency structure simulator (HFSS). In addition, a critical analysis of dielectric constant (ε′) has been carried out to select the best combination of composites for the development of efficient radar wave absorbers. A comparison between optimized and simulated results have been carried out to examine the effect of advanced EM approaches over reflection loss (RL) characteristics of composite radar absorbing materials (CRAMs). A rapid change in radar absorption properties of composites has been observed after the application of SSFSS and cascading. A SS-FSS impinged composite has been found to provide a wide absorption bandwidth of 3.6 GHz at X-band. A cascaded absorber having layer thickness 1.8 mm provides a peak RL of −42.6 dB at 10.6 GHz with an absorption bandwidth of 2.5 GHz. The strong agreement between mathematical model, HFSS and FEKO results clearly reflects the efficiency of adopted approach for distinct practical EM applications.",

When the material has small pores (Material 1), large expansion in the thickness at temperatures higher than 500 °C occurred by buckling of fiber bundles caused by mismatch strain between the fiber and matrix when the matrix shrunk. In contrast, when large pores are included in the matrix (Material 2), the cracking in the matrix relaxed the mismatch strain and suppressed the buckling. Next, the deformation of Material 1 after arc-plasma wind tunnel heating (AP) tests was examined to identify the causes of thermal deformation. In this environment, expansion also occurred. However, in addition to the fiber bundle buckling, delamination leads to larger expansion than that in QS. The temperature generating expansion in AP tests was higher than that in QS tests. This behavior is caused by reaction rate slower than rapid heating rate.",

After tensile tests, the fracture surface observation with a scanning electron microscopic (SEM) apparatus was also carried out to characterize damage extension due to thermo-oxidative degradation. The results show that thermo-oxidation induced matrix cracks preferentially in perpendicular area along the fiber direction and the matrix crack propagated along the fiber direction. Due to the crack onset, tensile strength was sharply dropped, even though compression strength was slightly changed. From the AE measurement result, the failure mode change was detected for the tension test.

In this study, monolithic PLLA and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP)/PLLA composites containing three different β-TCP contents (5, 10, 15 wt%) were prepared by injection molding and hydrolysis behavior in simulated body environment was characterized. The specimens were immersed in phosphate buffered solution to measure water absorption and molecular weight of the specimen. Water absorption in monolithic PLLA increased with increasing immersion time up to 14 days, and then saturated, whereas water absorption in composites increased with increasing immersion time up to 168 days. The composites with higher β-TCP content showed larger water absorption. Degradation of number averaged molecular weight for the composites became faster with β-TCP content at the same immersion time. Number averaged molecular weight of 15 wt% composites decreased from 60,000 to 39,000 after 24 weeks immersion. Two layers and three layers models were proposed to predict water absorption and number average molecular weight variation, respectively. To predict hydrolysis behavior of bioactive ceramics/PLLA composites more precisely, effect of water diffusion was considered in the proposed models. Predictions based on the present models were in good agreement with experimental results and the effectiveness of the models was confirmed.",

Because PBS has much higher ductility than that of PLA, it can be expected to have higher fatigue strength when subjected to the same strain amplitude as PLA. Fatigue tests were conducted with maximum stress set to 40–90% of the tensile strength. The stress ratio was set as 0.1.

Friction stir processing (FSP) was applied to the preparation of the Cu/SiCNPs, Cu/Gr and Cu/SiCNPs+Gr CMMCs. Then the microstructures, hardness and wear properties of the prepared surface composites were investigated and compared with samples in the absence of reinforcement particles. Evaluation of the microstructure of composites showed an extensive reduction in grain size compared to FSPed metal (e.g., 70 µm in FSPed copper to an average of 300 nm in the Cu/SiCNPs). The results also showed that the hardness of Cu/SiCNPs composites is 100 HV, which is much higher than that of FSPed copper (with the hardness of about 60 HV). The wear test results showed that the presence of SiCNPs alone and with SiCNPs+Gr particles increase the coefficient of friction, relative to FSPed copper, while the presence of Gr particles alone results in a significant reduction of this parameter.",

A composite with a staggered structure of fiber bundles were prepared by stacking prepreg sheets with unidirectionally arrayed chopped strands with a predetermined fiber length. The sheets were prepared by introducing fine slits at regular intervals along the fiber direction. The final failure is caused by an unstable growth of delamination from the tip of the bundles. The conventional linear fracture mechanics model cannot explain the reduction in the tensile strength as the fiber length shortens. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel fracture mechanics model that considers a non-linear stress–strain relation for the composite, which incorporates varying fiber length. The results confirm that this model can explain the relation between the tensile strength and fiber length very well, without any fitting parameters.",

Six different environmental temperatures ranged from 25°C to 150°C were chosen and tested. A pure laminate having the same stacking sequence as the parent laminate was prepared and tested at the six temperatures for references. Experimental results revealed that tensile strengths of the secondary bonded (SB) and co-bonded (CB) joints at 75°C reduced by 9.3% and 10.5% in comparison with strengths of the corresponding joints at 25°C, respectively. Particularly, at 125°C, which is higher than the resin glass transition temperature, significant reductions of 57.1% and 53.6% in strength were found for SB and CB joints, respectively. In terms of the manufacturing methods, the strengths of the SB joints were higher than those of the CB at 25°C, 50°C, and 75°C by 6.5%, 7.6%, and 8.0%, respectively.

This work discusses the methodology to control CNT alignment around the cut-out with the objective of enhancing the stiffness locally. The effectiveness of CNT alignment was assessed indirectly through the mapping of electrical resistance and polarized Raman spectroscopy. A strong correlation was found between the targeted CNT alignment state and the measured resistance values around the cut-out. As a precursor to developing glass/CNT-epoxy hierarchical composites, the response of MW-CNTs in the epoxy resin system was assessed at various input voltage levels in correlation with the weight fraction (wt.%) of CNTs. While a change in electrical resistance by ~3 orders of magnitude was found along the direction of CNT alignment in the hierarchical composites, a change in electrical resistance by ~5 orders of magnitude was observed in the CNT-epoxy composites in comparison with that of the respective control samples.",

    "abstract": "In the present work, a novel design is presented for producing auxetic laminated faceplates for structures that contain auxetic cores in order to produce fully auxetic sandwich structures. The design is based on the use of periodic cellular networks that are embedded in a fibre-reinforced polymer matrix. These networks have a high in-plane negative Poisson's ratio and a high in-plane stiffness. Two auxetic networks were chosen for this purpose: a classical re-entrant hexagonal network and an anti-tetra chiral auxetic network. The finite elements method was used to model the auxetic network and the faceplate. For the auxetic network, the relative modulus (Es/Em) was investigated to determine its effect on the behaviour of the faceplate. The auxetic behaviour of the faceplate occurs when the auxetic network has a high relative modulus. For example, for a classical re-entrant hexagonal network faceplate, the auxetic behaviour starts to appear when Es/Em > 33, while for an anti-tetra chiral auxetic network faceplate, the auxetic behaviour starts to appear when Es/Em > 24. Analytical expressions for the elastic constants of the faceplates were developed using the representative volume element model (RVE) and a semi-empirical formula of the rule of mixtures (ROMs). The results of the analytical expressions were compared with the finite elements results for various values of the relative density parameter ρ*. The relative density had a significant effect on the elastic constants of the faceplate. The model produced with the representative volume element method had higher values for the elastic constants than did that created with the finite elements model, but the semi-empirical rule of mixtures gave more accurate results for both types of faceplates. A modified design for the classical re-entrant hexagonal network that increases the in-plane stiffness of the auxetic network is presented since it has been found that it plays a major role in producing a high negative Poisson's ratio. The modified networks are an oval re-entered and a stiffened re-entered network. Experiments were carried out on the oval re-entered faceplates to obtain the in-plane moduli and the Poisson's ratios. The tested faceplate samples clearly showed auxetic behaviour. A good agreement between the finite elements results and the experimental data was obtained.",

Four CLDs are presented and their predictive accuracies are compared with the proposed model on composite materials fatigue data. The accuracy is compared between actual fatigue data and the predicted S–N curve for the arbitrary load condition, for which no experimental data exists.

As resin content in the composites can be easily controlled in VaRTM process combined with PMP, this paper investigates the effect of infused resin content on the final mechanical properties of CFRP. It is demonstrated that volume fraction of carbon fibers and the resultant mechanical properties of CFRP can be controlled by the infusion process control.

The control fin of a small flying object is usually actuated using a servo motor system with an electromagnetic motor. Much research has been conducted to solve the structural complexity of servo actuation systems to convert the rotation of a servo motor to a linear actuation motion. To simplify this structural complexity, several types of smart actuators have been developed, such as bimorph or unimorph actuators with piezoelectric material layers and shape memory alloy actuators. In this study, a camber morphing type control fin and an all-moving type control fin actuated using piezo-composite actuators are designed to evaluate their ability to simplify the structural complexity of the gear transmission and electromagnetic servo motor system or hydraulic actuator system. Within the skin of the control fin, a piezo-composite actuator is mounted and the other end inserted in a slot of the control fin. As the piezo-composite actuator is excited by an electric field, the pitch angle of the control fin is changed. Experimental testing for the pitch rotation angle of a control fin in a 450 V electric field showed the deflection angle of the camber morphing control fin was 1.4° and the rotational angle of the all-moving control fin was 5.4°, which is obtained from the rotation angle magnification linkage structural system.",

This paper explores the effects of temperature with alkaline and alkaline/chloride solutions on material properties over time, in the context of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures for transportation applications. The durability testing yielded several key findings: (1) higher temperatures accelerate degradation, (2) moisture sorption was the primary process responsible for the observed degradation, with plasticization and microcracking as the controlling mechanisms leading to fiber–matrix interfacial debonding, and (3) a relaxation-based analytical model was implemented to predict residual properties after environmental exposure, showing promising agreement with experimental data.",

As it is assumed that birds vary in size, impact experiments using projectiles that take into account the characteristics and shapes of birds are unavoidable for material screening during their development stage. However, such kinds of experiments have not been sufficiently carried out. In this study, to elucidate the effect of the shape and the properties of projectiles on the impact behaviors of CFRPs, a fundamental study was done by three-dimensional measurement using various projectiles including a gelatin cylinder, rubber cylinders and rubber spheres for mainly two types of CFRPs with different laminate configurations (stackings) at the impact velocities below 370 m/s. The difference in the elapsed-time dependence of the largest displacement of deformation (vertex displacement) due to the stackings was slight, but the deformation behavior changed depending on the shape of the projectile, i.e. especially, large deformable or large-diameter projectiles resulted in a wider bottom area. To determine the penetration and delamination, the contacted area, related to the projectile's diameter, should be considered. The deformation of CFRPs by a spherical projectile just after the impact could be described by a quartic/quintic-function and after a certain period of time (30–50 μs) by a quadratic-function. Empirical equations for the kinetic energies of penetration and delamination for aircraft structural grade CFRP were proposed.",

    "abstract": "This work explores sequential surface treatments involving atmospheric-air plasma and (3-glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GLYMO) to enhance the tensile properties of aramid/epoxy composites. To prove the technical advantages of this approach, aramid fibers received individual (atmospheric-air plasma or GLYMO) or sequential (plasma followed by GLYMO, and vice versa) surface treatments. Single fiber tensile tests (SFT) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize changes in aramid fibers upon the surface modifications. SFT revealed that none of the surface treatments compromised their tensile strength (σmax). Applying GLYMO, whether individually or in sequence (GLYMO followed by plasma and plasma followed by GLYMO), led to a significant enhancement in the fibers' elastic modulus (E). Composites with plasma-treated fibers displayed a 5% increase in E and an 8.5% increase in σmax, with no changes in toughness. However, the most notable improvements were achieved through sequential plasma followed by GLYMO treatments, resulting in a ~ 10% increase in σmax and a remarkable ~ 40% improvement in toughness. Plasma introduces oxygen-containing groups to the fiber surface, facilitating GLYMO grafting. Subsequent crosslinking of GLYMO with the epoxy resin strengthens the fiber-matrix interface. This sequential surface modification offers an alternative pathway for fabricating composites with superior toughness and σmax.",

Conventional fatigue testing is not practical for such conditions owing to the excessive time required; ultrasonic fatigue testing, which can be performed at a frequency of 20 kHz, is an effective alternative. Stress distribution in ultrasonic fatigue testing differs from that in conventional fatigue testing because the specimen is resonated. The stress distribution of cross-ply laminates with transverse cracks subjected to resonance was calculated using a variational approach. The energy release rate was calculated based on the results of a previous study on transverse crack initiation. The results of the stress analysis are in good agreement with those of finite-element analysis. Quantitative evaluation of transverse crack initiation was also conducted.",

The immersion corrosion tests were performed under the simulated body fluid (SBF) conditions. The microscopic measurements indicate that the examined alloys/nanocomposites exhibit a significant decrease in grain size when both alloying elements Gadolinium (Gd) and Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles are added. The examination of the phase by XRD indicates the presence of α-Mg and Mg2Zn, Mg7Zn3 secondary phases, which act as barriers against corrosion. The study confirmed that the incorporation of nanoparticles ZnO content ranging from 1 to 2.5 wt. % leads to a notable enhancement in yield strength (140 to 230 MPa). From the immersion corrosion test, the nanocomposites with the inclusion of 2 wt. % ZnO ceramic nanoparticles resulted in the highest level of corrosion resistance with a corrosion rate of 0.049 mm per year. This nanocomposite also shows better wettability with improved hydrophilicity. The developed Mg based advanced nanocomposites have the potential to be used in load bearing implant applications as it exhibited high corrosion resistance characteristics.",

To this end, the buckling behaviors and corresponding mechanism of CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced polymer) tubes are systematically investigated in this work. Furthermore, an advanced bionic method referring to bamboo and human bones is adopted to improve the buckling. To effectively analyze the buckling, drop weight impact experiments and corresponding numerical simulations are carried out. The results show that the specific energy absorption (SEA) of CFRP tubes is significantly affected by the diameter-to-height ratio and fiber ply direction, and the influencing mechanism is excessive buckling caused by the geometric characteristics and brittle failure of CFRP. At last, the SEA of CFRP tubes were improved through bio-inspired multi-layered metal/composite hybrid, where the buckling is suppressed reasonably well. The conclusions drawn would be inspiring or guiding the optimal design of high energy-absorbing composite tubes in engineering application.",

The prepared polymer sorbents showed high adsorption capacity (12.47 g/g), porosity (95.41%) and low density (0.069 g/cm3). The incorporation of carbon nanostructures (nanotubes or graphene oxide) in the sorbent increased the adsorption capacity to 14.85 g/g. The hydrophobic nature of carbon nanotubes significantly increases the contact angle of water with the surface of the nanocomposite absorber and reaches 137.5 degrees. The obtained sorbents showed good reusability in the adsorption process and maintained an adsorption capacity of about 10 g/g after 5 cycles. The optimal temperature range for using nanocomposite sorbents was 25°C to 35°C. The combination of high sorption capacity, low porosity and density in modified polyacrylonitrile, along with its reusability, makes this designed sorbent highly suitable for efficient removal of oil spills.",

The presence of post-impact residual strength in an operating FW cylinder has the potential to accelerate the onset of failure. Ensuring the structural integrity and safety of the equipment requires thorough impact testing, which can be expensive and time-consuming, resulting in limited use. This article presents an innovative and cost-effective approach for conducting low-velocity impact testing on a hybrid Al/CFRP filament-wound cylinder by utilizing a simple hybrid Al/CFRP plate specimen. The main focus is to conduct low-velocity impact testing on both types of specimens, followed by post-damage testing that includes tensile tests on the hybrid plate specimen and burst tests on the FW cylinder. The results of laboratory experiments were compared to explicit and implicit numerical models conducted in a broad spectrum of impact energy range and found to be consistent. Using a parameter known as the post-impact residual strength ratio, it is possible to determine the expected impact loading conditions on the hybrid plate specimen that are equivalent to those experienced by the FW-cylinder. This low-cost impact testing method offers a practical and feasible solution to ensure the dependability and safety of FW cylinders throughout their operational lifespan.",

These models were based on the 10 most significant factors that influence the severity of lightning damage, including three current waveform parameters, four material configurations, and three orthogonal electrical conductivities of each composite. All models demonstrated good performance with coefficient of determination (R2) values between 0.84 ~ 0.96. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) regression model trained with the lightning matrix damage dataset showed the most promising results (R2 > 0.94). Additional hyperparameter optimization was performed to improve the prediction performance of the baseline MLP model. The hyperparameter optimization (Adam optimizer, tanh activation function, and three hidden layers with 234 neurons) slightly improved the performance of the baseline MLP model by ~0.02, but achieved faster convergence. This result suggests that the baseline MLP model trained with the lightning matrix damage dataset is sufficiently accurate and robust. This paper highlights that ML-informed regression models can serve as an efficient first pass-estimator of lightning matrix damage in composite laminates, potentially reducing the amount of extremely time-consuming and expensive laboratory-scale lightning tests or streamlining the development of complex lightning damage models for future design.",

Micromorphology analyses show that the nanosilica has good dispersion and strong interaction with the matrix. Additionally, a finite element model was developed to predict the tensile performance of the nanocomposite under high-strain loads. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated a favorable binding energy between nanosilica and epoxy resin. The effects of nanosilica on the fracture toughness and energy release rate of photosensitive resins were investigated using load-enhanced tensile test method. The results showed that the addition of 1.0 wt.% nanosilica particles increased the toughness of the resin from 0.45 MPa m1/2 to 0.79 MPa m1/2, and the energy release rate from 248.3 J/m2 to 555.7 J/m2; compared with the neat photosensitive resins, the incorporation of nanosilica increased the tensile and impact strengths of the resins by 26.8% and 49.2%, respectively. The nanosilica was used to improve the tensile strength and impact strength of the resin by 26.8% and 49.2% respectively compared with the neat photosensitive resin. Electrochemical corrosion analysis showed that the photosensitive resin/nanosilica composites have excellent corrosion resistance. Under different corrosion environments of acid, alkali, and salt, the addition of 1 wt.% nanosilica in the photosensitive resin composite led to an increase in corrosion voltage by 0.023 V, 0.004 V, and 0.1 V respectively compared to neat photosensitive resin. Additionally, the corrosion current density decreased by 1.39 × 10−6 A/cm2, 0.525 × 10−4 A/cm2, and 2.57 × 10−6 A/cm2, respectively.

Results demonstrated that the algorithm successfully estimated the impact location for each of the 10 impact points at temperatures of −20, 0, 20, and 40 °C.

The flexural static strength of all the CFRP laminates depends remarkably on temperature and deflection rate.

The time-temperature shift factors of the flexural static strength for the CFRP laminates were quantitatively in good agreement with the initial modulus of the respective matrix resins.

    "abstract": "Carbon-carbon composites (CCCs) have extremely high thermal stability and shock resistance and find use in aerospace applications and aircraft disk brakes. The processing of CCCs can be divided into three stages: curing of precursor resin/fiber-reinforced-laminate; carbonization; and densification. During carbonization, the precursor resin (such as phenolic and furfuryl alcohol) develops microcracks and oftentimes delaminations, which reduce the mechanical properties of the material. In this study, we investigated the influence of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) when mixed with phenolic matrix precursor on the microstructure and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the ascured and carbonized composite specimens. CNFs offer low cost benefits, unlike traditional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that tend to be expensive. Different loadings (0%, 2%, and 5% weight/weight of resin) of CNFs, in conjunction with various percentages of surfactant (0%, 12.5%, and 50% by weight of acetone) treated carbon fabric reinforcement were used for the study. The rationale for treating the fabric with surfactant was to vary interfacial conditions of reinforcing fiber-CNF-matrix. This paper outlines the work done in the processing of CCC-CNF composites, and the influence of surfactant and various percentages of CNFs on the resulting microstructure and ILSS properties. The use of CNFs provided a bridging mechanism for matrix microcracking and reducing matrix shrinkage that occurs during first carbonization. Porosity and delaminations were found to increase with increase in surfactant treatment. An inverse relationship was observed between ILSS and porosity. At the as-cured and carbonized stages, an optimal value of 2% CNFs yielded the highest ILSS values of ∼40 MPa and 6 MPa respectively.",

The experimental results showed that an amorphous interface of about 3 nm in thickness formed between SiC particles and the matrix. SiC particles injected silicon into the matrix; thus an elevated silicon concentration was found around α-Al12(Fe, V)3Si dispersoids, which subsequently inhibited the coarsening and decomposition of α-Al12(Fe, V)3Si dispersoids and enhanced the thermostability of the alloy matrix. Moreover, the thermostability of microstructure and mechanical properties of Al–10.0Fe–1.3V–2Si/15 vol% SiCP are of higher quality than those of Al–8.5Fe–1.3V–1.7Si/15 vol% SiCP.",

    "abstract": "A matrix method for evaluating effective electro-magneto-thermo-elastic properties of a generally anisotropic multilayered composite is presented. Physical variables are categorized into two groups: one that satisfies the continuity across the interface between layers and another that satisfies an average interlayer compatibility (which is also exact). The coupled electro-magneto-thermo-elastic constitutive equation is accordingly reassembled into submatrices, which leads to the derivation of concise and exact matrix expressions for effective properties of a multilayered composite having the coupled physical effects. Comparing the results for a purely elastic multiplayer with those from other theoretical approaches validates the developed method. Examples are given for a PZT-graphite/epoxy composite and a BaTiO3–CoFe2O4 multilayer which exhibit piezo-thermoelastic and magnetoelectric properties, respectively. The result shows how a strong magnetoelectric effect can be achieved by combining piezoelectric and piezomagnetic materials in a multilayered structure. The magnetoelectric coefficient of the BaTiO3–CoFe2O4 multilayer is compared with those for fibrous and particulate composites fabricated with the same constituents.",

This study presents a new numerical approach for examining the fatigue damage progress in FMLs. A layer-wise finite element along with a cohesive element are used to predict the fatigue damage progress for splitting, transverse cracking and delamination. Four-node cohesive elements are introduced to express 0° ply splitting and transverse cracking. Eight-node cohesive elements are inserted into the ply interfaces to represent delamination. The most important character of this model is that the proposed simulation introduces a damage-mechanics concept into the degradation process in cohesive elements in order to express the damage progress due to cyclic loading. This enables us to address the complicated fatigue damage process observed in a FML. We applied this model to titanium/glass fiber-reinforced plastic (Ti/GFRP) laminates and compared the simulated results with the experiment data reported in the references. We confirmed that this model can reproduce the fatigue damage process in a FML. The effect of the parameters of the cohesive element on Ti crack growth and the delamination profile were also investigated. The Ti crack-growth rate was found to be strongly associated with the delamination profile near the crack tip.",

It is unavoidable for the cylinders to experience temperature variation and significant thermal input during service. The maximum failure pressure that the cylinder can sustain is affected due to the dependence of composite material properties on temperature and complexity of cylinder design. Most of the analysis reported for high-pressure composite cylinders is based on simplifying assumptions and does not account for complexities like thermo-mechanical behavior and temperature dependent material properties. In the present work, a comprehensive finite element simulation tool for the design of hydrogen storage cylinder system is developed. The structural response of the cylinder is analyzed using laminated shell theory accounting for transverse shear deformation and geometric nonlinearity. A composite failure model is used to evaluate the failure pressure under various thermo-mechanical loadings. A back-propagation neural network (NNk) model is developed to predict the maximum failure pressure using the analysis results. The failure pressures predicted from NNk model are compared with those from test cases. The developed NNk model is capable of predicting the failure pressure for any given loading condition.",

Therefore, in this study static and dynamic fracture toughness of MMCs manufactured by squeeze casting process were investigated. A number of MMCs were tested with various matrix alloy, volume fractions and specifically types of reinforcements. It was found that static and dynamic fracture toughness of MMCs was remarkably decreased by the addition of ceramic reinforcements. Compared with static fracture toughness, the mean cause of the decrease difference of dynamic fracture toughness and notch dynamic fracture toughness is due to the effect of dynamic velocity under impact loading. The toughness of ceramic reinforced MMCs is controlled by a complex interaction between the matrix alloy and reinforcement. Important properties which influence toughness include the type of reinforcement (appearance, size), volume fraction and combination of reinforcement and the matrix alloy. Notch fracture toughness of MMCs for simple evaluation was also discussed. Keywords: FRACTURE TOUGHNESSNOTCH FRACTURE TOUGHNESSMETAL MATRIX COMPOSITESSQUEEZE INFILTRATION METHOD",

The degree of dispersion and its standard deviation were evaluated by turbidity of the dispersing solution, as well as by volumetric electrical resistivity. Acetone was a better dispersing solvent than purified water and various acid treatments of the CNT also enhanced dispersion. Contact resistivity responded differently with dispersion degree. The apparent Young's modulus was higher for composites with acid treated CNT. The interfacial shear strength between a single carbon fiber and CNT/epoxy was lower than that between a single carbon fiber and neat epoxy. This difference is attributed to increased viscosity and decreased bonding availability in the matrix due to the added CNT. The optimum CNT treatment, for maximizing interfacial adhesion while maintaining good electrical conductivity was the sulfuric acid treatment. The CNT composites can also sense micro-damage in terms of the stepwise increments of electrical resistivity combined with acoustic emission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper focuses on using the high strength and low friction coefficient properties of 'super fibers', such as ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, to develop high performance fiber-reinforced composites with low friction coefficient properties. Dyneema SK60 (an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber) and three other representative high performance fibers (super fibers), are optimized in combination with an epoxy resin polymer matrix and compression molding to produce new low friction composites. As a result, for the developed four super fiber-reinforced composites, an obvious difference of friction coefficient properties was observed. The friction coefficients of composites across the fiber lay-up were generally lower than those of specimens cut along the direction of the fiber lay-up with a significant fiber direction dependence. The Dyneema fiber-reinforced composite exhibited the lowest and most stable friction coefficient properties. This low friction coefficient may be attributed to a phenomenon of 'reticular residue effect' as the most likely cause. The fiber mass fraction of the composites contributed a significant amount to the antifriction properties of the materials: samples with a higher fiber mass fraction had a lower friction coefficient. These results indicated that the developed composites described here, with high strength and low friction coefficients, are expected to find wide application in the field of anti-friction parts and energy saving.

    "abstract": "Fiber reinforced composites (FRC) are an interesting alternative for numerous applications due to their lightweight character. However, there are currently several challenges for a serial production. The manufacturing process still requires a high percentage of manual labor which greatly restricts the reproducibility. Additionally, high-quality standards necessary for many applications cannot be met due to the low displacement resistance of the textiles. Structural fixation could greatly improve the displacement resistance and therefore the handling of the material layers. This paper reports on a model used for draping simulations of nonfixed and fixed multilayer knits using the commercial finite element software LS-DYNA®. The aim of this model is to improve the development process of FRCs. With a standardized specification, the basic macromechanical properties can be modeled with finite shell elements. A material model is introduced that accounts to the characteristic mechanisms of the deformation of biaxial fibrous structures. A fixation of the fabrics is achieved by melting the thermoplastic hybrid yarns embedded in the textile structure with infrared radiation. This process improves the handling of the textiles. It is of great benefit when such a structural fixation is applied locally. The process of choosing local fixation zones is described in this paper and the applicability of this process is illustrated.",

Samples for mechanical test were obtained from laminates at different orientations depending on the textile architecture direction at 0°, 45°, and 90° in order to study the relationship between damage initiation and propagation with fabric geometry. Tension mode tests (static and cyclic) were carried out to evaluate the evolution of damage using as a main tool, the acoustic emission technique that allows monitoring the mechanical behavior of the materials during the test in 'real time'. Results show that there is a remarkable mechanical influence of the reinforcement textile in the composite and that damage generation and progression (mechanisms of fracture) is highly dependent of the direction in which the stress is applied in relation with the architecture of the fabric. In static tensile mode, samples at 0° exhibited better mechanical parameters than samples at 90°, while at 45° orientation was lesser. The effect of textile geometry was demonstrated to have an influence in such mechanisms. In cyclic tensile mode, Kaiser effect is observed at low stresses, while the experimental results showed that the Felicity effect became clearer along with the increasing of stress level.

Furthermore, the friction and wear properties of all the submicron SiCp/Cu samples were carefully investigated with lubricant of 20# machinery oil. It was found that 5 vol.% SiCp/Cu samples exhibit excellent wear properties.

The row–column decomposition method is used to perform 2D Fourier transform using two DDR3 SDRAM memories. Additionally, a source removal function is added into the system to highlight the damage when high energy at the source location occurs. The UPI system was applied for inspection of a composite wing box with impact damages.

    "abstract": "In modern mechanical industry, many designs are incorporating lightweight materials. Known as the future’s lightweight material; Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) contains a fiber structure and therefore is vulnerable to cracks and holes that may be generated during machining. However, in a mechanical structure, it requires bonding the multiple parts using bolts, rivets, etc. In other words, it inevitably requires generating holes in the mechanical structure. Because of such problems, CFRP has been attached with a normally used structural steel, to lighten the weight. It is quite difficult to understand the mechanical features of inhomogeneous composites. In order to increase the usage of inhomogeneous composites that contain multiple light weight mechanical parts, there is a necessity of mechanical basic data. This study used CFRP and SM45C that has the stacking angle [0/60/–60/0]. It has a form of a sandwich in which 5 mm thick SM45C acts as the core, with 2 mm thick unidirectional CFRP attached on both sides of it. Using inhomogeneous composites of such sandwich form, Compact Tension (CT) test and analysis took place. In the test, considering the actual material being used in mechanical industry, a hole was made on the edge of the crack and compared the results according to the location of the hole. SIMADZU corporation’s Universal Testing Machine was used in the test. Setting the test as the basis, we constructed a model for the analysis. In the analysis, like we did in the experiment, we kept in mind the fiber structure of unidirectional CFRP and the conditions of the analysis were identical to the test. As the test result, the magnitude was at its optimal when there was no hole. But if a hole had to be made, it is at its best when placed at the spot where the center of the hole is 20 mm from the edge of the crack. A model with no hole had the reaction force of 14 kN and the forced displacement was 4 mm. A model with a hole placed 20 mm from the edge of the crack had the reaction force of 11 kN with the forced displacement of 10 mm. Test results and analysis differ a lot, but the data after the section when the reaction force rapidly arises are reliable. In other words, in the process of destruction due to the crack propagation, the analysis is reliable.",

The failure strength of ZMI fibers was degraded with the increases in heat treatment temperatures and time in the temperature region of 1100°C or higher. As a result of the microstructure observation, it was clarified that the predominant factors contributing to the strength degradation are crystallization and grain growth in the temperature region of 1300°C or higher and the generation of defect and grain growth in the temperature region of less than 1300°C.",

Therefore, four samples have been fabricated and tested with constant jute fibre content and distinct iron contents. The electromagnetic parameters (εr and μr) have been measured using the waveguide-based microwave measurement technique. An optimal sample is found to possess good microwave absorption properties at X-band. Further, the fabricated composite is subjected to the tensile test and it has been found to possess an average Young's modulus value of 9.4 GPa, final failure strain value of 0.08, and an average ultimate tensile strength value of 49 MPa. Scanning electron microscope analysis was used for the tensile tested specimen to predict the internal failure behavior and determine the major modes of failure such as fiber breakage, matrix cracking, and delamination failure.

It was demonstrated that the apparent bending modulus depends on the length of span to thickness ratio (L/t) and the tensile modulus E to shear modulus G ratio (E/G). Sensitivity analyses were performed to select the length of span to thickness ratio in order to evaluate the bending modulus near material modulus. Consequently, it is predicted that the bending modulus performed with the L/t > 25 bending specimen is equivalent to tensile modulus, if the apparent bending modulus were evaluated from 1 to 15 GPa, while modified equations for the out-of-plane modulus of QI-CFRP laminates obtained by three-dimensional laminate theory were also derived. This modification took stress condition in consideration of the small in-plane size like bending specimens into account. Moreover, it is demonstrated that apparent bending moduli were evaluated between upper and lower bound solutions. The upper bound solution is an out-of-plane modulus based on existing three-dimensional laminate theory, and the other is modified out-of-plane modulus.Keywords: wordout of planemechanical propertiestest methodbending test",

The influence of thermal treatment on surface morphology, phase composition, and corrosion resistance of Zn–Ni+Ni coating was investigated. The Zn–Ni+Ni coating was deposited under galvanostatic conditions (j = 40 mA cm−2). Thermal treatment was carried out in argon atmosphere. The surface morphology of Zn–Ni+Ni coatings was carried using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-6480) and the surface chemical composition was determined by the EDS method. Structural investigations were conducted by X-ray diffraction method. The studies of electrochemical corrosion resistance were carried out in a 5% NaCl solution, using potentiodynamic and scanning vibrating electrode (SVET) methods. On the grounds of corrosion investigations, it was stated that thermal treatment improves both total and localized corrosion resistance of Zn–Ni+Ni coating in a 5% NaCl water solution. The higher corrosion resistance of the thermally treated Zn–Ni+Ni coating could be attributed to the increase in the amount of zinc bonded to nickel in the form of Ni2Zn11 and Ni5Zn21 intermetallic phases. The SVET analysis indicated that thermal treatment of Zn–Ni+Ni coating causes a decrease in the number of corrosion centers on their surface area.",

Since the FCVs are expected to increase driving distances of at least over 500 km, which is similar to those of conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles, the storage pressure of hydrogen must be raised from 35 to 70 MPa. It is important to decrease the amount of carbon fibers in order to reduce the cost and weight of the CFRP pressure vessels.

Then, the CFRP pressure vessel was inserted into the CSG, and burst tests of the CFRP pressure vessels reinforced with and without the CSG were conducted. Moreover, their experimental results were compared with numerical ones obtained by a FEM analysis, and the mechanical properties and the reinforcement effects of the CFRP pressure vessels reinforced with the CSG were investigated.",

To understand the mechanism of stress transfer , a multi-scale mathematical model is presented. At the microscale, interface stress transfer is studied by using two-dimensional finite element (FE) analysis. The filler dimensions required for FE analysis are estimated using XRD and Raman analysis of rGO. In the present case, the filament making process yields filler dimensions comparable to the critical length, hence providing better stress transfer.

The results showed that the impact force and bending stiffness decreased with the number of impacts, while impact duration and maximum central displacement increased. The shape of the damaged area was also affected. The numerical results showed that interlaminar damage initiated at most interfaces during the first impact, followed by in-plane propagation in the next impacts.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been significant interest in the development of high-performance electroactive ionic actuators that possess biocompatible, biodegradable, and bio-friendly characteristics for use in human-attachable electronics. However, research on biopolymer-based soft actuators has been relatively limited due to challenges such as the low ionic conductivity of biopolymers, difficulty in processing to achieve desired functionalities, and improper mechanical stiffness. Therefore, in this study, an electrospun silk membrane coated with sulfonated chitosan, in which membrane exhibits stable mechanical and electrochemical properties due to its interdigitated structures, is utilized to realize high-performance ionic biopolymer actuators. In particular, the introduction of sulfonated chitosan-ionic liquid on electrospun silk lowers the mechanical stiffness and increases the ionic conductivity, resulting in the provision of ion pathways through the interdigitated silk-chitosan domain. On bare electrospun silk membrane, the ionic electrospun silk-sulfonated chitosan actuators with graphene-PEDOT:PSS electrodes show a 165% increase in bending performance compared to those with only PEDOT:PSS electrodes. The developed biopolymer actuator, which shows substantial improvement in actuation performance, can be a promising candidate for use in skin-attachable and biomedical devices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis research study analyzes the influence of Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) resin on the properties of Polybutylene Terephthalate (PBT)/EVA blends produced by injection molding technique. It is based on the fact that a way to recycle PBT from toothbrush bristles is needed. Mechanical samples were made by mixing EVA into PBT with 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% contents. The samples were tested for flexural strength, impact strength, and hardness according to the standards of ASTM D790, ASTM D256, and ASTM D2240, respectively. The results show that when increasing the EVA content in the PBT/EVA blends, the flexural strength tends to decrease; the hardness fluctuates along a decreasing trend; however, the decrease is not significant. Interestingly, the measured impact resistance results are very positive, especially at the highest increase point, increasing by 40.7% compared to neat PBT. The microstructure results showed a good dispersion of EVA on the PBT substrate, but there was no compatibility between these two polymers. The results of XRD analysis showed that when EVA was mixed, it increased the crystallinity and improved the crystal growth of the blends.Keywords: Polybutylene TerephthalateEthylene-Vinyl Acetateimpact strengthblendrecycle PBT AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge HCMC University of Technology and Education, Dong Nhan Phat Co., Ltd and Material Testing Laboratory (HCMUTE).

    "abstract": "AbstractConventional sensors can detect the various physical and chemical changes that occur during deformation and the states of materials with a high accuracy. However, almost all existing sensors are bulky and stiff, making them highly susceptible to failure when used in large deformation-compliant structures. By contrast, despite their relatively-low resolution and accuracy, the demand for flexible and stretchable sensors used in detecting human motion and vital signs has drastically increased. There are several types of stretchable sensors that contain functional materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs). These stretchable sensors have different working principles and applications based on the attributes of their core components. Several electrical signals are used in the measurement of the different physical parameters such as the electrical resistance and capacitance. Triboelectric nanogeneration or voltage signals that can be identified under contact or impact loading conditions are employed in some measurement methods. Additionally, an array of microstructures with a special shape that is directly related to movement and deformation detection, as well as conductive nano-particles that are elaborately aligned along a certain direction for specific sensor applications, are used in the other methods. In this study, a review of the recently-developed high-performance stretchable sensors made from functional materials using new sensing mechanisms for wearable robot applications is provided.Keywords: Stretchable sensorswearable robotsnano-compositesgauge factor Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationFundingThe work was supported by the Chung-Ang University [2020 Young Scientist Scholarship]; National Research Foundation of Korea [RS-2023-00208286].",

However, despite its many superior properties, it is difficult to resource and recycle FRP after its disposition. In this report, the recycling technology of FRP that has been developed is introduced as well as an outline of new recycling technology of FRP developed by the authors. FRP fine powders are made from waste FTP moldings using a fine powder crusher. The average grain size of these fine powders is 15-20 μm. FRP fine powder was examined as a possible additive to paints and it was found that it increased the tensile strength of the paints. FRP can also be recycled as filler for FRP resin. FRPs were also examined for possible civil and construction materials and they were found to be useful as aggregates for concrete secondary products. After examining these manufacturing conditions in detail, by fabricating light and high-strength mortars and investigating strength prediction and water solubility after extended time, it was found to be a practical material. Burned ashes from FRP showed superior properties as mortar concrete expansive admixtures. It was concluded that FRPs, which used to be hard-to-destroy and hard-to-recycle materials, can be recycled for many industrial materials after crushing into fine powders.",

Currently, to increase the interfacial tensile/shear strength between MMCs and some metal parts, the joining processes have been studied. However, a suitable process has not yet been found. In this study, we first studied the optimum manufacturing condition to increase the preform compressive strength which should be necessary to prevent the preform from deformation in the squeeze cast process. The dependence of the binder types, which were the SiO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 sols, the binder content (0-5 mass% vs whisker amount), and the sintering temperature (1000- 1 160°C) of the preform were measured. We then examined the microstructure of the obtained material which was in situ joined with the semi-solid magnesium alloy (Mg-9 mass% Al-1 mass% Zn). The results were as follows: (1) The SiO2 sol was the most effective as a binder to increase the preform compressive strength. (2) During the squeeze cast process, the particles of the α-Mg solid phase in the semi-solid alloy were filtered by the preform and piled up in front of the preform/ semi-solid alloy interface. This causes a gradational distribution of the primary crystals in part of the obtained material.",

The outside diameter of the isogrid cylinder was 624.8 mm, the length was 368.3 mm and the total weight of the cylinder was 3.24 kg. A finite element buckling analysis result was compared with the axial compression experimental data. The average critical buckling load of 186.56 kN was obtained by using the Patran finite element analysis (FEA). The isogrid shell was modeled using 3-node triangular elements and the stiffeners were modeled using 4-node quad elements with a total of 504 nodes and 900 elements. The postbuckled isogrid cylinder was compression tested to the failure load of 177.35 kN. The postbuckled cylinder continued to resist compression loading even after one or more stiffeners had fractured. The testing evaluation revealed that the stiffener buckling was the critical failure mode and it has been demonstrated to be tolerant to structural damage due to the multiplicity of load paths. The lower experimental bucking load was due to the small imperfections in the cylinder but this problem can be overcome by advancement in the manufacturing methods.

    "abstract": "Two structural levels have predominated in fibre composites: (1) The microstructure, i.e. the detailed structure at the nanometer-micrometer level, involving the fibre, the interface or interphase, and the immediately surrounding polymer; (2) The macrostructure, which involves the final design including laminate lay-up, core-skin structure, etc. Between these structural levels lies the mesostructure, a hitherto neglected area, but one with great potential for improving composites and thus making them more efficient and more economical. Nearly all models for fibre composites have straight fibres, regularly packed. This is far from the case in real composites, and this can have serious consequences. The concept of mesostructures include structural defects such as fibre misalignments and uneven fibre packing. The concept can also be applied to lower performance composites with randomly distributed short fibres. In this case we have adventitious order rather than disorder, including preferred orientations and end synchronizations, etc. One mesostructure has already been quite intensively researched, i.e. fibre waviness. Most laminates are made with nominally straight fibres. However, when the structures are looked at carefully, they are always found to contain misaligned fibres. These misalignments are often quite small (only a degree or so) in well made reinforced thermosets, but can become quite large in some thermoplastics. (Very significant waviness has been detected in carbon fibre reinforced polyarysulphone.) The waviness reduces tensile properties to some extent, but has a much more serious effect on compressive properties. On the other hand, it many actually be beneficial for shear properties. Waviness can be controlled by choice of initial material (the exact form of prepreg) and processing conditions such as the type of mold used (i.e. graphite as compared with nickel). Thus it provides a direct link between processing and properties. The identification and classification of mesostructures will be discussed and their effects on final properties will be reviewed.",

A few parameters necessary for the probabilistic function are determined from the monotonic tensile tests at various stress rates.

    "abstract": "Cure cycle optimization and process control for autoclave cure of thermoset resin matrix composites based on temperature and internal strain monitoring were studied. Cure of thermoset resin is usually an exothermic reaction, which causes temperature increase of composites during cure. Slowing down the temperature ramp rate is effective in lowering the peak temperature. However, the slower is the ramp rate, the longer the cure time becomes. Therefore, it is desirable to control the ramp rate in order to depress the peak temperature with prolongation of cure time minimized. Besides that, precise determination of cure completion is also required in order to minimize cure time. The procedure for smart processing described above was developed and tried on laminate of carbon fiber/epoxy resin prepreg. In this procedure, temperature ramp rate is controlled so that the peak temperature predicted by Springer's thermochemical model is kept below an allowable value. Cure completion is determined by a cure rate equation and internal strain monitoring with embedded EFPI optical fiber sensors. The internal strain is correlated with specific volume change of the matrix resin caused by cure shrinkage and thermal expansion/contraction. The authors found that the cure shrinkage terminates at a certain degree of cure, and EFPI sensors can detect this point. Although the degree of cure can be calculated by integrating the cure rate equation along temperature history, errors may be accumulated. Therefore, the degree of cure is corrected and integration of cure rate equation is restarted at the cure shrinkage termination point detected by EFPI sensors. Thus, cure completion is determined precisely. This smart autoclave processing procedure was able to depress the peak temperature and determine the end of cure.",

The principles of the three infusion processes are discussed along with the advantages of each technique compared with traditional composite fabrication methods such as prepreg tape lay-up and autoclave cure. The large number of processing variables and the complex material behavior during infiltration and cure make experimental optimization of the infusion processes inefficient.

A variety of processing parameters such as fiber area fraction, molding temperature and forming pressure were systematically controlled and their influence on the tensile properties was investigated. It was revealed that both tensile strength and elastic modulus of the composites increase steadily depending on the increase in fiber area fraction, suggesting a general conformity to the rule of mixtures (ROM), particularly up to 55% fiber area fraction. The improvement in tensile properties was found to be closely related to the good interfacial adhesion between the fiber and polymer matrix, and was observed to be more pronounced under the optimum processing condition of 130°C molding temperature and 10 MPa forming pressure. However, processing out of the optimum condition results in a deterioration in properties, mostly fiber and/or matrix degradation together with their interfacial defect as a consequence of the thermal or mechanical damages. On the basis of microstructural observation, the cause of strength degradation and its countermeasure to provide a feasible composite design are discussed in relation to the optimized process conditions.",

Two different carbon/epoxy composite systems, the unidirectional T700S/2500 and TR50S/modified epoxy, are tested at the static condition and the strain rate of 100 s−1. A high-strain-rate test was performed using a tension-type split Hopkinson bar technique with a specific fixture for specimen. The experimental results demonstrated that both tensile strength increase with strain rate, while the fracture behaviors are quite different. By the use of the rosette analysis and the strain transformation equations, the strain rate effects of material principal directions on tensile strength are investigated. It is experimentally found that the shear strain rate produces the more significant contribution to strain rate effect on dynamic tensile strength. An empirical failure criterion for characterizing the dynamic tensile strength was proposed based on the Hashin's failure criterion. Although the proposed criterion is just the empirical formula, it is in better agreement with the experimental data and quite simple.

    "abstract": "Abstract Mechanical reinforcement of an all-sustainable composite, composed of papyrus stem-milled particles as reinforcement and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) resin as matrix, was investigated. The papyrus particles (average diameter of 70 μm) could be well dispersed in PLLA resin up to 50 wt% without any surface modification. Young's modulus of the composite was 4.2 GPa at 50 wt% of the papyrus content. This is a two-fold increment in modulus as compared to that of the PLLA matrix. The tensile strength of the composite was almost constant around 48 MPa irrespective of the papyrus content. Temperature dependence of the storage modulus demonstrated that the incorporation of papyrus restricts the large drop in the modulus above the glass transition of PLLA.

    "abstract": "Recently, natural fiber reinforced composite is attracting attention and considered as an environmentally friendly material. Usually cellulosic fibers are used to reinforce the composites, but some protein fibers such as silk and wool serve the same purpose. In this paper, we proposed a method of producing artistic composite from artistic fabric by using silk fiber reinforced biodegradable plastic, which is designated as 'silk composite', for reinforcement. In order to expand applications of the silk composite, we performed the compression molding of decorative laminates with woody material, which was selected as a core material, and examined the properties of molded decorative laminates with various content of the silk composite. Since plywood and medium-density fiberboard (MDF) are widely used for decorative laminates, we selected them as core materials. As a result, flexible decorative laminates with high flexural strength were obtained by compounding the silk composite with wood materials.",

However, it implies significant uncertainty within the construction process of its material properties when compared to other regular metals. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a probabilistic design method based on reliability. This paper calculated the probabilistic margin of safety of a simplified composite sandwich fuselage in order to examine that the classic design method utilizing the safety factor does not ensure the safety of the structure. Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) was conducted for efficient calculation by using proposed RBDO by moving probability density function (RBDO-MPDF) method in this paper. Crude Monte-Carlo Simulation was used to calculate the probability density function. The results of this paper will be applicable to the improved design methods that ensure the structural reliability and maximized efficiency within the RBDO process.Keywords: composite sandwichuncertaintyreliability analysisprobabilistic margin of safetyRBDO by moving PDF AcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by the Flight Vehicle Research Center.",

Three-dimensional finite element models with different bolt-hole fit conditions and bolts' preloads are constructed based on the contact relationships between the fasteners and the plates, the progressive failure features of composite materials and the elastic–plastic property of the titanium alloy. The models are used to study the effects of the assembly parameters after the modelling method is validated through comparing with test results. Through the analysis of the results, the conclusions can be drawn that: firstly, appropriate preload or interference fit can change the contact status and stress state around the fastener hole as the joints are under load and then increases the load capacity of the joints; secondly, too large preload or interference fit will cause joints to fail prematurely and decrease the load capacity consequently; thirdly, the effect of the bolt-hole fit conditions and the effect of the bolt's clamping forces impact each other, and these two parameters need to be considered together in order to obtain the optimized joint configurations.",

Two injection modes are considered — constant volumetric flow rate and constant pressure — while the constant compression velocity is utilized in this study. Three typical cases are used to investigate the compression initiation effects on the filling process. When the inlet condition is a constant flow rate, the numerical results show that the compression has both increase and decrease effects on the inlet pressure. Thus, a discontinuity in the inlet pressure is present at the onset or the end of compression. Among three CRTM cases, the process with a simultaneous injection and compression end maximally reduces the inlet pressure by 80% but increases the mold filling time by 65% compared with the resin transfer molding (RTM). For the inlet condition being a constant pressure, the resin may flow out of the mold cavity through the inlet when an excessively low injection pressure and high compression speed are applied concurrently. Compared with RTM, the CRTM processes reduce the mold filling time by 68–76% but cannot ensure a reduction in inlet pressure.",

For this purpose, static tension tests are performed on thickness dimension (1D), in-plane dimensions (2D), and all the dimensions (3D) scaled specimens, respectively. The experimental results show that the tensile strength has a tendency to decrease by about 40–60% with increasing thickness dimension by a factor of 2. In contrast, the tensile strength tends to increase by about 60–130% with increasing in-plane dimensions by a factor of 2. The tensile strength has a tendency to slightly increase by about 6% with increasing all the dimensions by a factor of 2. The effect of 1D scaling on the tensile strength is opposite to that of 2D scaling, and the 2D scaling effect is slightly more significant than the 1D scaling effect. The 2D scaling effect in the tensile strength masks the 1D scaling effect when they are involved at the same time. The latter is consistent with the small 3D scaling effect that is similar in nature to the 2D scaling effect. On the basis of these observations, a phenomenological equation to describe the effect of specimen size on the tensile strength of the unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite is established. It is demonstrated that the scale effect model can adequately describe the 1D, 2D, and 3D scaling effects on the tensile strength of the unidirectional composite.",

In this paper, we investigated the effect of pore geometries – 1) sizes and 2) aspect ratios on the fatigue life of polyamide 12 (PA12) by combining two different fatigue life prediction approaches. Considering that the typical failure mechanism of structural materials follows the initiation of the crack, propagation, and ultimate separation, the present approach counts the fatigue life until crack initiation and fatigue cycles during the crack growth until complete separation. For the prediction, a crack growth model by Castillo-Canteli-Siegele model (CCS model) with initial defects was adopted. In addition, to reflect the elastoplastic behavior better, an extended CCS model with the cyclic J-integral was used. The simulation results show that the presence of the pores in the plastic material can significantly affect the fatigue life. The characteristics of fatigue properties on the geometric conditions of pores were discussed by comparing the results. The proposed method can be seamlessly used for the evaluation of fatigue life of polymer matrix composite materials.",

Here, two braided composite configurations were considered: biaxial and triaxial. The present ELM-based modeling was validated through a comparison with analytical unit cell modeling. In addition, a comparison with existing numerical and experimental results is also presented. As importantly, a technique to introduce an undulation effect into ELM using constant undulation angle is newly proposed. The results demonstrated the workability of using ELM to approximate the effective properties of braided composites predicted by considerably more sophisticated methods. An excellent approximation of unit cell analysis results highlights the capability of the proposed ELM with undulation effect.",

    "abstract": "In carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) adhesive joints, poor adhesion because of weak bonds may occur due to contamination at the bond line. We reproduced weak bonds by using a molecular dynamics simulation (MD) approach to investigate the mechanisms of weak bonds. Weak-bond models were created by inserting water (H2O), xylene (C8H10), and silicone molecules as contaminants in the two epoxy models. Tensile analysis was performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the weak-bond models. The results revealed that the insertion of contaminants reduced the strength of these models. Stress concentration occurred due to the concentration of inserted molecules at the bond line. In addition, the yielding behavior was slower in the H2O model than in the C8H10 and silicone models, and the strength of the H2O model decreased significantly even at a small insertion rate compared with the C8H10 and silicone models. The reason for the difference in yielding behavior may be due to the high diffusion of H2O molecules into the whole epoxy resin. The weak-bond model was reproduced using MD, and the mechanisms of weak bonds were clarified by an analysis of van der Waals potential energy.",

Herein, a detailed research on the impact of electrospinning parameters on the morphological and electromechanical properties of electrospun multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofibers is conducted. Besides the MWCNTs concentrations, electrospinning parameters have a significant effect on the morphology, electromechanical and sensory properties of electrospun MWCNTs/TPU nanofibrous membrane. Results show that at lower collector speeds, tip to collector distances, and higher electrospinning time lead to the formation of more homogeneously dispersed fibrous structures, which result in enhanced conductivity and strain sensitivity. Consequently, from the repeatability tests, all samples show quite similar linear responses under strain, indicating a highly repeatable fabrication process. Obtained results can help to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of controlling the electrospinning parameters, especially in the production of flexible strain sensors.",

The pressure vessel geometry is generally cylindrical and the wall is composed of a 'liner' and a 'shell.' The liner holds the gas and guards the shell from chemical attacks. The filament-wound shell aims to withstand the hydrostatic load of pressure gas. The shell design has to be defined in observance of both fibers stratification methodology and design structural criteria. For years, pressure vessel design primarily focused on mass; space saving features during pressure vessel design was usually a secondary concern unless specifically required by the customer. Now, more emphasis have being assigned to design light weight pressure vessels that also maximizes use of available space for industry finding such as space on a spacecraft, as well as mass, is at premium. For this reason, it is very important to optimize together the index of performance and packaging of gas storage system. This work aims to develop a parametric method to optimize the index of performance as a function of one or more pressure vessels; in this way, it is possible to optimize also the packaging of the gas storage system.keywords: composite materialpressure vesselfilament windingperformance indexpackaging AcknowledgmentsThis work was carried out with the funding of the Italian MIUR (Ministry of University and Research).

For example, hydroxyapatite (HA) has bone-bonding ability through a bone-like apatite layer in body environment and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) has a high bioresorbability in body environment. In addition, HA/β-TCP composites has the characteristics of both HA and TCP. However, it is difficult to sinter the composite, so that MgO has been used as a sintering agent. In the present study, effects of MgO addition on sintering calcium phosphate ceramics and composites were investigated. In order to evaluate the effect of MgO on the composites, HA, HA/β-TCP(30wt%), and HA/β-TCP(50wt%) with 1wt% MgO were prepared and characterized. To clarify the role of MgO on sintering of calcium phosphate ceramics, HA, β-TCP, and α-TCP with different TCP content (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt%) were also prepared. The results suggest that MgO addition densified HA/β-TCP composites and gave higher strength composites. The results of monolithic calcium phosphate ceramics indicated MgO addition was effective on β-TCP and α-TCP, not on HA. The maximum content of Ca atom in β-TCP displaced with Mg atoms in MgO might be 24 atm%.",

Shear strength increased by drawing, while twist strength decreased. This might be due to orientation of molecular chains during drawing. In order to evaluate orientation of molecular chains, orientation function in extruded billets was measured as a function of ER. Since orientation function increased with ER, drawing is effective method to improve shear strength of screw, where fibrous structure which was formed during extruding resisted shear stress in cross-section perpendicular to screw axis. Although orientation functions for billet extruded at ER 1.3–4 were equivalent, both strengths changed for the screw extruded at the range of this ER. Infrared spectra suggested transforming from α to β crystal for the billet extruded at the range of this ER. This result suggested that mechanical properties of screw also depended on the crystal forms.",

Thus, the buckling load can be determined by considering the wall segments as individual plates rotationally restrained by the adjacent wall segments. This technique is combined with plate theories as a new analytical method to predict the buckling load of an initially delaminated column with any arbitrary sections (open or closed). First, moments at the rotationally restrained edges of delaminated segment (web or flange) are obtained from the curvature and stiffness of the adjacent laminates. Then, the strain energy of this delaminated segment with distributed moment at edges is calculated based on the first-order shear deformation theory. Using the principal of minimum potential energy, the governing equations are obtained and solved by the Rayleigh–Ritz approximation technique. Results of the present approach are compared with three-dimensional finite-element results obtained from eigenvalue buckling analysis in ANSYS software for both box- and channel-section columns with cross-ply and angle-ply stacking sequences. Finally, the effects of delamination size and location are investigated on the buckling loads.",

The accuracy improved and then converged to a certain value with decreasing distance between each tomogram. Better accuracy was obtained for the circular fibers. Average error in the estimated fiber locations was less than in the fiber diameter. However, errors caused overlapped fibers.

These materials can be roughly divided into two types. One is a compatible type, which shows high impact resistance under low velocities with high Mode II delamination resistance. The other type is a non-compatible type, which has poor impact resistance at low velocities, even though it has superior Mode II delamination resistance. As for the system of T800/3631, T800/3900-2 and IM7/PIX-A composites, the Impact Energy (IE)/Damage Area (DA) ratio correlates well with GIIC(0 : PMAX), Mode II energy release rate characterized at PMAX, and GIIR(0), Mode II energy release rate in propagation, for the 0/0 interface. The system of these materials is the compatible type. On the other hand, as for the system of T800/3631, UT500/PEEK and AS4/PEEK composites, the IE/DA ratio correlates well with GIIC(PNL), Mode II energy release rate characterized at PNL, for 0/0 and 22.5/-22.5 interfaces. The system of these materials is the non-compatible type. It is suggested that the main reason for the difference in behavior of these two types is that the compatible type has the superior Mode II delamination resistance in the sub-critical crack growth region and propagation. It correlates with the superior impact resistance under low velocities. Keywords: Impactdelaminationdamage resistanceMode IItoughnesslow velocitycorrelation",

The sandwich pipe is created using non-reinforced material for the core layer and an alternate-ply material for the skin layers. Considering the complicated material properties of the skin layers reinforced by alternate-ply composites, the analysis is based on treating typical sandwich pipes that are three-dimensional, cylindrical, and orthotropic.

Then, the present methods are applied to CFRP pipes and shells having interior damage and the numerical and experimental results show that the elemental strain-basis method is quite useful for detecting the damage inside CFRP filament winding pipes.

    "abstract": "A numerical analysis is performed to study an impact damage accumulation problem in composite laminates. A special three-dimensional interface element is developed based on the cohesive model. The element enables the mesh independent configurations of a crack to be calculated and can treat contact problems of the delaminated area. The energy stored in the element per unit area is defined as a function of continuous relative displacements of the delaminated surface. The energy stored before the perfect separation of the interface is equal to the interlaminar fracture toughness. The softening cohesive relations between the tractions and the relative displacements are given by differentiating the energy function with respect to the relative displacements. The maximum value of traction may coincide with interfacial bonding strength. The element is incorporated in a commercially available finite element code. Crack propagation problems under pure Mode I and Mode II loading conditions for three-dimensional models are calculated to show the validity of the present element. The convergence of solution with mesh refinement is examined. The analytical solutions converge smoothly and agree well with the theoretical ones. The present method may be a good tool to simulate the damage accumulation problem of CFRP laminates.",

    "abstract": "We propose a stochastic process analysis for predicting the strength and reliability of a unidirectional fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composite. The analysis is based on a Markov process, in which it is assumed that a state of damage in the composite is developed with each fiber breakage. When the Weibull distribution is used to describe the strength distribution of the fiber, the probability of being in each state can be solved analytically in a closed form. Using the solutions of the probabilities, a discussion about damage tolerance of the composites is quantitatively developed, from the viewpoint of materials reliability engineering. To compare the proposed stochastic process analysis with previously proposed strength models in the basis of classical bundle theory, we obtained the expected value and variance in the composite stress from solutions of the probabilities of being in the states. The expected value and variance both consist of two terms, equivalent to the effects of both bundle structure and stress recovery in broken fibers. These are surprisingly in agreement with the solutions analyzed by Phoenix and Raj [9]. The effect of stress recovery in broken fibers produces a positive in the expected value and a negative in the variance and is thus a significant mechanism for increasing the strength and reliability of the composite. In addition we predicted the expected values of composite strengths and variances from the solutions. The corresponding value of normalized fiber stress to obtain the expected value in strength and the variance agreed relatively well with the value predicted by Hui et al. [13]. We further verified that the composite strength obeys a normal distribution, which has the expected value and standard deviation predicted above. Finally, we predicted the probabilities in strength of the composites with various sizes and concluded that the ceramic matrix composite is quite reliable in strength when the number of fibers corresponds to that in practical use.",

    "abstract": "The research and development in soundproof materials for preventing noise have attracted great attention due to their social impact. Noise insulation materials are especially important in the field of soundproofing. Since the insulation ability of most materials follows a mass rule, the heavy weight materials like concrete, lead and steel board are mainly used in the current noise insulation materials. To overcome some weak points in these materials, fiber reinforced composite materials with lightweight and other high performance characteristics are now being used. In this paper, innovative insulation sheet materials with carbon and/or glass fabrics and nano-silica hybrid PU resin are developed. The parameters related to sound performance, such as materials and fabric texture in base fabric, hybrid method of resin, size of silica particle and so on, are investigated. At the same time, the wave analysis code (PZFlex) is used to simulate some of experimental results. As a result, it is found that both bundle density and fabric texture in the base fabrics play an important role on the soundproof performance. Compared with the effect of base fabrics, the transmission loss in sheet materials increased more than 10 dB even though the thickness of the sample was only about 0.7 mm. The results show different values of transmission loss factor when the diameters of silica particles in coating materials changed. It is understood that the effect of the soundproof performance is different due to the change of hybrid method and the size of silica particles. Fillers occupying appropriate positions and with optimum size may achieve a better effect in soundproof performance. The effect of the particle content on the soundproof performance is confirmed, but there is a limit for the addition of the fillers. The optimization of silica content for the improvement of the sound insulation effect is important. It is observed that nano-particles will have better effect on the high soundproof performance. The sound insulation effect has been understood through a comparison between the experimental and analytical results. It is confirmed that the time-domain finite wave analysis (PZFlex) is effective for the prediction and design of soundproof performance materials. Both experimental and analytical results indicate that the developed materials have advantages in lightweight, flexibility, other mechanical properties and excellent soundproof performance.",

First of all, rate dependence of the tensile behavior of balanced symmetric cross-ply T800H/epoxy laminates with a [0/90]3S lay-up under off-axis loading conditions at 100°C is examined. Uniaxial tension tests are performed on plain coupon specimens with various fiber orientations [/(90 – )]3S ( = 0, 5, 15, 45 and 90°) at two different strain rates (1.0 and 0.01%/min). The off-axis stress–strain curves exhibit marked nonlinearity for all the off-axis fiber orientations except for the on-axis fiber orientations = 0 and 90°, regardless of the strain rates. Strain rate has significant influences not only on the off-axis flow stress in the regime of nonlinear response but also on the apparent off-axis elastic modulus in the regime of initial linear response. A macromechanical constitutive model based on a ply viscoplasticity model and the classical laminated plate theory is applied to predictions of the rate-dependent off-axis nonlinear behavior of the cross-ply CFRP laminate. The material constants involved by the ply viscoplasticity model are identified on the basis of the experimental results on the unidirectional laminate of the same carbon/epoxy system. It is demonstrated that good agreements between the predicted and observed results are obtained by taking account of the fiber rotation induced by deformation as well as the rate dependence of the initial Young's moduli.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Robotized filament winding technology involves a robot that winds a roving impregnated by resin on a die along the directions of stresses to which the work-piece is submitted in applications. The robot moves a deposition head along a winding trajectory in order to deposit roving. The trajectory planning is a very critical aspect of robotized filament winding technology, since it is responsible for both the tension constancy and the winding time. The present work shows two original rules to plan the winding trajectory of structural parts, whose shape is obtained by sweeping a full section around a 3D curve that must be closed and not crossing in order to assure a continuous winding. The first rule plans the winding trajectory by approximating the part 3D shape with straight lines; it is called the discretized rule. The second rule defines the winding trajectory simply by offsetting a 3D curve that reproduces the part 3D shape, of a defined distance; it is called the offset rule. The two rules have been compared in terms of roving tension and winding time. The present work shows how the offset rule enables achievement of both the required aims: to manufacture parts of high structural performances by keeping the tension on the roving near to the nominal value and to markedly decrease the winding time. This is the first step towards the optimization of the robotized filament winding technology.

Two specimens, i.e. [(0/90)3]S, [(0/45/90/–45)2]S, were analyzed using a finite element method and were experimentally tested for cases, both with and without a hole, whose diameter corresponded to 0.12 times the specimen width. Delamination positions predicted by a 3-dimensional static finite element analysis were matched well to those observed by an ultrasonic imaging system in the middle of fatigue test. A hole whose diameter corresponds to 0.12 times the specimen width caused the fatigue strength to decrease by 9% and 11% under 5 Hz loading frequency, and by 22% and 25% under 10 Hz loading frequency for [(0/90)3]S and [(0/45/90/–45)2]S, respectively. Because the decrease in sectional area due to the hole was normalized in calculation of the tensile strength, a stress concentration around the hole is believed to induce the strength degradation of fatigue specimens. From the finite element analyses, the stress concentration factor around a hole was expected as 8.8 and 9.5 for [(0/90)3]S and [(0/45/90/–45)2]S, respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a strength prediction method for unidirectional glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRPs) after hydrothermal aging: immersion in deionized water at 80°C. First, the strength degradation of the constituents (i.e., the glass fiber and the fiber/matrix interface) of unidirectional GFRP after hydrothermal aging was evaluated from the fiber strength and the interfacial shear stress by using a single-fiber composite (SFC). Both the fiber strength and the interfacial shear stress had a tendency to decrease in the early stage of hydrothermal aging and to saturate toward certain values with long-term aging. In addition, the tensile strength of the unidirectional GFRP was measured after hydrothermal aging. The residual strength of the unidirectional GFRP also had a tendency to decrease sharply in the early stage of hydrothermal aging and to saturate toward a certain strength with long-term aging. Finally, the residual strength of the unidirectional GFRP after hydrothermal aging was predicted using the global loading sharing (GLS) model, by considering the degradation of both the glass fiber and the fiber/matrix interface. The predicted results indicated good agreement with the experimental data while considering not only the degradation of the fiber reinforcement but also the fiber/matrix interface adhesion. It was concluded that the GLS model applied considering the degradation of the GFRP constituents would be a suitable and a simple model to predict the residual strength of the unidirectional GFRP after hydrothermal aging.",

The results show that iron matrix composites with SiC particle of 13 μm achieve the best tensile strength and elongation.

The iron matrix composites with SiC particle of 13 μm with excellent mechanical property can be reasonably attributed to the uniform reinforcement distribution compared with the ones with particle of 3 μm and the relative higher dislocation strengthening effects and lower particle-cracking probability compared with the ones with coarser particles.",

But the presence of crystal defects like Stone–Wales defects or vacancies degrade their mechanical properties to a large extent. The effects of the presence of a single Stone–Wales defect or a single vacancy defect on the elastic properties and the fracture pattern of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) are investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We considered three samples of SWCNT, one each of chiral, armchair and zigzag type. In all the three samples, significant changes are observed compared to a defect-free tube. A defective chiral (10,6) tube shows more stability under stretched condition compared to the armchair (7,7) or the zigzag (10,0) tube as revealed from the energy differences between defective and defect-free tubes at different stages of deformation. Fluctuation of energy differences for higher strain values for the same defect orientation is observed to be most pronounced in the case of a zigzag tube and hence shows a less stable configuration than the other two tubes. The fracture pattern in each case is modelled and shows that defects play a major role in the breaking mechanism of a SWCNT. Also the differences in fracture modes of chiral and achiral tubes prove the dependence of their mechanical behavior on chirality.",

A Lamb wave-based quantitative identification technique for delamination in VARTM (vacuum assisted resin transfer molding) composite structures was established. The propagation of Lamb waves in composite plates was evaluated using dynamic FEM analysis, then an experiment was carried out to verify the validity of the analytical study. The study assessed damage in the plates by fusing information from multiple sensing paths of the embedded network. To eliminate interference, a wavelet transform technique was applied to purify the acquired Lamb wave signals.

In the present study, FRP using polypropylene (PP) felt and banana-polyester felt which have lower density comparing with conventional polyester poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) felt were developed for alternative reinforcement. Three-point bending and creep tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties of the composites. In static bending, PET and banana composites showed brittleness, whereas PP composites failed in a stable manner. Especially, PP composites with thicker layers showed higher load-bearing capacity. Creep test results indicated that modulus retentions of PET and PP composites are comparable.

This study proposes a method for estimating the overall state of CFRP during molding based on data assimilation, which integrates theoretical and experimental values. In this method, three types of specimens with different thermal conductivities were considered, and the temperatures throughout each specimen during molding were estimated by data assimilation of surface temperatures measured using thermocouples. To validate the accuracy of this method, the temperatures estimated by data assimilation were compared with those obtained using numerical simulations without data assimilation. The experimental results of all the specimens showed that data assimilation can be used to accurately estimate the surface temperature. The proposed method is therefore effective for monitoring composite molding processes.",

First, a critical dimension of broken fiber cluster in the presence of splitting is formulated using the principles of fracture mechanics. Based on the geometry of fiber packing, a relation between the rate of fiber breakage and the probability distribution of the cluster dimension is derived. Lastly, the assumption that the cross-sectional area separated by splitting sustains no load is used as a discounting factor to reduce the tensile stress in the unidirectional composites and the stress–strain relation is then predicted. The discounting factor is calculated by comparing the probability distribution for the cluster dimensions estimated from the rate of fiber breakage with that of the critical cluster dimension, both of which are functions of fiber stress. When the interfacial toughness related to the critical cluster dimension is estimated from the single-fiber pull-out test and substituted into this model, the predicted tensile strengths are in good agreement with the experimental results.",

In addition, there are few cases where molecular dynamics simulation is used to compare the molecular chain deformation behavior which is difficult to evaluate in the micro region and the potential energy and evaluate mechanical properties like stress. Therefore, in this study, in order to compare molecular chain deformation behavior of PLLA using molecular dynamics method, analysis models of initial orientation 0 °, 45 °, 90 ° and four random oriented models were prepared. In addition, tensile simulation was carried out using affine deformation, and the influence on the mechanical properties exerted by molecular chain deformation behavior was evaluated. As molecular chain deformation behavior, molecular chain length, molecular chain angle, distance between centers of gravity between molecular chains were determined, and in comparison with potential energy and stress generated in tensile simulation for evaluating mechanical behavior. As a result, it was shown that the model showing the curing behavior increased the stress after reaching the lower yield point, and the model not showing a remarkable increase after the stress reached the lower yield point. In addition, it was suggested that the elongation and angle change of the molecular chain had a large influence on the stress, and among them, the influence on the stress exerted by the angle change was the largest.",

Also, the viscoelastic-viscoplastic behavior of the PBT is predicted by finite element simulation. The evaluation reveals that the initial yield stress depends on temperature and strain rate; however, viscosity depends on only strain rate. Furthermore, the rate sensitivity is independent of temperature and strain rate. The finite element simulation using identified viscoelastic-viscoplastic characteristics can reproduce the stress–strain relationship in the uniaxial tensile tests under various testing conditions.

High residual Si resulted in thermal-shock cracking due to the high thermal expansion coefficient and volume change during melting. The composite infiltrated with 30 wt.% Si showed 0.9 × 10–4 g/cm2∙s of the ablation rate and no thermal-shock cracking after three successive ablation tests due to the formation of a thin SiO2 layer.

The formation of SiC diffusion coating was confirmed, including the compositional gradient of C and Si elements on the substrates. The oxidation results of SiC coated specimens show that the amount of SiO2 phase formed on the graphite is much more than C/C composite. Furthermore, because of the high viscosity of SiO2, it can seal most of the pores on the SiC surface formed on the graphite.

Surface deformations of sandwich panels were calculated using finite element analyses to examine the elasto-plastic deformation of the ROHACELLs based on the tensile test results. Experimentally measured deformation in the sandwich panels varied depending on the cell size of cores, and the largest measured deformation after the moisture absorption was approximately 100 μm.

The initial degradation of the resin was controlled by a physical action, followed by a slow chemical degradation, i.e. corrosion. Higher temperature and higher concentration of the solutions promoted degradation. Lower molecular alcohols produced more severe corrosion by transesterification under neutral condition without an acidic or basic catalyst. Reduction in flexural strength of the resin could be predicted by the volume swollen ratio of the resin. In the case of FRP, physical degradation was decreased by the filler, and high effectiveness of the FRP for actual use was shown.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study deals with transverse cracking in cross-ply laminates. A fracture mechanics analysis, using a strain energy based criterion, was used to model the onset of transverse matrix cracking, and the conditions for further damage development. An admissible displacement field, involving unknown functions was assumed, and the principle of minimum potential energy was used to establish these functions. The crack front shape was a part of the assumed displacement field, thus making it possible to minimise the strain energy with respect to the crack opening displacement function. In this paper the aim was to establish a solution to the transverse cracking problem, to use later in a numerical procedure for the viscoelastic damage predictions for a cross-ply laminate. The model accounts for residual stresses. A number of finite element solutions were performed to verify the accuracy of the presented analytical solution. Predictions of stiffness degradation due to matrix cracking, and matrix cracking as a function of applied stress are presented.

The characteristics of individual fibers, matrix, and the fiber/matrix interface are the most important factors for evaluating fiber-reinforced composite materials from a micromechanical viewpoint. To this purpose, we first developed a testing device with which the load-elongation curve of a monofilament can be obtained. Filament diameter was measured by the aid of laser diffraction. Using these devices, we have tensile-tested several kinds of monofilaments and accumulated data. The strength distribution agreed fairly well with the Weibull distribution. The fiber/matrix interaction was also examined with a single fiber embedded model. By measuring a fragment length, an ineffective length was calculated. This paper will provide the basic data to the second report in which the strength of unidirectional composites is predicted by means of computer simulation.",

A hybrid FRP layer is also composed of a CFRP layer sandwiched in between two KFRP layers. The CFRP layers prevent kink band formation in the KFRP layers. The KFRP layers prevent growth of micro-cracks produced on the CFRP layers. At the same time, KFRP layers act as an insulator between an aluminum layer and a CFRP layer to prevent galvanic corrosion. Results of tensile and compressive tests indicated that the mechanical properties of the new material were improved by 10%-50% from those of KFRP/Al. It was also indicated that though the tensile strength of the new material was almost the same as that of CFRP/A1, its failure strain increased by about 40%.

New hybrid concrete columns are developed in this study for new constructions. The basic structure of the proposed hybrid column consists of an exterior PVC-FRP shell with a concrete core. The exterior shell is commercially available cylindrical PVC pipe externally reinforced with impregnated continuous fiber in the form of hoops at different spacing. This paper presents the results of experimental and analytical studies of the performance of axially loaded concrete columns confined with PVC-FRP tubes. Test variables include type of confinement, volume of fiber and FRP hoop spacing. The results indicate that the new hybrid columns exhibited high strength and ductility. A new design procedure for concrete confined with PVC-FRP is proposed. Comparisons between experimental and theoretical results showed good agreement.

The CVD-SiC coated C/C composites were mechanically loaded to a strain of 0.13% and were exposed in air at the testing temperature for 10 min. Then, the specimens were subjected to tensile load to failure. The nominal tensile strength of the CVD-SiC coated C/C composite was decreased with increasing temperature due to the oxidation under the coating cracks. Two kinds of true strength were calculated using the cross-sectional area at fracture or the effective cross-sectional area. The effective strength of the CVD-SiC coated C/C composites, based on the decrease in cross-sectional area with no contribution of 90° plies to load carrying, is appropriate to characterize strength after exposure. A diffusion model was applied to predict the oxidation behavior of CVD-SiC coated C/C composite. The effectiveness of the present model was confirmed.

Initially, this project consisted of four research groups: structural health monitoring, smart manufacturing, active/adaptive structures, and actuator material/devices. Two years later, two demonstrator programs were added in order to integrate the developed sensor and actuator elements into the smart structure system and to verify the research and development results of the four research groups. The application target of these demonstrators was the airplane, and two demonstrators whose shapes simulated the fuselage of a small commercial airplane (for example, Boeing B737) were established. The first demonstrator integrated the following six innovative techniques: (1) impact monitoring using embedded, small diameter optical fiber sensors newly developed in this program, (2) impact monitoring using integrated acoustic emission (AE) systems, (3) whole-field strain mapping using the BOTDR/FBG integrated system, (4) damage suppression using embedded shape memory alloy (SMA) films, (5) maximum and cyclic strain sensing using smart composite patches, and (6) smart manufacturing using the integrated sensing system. The second demonstrator was for suppressing vibration and acoustic noise generated in a composite cylindrical structure. In this program, high-performance PZT actuators/sensors (developed in this project) were also installed. All tests and evaluations were completed. This paper outlines the demonstrator programs.",

Finite element analyses have been carried out to show how the deformation behavior of a metal matrix composite changes as the particle size and volume fraction are varied. The strain hardenings in metal matrix composites are increased with smaller particles and larger volume fractions which could not be predicted with size-independent constitutive relation. It has been shown that the suggested method can be used in a common finite element analysis process to account for the size effect of composite strengthening.",

Transient and steady shear flows were simulated numerically by using the K-BKZ integral constitutive equation along with experimentally determined damping functions under dynamic oscillatory and step strain shear flows. Nonlinear shear responses were predicted with the K-BKZ constitutive equation using two different damping functions such as the Wagner and PSM models. It was observed that PP-g-MAH compatibilized PP/layered silicate nanocomposites have stronger and earlier shear thinning and higher steady shear viscosity than pure PP resin or uncompatibilized nanocomposites at low shear rate regions. Strong damping behavior of the PP/layered silicate nanocomposite was predicted under large step shear strain and considered as a result of the strain-induced orientation of the organoclay in the shear flow. Steady shear viscosity of the pure PP and uncompatibilized nanocomposite predicted by the K-BKZ model was in good agreement with the experimental results at all shear rate regions. However, the model was inadequate to predict the steady shear viscosity of PP-g-MAH compatibilized nanocomposites quantitatively because the K-BKZ model overestimates strain-softening damping behavior for PP/layered silicate nanocomposites.",

    "abstract": "Abstract High quality and expedient processing repair methods are necessary to enhance the service life of bridge structures. Deterioration of concrete can occur as a result of structural cracks, corrosion of reinforcement, and freeze–thaw cycles. Cost effective methods with potential for field implementation are necessary to address the issue of the vulnerability of bridge structures and how to repair them. Most infrastructure related applications of fiber-reinforced plastics (FRPs) use traditional hand lay-up technology. The hand lay-up is tedious, labor-intensive and relies upon personnel skill level. An alternative to traditional hand lay-up of FRP for infrastructure applications is Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM). VARTM uses single sided molding technology to infuse resin over fabrics wrapping large structures, such as bridge girders and columns. There is no work currently available in understanding the interface developed, when VARTM processing is adopted to wrap fibers such as carbon and/or glass over concrete structures. This paper investigates the interface formed by carbon fiber processed on to a concrete surface using the VARTM technique. Various surface treatments, including sandblasting, were performed to study the pull-off tensile test to find a potential prepared surface. A single-lap shear test was used to study the bond strength of CFRP fabric/epoxy composite adhered to concrete. Carbon fiber wraps incorporating Sikadur HEX 103C and low viscosity epoxy resin Sikadur 300 were considered in VARTM processing of concrete specimens. Keywords: VARTMFRP REINFORCEMENTRC BEAMS",

    "abstract": "Aerospace structural applications, along with high performance marine and automotive applications, require high-strength efficiency, which can be achieved using metal matrix composites (MMCs). Rotating components, such as jet-engine blades and gas turbine parts, require materials that maximize strength efficiency and metallurgical stability at elevated temperatures. Titanium matrix composites (TMCs) are well suited in such applications, since they offer an enhanced resistance to temperature effects as well as corrosion resistance, in addition to optimum strength efficiency. The overall behavior of the composite system largly depends on the properties of the interface between fiber and matrix. Characterization of the fiber–matrix interface at operating temperatures is therefore essential for the developemt of these materials. The fiber fragmentation test shows good reproducibility of results in determining interface properties. This paper deals with the evaluation of fiber fragmentation characteristics in TMCs at elevated temperature and the results are compared with tests at ambient temperature. It was observed that tensile testing at 650°C of single-fiber TMCs led to limited fiber fragmentation behavior. This indicates that the load transfer from the matrix to the fiber occurs due to interfacial friction, arising predominantly from mechanical clamping of the fiber by radial compressive residual and Poisson stresses. The present work also demonstrates that composite processing conditions can significantly affect the nature of the fiber–matrix interface and the resulting fragmentation of the fiber.",

Due to a slight deviation between the spin axis and antenna-extended axis with the spin, the antenna is subjected to centrifugal body force; the centrifugal force enhances the antenna deflection. A relationship between centrifugal force and antenna deflection is derived from beam theory. As the apparent material modulus decreases with time, the deflection increases simultaneously. The time dependence of mechanical properties of the tri-axial woven CFRP is hence examined by a creep test. The time-dependent failure criterion of the antenna is then examined using a flexural durability test. Based on the beam theory and experimental results, we examine the long-term reliability of applying the tri-axial woven CFRP to extensible rigid antenna for the spinning spacecraft, especially for SCOPE mission; it is verified that the current design tolerance for the mission assures certain durability for long-term usage.",

The laminated CFRP composite structures require optimal design of the stacking sequences. Modifications to the stacking sequences change the thermal deformation that results from the CFRP laminate curing process. Even if a stacking sequence provides maximum buckling load, the laminate is unacceptable if it displays large deformations after the curing process. Therefore, this study deals with the constraint of thermal deformation after the curing process. Maximization of the buckling load was targeted as the objective function here. Three types of response surfaces were proposed to estimate the thermal deformation and their fit was investigated. The mode classification method was found to be excellent. Using the mode classification response surface, a stacking sequence optimization to maximize the buckling stress was performed. The new mode classification method was shown to be appropriate for optimization of the curing process constraints. Keywords: bucklinglaminatesthermal deformationoptimization",

It is found that fracture properties and fractographies of the composite are affected by the distribution and orientation of SiC particles. The composite is characterized by the fractographies of the composite varying with the elevation of temperature. Cracking of SiC particles is the dominant rupture mode because of the strong interface bonding with the tensile temperature below 300 °C. Debonding at SiC/Al matrix interfaces becomes the dominant rupture mode with tensile temperature above 300 °C, particles breakage reduces sharply as the tensile temperature is elevated, while tensile strength and elongation of the composite decreases rapidly as the tensile temperature increases.",

    "abstract": "The use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials in various applications such as aerospace, automotive, sport equipment, and oil and gas industries has been growing in a steady rate in recent years. The potential use of perforated FRP tubes (pipes) in oil and gas industry-related applications can become significantly greater, provided that the influence of the harsh environmental conditions specific to the industry could be tolerated by the materials used to form such tubes, with minimal degradation to system's mechanical and physical properties. Unfortunately, there is not adequate database and information in the literature in regards to the long-term response of perforated FRP tubes. The purpose of this study is therefore to investigate whether FRP could be confidently used in structural applications that are primarily subjected to compressive loading and exposed to harsh environments, without significant deterioration of their physical and mechanical properties. For that, three sets of perforated glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) pipes were fabricated and subjected to accelerated aging conditions in an acid. Subsequently, the pipes were tested to failure under an axially applied compressive load. Results showed a considerable decrease in the load carrying capacity and axial stiffness of perforated pipes having certain D/t ratios, as a result of the aging.",

As expected, the overlapped and discontinuous models had lower tensile modulus and strength than the normal model; these values were functions of the effective fiber-volume fraction. The differences were examined and used to predict the overlap-damage and discontinuous-damage parameters, which were developed from the energy method, rule of mixture and failure modes. Also, the results showed that the final failures of the overlapped and discontinuous models were either interfacial bond failure or breaking fibers depending on the overlapped and discontinuous lengths. Since discontinuous fabrics in the preform cannot be avoided in designing and manufacturing composites, the ratio of the discontinuous gap to the gauge length (L G /L) should be less than 0.05. Also, the ratio of the discontinuous length to the gauge length (L D /L) should be large to minimize the influence of the stress concentration. Also, in light of the fiber-volume fraction, composites designed with the overlapped preform are better than those with the discontinuous preform.",

To verify the effect of MWNT on the impact energy absorbing capability of composite materials, normal CFRP and MWNT-reinforced CFRP were prepared and tested by using a two-stage light gas gun that can accelerate an aluminum ball of a diameter of 5.56 mm to 1 km/s. And the applicability of MWNT against hypervelocity impact of space debris was studied. In addition, accelerated ground simulation experiments were performed for each material model to simulate the aging of composite materials to verify the effect of LEO environmental aging on impact absorbing capability of composites. For the aging experiment, the impact specimens were simultaneously exposed to high vacuum, atomic oxygen, ultra violet light, and thermal cycling. After being exposed to simulated LEO environment, high velocity impact tests were performed for each material. As a result, MWNT did not have a significant improvement on the impact energy absorbing capability of CFRP under high velocity impact, even though the quasi static material properties are improved by adding MWNT. This is caused by the early generation of fiber breakages on the impact surface before enough generation of progressive failure which is one of the impact energy absorbing mechanism. Similarly, MWNT has less effect on the impact energy absorbing capability of CFRP under LEO environment.",

In PCM, the bag is divided into several segments. During infusion, all segmented bags are pulled upward by the vacuum. Resin is easily infused into the loose preform. Once enough volume of resin is infused, the vacuum on the segmented bags is released in a step-wise manner. The atmospheric pressure is progressively applied on the segmented bags that are inflated to squeeze the surplus resin from the wetted preform through the dry preform. The flow enhancement is achieved since the dry preform remains loose during the filling process. Once the preform is fully saturated, the post-filling stage is performed for achieving the uniform thickness of the part. In the present study, seven cases is utilized to investigate the effect of three key process variables, including the number of the compression segment, initiating timing of the next segmented compression and volume of infused resin, on the complete filling process. Numerical results show that the multi-segment compression and appropriately premature initiation of the next segmented compression can reduce the filling process; whereas, the excess infused resin can significantly increase the total filling time due to the very slow post-filling stage. Compared with the traditional VI process, PCM at the optimal case reduces the filling time by 10.15% with the same resin consumption as VI.",

It is found that the amplitude of the magnetic field deformation decreases with waviness depth in a certain proportion that is independent of the waviness amplitude. Using these characteristics, the range of the waviness amplitude is obtained. The effect of waviness in multiple layers on waviness size evaluation is also investigated.

The numerical method is based on finite element analysis with the homogenization method, where crack extension is expressed using embedded cohesive elements. We first present the formulation of the numerical model and verify the model's validity by comparing the simulated crack extension with the linear fracture mechanics. Next we simulate damage extension for a composite reinforced with spherical particles. We consider the cracks in the particles and on particle–matrix interfaces. The analytical results reveal the effect of crack extension on the macroscopic material properties of the composite. The particle crack extends unstably and sharply decreases the tangent modulus of the material, irrespective of the initial flaw size. In contrast, the interfacial crack invariably grows stably and decreases the tangent modulus gradually.

For two different layups of [(0/90)12] and [(±45)2/(0/90)5]S, respectively, static tension tests were performed on two-dimensional geometrically similar unnotched and double-edge notched specimens scaled to three different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that the notched strength of the woven CFRP laminates depend on the size of specimen as well as the size of notch. The ratio of notched strength to unnotched strength decreases as the length of notch increases, regardless of the size of specimen. For a given size of notch, the notch strength ratio becomes larger with decreasing size of specimen. A notch-size effect law is derived by means of the Neuber interpolation method. A specimen-size effect is embedded into the notch sensitivity parameter involved by the notch-size effect law to establish a size effect law that can cope with these two kinds of size effect. The engineering size effect law proposed can adequately describe the specimen-size effect as well as notch-size effect on the tensile strength of the woven CFRP laminates. It is also demonstrated that the size effect law allows determining the size independent fracture toughness on the basis of notched strengths of small specimens that fail in a quasi-brittle manner.",

    "abstract": "A novel micromechanical approach is used to study the fatigue failure of unidirectional polymer matrix composites subject to off-axis loading. The main advantage of the present micromechanical model lies in its ability to give closed form solutions for the effective nonlinear response of unidirectional composites and to predict the material response to any combination of shear and normal loading. The fatigue failure criterion is expressed in terms of the fatigue failure functions of the constituent materials. The micromechanical model is also used to calculate these fatigue failure functions from the knowledge of the S–N diagrams of the composite material in longitudinal, transverse, and shear loadings; thus, eliminating the need for any further experimentation. Unlike previous works, the present study accounts for the viscoelasticity of the matrix material rendering it the capability of modeling creep damage accumulation in high-temperature composite materials. The results are found to be in good agreement with the literature. In particular, for higher off-axis angles, the results are seen to be in better concurrence with the experimental data compared to when the effect of viscoelasticity is overlooked. The present approach is also capable of accounting for the strain evolution due to viscoelasticity of the matrix material.",

In this study, the design and fabrication method of an actuator with a piezoelectric single-crystal layer were investigated to increase the actuation strain and displacement.

A simple method of finding damage around fastener holes is thus required for CFRP structures. This study applies self-sensing time-domain reflectometry to detect bearing failure around fastener holes of CFRP structures. In a previous paper, the effect of fasteners was minimized when the micro-strip line (MSL) was placed apart from the fasteners. This study numerically and experimentally investigates the peeling of glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) insulator. A bearing failure results in embossing at the edge of a fastener hole. The embossing produces a wedge that causes the peeling of GFRP, generating a gap between the GFRP and CFRP. The gap strongly affects the characteristic impedance of the MSL.",

The scan images were then converted to three-dimensional volumetric entity through image processing, from which finite element mesh was generated with the detected defects directly incorporated. Next, three-dimensional progressive failure analysis was performed for the finite element model of the L-shaped laminate composite simulating four-point bending test condition with delamination and matrix failure in 90 degree plies accounted for by using cohesive zone modelling. The predicted maximum load was well matched to that obtained by tests validating the analysis modeling. Then a series of parametric studies were performed to investigate the effect of defect size and location on the failure load and delamination propagation pattern. It was found that the maximum load reduction was the largest when the pre-defect was located at the center of the symmetrical portion of the L-beam. In addition, the maximum load and delamination development behavior varied significantly depending on the interlayer and in-plane position of the pre-defect.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFor continuous carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (cCFRP), in the case of loading in the longitudinal direction, occurrence of kink band failure causes compression strength to be lower than the tensile strength. Furthermore, 3D-printed cCFRP may exhibit intrinsic compressive behavior depending on the printing orientation. In this study, two types of rectangular specimens were fabricated using the Markforged Mark Two > 3D printer. The first was the in-plane specimen, whose width direction was parallel to the print bed and thickness direction was along the layup direction. The second was the out-of-plane specimen, whose width direction was the layup direction and thickness direction was parallel to the print bed. Compression tests were performed, and the experimental results were compared. As a result, the compressive strengths of both types were similar, and the kink bands always grew in the lay-up direction. For the out-of-plane specimens, nonlinear stress–strain curves were observed. This may be due to the delamination crack growth caused by the low strength in the lay-up direction and the existence of initial defects. This study experimentally investigated the effect of two different printing orientations of 3D printed cCFRP to its strength and failure mode, and this work shows the importance of considering structural deformation due to compression loading in 3D printed cCFRP.Keywords: 3D printercomposite materialsprinting orientationCFRPcompression testkink band AcknowledgmentI express my deepest gratitude to them.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationFundingThe work was supported by the Tokyo Institute of Technology [1102202000000000101baeaem2002116].",

In the present study, a predictive method is developed for transverse cracking in CFRP cross-ply laminates with interlaminar resin layers at 0/90° interfaces under static tensile loading. The analysis is based on a two-dimensional approximate elastic analysis considering the interlaminar resin layers and thermal residual stresses. To predict transverse cracking, both energy and stress criteria are used. The change in thermoelastic properties of a laminate due to transverse cracking is also predicted. To investigate the validity of the analysis, loading-unloading tests are performed to obtain Young's modulus reduction as a function of the transverse crack density. The predictions of transverse crack density as a function of the laminate strain are compared with our previous experimental results. A good agreement is obtained which implies the validity of the present analysis.",

Two types of laminates were made from surfacetreated or surface-non-treated carbon fiber, and a common epoxy matrix. Tests were carried out using end notched flexure (ENF) specimens. Stabilized mode II static tests showed that the fracture toughness of the surface-treated CFRP was 30% higher than that of non-treated CFRP. Fatigue crack growth resistance of the surface-treated CFRP was higher than that of non-treated CFRP at higher crack growth rate. However, the effect of fiber surface treatment was negligible near the threshold region. At higher growth rate, interfacial fracture occurred prior to the matrix fracture near the crack tip for the non-treated CFRP. Then, the fracture mechanism was controlled by the interfacial fracture. On the other hand, the resin fracture with plastic deformation occurred prior to the interfacial fracture near the crack tip for the surface-treated CFRP. Then, the fracture mechanism was controlled by the resin fracture. Near the threshold region, the ratio of the resin fracture was rather large without respect to the fiber-surface treatment. The main fracture mechanisms near the threshold region were only controlled by the matrix resin. This fact was well correlated to the fact that the threshold value was insensitive to the fiber-surface treatment.",

No significant adverse effects were found on the modulus or ultimate tensile strength. The modification of epoxy causes precipitation and separation of discrete rubber particles during curing of the epoxy which also enhances the interlaminar toughness and impact tolerance.",

Results suggested that defects in the laminae, such as transverse cracks, have no effects on the tensile strength of the C/C composites.

As one of the factors in the bundle, the effect of bonding strength of fiber/matrix interface was examined by using the fiber bundles with different surface treatments. In addition to surface oxidized and non-oxidized fiber bundles, an attempt was made to form porous carbon coating layers around the fibers to reduce the bonding strength intentionally. Results suggested that the bonding strength of the fiber/matrix interface, which was evaluated by bundle pushout tests, have significant effect on the tensile strength of C/C composites.

In previous studies, the authors confirmed the damage growth suppression of CFRP laminates with embedded pre-strained shape memory alloy (SMA) foils through both coupon testing and structural element testing. Through detailed observation of the damage behavior, we determined that these effects occurred due to the suppression of the strain energy release rate based on the suppression of the crack opening displacement caused by the recovery stress of SMA foils. These results were verified in this study using a demonstrator test article, which was a 1/3-scaled model of a commercial airliner's fuselage structure (B737 class). To demonstrate the damage growth suppression, the lower panel, which was dominated by tension load, was selected as the evaluation area. The evaluation area was an integrated panel including both the 'smart area' (CFRP laminate with embedded pre-strained SMA foils), and the 'conventional area' (standard CFRP laminate), for direct comparison of the damage behavior. The demonstration was conducted at 80°C in the smart area, and room temperature (RT) in the conventional area using a quasi-static load-unload test method. The demonstrator test article identified that the damage onset strain in the smart area was improved by 30% over that in the conventional area.

    "abstract": "Abstract Phenolic resin has the excellent properties of fire resistance, low smoke production during burning, and a good balance between its cost and mechanical properties compared with other types of resin used in fire-resistant polymers (FRPs). If phenolic resin can be employed as a matrix of FRP, such FRP can have a higher fire safety factor which will be a desirable property in the structures of vessels and railway carriages. However, for the case of the resole type of phenolic resin, water formed from the condensation reaction remains in the matrix, and this water evaporates resulting in the formation of voids during the curing process. In order to develop a new type of phenolic composite that can overcome this weakness, we used a foam type of phenolic resin and glass fibers as the matrix and the reinforcement, respectively. We, then, developed a new pultrusion technique for the new phenolic foam composite and examined its mechanical properties and thermal conductivity.In this paper, we report a new technique to mold not only a phenolic foam composite but also a sandwich beam in which the phenolic foam composite as a core and a thin phenolic FRP layer as a faceplate are used. We also investigated the compressive strength and elastic modulus under high temperatures and compared the result with that at room temperature. Finally, we show that the compressive properties of the phenolic foam composite and the sandwich beam are stable at higher temperatures.

    "abstract": "Winding tension is a very critical parameter to be controlled during the manufacturing of composite parts by robotized filament winding technology. In fact, the winding tension influences directly the defects and the mechanical properties of composite parts.The nominal value of the winding tension that has been set in order to obtain a good roving alignment and compactness inside the composite part is not equal to the actual value acting on roving during the winding. The difference between the nominal and actual value of the winding tension is due both to the typology of the winding trajectory that has been set and to the agents that are external to the technological process and consequently hardly controllable. Therefore, once the value of the nominal winding tension has been set and the geometry of the part to be wound has been fixed, it is necessary to act on the geometric parameters of the winding trajectory in order to guarantee that tension acting on the roving during the winding is as near as possible to the nominal value. The present work shows how using a unique parameter, the actual trajectory angle characterizing the planned winding trajectory, it is possible to estimate quickly and easily the average value of the tension acting on the roving once the nominal winding tension and the geometry of the part to be wound have been chosen. In this way it is possible to decide which winding trajectory typology is prefereable in order to manufacture a composite part of good quality.",

The flow of molten metal is a moving boundary phenomenon which is similar to a fluid flowing through a porous medium. A numerical technique, body-fitted finite element method (FEM), is used to generate grids inside the physical domain and to calculate the distribution of pressure and other relative properties.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives of the work are to use optical microscopy to identify matrix cracks that lead to delamination in cross-ply glass-fibre-reinforced polymers (GFRP) under transverse loading and to provide evidence on the associated damage evolvement procedure. Sequence of the damage evolvement was established by examining a series of identical specimens that had been subjected to different levels of loading. The results were found to be consistent with those reported in the literature, that the transverse loading generated both bending and shear cracks in the matrix, and that it was the shear cracks that initiate the delamination. What was revealed in the current study is that delamination in the bottom half of the cross section, i.e. away from the contact surface, developed first, from shear cracks in regions of mid-thickness. Only after the load was further increased was delamination in the top half of the cross-section developed, from cracks generated by stress concentration around the contact area. The study also showed that the matrix shear cracking can 'cut through' the fibre bundle in the lamina of the central region, for further growth of the shear cracks or development of delamination towards the back surface. On some occasions, growth of the shear cracks appears to be continuous under the microscopic observation, not interrupted by the cross-ply fibre lay-up.

The effect of pH on the hydrogen gas permeability (H2GP) values of the different MGO-based films was investigated to determine the optimum pH value of the MGO solution for the preparation of PDDA/MGO-based LBL assembly. Accordingly, the different numbers of bilayers based LBL-assembled films were prepared using alternate deposition of PDDA and MGO solutions and the H2GP values were measured for those assemblies. The films were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, and Raman spectroscopy analyses. The morphology of the LBL-assembled film was observed by cross-sectional field emission scanning electron microscopy which confirms densely packed layered structure. The H2GP of six bilayers PDDA/MGO composite film is 5.7 cc/m2⋅d⋅atm, which is much lower than that of pure PET substrate (170.7 cc/m2⋅d⋅atm), indicating 96.7% decrease in H2GP.

The presence of vascular conductive pathways was not found to hinder the structural integrity of the composites. The use of such conductive pathways for in situ strain monitoring of composites was investigated.

Differences in the adhesive used to affix the repair patch to the base plate have little effect on the erosion resistance of repaired areas, but deteriorations in adhesion between the repair patch and base plate result in degraded erosion resistance in the repaired area. With regard to the mechanism by which post-repair erosion resistance characteristics changed, our tests revealed that adhesive irregularities between the repair patch and base plate allowed impact energy from particle collisions to cause the repair patch to vibrate, and the resulting fatigue breakdown caused resin and fiber fragments to more readily separate, accelerating erosion.",

In this study, effects of strain rate on the mechanical properties of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and tricalcium phosphate/Poly(L-lactic acid) (TCP/PLLA) composites specimens were investigated experimentally. The TCP/PLLA composites containing three different TCP contents (5, 10 and 15 wt.%) were prepared by injection molding. The fabricated specimens were then immersed in the simulated body environment, such as phosphate buffered solution (pH = 7.4), to investigate effects of hydrolysis on the mechanical properties. In order to characterize the mechanical properties, compressive tests were performed at the strain rates ranging from 10−3 to 10−1/s. Initial molecular weights (M w) of non-annealing PLLA and TCP/PLLA composites were approximately 173,000 and 154,000. After 24 weeks immersion, M w of 15 wt.% decreased to 91,000. In the results of these tests, TCP/PLLA composites showed that their Young's modulus has no dependence on the strain rate and their compressive strength increased with increasing strain rates. After 16 weeks immersion, compressive strength of 15 wt.% composites decreased slightly at a strain rate of 10−1/s. After 24 weeks immersion, compressive strength of 5, 10, and 15 wt.% composites decreased.",

Y2Si2O7 whisker can effectively decrease the thermal expansion coefficient of MoSi2 and prevent coatings from cracking, which results in improved oxidation resistant performance of the coated composites.

In this study, long-term thermo-oxidative aging test was conducted to examine the effect of high pressure atmospheric environment on the weight and mechanical properties of CFRP to accelerate the rate of thermo-oxidative degradation. The effect of thermo-oxidative environment under high atmospheric pressure on the change in weight, strength, and shrinkage behavior of a CFRP with polycyanate (FSD-M-08178) was investigated. The aging test was conducted at 180 °C up to 8,000 h under atmospheric pressure and the test result was used as a reference data. Other aging tests were also conducted under elevated pressure conditions (0.3 and 0.5 MPa) at the same exposure temperature up to 2,000 h and the test results were treated as the accelerated aging test data. Unidirectional laminates [0]8 and [90]8 for tensile specimens and angle ply laminates [±45]2S for off-axis tensile specimens were aged in oven, and then mechanical tests were carried out on them. The results indicated that elevated pressure would cause faster and larger weight gain in earlier aging period. The outcomes of these experiments were changes in weight, strength, and local shrinkage deformation were changed quickly under elevated atmospheric pressure environment. Same micro damage onset and extension irrespective of pressure during thermo-oxidative aging and subsequent loading test were observed. The test results indicate that the change in weight, strength, and local shrinkage deformation could be accelerated by elevated pressure without change in thermo-oxidative degradation mechanism. Therefore, the elevated pressure testing would be a better method to accelerate thermo-oxidative degradation. On the other hand, the change in strength under elevated pressure conditions is faster than local shrinkage deformation. Equivalent acceleration rate of degradation could not be obtained.",

Consequently, a parametric study of the skin laminates used in the blade composite layup, is conducted to explore and identify the possible design improvements.

The coupling of in-plane and twisting stiffnesses in general laminates is made use of to design the turbine blade. The optimized blade will have minimal twisting curvature, reduced twisting vibrations of the blade and consequent less turbulence in the working fluid. A simplified design method is developed to determine the optimum combination of layer materials, layer orientations, layer thicknesses and laminate configuration. With the assumption of the turbine blade as a flat plate for the purpose of analysis, the use of the genetic algorithm is illustrated with examples of blades of 12, 24 and 36 layered composites. The discreteness of the search space makes GAs particularly suitable to use in this problem. Keywords: Optimal designcomposite turbine bladegenetic algorithms (GAs)laminate configuration",

To utilize CFCCs designers need reliable and comprehensive data bases (and the design codes that contain them). Generating reproducible information for these data bases requires standards. Presently, there are relatively few (compared to metals) national (e.g. ASTM, CEN, JIS, etc.) or international standards (e.g. ISO) for testing CFCCs. In this paper, the various standards for CFCCs are reviewed and additional areas requiring normalization are discussed (e.g. mechanical, thermal, electrical, electro-magnetic, optical, and biological testing). 'Design codes' such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code discussed here, are widely accepted, general rules for the construction of components or systems (for performance, efficiency, usability, or manufacturabilty) with emphasis on safety. Wide-ranging codes incorporate figurative links between materials, general design, fabrication techniques, inspection, testing, certification, and finally quality control to insure that the code has been followed. Implicit in design codes are many of the standards for materials testing, characterization, and quality control. Logical outcomes of design codes are data bases of material properties and performance 'qualified' for inclusion in the code. As discussed in this paper, data bases (such as those contained in the Mil-Hdbk-17 CMC effort) may be in print, electronic or worldwide web-based formats and may include primary summary data (e.g. mean, standard deviation, and number of tests) along with secondary data (e.g. graphical information such as stress-strain curves).",

The results showed that if dynamic interlaminar fracture toughness is estimated on the basis of load data obtained from a strain gage signal measured on the falling dart, the dynamic toughness could be overestimated, resulting in an erroneous understanding of the experimental results.

The initiation and propagation history of the damage has been recorded at few microsecond intervals using a high speed Cranz-Schardin camera. The images obtained are analyzed using IDRISI, an image processing tool. Three different fiber volume fractions, 2.4, 5.3 and 33.0 percent are considered. The influence of notch orientation are studied by varying the initial notch orientation between 0° and 45°. On the basis of the studies, it is observed that irrespective of initial notch orientation, the damage propagates in a direction perpendicular to the loading direction. For low fiber volume fractions, the damage is in the form of matrix cracking and interface debonding while delamination dominates for specimens with high fiber volume fractions. The damage velocity in low fiber volume fraction specimens are found to be higher than the terminal velocity of the crack in unreinforced polyester resin. Fractographic studies are also carried out and the results are presented.",

The cone vertex angle and the cylindrical part height were 15 degrees and 10 mm, respectively. Load–displacement curves and deformation histories of typical specimens are presented and discussed. The experimental data are correlated with predictions from finite element model. Numerical results show that for curved systems under lateral load, local stress has been concentrated at the junctions between the cylinder and cones as well as the edge of the systems, while for the curved systems under axial load, the stress concentration is slightly clear at the loaded end of the curved systems. Experimental results show that the axial loaded curved systems are crushed into a progressive failure mode and exhibit high-energy absorption capability. Results also show that the debonding at the fibre–matrix interface is influenced by the load–displacement relationship for the lateral loaded curved systems. On the other hand, the fragmentation failure mode is dominated by the load–displacement relationship for the axial loaded curved systems.",

The analytical prediction of the relation between laminate stress and strain is compared with the experimental results. The analytical prediction slightly underestimates the laminate stress because the strain increment associated with transverse crack opening displacement is overestimated in this analysis.

Strengthening and rehabilitating these concrete structures by externally bonding carbon laminates is one of many economical engineering solutions. Eight rectangular beams with varying internal steel reinforcement were retrofitted with CFRP strips on the tension faces and tested under four-point bending. The beams were instrumented to monitor strains, deflection, and curvature over the entire spectrum of loading, and determine the structural response of the beams. An existing analytical model using the discrete yield and ultimate values of the load-deflection and moment-curvature curves was modified to an energy-based model, and used to predict the ductility of the beams. Numerical results indicated an increase in strength, a decrease in ductility, and validated the analytical model.

The simulation model comprises fiber, matrix and interface elements; thereby, fiber breaks, matrix fractures and interfacial debondings during loading can be predicted individually. Tensile fracture processes and strengths of a boron/epoxy composite were simulated at various IFSSs. Results show that as IFSS decreases, stress concentration factors to intact fibers adjacent to a broken fiber element decrease because of occurrences of interfacial debonding. However, since interfacial debonding also reduces load carrying capacity in broken fibers, composite strength is reduced in all fiber volume fractions. On the other hand, a large IFSS causes many matrix fractures at once; therefore, it induces low composite strength. Thus, intermediate IFSSs increase tensile strength of the composite. This means that there must be an 'optimum' IFSS which induces the highest tensile strength of the composite. The optimum value shifts to a low value as fiber volume fraction increases. This occurs because the matrix around broken fiber elements becomes more apt to be broken easily in shear at a higher fiber volume fraction, therefore enhancing normal stress on intact fibers.",

For coupon specimens of various cross-ply stacking sequences, quasi-static tensile tests were carried out and transverse cracks were observed. The experimental results showed that the measured fiber bundle strength of 0° ply was almost constant, which indicated that transverse cracks had little influence on the notch sensibility of the bundle strength. Then, we proposed a new numerical model based on the finite element method to investigate the damage extension to the fracture. This model considered the elastoplastic behavior of epoxy matrix and the fiber breakages. Using this model, we applied a Monte-Carlo method to the damage extension simulation. It was found that the plastic region at the tip of the transverse crack reduced the stress concentration due to the crack, and that the bundle strength was barely affected by transverse cracks.

When the pre-strained SMA foil is heated, the shape memory effect produces appropriate recovery compressive stress in the direction to suppress transverse cracks. However, Ti-Ni SMA foil has these specific characteristics due to the existence of a rhombohedral phase (R-phase). Thus, in this research, in order to use this SMA foil as an actuator, an extended Brinson model was proposed to clarify complicated behaviors of SMA. Then, for the determination of the parameters in the constitutive equation in this model, experimental tests were performed for the SMA foils. Using this model, several simulations were conducted and compared with experimental results. The agreement indicated that this model could express the thermo-mechanical behavior of the Ti-Ni SMA foil adequately. Finally, the behavior of the SMA foil during the CFRP manufacturing process was calculated on the basis of this model. The calculation results proved that the recovery stress already existed after the manufacturing process and the embedment of 4% pre-strained SMA into CFRP cross-ply laminate had the effect of suppressing the occurrence of transverse cracks.",

No damage was observed in the specimen with heat-resistant resin, while three hundred AE counts were detected in the specimen with conventional resin, in which many matrix cracks were observed from the small temperature differences in the wall. AE signals were classified into three fractures types, namely, delaminations and matrix and transverse cracks, by waveform characterization. Here, the three AE signal types were simulated by adiabatic thermal expansion with a pulse laser. The numbers of all three types of AE signals linearly increased with time. AEs from the matrix cracks were more frequent than those from delaminations and transverse cracks.Vertical immersion testing of the CFRP plate into liquefied nitrogen revealed only matrix cracks on the specimen surface at temperatures higher than 228 K. At 213 K, a large number of AE signals due to matrix cracks but few signals due to delaminations and transverse cracks were observed. At 77 K, a large number of AE signals due to the three types of fractures were observed. Keywords: CFRPACOUSTIC EMISSIONCRYOGENIC THERMAL SHOCKFRACTURE MODESSIGNAL CLASSIFICATIONPULSE YAG-LASER",

At the same time, the power ratings of wind turbine blades have also increased continuously. As wind turbine blade sizes increase, blade weights need to be reduced to mitigate the structural loads on those blades. Recently, researchers at General Electric Co. proposed a new wind turbine blade concept, which is called fabric-covered. The design is composed of metal or composite spars, ribs, and covering fabrics that work to decrease the blade's overall weight. The present study investigates the structural designs of fabric-covered wind turbine blades and their feasibility by analyzing static and buckling conditions based on two extreme design load cases. Three types of blade structures are proposed to compare blade weight reduction rates and stiffness. The structural properties of the blade sections calculated via VABS are compared with those of the reference model, i.e. the NREL-5MW wind turbine blade. The analytic results show that the proposed fabric-covered blade structure equipped with a rear spar in this study is able to reduce the weight of the reference blade over 36%, satisfying the structural requirements.",

Compression tests on the unreinforced cores have shown that the strength decreased steadily with increasing temperature, passing from 4.8 MPa at room temperature to 3.8 MPa at 140 °C. Similarly, the specific energy absorption (SEA) of the plain core samples decreased slightly from 22.3 to 18.9 kJ/kg over this range of temperatures.

Thus, we proposed the manufacture of moldable block-type bone-graft materials from nano-sized hydroxyapatite(HAp)-sol and methylcellulose (MC), which is widely used as a thickener. Composites of various HAp-sol and MC concentrations were fabricated and their viscosity was measured. The composites were freeze-dried to fabricate blocks, and their microstructure was studied. pH and cell viability tests were conducted to verify that the biological stability of the bone-grafting materials was not impaired by the MC. A tooth-injection test was conducted in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution over three months; this demonstrated that the composite bone-graft materials were activated in the SBF solution.",

Mechanical properties of a woven SRPP composite were characterised. Constitutive equations were derived as functions of strains using a homogenised orthotropic material model. Specimens with novel geometries, different aspect ratios and fibre orientations were stretch formed in a custom-built press until catastrophic failure. Evolution of principal strains was captured using a real time Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system. A path-dependant failure criterion was developed as a function of deformation modes and invariants of strain tensor. Material and failure models were implemented into a finite element analysis using Abaqus/implicit. Strain path at the pole of specimens, evolution of surface strains, and onset of failure were predicted using a homogenised numerical scheme. Comparison with experimental outcomes demonstrated the high accuracy of the proposed numerical model in predicting deformation and failure behaviours of a thermoplastic composite under a wide range of deformation modes. The model demonstrates the potential to predict formability and failure behaviour of woven self-reinforced thermoplastic composites during manufacturing by eliminating the need to conduct expensive, time consuming trial and error procedures.",

In this study, a technique based on resonant ultrasound spectroscopy is proposed that can identify the viscoelastic moduli of CFRP by measuring the resonant frequencies. The resonant frequencies of a CFRP specimen were measured by employing an experimental device comprising a pair of piezoelectric transducers and the spectrum analyzer software. The viscoelastic moduli were thereby identified by applying genetic algorithms. Considering the viscoelastic properties, it is possible to conduct highly accurate analysis as compared to the case in which the viscoelastic properties are not considered. Furthermore, by measuring the resonance modes that are significantly affected by the three independent viscoelastic moduli (EL, ET, GLT), each modulus can be identified with constant precision.",

    "abstract": "In many experimental studies, it has been proved that unreinforced masonry (URM) brick walls have high strength against lateral forces acting in plane. However, out-of-plane strength of URM brick walls against lateral forces has found to be quite low. According to the experiences that were obtained from the major earthquakes, the low out-of-plane performance of URM brick walls resulted in excessive loss of human lives during an earthquake, hence the strengthening of URM brick walls with CFRP strips has been appeared to be a very important subject. However, very limited literature has been found. Especially, the data obtained from experimental studies must be increased for the true understanding of the behavior of strengthened brick walls under out-of-plane lateral forces. However, in most cases, this procedure required large number of expensive experiments. At this stage, numerical analysis can be an appropriate choice, thus in this paper a finite element model is presented for modeling URM brick walls that are strengthened with CFRP strips. The numerical results are compared with the experimental ones and consistent results are obtained from the finite element model. General purpose finite element analysis software ANSYS is used throughout this study. Contact elements are used along the masonry wall–CFRP strip interfaces for the investigation of the stress distribution and load – strain behavior.",

The effect of different process parameters (laser power, scanning rate) on the micro-topography, composition and micro-hardness of the sintered area is studied by means of scanning electron telescope, X-ray diffractometer and micro-hardness tester. At a laser power of 900 W and a scanning rate of 0.7 m/min, the test shows good laser sintering performance and high sintered density. Meanwhile, it indicates that WC particles are molten into dendritic crystals and evenly dispersed in the matrix, and that the reinforced particles are arrested by the solid–liquid interface. The fact that WC particles are well dispersed in the matrix improves the performance of the bulk sintering. According to the test, we have obtained a set of optimal process parameters in production of sintered metal bulks, high in hardness and compact in construction.

The oxidation behaviors of C/Mullite/Si–C–N were investigated in air by comparison with that of C/PyC/Si–C–N using thermogravimetry and SEM technique. The results indicate that the weight loss of the C/Mullite/Si–C–N increases with the increase of the temperature below 800°C, decreases in the range of 800–1000°C, and increases again above 1000°C. The increase of the weight loss below 800°C results from the increase of the oxidation temperature. The closure of the matrix microcracks at 800–1000°C leads to the decrease of the weight loss, and the reopening of microcracks results in the increase above 1000°C. The oxidation resistance of C/Mullite/Si–C–N was improved greatly as compared to C/PyC/Si–C–N within the temperature range from 600°C to 1200°C. The mullite interphase changes the oxidation mode of C/Si–C–N and leads to the non-uniform oxidation of carbon fibers in the composite. At 600°C, the oxidation curve of C/Mullite/Si–C–N shows obvious non-linearity, which mainly results from the non-uniform oxidation of carbon fibers.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-light composites are produced through the spread tow technology. The success of spread tow fabrics lies in their unique woven structure. By interlacing widespread thin flat tapes, instead of regular (and thicker) yarns, more straight fibers and thinner plies are obtained which leads to improvements in the mechanical performance in terms of both stiffness and strength. The available numerical studies on spread tow fabric composites are based on the approximation to equivalent thin ply laminates, where the key observations are dedicated to a delayed or suppressed microcracking. This paper helps to investigate the limitations of considering thin-ply spread tow composites as equivalent laminates, as well as to bring more understanding on how the tow thickness affect the sequence of failure mechanisms. As an aid to these investigations, a parameterized mesoscale model has been developed that preserves the complex geometry of the woven structure and can analyze the tow thickness effect down to 35 µm. By applying shifted periodic boundary conditions through the thickness, the effect of periodic layer shifting is also analyzed without having to discretize and model more than one layer of the composite.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we successfully synthesized a series of CuCr0.85Mg(0.15-x)ZnxO2 (x = 0.00 − 0.05) delafossite materials with different Zn concentrations and investigated their thermoelectric properties. Delafossite materials are promising for thermoelectric applications due to their low thermal conductivity and high Seebeck coefficient. We observed that Zn doping significantly affects the structural properties and thermal conductivity of delafossite materials. Zn atoms can substitute for Cr and Cu atoms in the delafossite structure, leading to carrier concentration and mobility changes. We found that the optimal Zn concentration for enhancing the thermoelectric performance is x = 0.0125 − 0.025, which reduces the thermal conductivity from 5.6 to 4.7 W/mK without significantly compromising the electrical conductivity, improving the fi g ure of merit (ZT). The enhancement of ZT at x = 0.0125 is attributed to a high power factor of 220 μW/mK2 resulting from an electrical conductivity of 14.5 S/cm and a Seebeck coefficient of 390 μV/K. This indicates that Zn doping can effectively scatter phonons and improve the ZT of the delafossite materials.",

    "abstract": "CFRP is characterized by its anisotropic properties. Therefore, further structural weight reduction might be achieved by introducing the fiber direction as a design variable. For this study, steering fiber laminates defined by a Bezier curve are applied to a skin panel of CFRP stiffened panels. Then, simultaneous optimization of the fiber paths and stringer dimensions is performed to minimize the panel weight. We propose a new surrogate model that combines two neural networks and Latin hypercube sampling. Stiffness, manufacturability, and buckling load are introduced as constraints. Also, optimization is performed using the surrogate model and a genetic algorithm (GA). Furthermore, the stringer dimensions and fiber directions are optimized for straight fiber laminates. Comparison of steering fiber laminates and straight fiber laminates demonstrated that the introduction of steering layup into skin plates can reduce the stringer weight by up to 25.6%. An effective method for designing the geometric dimensions and layup path is provided.",

Electrically triggered SMP has become an important branch of shape memory materials because of its advantages such as remote heating, fast response and local control. In this paper, a novel shape memory composite structure is prepared by using polylactic acid (PLA) as substrate and short carbon fiber (SCF) as conductive filler. The electrification treatment during the preparation process has a beneficial effect on the SCF arrangement. Compared with the sample without electrification treatment, the highest conductivity can be increased from 43.96 S/m to 66.67 S/m, and the performance is improved by 51.66 %. When the voltage is increased from 3 V to 8 V, the time to reach the glass transition temperature (Tg) is reduced by 62.22 %, and the shape memory recovery time is reduced by 53.68 %. The intelligent fixture based on the composite structure can realize the remote grasp of 3D printed balls with a diameter of 40 mm and a weight of 18.35 g under pressure, which fully proves the reliable electrically triggered shape memory performance of the composite structure and the great application potential in the field of robot gripper.",

In addition, a stacking-sequence optimization method was developed, which was built upon the damage tolerance design. A no-growth approach, damage categorization, and residual strength requirements were proposed for the damage-tolerance design method for high-pressure hydrogen vessels, which were implemented in the damage-tolerance design method for composite aircrafts. The initial burst pressure was set at 180% of normal working pressure (NWP) assuming that the structural health monitoring (SHM) system with acoustic emission (AE) testing would immediately detect the occurrence of fiber failure. Stacking-sequence optimization was then conducted to minimize vessel thickness and meet the residual strength requirements. As a result of the optimization, the calculations confirmed that the vessel thickness could be reduced by approximately 52% of the existing vessel stacking sequence. The results show that the thickness of the vessel can be reduced by introducing a damage-tolerant design. Moreover, the proposed method for an optimal design based on the damage-tolerance design method is effective.",

In this work, a low-cost multiscale model based on the Self-consistent Clustering Analysis (SCA) method is developed to predict the matrix failure process of the composite storage tanks. First, a reduced order model modeling method with fiber/matrix interfaces is proposed. Then, in conjunction with Progressive Failure Analysis (PFA), a reduced-order model is used to predict matrix failure and interface failure of the composites, mesh sensitivity analyses were carried out, and strength damage envelopes were obtained for unidirectional composites subjected to a combination of transverse stresses and in-plane shear. Compared with the prediction results of the Puck criterion, the errors in predicting damage strength for compressive-shear load and tensile-shear load do not exceed 10% and 30%, respectively. And finally, the thermal-mechanical load analysis of the composite storage tanks is carried out and the effect of homogenous temperature field and heterogenous temperature field on the load-bearing performance of the composite structure is analyzed. The method is proved to have good accuracy and to be very efficient. Its main feature is the ability to rapidly predict the stiffness and strength properties of composite structures under different environmental conditions, in agreement with experimental results, showing the potential to reduce the time and cost required for structural design.",

    "abstract": "As a naturally occurring mineral component of bone, hydroxyapatite (HA) is a preferred bone-repair material in clinical medicine. This adaptable biomaterial is developed from synthetic or biological sources. The goal of this study was to investigate the physicochemical and biological properties of scaffolds made from diverse hydroxyapatite sources. We prepared hydroxyapatite powders either from naturally occurring sources, using decellularized bone extracellular matrix (DBECM) and deproteinized bovine bone (DBB), or in the laboratory using the co-precipitation method. Although XRD analysis confirmed the pure phase of HA in all three powders, XRF data found some other trace elements in bone-derived biomaterials, such as magnesium and strontium. Further, FTIR spectra showed DBECM-associated macromolecule peaks. In the second phase of this study, the particles were mixed with sodium alginate to produce bioink for 3D printing via extrusion. SEM photographs of the printed scaffolds showed a grid-like porous structure with large, interconnected pores. Although all of the scaffolds retained their structural integrity after 28 days submerged in the culture medium, DBECM-based scaffolds degraded the most. The test of Young's modulus and compressive strength of scaffolds revealed that all scaffolds are strong enough to be employed in non-weight-bearing applications. The biological characteristics of the scaffolds were then evaluated via cytotoxicity analysis, SEM examination of cell attachment, MTT assay, ALP activity assessment, immunofluorescence staining, and Alizarin red staining. The results indicated that all three scaffolds provided a surface that promoted adhesion and proliferation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs), as well as stimulated the production of mineralized extracellular matrices. Additionally, our findings showed that scaffolds made from DBECM powders offer the best environment for cell activity. This is most likely due to the presence of trace elements and protein macromolecules in DBECM powders that are not found in DBB and synthetic HA. In conclusion, our comparative study revealed that while all three scaffolds are suitable for bone tissue engineering, DBECM-based scaffolds outperform DBB and synthetic HA.",

Strontium-doped hydroxyapatite (SrHAp) was prepared with varying dopant concentrations (1%, 3%, and 5% Sr) on the calcium site of HAp. The materials were analyzed by XRD, FTIR and SEM/EDX techniques.

Since the internal structure of CFRP is very complex, it is very difficult to define failure criteria when external loads are applied. Various methods have been proposed to evaluate the interfacial shear strength between carbon fiber and resin matrix, such as microbond test, rupture test, and pull-out test, but currently no effective method has been proposed to evaluate the tensile strength of the CF/resin interface. In this study, we applied the pulsed laser spallation method, which has been confirmed to be effective for evaluating the adhesion strength of thin films and coating films on substrates, to the evaluation of CFRP. A finite element method based on the Laplace transform was used for the numerical analysis of the unsteady elastodynamic problem. The macroscopic stresses generated by ultrasonic waves excited by pulsed laser irradiation were calculated by inverse analysis using a transfer function with the displacement history of the back surface of the CFRP specimen as supplementary information. Microscopic stresses at the fiber/resin interface were evaluated by the homogenization method, taking into account the effects of fiber arrangement, distance between fibers, and molding residual stress in unidirectionally reinforced CFRP laminates. As a result, this series of investigations revealed that the vertical interfacial stress is dominant with respect to the strength of the fiber/resin interface with the strength of about 54MPa.",

Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or MWCNTs in polyurea-formaldehyde (PUF) shells, this research advances microcapsule technology by exploring MWCNT reinforcement in M-U-F shells. We employed a dual experimental-numerical approach, combining the precision of micro-compression tests with the predictive capabilities of finite element analysis (FEA) to determine the elastic modulus of MWCNT-reinforced M-U-F microcapsules. This method offers new insights into the mechanical behavior of these microcapsules. Our findings indicate an 8.8% increase in fracture load and a 14.6% reduction in fracture displacement for MWCNT-reinforced microcapsules compared to conventional M-U-F microcapsules. Additionally, FEA confirmed the results of the micro-compression tests, showing that MWCNT-reinforced microcapsules had the best correlation with an elastic modulus of 4.00 GPa. Conventional M-U-F microcapsules corresponded to an elastic modulus of 2.25 GPa. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of how nano-reinforcement influences the structural properties of thin-walled microcapsules, with potential applications in composite damage repair and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Polylactic acid, a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from renewable sources, has notable environmental advantages and versatile properties. However, recycled PLA often experiences reduced mechanical strength and altered chemical composition due to the recycling process, limiting its suitability for 3D printing filament applications. Recognizing the inherent limitations of recycled PLA (rPLA), this research employs a unique method of coating rPLA with dopamine (DA) and reinforcing it with kenaf fibers (KF) at various weight fractions, introducing a novel multiscale modeling approach to address the challenges of interfacial bonding and tensile performance in recycled polymers. The methodology integrates experimental single filament tensile testing with multiscale finite element modeling to accurately predict the composite's mechanical behavior across different scales. The findings reveal that a 5% kenaf fiber weight/volume fraction provides the optimal balance between tensile strength, stiffness, and toughness, achieving a significant 49.3% improvement over the unreinforced rPLA. However, increasing the kenaf fiber content beyond 5% leads to a decline in mechanical properties, attributed to higher fiber agglomeration and suboptimal fiber-matrix interactions. The novelty of this research lies in its combined use of PDA coating, natural kenaf fiber reinforcement, and advanced multiscale modeling to enhance and predict the performance of rPLA-PDA/kenaf composites, paving the way for sustainable, high-performance materials in 3D printing applications.",

First stage of the study involves the identification of the optimized fiber stacking pattern. Later, nanocomposites were made for further enhancement of tensile properties by infusing titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles to hybrid FRP composite 'C2G3C3G3C2' with optimized stacking pattern. The TiO2 nanoparticles are equally disseminated in the epoxy resin using ultrasonication with five different wt. % of 0, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, and 5. The peak load, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), tensile modulus, and % elongation at break were examined as per ASTM D3039 tensile testing. The UTS of optimized hybrid FRP composite, carbon non-hybrid FRP composite, and nanocomposite (at 2.5 wt. % TiO2 nanoparticles) were 424.98 MPa, 429.0 MPa, and 478.51 MPa, respectively. Further, the cost of optimized hybrid FRP composite and nanocomposite (at 2.5 wt. % of TiO2 nanoparticles) is approximately 36.93% and 21.51% less than most expensive carbon non-hybrid FRP composite. The morphological analysis revealed that TiO2 added composites up to 2.5 wt. % exhibit fewer defects, indicating a better interaction between the matrix and the fibers.",

The observations demonstrate the importance of improving the probability of detection for non-destructive testing in ensuring the safety of damage-tolerance-designed vessels after fiber failure.

Hence, its assessment using Fick's law and 3-core water shell model are used for a holistic understanding of water diffusion. Epoxy with organically modified montmorillonite clay of 2, 5 and 7 weight percent (wt.%) are fabricated and water diffusion is carried out for 240 hours. The results are analysed by dielectric and gravimetric approaches. The weight gain in epoxy after 240 hours is 0.42% and 0.19% at 5 wt.% of the filler. The weight gain peaks after 120 hours in all the composites and the variations from 120 to 240 hours are minimal. The weight gain rate is lowest at 96 hours, and it peaks at 120 hours and is highest at 0.00033%/hour in epoxy, and reduces to 0.0023%/hour with filler of 7 wt.%. The weight gain and weight gain rate are characteristics of the epoxy and the filler controls the magnitude. Diffusion coefficient is lowest at 5 wt.% but the differences in the other composites are limited. The effect of fillers on free volume, free volume rate and fractional free volume are correlated to the dielectric parameters. Water uptake increases the DC conductivity from 10−14 to 10−12 S/m after 240 hours and the relative permittivity increases by 40%. The water shell model, diffusion parameters and the free volume parameters are correlated to the results of DC conductivity and relative permittivity. Subtle changes induced by absorbed water is identified by the method adopted.",

Continuous-fiber FRCs such as 3D-FRC feature more efficient reinforcement and produce stronger members than do short-fiber FRCs. These FRCs have been applied to secondary structural members such as curtain walls. FRCs are expected to become more common in the future.

    "abstract": "The Charpy impact test method has been widely used to investigate impact resistance of fiber reinforced composites because of its simplicity. However, when laminated composites such as CFRPs are to be tested, each specimen may have different thickness without a notch. This may result in incorrect material evaluation for impact resistance. In this paper, an instrumented Charpy impact tester was introduced in order to determine a proper Charpy impact test method for CFRPs and to investigate the effect of the ratio of the support-span length to thickness l/t on impact characteristics for both unidirectional and fabric CFRPs. Energy per unit volume u increases rapidly along with l/t in the range of l/t < 20 and l/t < 16 for unidirectional CFRPs and fabric CFRPs, respectively, both of which are influenced by interlaminar separation. However, the u values become almost constant over 20 l/t 40 for the unidirectional CFRPs and over 16 l/t 40 for the fabric CFRPs. It is found that those ranges are the proper ranges for each type of CFRPs. It is, therefore, expected that such u values are not influenced by the size of specimens or the support-span length (unlike conventional impact strength) and thereby a unified evaluation method is possible for impact resistance of CFRPs under different test conditions.",

Fiber direction, misorientation, and fiber content were detectable for unidirectional CFRP. In this apparatus the transmitted wave is divided into two cross components and their difference and/or ratio is measured, so that the sensitivity of detecting the fiber orientation is improved and the change of fiber direction is detected separately from that of the fiber content. The sensitivity of the detection for the fiber direction and misorientation was especially good in such thin CFRP samples (less than about 1 mm in thickness). This method, therefore, was found to be most useful to check the fiber orientation of intermediary materials such as prepreg rather than end constructions or products. The sensitivity of detection for GRFP was rather low in comparison with that for CFRP, because the difference of electrical property between matrix resin and glass fiber is small. Theoretical formulations and calculations for the transmission and reflection of electromagnetic waves in anisotropic layered material were performed, and good agreement with the experimental results was obtained.",

This effect is attributed to the interface between the PA6 polymer matrix and the PET microfibrils resulting in the formation of a new phase - a PET-PA6 copolymer which plays the role of a selfcompatibilizer. The progress of the chemical interactions between PET and PA6 amorphous phases leads ultimately to the involvement of the entire amount of PA6 into a block copolymer, thus changing the orginal homopolymeric PA6 matrix into a copolymeric PET-PA6 one.

The C/C composite exhibited an interesting 'zigzag cracking' during growth of the damage in the 0° plies. At the same time, a straight crack extension was formed in the 90° plies. This zigzag crack proceeded in the following order: at first, vertical splits formed, then micro-cracks between the splits, and finally a connecting unstable crack formed. A stable/unstable regime of zigzag cracking was repeated for several cycles until the final failure. An R-curve was determined, taking this cracking extension into account. The R-curve demonstrated that the high-fracture toughness of the cross-ply laminated C/C composites could be attributed to the zigzag cracking characteristics. Then, the DEN results were compared with the R-curve behavior. This comparison showed that the DEN occurred at the initial value of the R-curve obtained when the micro-crack growth length was regarded as the crack tip.

The polymer, poly[(phenylsilylene) ethynylene-1,3-phenyleneethynylene], abbreviated MSP, possesses low thermosetting temperature (423-480 K), no volatility with cure, excellent heat-resistance and high char yield above 1273 K. In this study, carbon fiber reinforced composites with MSP were made by prepreg consolidation with plain 2D woven prepreg sheets, and resin transfer molding (RTM) with stitched plain 2D woven preforms. Compressive tests were conducted in order to evaluate the mechanical properties of the composites. However, the strengths of the composites were poor at elevated temperature. It was attributed to embrittlement and shrinkage of the polymer during heat treatment above 473 K.",

For the prevention of exfoliation, high strength bonding of the coating to the C/C substrate is often required. However, no measures have been established to determine bonding strength for thin and brittle coatings. In the present paper, first, a criterion for interfacial fracture of a SiC coating on a C/C substrate was discussed on the basis of fracture loads measured by a specially designed plunger method. The fracture mechanics approach was shown to be successful to predict the interfacial debonding. Then, a parametric study was carried out to understand the effect of various parameters on the interfacial fracture loads.

To meet these requirements, the design team adopted an all-composite monocoque structure instead of a conventional aluminum skin, stringer-frame structure. The all-composite structure was made of several large parts in order to reduce the total number of parts. These large parts were made by using the non-autoclave curing technique and assembled by bonding into a monocoque structure. The high-accuracy large lay-up tool and the custom-made oven played important roles particularly during these manufacturing processes, leading to reduction in both lead-time and cost. The structural design and the manufacturing strategy for the prototype structure are described in this paper. The development of the lay-up tool and the oven, which helped to realize low fabrication cost, is described here.

Two kinds of polymer matrices such as epoxy and vinyl-ester were used. Fractured surfaces were taken to study the failure mechanism and fiber/matrix interfacial adhesion. It is shown that it can be enhanced to improve their mechanical performance to reveal the relationship between fracture toughness and water absorption fatigue according to different polymer matrices. Water uptake of the epoxy composites was found to increase with cycle times. Mechanical properties are dramatically affected by the water absorption cycles. Water-absorbed samples showed poor mechanical properties, such as lower values of maximum strength and extreme elongation.

Comparing with the LIPCA-C2, the design of the mini-LIPCA comes with reduced overall size and a thinner active layer. Since a variation in the number and lay-up of fiber composite layers may strongly affect the performance of the device, one is able to configure several designs of mini-LIPCA. The evaluation process is then followed in order to determine a configuration which characterizes the possibly optimal performance. That is, a design of a mini-LIPCA is said to be optimal if it is capable of producing a maximum out-of-plane displacement. The size of the LIPCA to be investigated was selected to be 10 mm × 20 mm in which the thickness of PZT plate is about 0.1 mm. The thickness of glass/epoxy and carbon/epoxy are about 0.09 mm and 0.1 mm, respectively. The evaluation process has been conducted thoroughly, i.e., analytical estimation, numerical approximation and the experimental measurement are all involved. Firstly, the design equation was used to calculate essential parameters of proposed lay-up configurations. Secondly, ANSYS, a commercial FEA package, was utilized to estimate displacement outputs of the actuators upon being excited. Finally, experimental measurements were able to verify the predicted results.",

First, a delayed fracture model for a crack in a brittle material subjected to cyclic loading was established on the basis of the slow crack growth (SCG) concept in conjunction with the Weibull's probabilistic failure model. Second, the above probabilistic delayed fracture model was applied to transverse cracking in cross-ply laminates during cyclic loading. The stress distribution and the length of the unit element were calculated with the aid of a shear lag analysis. The transverse crack density was expressed as a function of maximum stress, stress ratio and number of cycles using the parameters associated with the Paris equation and the Weibull distribution in addition to the mechanical properties. Unknown parameters were determined from experiment data for three kinds of cross-ply laminates to reproduce the transverse crack density against the number of cycles. The parametric studies using the obtained parameters revealed the effects of the Weibull modulus, crack propagation exponent and stress ratio on evolution of transverse cracking under fatigue loading.",

Numerical analysis of resin flow and mold filling is a very useful means for optimization of the manufacturing process. However, the numerical analysis is quite time consuming and requires a great deal of effort, since a separate numerical calculation is needed for every set of material properties, part size and injection conditions. The efforts can be appreciably reduced if similarity solutions are used instead of repeated numerical calculations. In this study, the similarity relations for pressure, resin velocity and flow front propagation are proposed to correlate another desired case from the already obtained numerical result. In other words, the model gives a correlation of flow induced variables between two different cases. The model was verified by comparing results obtained by the similarity relation and by independent numerical simulation.

By developing a simple model, the optimal gradient pattern of the silica distribution was proposed. The degree of the distribution gradient (Dg) should be maximized to have the best compressive properties. A higher Dg could be obtained by increasing the rotating speed and time. On the other hand, the highest Dg has the problem of popping out the silica located in the surface during compressive loading, even in early stages. To overcome the model-predicted ideal pattern of silica particles, the distribution pattern for modified experimental observations can be obtained by changing the curing processes. In addition, the surface treatments of silica significantly affect the manufacturing conditions due to a higher adsorption capacity of rubber molecules that interfere with silica movement by the centrifugal force.",

Three-dimensional laminate theory is used to reproduce all the thermoelastic properties of the damaged laminate. The damage variable, which describes the degree of stiffness reduction caused by transverse cracking, is formulated based on a three-dimensional micromechanical model, with a loose boundary condition and assuming parabolic crack opening. These assumptions contribute to the analytical accuracy of the stiffness reduction model, while simplifying the damage variable expression. The effective thermomechanical properties of various composite laminates are predicted using the proposed model and compared with finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental results. We found that the proposed model with derived damage variable successfully reproduces the FEA and experimental results of stiffness degradation of damaged composite laminates.",

The Mg alloy AZ91 is used as a lightweight structural material in automobiles because of its high mechanical strength and corrosion resistance. In Mg-based nanocomposites, wherein graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are added as reinforcement materials to the AZ91 matrix, severe agglomeration occurs in the process of mixing the GNPs and Mg alloy powders owing to extensive van der Waals bonds between the GNP layers. This agglomeration of GNPs in the Mg alloy acts as a crack initiation site and lowers the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the alloy. In this study, a double-powder mixing process called SMART/MA is developed to inhibit GNP agglomeration. This process produces an AZ91-based composite with a few layers of GNP evenly dispersed throughout the matrix, which improves its mechanical properties and corrosion resistance.",

Physical, chemical, and mechanical treatments were comprehensively investigated, and then ensembled to effectively and efficiently remove lignin and hemicellulose with low energy from raw bamboo fibers, which combine microwave liquefaction, hydrogen peroxide-acetic acid delignification, alkaline treatment, and along with acid hydrolysis. This was able to allow for the extraction of CNFs. Compositional analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis were performed to investigate and confirm the successful removal of undesirable lignin and hemicellulose. The resultant cellulose fibers were then subjected to a mechanical treatment to obtain the cellulose nanofibrils. It was found that the obtained CNFs have an average diameter of 13 nm with a cellulose purity of 94.52%. Without any further surface modification, the incorporation of bamboo-based CNFs into natural rubber (NR) exhibits significant improvement in their mechanical properties including modulus (~66.67%), tensile strength (~120.83%), toughness (~139.34%), and elongation at break (~31.41%). Interestingly, there is no compromise between tensile strength and elongation at break for the nanocomposites. DMA results also showed that both storage and loss moduli were dramatically enhanced over those of neat NR in their glassy region, which is typically unusual. This study can show, if optimized for material extraction, the great promise to the potential use of natural materials to develop environmentally friendly composites with multi-functionality in a variety of real-world engineering structural applications.",

Such damages have been introduced as one of the main causes of catastrophic failure of whole structure, thus impact event detection and localization should be essential for many kinds of composite structures. In this study, low-velocity impact localization method was proposed using six multiplexed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors on the composite wingbox structure. The principle is to find the location which has the most similar set of reference signals from the database. Firstly, the required reference signals were measured to construct the database for the test section which is located on the upper skin of the wingbox. Then, the localization was implemented with the process of detecting the time of arrival (TOA) and finding the impact location. The similarities between the impact-induced signals and reference signals are assessed by calculating the root mean squared (RMS) values. Through the impact localizations on the non-reference locations, this method was validated. Also, this method was applied to the impact localizations when the wingbox structure was under static loads. From the acceptable results of such experiments under static loading conditions, the practicality of this method was successfully verified.keywords: Composite wingbox structurelow-velocity impact localizationfiber Bragg grating sensorstatic loading condition AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the Republic of Korea, under Development of 15 kW Rated Power Fuelcell Powerpack System for Agriculture and Delivery Drone Project (20213030030120).Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationFundingThe work was supported by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy [20213030030120].",

The LOX compatibility of CE resin-only, CF impregnated with CE resin (CF/CE), and the proposed CNT-modified CF composite (CNTs-CF/CE) was investigated according to ASTM D2512 guidelines. While the CE resin-only samples exhibited no reaction, CF/CE and CNTs-CF/CE composites reacted with a flash event during the LOX compatibility test. Further investigation revealed that the introduction of CNTs in the CF/CE composite increased the LOX reaction probability. Notably, the study identified the influence of the damage level on the ignition rate, emphasizing the importance of damage assessment.

    "abstract": "AbstractComposite overwrapped pressure vessels are designed to contain fluids that operate under high pressures. In addition to internal pressure, the design needs to account for out-of-plane loading in the form of low-velocity impact. In this study, a numerical analysis of four models of composite overwrapped pressure vessels with different stacking sequences is performed. A three-dimensional explicit finite element model using multi-layer stacked shell elements was used in the impact zone region to obtain reasonable computation time. Utilizing the bilinear traction-separation law, cohesive zone elements were used to simulate the delamination failure and as bonding between eight layers of CFRP covering the aluminum liner. The simulation results were then validated using drop-weight impact tests, which revealed that the response of contact force to impact time was comparable for both types of analysis. Prediction of failure was carried out by assessing the quantity of energy absorbed by the CFRP layers and was confirmed by shell element data that failed during simulations. In addition, the Hashin damage model confirmed that the matrix tensile failure mode was the predominant failure mode for all discussed impact scenarios. Model-A with Al + [90]8 stacking sequence was found to have the highest impact resistance based on the prediction of the composite's failure area and the energy absorbed by the CFRP layers. Furthermore, it was found that COPVs with combinations of helical and hoop sequences tend to have larger areas of delamination due to high interlaminar shear stress between the CFRP layers.Keywords: low-velocity impactcohesive zone elements;Hashin damage model impact energy absorption Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

    "abstract": "Composite fan blades made of CFRP have been developed and investigated to reduce the weight of aircraft engines. Aircraft fan blades are subjected to high-speed impact by foreign objects, such as bird strikes. Because CFRP has lower impact resistance than metal materials, it is necessary to focus on possible failure not only at the impact point but also at the tip and trailing edge of the fan blade. This paper developed a finite element analysis model of fan blade geometry and investigated the dynamic deformation that may induce peripheral fracture when a bird strike occurs on a composite fan blade. Natural vibration analysis and transient response analysis were performed to analyze the vibration behavior at the fan blade periphery. The natural vibration analysis showed that the vibration modes in the out-of-plane direction of the blade are of low order. In the transient response analysis, when a group of particles defined by the equation of state and the SPH method collided, a sudden deformation in the periphery, called a whipping motion, was observed immediately after the impact. The spanwise strain has a peak value at the trailing edge of the fan blade, while the chordwise strain has a peak value at the leading edge of the fan blade. Furthermore, the transient response analysis with the fan blades rotating showed an increase in the peak strain value. A comparison of the impact loads and displacements immediately below the impact indicated that the centrifugal force increased the geometric stiffness, which increased the reaction force due to the fan blade, increasing the peak value.",

During the resin injection the mold is kept only partially closed and thus a gap is present between the reinforcements and the upper mold. The gap results in preferential flow path. After the gap is filled with the resin, the compression action initiates and forces the resin to penetrate into the fiber preform. In the present study, the resin flow in the gap is simplified by using the Stokes approximation, while Darcy's law is used to calculate the flow field in the fiber mats. Results show that most of the injected resins enter into the gap during the injection phase. The resin injection time is extremely short so the duration of the filling process is determined by the final closing action of the mold cavity. Compared with resin transfer molding (RTM), I/CM process can reduce the mold filling time or injection pressure significantly.

CPCs using 100 µm FG showed optimal material properties at 60 wt% FG ratio, which were an electrical conductivity of 390 S/cm and flexural strength of 51 MPa. The particle size was an important parameter to change the mechanical and electrical behaviors. The flexural strength was sensitive to the particle size due to the different levels of densification. The electrical conductivity also showed size-dependent behavior because of the different contributions to the conductive network. Meanwhile, the material properties of EG/CF filled CPCs was also optimized according to the CF ratio, and the optimized electrical conductivity and flexural strength were 290 S/cm and 58 MPa, respectively. The electrical conductivity of this case decreased similarly to the EG/FG filled case. On the other hand, the behavior of the flexural strength was more complicated than the EG/FG filled case, and the reason was attributed to the interaction between the strengthening effect of CF and the deterioration of voids.",

This article investigates how the aircraft fluid affected the tensile properties, including ultimate tensile strength, tensile modulus, and strain at break of aramid fiber composites. Two different types of aramid fiber composite test specimens were prepared; Kevlar® laminate (para-aramid) and Nomex® paper (meta-aramid). The test specimens were soaked in four different types of aircraft fluid, jet fuel, engine oil, hydraulic fluid, and water and tested to measure their tensile properties. The influence of fluid ingression on the test specimens was analyzed by comparing the test data of each fluid group to the control group. Digital image correlation (DIC) was used during the tensile test for strain calculation and better understanding of local strain change during the test. The test results showed that the test specimens soaked in hydraulic fluid and water had an evidence of tensile property change.",

For this purpose, static tension tests are performed on thickness dimension (1D), in-plane dimensions (2D) and all the dimensions (3D) scaled notched specimens, respectively. The experimental results show that splitting strength has a tendency to increase by about 5–10% with increasing thickness dimension of a notched specimen. In contrast, splitting strength tends to decrease by about 20% not only with increasing in-plane dimensions but also with increasing all the dimensions, regardless of notch size. It is suggested that the 3D scaling effect in splitting strength of notched specimens is governed by the 2D scaling effect involved, since the 1D scaling effect is smaller. On the basis of these observations, a scale-sensitive notch size effect law is established. It is demonstrated to adequately describe the specimen-size effect as well as the notch-size effect in the longitudinal splitting strength of the unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite laminates. It is also shown that the effective normalized mode I fracture toughness for splitting failure in the unidirectional CFRP laminate can indirectly be evaluated by means of the scale-sensitive notch size effect law and it is close to the fracture mechanics test results in literature.",

In order to reveal the link between the interfacial properties and the failure behavior, the micromechanisms of damage initiation at the notch tip on the C/Cs was investigated in real-time during the flexural fracture tests through scanning election microscopy. Real-time fracture observation revealed that the damage was nucleated in the fiber bundle/matrix interfaces around the notch tip and the failure crack was successfully observed along the fiber bundle/matrix interface.

Adopting an effective lay-up structure established in earlier research by the authors, the actuator consists of an active layer operating with 3–3 mode actuation bonded to several other composite prepreg layers. The interdigitated electrodes through which the electric signal is applied to achieve 3–3 actuation along longitudinal direction are embedded into PZT ceramic. The asymptotic homogenization technique is used to calculate effective electro-mechanical properties of the active layer. These properties are then used in the analytical model to investigate the influence of the critical design parameters on the performance of the actuator through a defined coefficient. Optimal values of the active layer thickness are obtained for common electrode materials. The results demonstrate that metals having similar stiffness of the PZT ceramic are preferable as electrodes as they reduce the electrode width, bringing the design closer to an ideal case.",

Water contact angles varied from 80 to 120° which shows that the fiber composition can control the mat properties from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. The results also showed variation in the average fiber diameters alone did not always affect sheet wettability.

Strength and stiffness characteristics are attributable to the fiber or reinforcing agent. Only those fibers which possess very high strength and very high modulus or stiffness with moderately low density are suitable candidates as reinforcing agents in ACM. Specific modulus (normalized by fiber density) values of at least 6 × 108 cm and specific strength (normalized by fiber density) values of 6 × 106 cm are the guidelines for these high strength fibers. These include ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), aramids, carbon fiber, S-2 glass, and newly reported experimental fibers, PBO and PBT. Although the specific modulus of S-2 glass is below 6 × 108 cm or only 4 × 108 cm, the specific strength of S-2 glass is 18 × 106 cm and sufficiently high to merit consideration as a high performance fiber. The high performance fibers that dominate the ACM area possess low density (950–2500 kg/m3) and extremely high strengths (2–7 GPa) and moduli (70–800 GPa).",

    "abstract": "We have been conducting research on the development of heat-resistant composite materials filled with functional short fibers in multi-functional epoxy resin. As part of such effort, the filling effects of pitch-based carbon short fibers were investigated. In addition, the effects of treatment of coupling agents were studied by filling treated fibers into matrices cured with acid anhydride taking the large surface activity of fibers into account. In this report, matrices cured with diamine were investigated and were compared with those cured with acid anhydride. Pitch-based carbon short fibers treated with five types of coupling agents were filled in three types of multi-functional epoxy resin cured with two types of diamine for 22.2 wt%. The dynamic mechanical properties were measured for these materials in the temperature range of -150° C to 300° C. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) for all the tested materials became higher than those filled with short fibers not treated with coupling agents. The dynamic storage moduli, E', also increased in the glassy state region of low temperature (-140°C) and room temperature (25° C) as well as at high temperature of 200° C. However, the rise of Tg and increase of E' differed depending on the combination of epoxy resin and hardeners. All the values of E' at room temperature (25° C) were larger than the predicted value from the rule of mixtures for all the samples. Although the modified Halpin-Tsai equation by Nielsen yielded better prediction for some of the materials, E' for most of the materials were larger than the predicted values thus demonstrating the filling effect by short fibers treated with coupling agents in multi-functional epoxy resin cured with diamine hardeners. For flexural strength of the tested specimens, while the effect of treating with coupling agents on short fibers was small, the filling effect was evident for the materials whose matrices were brittle. It was found, as a result, that the materials made of multi-functional epoxy resin cured with diamine filled with pitch-based carbon short fibers treated with coupling agents were more heat-resistant with higher stiffness than those cured with three types of acid anhydride.",

Ring specimens were fabricated by a filament winding (FW) machine. In this study, the simulated damage of the scratch and the combination of scratch and pre-existing interlaminar delamination, i.e. teflon sheet inserted between the outermost and the inner FRP layers, were introduced artificially into the FW-FRP specimen. The fracture behavior during the tests of damaged FRP was characterized by observation using an 8-mm video camera and a high magnification video scope, strain measurements and AE analysis. It was confirmed that AE analysis is exellent for monitoring the propagation of delamination in an FRP pressure vessel with damage. The pressure of a notched specimen showed the maximum when the delamination propagated to the half region of the specimen. The maximum pressure was larger than the predicted pressure based on the premise that the notched outermost ply could not sustain the load. As the teflon sheet was longer, the maximum pressure was gradually decreased due to the decrease in initial ligament. On the other hand, as the teflon sheet was longer, the burst pressure of specimen with a scratch in the outermost ply was enhanced due to the smooth propagation of interlaminar delamination. Consequently, it was demonstrated by the observation of the fracture behavior and the fracture surface that the burst pressure was decreased due to the expansion of damage into the inner ply.",

    "abstract": "Controlled solidification of sapphire-NiAl and sapphire-Hastelloy composites was carried out to evaluate the influence of processing and alloying on the microstructure, chemistry, and interface and fiber strengths. Pressure casting, gravity casting, and zone directional solidification (DS) techniques were used to synthesize the composites. Both gravity casting and DS yielded higher interfacial shear strength in the composites compared to the solid-state powder cloth (PC) techniques. Large columnar β-NiAl grains surrounding the fibers in the DS material decreased the propensity for interfacial decohesion, resulting in a higher interface strength than in fine, equiaxed grains of gravity cast and PC composites. Alloying of NiAl matrix with Cr, W and Yb increased the interface strength relative to unalloyed NiAl but led to fiber degradation, with Yb causing the most extensive fiber damage. Pressure casting is viable to make high fiber volume fraction sapphire-reinforced Ni-base composites; however, fibers suffer strength loss (about 65 pct. relative to the virgin fiber) due to chemical attack. The residual fiber strengths are consistent with a Weibull distribution function. Controlling the strength-limiting reactions by matrix modification, use of barrier coatings, and process control (e.g. reduced temperatures) would permit exploitation of the unique potential of solidification techniques to design the composites for toughening and strengthening.",

    "abstract": "A feasibility study of three-dimensionally fiber-reinforced carbon-carbon composites (3DC/Cs) for application to a turbine disk of ATREX (Air turbo ramjet engine with expander cycle) was carried out. Spin burst tests at room temperature were conducted using 3D-C/C disks, and the fracture behaviors were characterized. A 3D-C/C disk was totally fractured at a peripheral speed of 516 m/s (r = 150 mm), which is sufficient for the ATREX application. However, fiber bundles at the disk periphery prematurely suffered micro-scale damage, and fragments of the fiber bundle unit flew out before total fracture occurred. In order to prevent the fly-out behavior, the disk was impregnated with Si only near its periphery. Although this treatment increased the initiation speed of the flyout behavior, this improvement was considered insufficient for purposes of the ATREX application. Next, a simplified analysis was conducted to characterize the fly-out behavior. Based on this analysis, the following three measures were discussed: (1) decreasing bundle thickness (i.e. using fine fiber texture), (2) increasing toughness of the fiber bundle interface, and (3) minimizing local curvature in waviness of the fiber bundles in the circumferential direction.",

    "abstract": "In order to increase the whisker preform strength and decrease the interfacial reactivity between Al18B4O33 whisker and aluminum alloy, three kinds of whisker surface treatments have been carried out. They were SiO2 binder addition, magnesium deposition coating and spinel (MgAl2O4) coating. By a low vacuum evaporation technique (under vacuum 10 Pa at 650°C for 1 h), magnesium was deposited on the whiskers uniformly. Magnesium deposition reacted with the whisker at 800°C for 0.5 h in air to create a MgAl2O4 layer (8-10 nm in thickness) on the whisker. Three kinds of surface-treated whiskers and the untreated whisker were used to reinforce AC4CH aluminum alloy by squeeze casting method. Those surface treatments could increase the strength of whisker preform and hence decreased the preform deformation during squeeze casting. However, SiO2 binder did not prevent the interfacial reaction. Being similar to untreated whisker composite, SiO2 added whisker composite had a deterioration of strength after T6 treatment. Magnesium coating just avoided the interfacial reaction of Al18B4O33 whisker with the matrix but did not prevent that with the magnesium coating itself. After T6 treatment, the strength decrease due to whisker damage and the strength increase from the matrix age strengthening did not change the total strength of composites. MgAl2O4 coating existed as an effective barrier to prevent the interfacial reaction. During T6 treating, no further whisker damage occurred and the matrix was strengthened. This produced considerable enhancement of the composite strength.",

The core-less tubes have two different arrangement systems (single and double). For the core tubes, natural cellular fibre was used as filler. Experiments showed that the crushing behaviours of the core-less tubes were found to be sensitive to their ellipticity ratio. Catastrophic failure mode is eradicated by both the arrangement system and the existence of the core, while the elastic energy is significantly suppressed by the existence of the core. The presence of core provides significant enhancement in tube damage tolerance and energy absorption per unit volume compared to the core-less tubes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Compression after impact (CAI) behavior of stiffened panels using T-shaped stringers made of heat resistant thermoplastic composites, CF/PIXA, was obtained by tests at room temperature and 180°C. Excellent impact resistance in terms of delamination area was verified for the present composite panels due to the special fusion bonding film. Room temperature CAI strengths of the stiffened panels were found to be better than CF/PEEK panels in a rough comparison, without regard to differences in stacking sequence and geometry. Relationships between temperature and CAI strengths for CF/PIXA stiffened panels were compared with the results for flat plates (SACMA) and a compatibility between flat plate and stiffened panel data was observed. It is clarified that damage tolerance properties of CF/PIXA stiffened structure are so remarkable at room temperature that compression strengths are quite insensitive to relative impact energy. Its damage tolerance capability is also excellent at high temperature for High Speed Civil Transport structures. Linear and nonlinear buckling analyses based on simple models without delamination and interlaminar stresses were conducted using a finite element code. The results agreed well basically with experimental results. In the case of prediction of the final strength, several points of improvement are identified. The present prediction provides the initial step to discuss the possibility of post-buckling strength design at high temperature stiffened panels.

In this study, the analysis model is applied to the analysis of a sandwich SCB test specimen where the Young’s modulus of the core varies along the thickness direction. The procedures to obtain the solution for two specific cases are described. One is the case that the Young’s modulus of the core varies in the thickness direction as an exponential function. The other is the case that the Young’s modulus of the core varies as a combination of exponential functions which is symmetric with respect to the midplane of the core. By comparing with finite element analysis, it is confirmed that the beam analysis model can provide reliable results even when the core is inhomogeneous in the thickness direction.",

Four types of epoxy resins were used as matrix resins to investigate the effects of matrix resin characteristics on the microscopic damage behavior and the mechanical properties of CFRP. As a result, the mechanical properties of on-axis CFRP were comparable regardless of matrix resins. On the other hand, in the case of off-axis CFRP, such as 45° direction, the tensile strength was remarkably lower with a brittle matrix resin. From the AE measurement results, the number of cumulative hits for CFRP was much larger than that for neat resins due to the occurrence of fiber/matrix interfacial cracks. Also, AE waves for CFRP had a longer duration than that for neat resin, and the relationship between the degree of duration and fracture mode was clarified.",

In the model, a surface twist angel θ e was regarded as the threshold value where ε 1 = ε (ε 1 is the longitudinal tensile strain, and e is its numerical value) for the piecewise function, which cut off the experimental stress–strain curve from nonlinearity into linearity.

The degree of damage is higher for carbon fiber than for glass fiber, and the survival rate increases with a hyperbolic tangent relationship as the nozzle diameter increases. Higher survival rate corresponds to a stronger material. Five different lengths of fiber with 29 different size fibers were selected based on the distribution and shape of residual fiber in experimental works. These were examined to study the effects of fiber distribution on the tensile properties of a short-fiber reinforced composite (SFRC). Compared with the experimental results, the modulus predicted using the Halpin-Tsai relation shows reasonable agreement with the prediction obtained using the residual fiber length instead of the initial fiber length. It was found that the tensile modulus and strength generally differ by a factor of up to 3.2, depending on the fiber distribution patterns with Vf = 30%, and the trend is more significant as the fiber aspect ratio increases. The interactions between the fiber and matrix and the staggered-type distribution are the most important factors in the reinforcement of the SFRC. With the same combination of short fiber length, an optimized fiber distribution pattern is suggested.",

    "abstract": "Burst pressure is used as a safety design limit for a pressure vessel. This research aimed at finding burst pressure of three models of cylindrical pressure vessels, i.e. a) composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) with an aluminum liner, b) aluminum pressure vessel with the same thickness as the liner of COPV, and c) aluminum pressure vessel with the same thickness as the total thickness of COPV. Non-linear finite element simulations,were used as a numerical tool to find stress, strain, and deformation of the cylinder. It was found that the aluminum material used as an aluminum liner of COPV has a higher burst pressure up to 55 MPa, while burst pressure of the other two aluminum cylinders only reaches 11.6 and 17.6 MPa. These results show good correlations with the theoretical calculation, which is calculated by using Faupel formulae and the Barlow Equation. In order to investigate the effect of using the CFRP layer on the severity of the crack defect in the aluminum liner, fracture analysis was held to find the stress intensity factor (SIF) along the crack front of a semielliptical crack. It was found that using CFRP layers, the stress intensity factor and energy release rate are reduced to 64.84% and 87.09%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites are widely used in aviation, aerospace, sports and special vehicles because of their light weight, high wear resistance, good fatigue resistance and low thermal expansion coefficient. However, the anisotropy and low interlaminar strength easily lead to defects such as wire drawing, delamination and tearing during drilling process, which seriously restricts the development of GFRP composites. In this study, the effects of drilling tool material and geometrical parameters on the machining quality of GFRP composites in ultrasonic-assisted drilling are revealed through single-factor experiment. Unidirectional laminated GFRP epoxy plates of 80 × 50 × 5 mm are used in the experiment, and the thrust in the machining process is collected by a dynamometer. An industrial camera is used to record the exit morphology of the hole, and then MATLAB is used for image processing to convert it into a greyscale map. Finally, the size of the delamination factor Fd is obtained according to the equation. The experiment results indicate that using the carbide drilling bit with a diameter of 4 mm and a point angle of 120° is beneficial to reduce the thrust and suppress the machining defects.",

Damaged laminates are modeled as quasi-isotropic nonlinear axisymmetric plates with multiple, equal-diameter, equally spaced, and circular delaminations. Its boundary is supported by distributed linear springs with arbitrary spring constants for rotational and in-plane movements to consider the effect of the arbitrary boundary constraints. Closed-form expressions of nonlinear simultaneous equations are derived for the responses of the damaged plates to a transverse concentrated load based on the Rayleigh–Ritz method. The resulting energy release rate is given in a closed-form in terms of the applied load and the generalized coordinates. The nonlinear response considering damage growth is solved to quantitatively show the effects of various design factors such as boundary conditions, dimensions of the plate, number of multiple delaminations, and interlaminar fracture toughness.

The addition of alumina to HA led to an improved pore orientation attributed to the improved latent heat release during the freezing process owing to its higher thermal conductivity. The appropriate sintering temperature for composites consisting of different ceramics, HA, and alumina exceeded 1450 °C. Next, a compression test was conducted with fracture behavior monitoring using an acoustic emission method. The proposed HA-alumina composite porous scaffold exhibited better mechanical properties with higher porosity compared to scaffolds with randomly oriented pores. Furthermore, it was observed that the alumina addition and sintering temperature affected the macrofracture and microfracture behaviors, respectively.",

Consequently, FOD corresponds to the weight vector derived through serial waveform separation.

Fatigue crack propagation rates for SiCw/A2024 and SiCp/A356 composites were lower than those for unreinforced alloys at a given stress intensity factor near fatigue threshold, while the fatigue thresholds for those composites were higher than those for matrix alloys. For SiCp/A357 composite the fatigue crack propogation rates were higher than those for SiCp/A356 composite. Fractography revealed that the fatigue crack would propagate to the whisker/matrix interface following the formation of dimple patterns in the whisker rich zones or formation of striation patterns in the whisker poor zones for SiCw/A2024 composites, while for SiCp/A356 and SiCp/A357 composites the fatigue crack would propagate in the matrix near fatigue threshold. The near final failure crack would be linked to the sub-crack initiated from the particles ahead of the main crack. The fatigue crack propagation models were proposed for discontinuous fiber reinforced aluminum matrix composites. It is suggested that the silicon carbide whiskers or particles would have a very significant effect on fatigue crack propagation properties near fatigue threshold",

ACMs have been extensively developed and applied to a wide range of industrial fields including aeronautics and astronautics, ships, vehicles, civil engineering and architecture, sports and recreational articles. Off-setting these various advantages, ACMs also have detrimental effects which may be harmful to the global ecological system after the end of the product life. A recent trend of research and development of composites, the so-called SPAGHETTI syndrome, tends to add more functions to ACM, consequently making constituent materials more diversified and complicated. Some experts point out that, under present circumstances, this may produce more man-made garbage which is hard to incinerate or recycle and finally result in devastation of the ecological system. This paper places special emphasis on original composites compatible with the requirements for recycling as a design prerequisite. A concept of environmentally conscious, smart composite materials which are able to satisfy various functional requirements and impose fewer hazards for the global environmental system is introduced.",

Both coefficient of friction (μ) and the width of worn groove decreased with the TiC volume fraction (V f) increasing, and increased with the applied load increasing. Metallographic examinations revealed that unreinforced ZA43 alloy had deep ploughing grooves with obvious adhesion phenomenon, whereas TiC/ZA43 composites had smooth worn surface.

Multi-holed specimens with different numbers of holes and different distances between the holes were prepared and tensile fracture tests were conducted.

Higher tensile strength than that of smooth specimens was obtained in an optimal case on the basis of averaged net stress.

    "abstract": "Abstract An interface element which accounts for the properties of both material strength and fracture mechanics is proposed to numerically simulate the damage propagation process in composite laminates. Several element refinements, which ensure the smooth convergence of the solution during the calculation of damage, are incorporated through a user subroutine in the commercially available finite element package program (MARC). The element was successfully applied to the fundamental problems of stable crack propagation and crack initiation. The propagation process of multiple interlaminar delaminations in circular axisymmetric nonlinear plates subjected to a quasi-static transverse load has been solved to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the present element in a complex delamination propagation problem. Because a continuous stress distribution with respect to surface separation along the crack path is assumed on the interface, smooth and stable convergence of the solution of crack propagation can be realized with a fairly coarse mesh compared to the mesh of the model when a discrete interface traction force is assumed only at the nodes on the interface. Since the interface element considers the energy dissipated during the formation of the crack surface, it may be applied to the simulation of a dynamic failure process.

Because of the rotation of the asymmetric arms in the adhesive DCB specimens due to temperature change, it is necessary to correct the evaluated fracture toughness of the DCB specimens, specifically in the case of a large temperature change. This study shows that the difference between the true toughness and an apparent toughness due to the consequence of ignoring residual stresses can be calculated for a given specimen geometry and thermo-mechanical properties (e.g. coefficient of thermal expansion). The calculated difference in the energy release rates based on the present correction method is compared with that from FEM in order to verify the present correction method. The residual stress effects on the evaluation of the adhesive fracture toughness are discussed. Keywords: ADHESIVESFRACTURE TOUGHNESSRESIDUAL THERMAL STRESS",

    "abstract": "The single-modal Weibull model has been assessed on Tyranno ZMI Si-Zr-C-O fiber if a set of shape and scale parameters accurately reproduced the effect of the size of the diameter on strength. The tensile data of a single fiber have been divided into two expedient groups as 'small diameter' group and 'large diameter' group in deriving the parameters, which should be consistent if the Weibull model accurately reproduced the size effect. However, the derived Weibull parameters were inconsistent between the two groups. Thereby the authors have concluded that the parameters of the single-modal Weibull model are dependent on the fiber diameter, so that the model is inadequate to reproduce the strength size effect. On the other hand, Weibull parameters were found consistent between the two groups by excluding the data of 'large mirror zone' sample, which was defined as the sample around 10% mirror zone area of the fracture surface. What is more, the exclusion reduced the strength variance more drastically in the 'large diameter' group than in the 'small diameter' group, even though the 'large mirror zone' samples were found identical in the percentage between the two groups. The authors therefore conclude that diameter limitation to the 'small diameter' group level can lead to drastically less distributed strength values than the estimated strength through the Weibull scaling on the present Tyranno ZMI Si-Zr-C-O fiber.",

Composites of PVA GT and HDPE GM were made to investigate the advanced properties of long-term performance related to waste landfill applications. The same experiments were also performed for typical polypropylene and polyester GT and compared to PVA GT/HDPE GM composites. We also develop high performance GT composites with GM by using PVA GT, which is capable of improving the frictional properties and thus enhances long-term performance of GT composites. Experimental study reveals that the friction coefficient of GT composites is relatively large compared with those of polyester and polypropylene non-woven GT as long as the friction media has similar size to the particles of domestic standard earth. In addition, the geo-composites bonded with geo-grid by a chemical process were investigated experimentally in terms of strain evaluation and creep response values. Geo-grid plays an important role as a reinforcing material. Three kinds of geo-grid were prepared as strong yarn polyester and they were woven type, non-woven type, and wrap knitted type. The sample geo-grids were then coated with PVC. The rib tensile strength tests were conducted to evaluate geo-grid products in terms of tensile strength with regard to single rib. The test was performed according to GRI-GGI. It was concluded again from the experiments that the tensile and creep strains of the geo-grid showed such stable values that the geo-grid prepared in this study could protect geo-textile partially in practical structures.",

The microscopic flow of the fibers and matrix was observed during a parallel plate compression test conducted near the melting point. On the basis of this observation, the viscosity and flow properties were evaluated by the finite element method (FEM). The results of the parallel plate compression test showed that the test conditions and the decrease in the thickness of the laminates are related to the apparent viscosity of the unidirectional plate. In addition, cracks in the direction of the maximum shear stress were detected via in situ observation near the melting point of the matrix. The occurrence of this phenomenon depended on the apparent viscosity of the unidirectional laminates, and it was found that no cracks occurred when the apparent maximum viscosity of the unidirectional laminates was lower than a threshold.",

In this regard, one-dimensional elements are required to accurately represent all the structural properties of a three-dimensional component. Most of the previous methods regarded the blade as a linear structure, resulting in limitations associated with nonlinearities. The geometry of the blades has a significant change along the length, and the composition of the materials used inside the blades is very complex, so these methods are not suitable for extracting the characteristics of the blades. In this paper, a new design scheme of a one-dimensional beam modeling method is proposed based on the blade sectional element concept that is easier and faster to apply without performing nonlinear analysis. In addition, the validation of the accuracy of its numerical analysis results, the total mass and modal analysis results are compared between three-dimensional blade and one-dimensional blade.",

In the evaluation of the apparent Poisson's ratio, the strain in the width direction was shown to vary under the condition of low b/t.

This model relies on the assumption that each state is assigned in the order of the fiber-break point number, and that it transits to two states from one state. The first state of the two is a state causing a composite fracture, and another is a state of survival while being damaged. Mini composites with 2–4 fibers were prepared using carbon fiber and epoxy resin to examine the applicability of the model. Predicted failure probability curves approach experimentally obtained data with an increase in the fiber-break point and ultimately agree with them. The fiber-break points till fracture are estimated with greater numbers than the number of fibers, which elucidates the significance of the experimental results higher than the average fiber strength. The validity of the model was finally discussed while considering the stress concentration around fiber-break point(s).",

Thermal conductivity was increased by an increase of filler connectivitywhich was determined by weight fractions and aspect ratios of fillers. The effect of filler aspect ratios was dominant on mechanical strengths. However, modulus was not influenced by the aspect ratios but was determined solely by the weight fractions of fillers. Impact strength decreased with an increase of the weight fractions of AS due to the loss of intrinsic toughness of PA66. The gas barrier property of PA66 was improved by the additions of AS.

And the design profile can ensure that the two rotors always have a conjugate contact point when rotating, thus preventing the pump’s leakage. The volumetric efficiency of the pump is used to evaluate the excellent of profile design. The design variables are the number of lobes and the shape of single lobe. Then the performance analysis of the pump is done to understand the effects of design parameters on its volumetric efficiency. And the results show that the increase in the number of lobes can reduce the volumetric efficiency. For the two-lobe rotor, the raise of the center height of the top circle can enhance the volumetric efficiency.

    "abstract": "At the Waterworks Bureau (Tokyo Metropolitan Government), activated carbon has been used for filtering water. After being used for the filtering process, it is normally disposed or burned for thermal recycling. However, CO2 emissions occur during the thermal recycling. This work focuses on the identification of mechanical behavior of recycled wasted activated carbon (WAC) in order to elaborate smart materials having mechanical–electrical functions. Acoustic emission technique (AE) was used intensively as characterization support in which sensors were attached to detect microdamage during bending tests. At first, the resonant frequencies of the specimens were measured using the through-transmission test. The resonant frequencies of the specimens containing low weight fractions of WAC powder were less in comparison to the frequencies of the specimens with higher volume fraction. The frequency analysis was carried out with the projected wavelet transform on the signals detected during bending tests. Obtained data showed that, typically, the first major peaks showed the resonant frequency of the sensors, while the second major peaks exhibited signals indicative of resin cracking. The surfaces of the fractured specimens were analyzed by optical microscopy in order to visualize the crack formation and propagation on the activated carbon composite under flexural stresses. Consequently, fractographic and AE analyses provide better understanding of the failure mechanisms involved.",

Factors which have an effect on the accuracy of load application have been identified. An effective procedure for installing test article and actuators is proposed to achieve accurate loading direction compared to conventional one. A method to define quality of load control for a full-scale static test is suggested by using root mean square deviation (RMSD) of command-feedback (CMF) values. Test result of U1 test condition for the KC-100 full-scale static test has shown 8.7 N of averaged RMSD value. At the end, an approach to make general equation for reaction to load increment has been presented and reaction can be assumed to have relation of linear to load increment for symmetric load condition. The linear behavior has been shown through a test data of the KC-100 aircraft which has high stiffness of composite material structure. The test result presents that the linear behavior of the reaction has been well corresponding to the linear model.",

    "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) has been used to construct various vehicle forms because its lightweight properties facilitate motion and operation. Such lightweight structures can both provide sufficient strength and save material cost. Because fiber cloth is limited by its dimensions, an overlap installation is required to ensure its structural strength; however, overlap installation increases structural weight by approximately 10–15%. In this study, experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to compare the mechanical properties of various overlap forms. Based on the findings, a laminated FRP stacking arrangement is proposed for use in vehicle structures. The ‘full overlap (FO)’ method is traditionally used to maintain the continuity of FRP structures; however, this study explored the ‘full butt’ and ‘outer layer for overlap and inner layer for butted-joint (OOAIB)’ methods. In order to simulate the structural discontinuity at overlap region and butted-joint region, a new approach to establish finite element model is presented in this paper. According to experimental and simulated results, FO and OOAIB are similar regarding strength and stiffness. Therefore, the OOAIB method is suggested for decreasing the weight of FRP structure.",

However, it is difficult to obtain dense composites. In this study, we focused on pulse electric current sintering (PECS) to obtain dense HA/β-TCP composites. The sinterability is evaluated with relative density and grain size measurements. Composition of sintered body was also characterized by X-ray diffraction. In comparison with pressureless sintering, PECS increased relative density of the composites without grain growth. In HA/β-TCP sintered by PECS, the phase transformation from β-TCP to α-TCP was promoted. This is due to higher thermal energy by spark discharge during PECS. On the other hand, sintering additives (MgO) inhibited phase transformation. It was suggested that sinterability of HA/β-TCP composites was improved by PECS.",

    "abstract": "Engineering structures may be sensitive to vibrations such that their normal functioning is impaired due to the presence of vibrations. A material capable of dissipating energy of vibration by means of heat tends to have better mechanical damping properties. However, due to the demands on structural stability, the material needs to have sufficient stiffness to be useful structurally. Thus, the material must have both high stiffness and high mechanical damping. This paper discusses a variety of materials that were uniquely developed to achieve the aforementioned objectives. The new nickel–aluminum–bronze (UNS C95800)-based samples were classified according to alloying composition by weight percentage with different indium alloys. A dynamic mechanical analyzer was used to find the complex modulus (|E*|) and loss tangent (tan δ) values of the samples. These values were used to evaluate and compare the figure-of-merit (FOM) across different frequencies at a particular temperature and strain. The samples which have FOM equal to or greater than 0.6 GPA include the ones alloyed with pure indium (5 wt%), eutectic solder (5 wt%), indium–bismuth eutectic (10 wt%), bismuth–tin eutectic (5 and 10 wt%), and indium–tin eutectic (5 wt%). The newly alloyed high-damping metals can be used to reduce vibration while maintaining their stiffness.",

Quasi-static to medium strain rate tensile tests at strain rates ranging from 10-3 to 10-1 s-1 were also performed and compared with dynamic behavior. The dependence of mechanical properties on strain rate is clarified. Particularly, the tensile strength and modulus increase drastically at dynamic strain rates of the order of 103 s-1. High velocity impact-absorbing ability is revealed, although the dynamic breaking strain shows values of an order similar to the static results.

Using the unit cell approach, a 'cross-over model' has been proposed for expressing the cross-over of curved yarns of knitted fabric. Using laminated plate theory, the effective elastic properties of the yarns in the cross-over model have been estimated. Elastic properties of the composite were determined by combining the effective elastic properties of the curved yarns and the resin-rich regions. Tensile strength properties have been predicted by estimating the fracture strength of yarns bridging the fracture plane. Tensile properties of knitted fabric composites with different volume fraction of fibers were predicted. The analytical procedures have been validated by comparing one set of experimental results with the predictions. The applicability and limitation of these models have been discussed.",

Thus, the aim of this work is the optimisation of the specimen geometry which allows the characterisation of mode II by the approach of the LEFM concept. The results obtained show an interaction between the geometrical characteristics of the specimen (thickness h), the angle of orientation of the plies () and the characterisation of delamination. The experimental results are in good agreement with the analytical predictions.

The fabrication of the lightweight aggregates was found to depend on the amount of char, CaCO3, and the firing temperature. At all temperatures, the samples prepared from the FRP waste that had been decomposed in N2 gas did not yield pore structure required for lightweight aggregates due to a relatively large amount of char. However, the sample containing a small amount of char prepared from the FRP waste that had been decomposed in air showed well-developed closed pores at 900°C and 950°C. The addition of 5 wt% CaCO3 resulted in the most uniform pore structure. As the amount of CaCO3 or the firing temperature was increased, the pore size and its distribution became larger and broadened.

We formulated the point stress criterion (PSC) for notched composites with the characteristic distance at which the Tsai–Hill criterion for orthotropic materials was satisfied. The strengths of CFRP off-axis unidirectional laminates with a hole predicted by the PSC agreed well with the measured strengths, and the validity of the characteristic distance determined by the Tsai–Hill criterion was confirmed. Moreover, we observed the fractured surfaces of the holed specimens with small off-axis angles and found that the fracture mode within the characteristic distance (fiber breakage mode) was different from that away from the hole (shear fracture mode). These observations of the fractured surfaces suggested that the characteristic distance represented the size of the initially damaged area at the notch tip.

SMA fiber can be used in practical applications, including stress or cure-monitoring sensors, due to its inherent shape recovery properties, i.e., it exhibits a shape memory effect (SME) when subjected to applied stress or temperature. Superelasticity was observed for SMA fiber/epoxy composites under cyclic stress–strain curve. Under a certain stress, the original modulus was reduced steeply but then recovered under further stress. A sudden transitional change in electrical resistance was also observed around 87°C with an increase of temperature. Under cyclic loading the stress was suddenly leveled-off with a certain stress, which resulted in a different stress hysteresis repeatedly with two differing matrices and surface treatment. In SMA fiber/epoxy composites, residual stress of single-SMA fiber with and without embedding epoxy matrix exhibited the incomplete and complete recovery, respectively, during the curing process.

A bipolar plate, which is the major component of the fuel cell, is always exposed to the moisture during operation, because one of the important functions of the bipolar plate is to facilitate water management within the cell. In order to use graphite composite materials as bipolar plate material for PEMFC, the effect of the moisture environment on the mechanical properties of bipolar plate is studied. Two types of specimens, one made of particulate graphite 90%-epoxy 10% composite 'with' woven carbon fabric, and the other 'without' carbon fabric, were fabricated. Both types of specimens were kept in three different environmental conditions: (1) dry at room temperature, (2) immersed in 85° C water for 100 h, and (3) immersed in 85° C water for 300 h. A series of experiments were performed with the samples of the two types: water absorption rate, strength and modulus from the bending and tensile tests were measured. The results showed that a steep increase of water absorption rate occurred at the beginning of the test followed by a slow increase afterwards. Total water absorption rate was lower for the specimens with fabric since the inserted carbon fabric has lower porosity and lower water absorption than the specimens without fabric made of graphite/epoxy composite. Bending strength and modulus decreased for both types of specimens. However, addition of carbon fabrics to the graphite-particle/epoxy composite increased the tensile strength significantly.",

It was found by SEM observation that the distribution of short fibers in the resin was random. Dynamic mechanical properties were measured for short fiber filled composites in the temperature range of -150 to 300° C. The glass transition temperature (Tg) for the composites became higher than that for the matrices, and the dynamic storage moduli, E', were also increased. The values of E' for the graphite filled composites in the glassy region at low temperature (-140° C) and room temperature (25° C) were larger than those for the carbon filled composites but at high temperature (200° C), E' for the carbon filled composites became larger as the surface activation of carbon was higher than that of graphite. The value of E' for the composites at 25° C was larger than the estimated values from the rule of mixture for both types of composites, thus demonstrating the filling effect. The experimental values were in good agreement with the Halpin-Tsai equation modified by Nielsen. However, some variations on the increase of Tg and E' were seen depending on the combination of epoxy resin and hardener as well as the difference between carbon and graphite as the pitch-based carbon fibers. The filling effect on flexural strength was evident in the composites whose matrices were brittle. It was found that heat resistant and high modulus composites can be developed by using multi-functional epoxy resin as the matrix filled with functional short fibers.",

For this calculation, two dominating processes in the vicinity of the crack tip have to be distinguished. Immediately in front of the notch the creation of a new fracture surface is connected with the consumption of specific energy γ. This material region is termed the process zone. A substantial part of the elastic energy is dissipated in a larger zone near the crack tip-the so-called dissipation zone.

A flexural experimental investigation has been carried out on carbon/epoxy (Type C), aramid/epoxy (Type A) and C/A hybrid (Type A-C-A, C-A-C) laminates. The results were as follows. (1) A kink band was observed for Type A and Type A-C-A at the compressive surface near the loading point by a low level flexural load. (2) The load deflection curves of Type A and Type A-C-A had knee points, and loading over the knee point; a white region was observed at the compressive surface near the loading point. (3) The stress at the knee point of Type A and Type A-C-A was lower than the critical stress of microbuckling calculated by the Dow's equation. This was caused by the decrease of the observed compressive modulus of aramid fibers producing kink bands. (4) Tensile and shearing fracture was observed for Type A and Type A-C-A over the maximum load. The scale of the shearing fracture of Type A-C-A was smaller than that of Type As, and this was caused by the support of CFRPs layers.

Although the glass transition temperatures Tg of the multi-functional epoxy resin matrix varied when combined with different hardeners, they were all high (over 200° C) and the highest temperature reached 260° C. The storage modulus E' of the material increased when AFP was added and remained at over 2 GPa even at 150° C. The value of E' in the glassy region was higher than the estimated value by the rule of mixtures which shows that the effect of AFP filling was remarkable. The relative modulus at Tg and the ratio of the peak height of tan δ implied that the affinity of epoxy resin with AFPs was large. The flexural strength of the matrix (epoxy resin) for less tough materials was larger than that for tougher but brittle materials. Although filling with AFPs reduces the flexural strength of the material, this significantly depends on the type of the matrix material.",

Effect of measurement points and measurement errors on the identification results is examined through numerical examples on symmetric laminated plates.",

Its cause seems to be the discrepancy of the optical fiber axis in the optical fiber sensor caused by the molding pressure. In the present paper, compression and shear tests of epoxy specimens where the optical fiber sensor was embedded were conducted to investigate effects of the pressure on the internal strain output. In the experiment, the strain output was monitored under the compressive and the shear load. The stress distributions were calculated by the FEM method to know the pressure applied to the sensor. The relation between the strain output and the calculated pressure on the sensor was obtained. From the results, it was found that the load equivalent to the autoclave molding pressure almost does not affect the strain output.",

Three representative test methods were performed: Iosipescu, ±45° tensile and ±45° compressive tests. Test methods were evaluated by comparing apparent shear behavior and shear damage progress. Highest and lowest shear strengths were obtained in Iosipescu and ±45° tensile tests, respectively. In particular, the ±45° tensile method yielded most remarkable stiffness reduction because tensile normal stresses have a profound influence on shear damage progress. Therefore, it was concluded that the ±45° tensile method is not appropriate for evaluating in-plane shear strength. In contrast, ±45° compressive tests yielded almost identical damage evolution to that in Iosipescu tests. Although apparent shear behavior depended remarkably on test methods, a common damage process with propagation of transverse cracks, and debonding among fiber bundles was observed. Finally, to demonstrate normal stress effects on shear damage progress, mechanical behavior under various biaxial loads was calculated using a continuum damage mechanics (CDM) approach. Calculated behavior agreed reasonably well with experimental results when shear/normal stresses coupling effects were taken into account.",

The experimental results showed that the composite possessed high σ b (elevated temperature tensile strength), for instance, σ b was 315.8 MPa, which was tested at 315°C, meanwhile the figure was 232.6 MPa tested at 400°C, and the elongations were 2.5% and 1.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the composite sheets exhibited excellent thermal stability: the hardness showed no significant decline after annealing at 550°C for 200 h or at 600°C for 10 h. The good elevated temperature mechanical properties and excellent thermal stability should mainly be attributed to the formation of spherical α-Al12(Fe, V)3Si dispersed phase particulates in the aluminum matrix. Furthermore, the addition of SiC particles into the alloy is another important factor, which the following properties are responsible for. The resultant Si of the reaction between Al matrix and SiC particles diffused into Al matrix can stabilize α-Al12(Fe, V)3Si dispersed phase; in addition, the interface (Si layer) improved the wettability of Al/SiCP, hence, elevated the bonding between them. Furthermore, the fine Al4C3 phase also strengthened the matrix as a dispersion-strengthened phase. Meanwhile, load is transferred from Al matrix to SiC particles, which increased the cooling rate of the melt droplets and improved the solution strengthening and dispersion strengthening.",

It is to improve the interfacial bonding between the VGCF and epoxy matrix. The allylamine plasma process was performed by batch process in a vacuum chamber, using gas injection followed by plasma discharge for the durations of 20, 40 and 60 min. The interdependence of mechanical properties on the VGCF contents, treatment time and interfacial bonding between VGCF/ep was investigated. The interfacial bonding between VGCF and epoxy matrix was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of nanocomposites fracture surfaces. The changes in the mechanical properties of VGCF/ep, such as the tensile modulus and strength were discussed. The mechanical properties of allylamine plasma treated (AAPT) VGCF/ep were compared with those of raw VGCF/ep. The tensile strength and modulus of allyamine plasma treated VGCF40 (40 min treatment)/ep demonstrated a higher value than those of other samples. The mechanical properties were increased with the allyamine plasma treatment due to the improved adhesion at VGCF/ep interface. The modification of the carbon nanofibers surface was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM micrographs showed an excellent dispersion of VGCF in epoxy matrix by ultrasonic method.

The conventional composite EM wave absorber contains lossy fillers for dielectric characteristics, and thus the fillers affect the mechanical properties, which determine the structural performance of the composite itself. The newly proposed EM wave absorber uses a combination of the following two components: the load-bearable composite structure as the ‘shell’ and the EM wave-absorbing back layer as the ‘absorber.’ The shell type absorber does not use any additional fillers in the composite structure. However, the absorbing layer that is designed with a periodic patterned layer and low lossy foam exhibits good EM wave-absorbing performance. Design, analysis with computational simulation, and measurement of EM characteristics are performed to verify the advantages of the shell type absorber. Furthermore, the EM wave absorber is adopted in the leading edge of an aircraft to identify the contribution of Radar Cross Section reduction. This type of absorber has various applications in aerial vehicles, and the EM characteristics are widely tunable for specific purposes without changing the original shell structure.",

Tests were carried out by using both compact tension (CT) and single edge notched beam (SENB) specimens. Effect of the root radius of the starter notch was also investigated in order to find out its sensitivity on the fracture behavior. Although the load-displacement relation showed nonlinear behavior, the relation between the specimen compliance calculated by the straight line from the origin of the load-displacement axis and the measured crack length followed the polynomial equations based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics. Fracture toughness values were calculated by using the stress intensity factor. The relation between the fracture toughness and the increment of crack length (R-curve) was independent of the specimen shapes, the starter notch lengths, and the root radius of the starter notch. The fracture toughness values first increased rapidly until the increment of the crack length equaled 1 mm, and then leveled off. For the case of SENB specimens, tests without starter cracks were also carried out. These tests indicated that both the crack propagation behavior and the resultant R-curve were similar to those of normal SENB specimens. Comparison between the fracture toughness value and the bending strength yielded that the length of the latent crack is about 1 mm. X-ray observation showed that plenty of microcracks had already existed before the fracture load was applied. Microscopic observation showed that the crack growth process was characterized as pull-out of fibers. The length of fiber pull-out with the increment of crack growth was discussed in conjunction with the R-curve behavior.",

First of all, some problems of the conventional method using the laminate theory are pointed out. In order to develop an effective predicting method, a model on detailed structure of a unit cell for sandwich panels is developed utilizing the 3D finite element method. A periodic boundary condition is introduced to the model to represent the repetitive structures of the sandwich panel. The effective elastic modulus of the cell foil is obtained from the result of an out-of-plane compressive test on the honeycomb core. The adhesives between skin and core is modeled by considering its shape and quantity. The difference between the CTE according to this model and the actually measured one is approximately 0.1 × 10-6/K. The paper further attempts to explain the anisotropic character of the sandwich panel. The result of this analysis suggests that the direction-dependency of the CTE is underestimated with the fact that the effective elastic modulus at a portion where a ribbon is bonded with another one is different from the effective elastic modulus at a portion where the ribbon is on its own.",

Such values are determined by carrying out experiments on unidirectional test coupons. In this paper it is argued that the predicting the failure of multidirectional laminates based on the lamina to laminate approach cannot be accurately done using lamina properties obtained from unidirectional coupon test. Instead, one needs to obtain the effective properties of laminae as deduced from multidirectional laminate test. A method is therefore proposed to determine the effective tensile properties of a composite laminate. In particular, two types of composite materials were examined, namely carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy and glass fiber-reinforced epoxy. The failure behavior of laminates made from these materials is explained and the effect of multiple cracking in strength reduction is outlined. The experimental results confirm that the failure of multidirectional laminates cannot be accurately predicted using unidirectional laminae properties. Instead, the paper describes how to obtain the effective properties and shows that these are quite different from those obtained using unidirectional configurations.",

    "abstract": "From a practical point of view, a broadband radar absorbing sandwich structure (RAS) consisting of a glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP), a foam core, and a periodic pattern surface (PPS) was developed using the proposed equivalent pattern modeling method (EPMM). As implementable sheet resistance is limited by the electrical properties of conductive ink and the fabrication method, the design flexibility of PPS can be reduced. The EPMM allows a more flexible design with limited sheet resistance values. Using the EPMM, the initial pattern design with a sheet resistance was replaced with an implementable sheet resistance and a modified pattern. The – 10 dB bandwidth of the broadband RAS, which is designed using an equivalent pattern converted through the EPMM, was about 10 GHz. To demonstrate the proposed design method, the designed broadband RAS was fabricated using an autoclave process and measured using a free-space measurement system. The measurement result was well matched with the design, and the EPMM was confirmed to work well. From this study, it was confirmed that the proposed EPMM could extend the implementable range of sheet resistance that can be implemented as a material, thereby contributing to the implementation of more practical and high performance RAS.",

    "abstract": "Designing the structure of a wind turbine blade is a nontrivial task. Nowadays, finite element software is widely applied for its design and computation. However, huge computational resources and time are required for modeling and evaluation of large composite turbine blades. Additionally, a significant amount of design parameters is required to be handled; thereby, it is difficult to perform a systematic parametric study. This paper presents a preliminary procedure for the initial structural design of a large wind turbine blade based on the classical lamination theory (CLT). By analyzing the existing blade, the optimized numbers of the spar cap layers in the blades are estimated. Furthermore, a parametric study using the carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (GFRP) and glass fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) at multiple fiber orientation angles for the spar cap design is attempted with respect to the axial and twist coupling stiffness coefficients for each material design. Based on the constitutive equation, an analytical design approach of a laminated composite blade is developed and compared with a three-dimensional finite element blade model. The results show good agreement; thus, the design procedure provides a foundation for the initial structural design of a wind turbine blade.",

However, their application has been limited by their bio-inertness, which prevents them from directly bonding to the living bone. Therefore, the bioactivation of zirconia materials through the acid/alkali process has been studied. Currently, there is little information on the low-temperature degradation (LTD) behavior associated with this treatment. In this study, we investigated the degradation behavior of TZP or ATZ by examining the monoclinic fraction and biaxial flexure strength after immersion in sodium hydroxide or phosphoric acid aqueous solutions. The results showed that the monoclinic fraction increased significantly, indicating LTD at the surface, whereas the strength was not affected. In addition, more apatite formation was observed on TZP than on ATZ after immersion in SBF for 7 days. In particular, under the phosphoric acid treatment condition, almost the entire surface was covered with apatite. The contact angle measurement showed the possibility of predicting the apatite formation ability during immersion in SBF.",

    "abstract": "Composite lap joints have been extensively used due to their excellent properties and the demand for light structures. However, composites exhibit weak mechanical properties in their thickness, which may cause failure in composite lap joints. Various reinforcement methods that delay fracture by dispersing stress concentration have been discussed to overcome this problem, such as z-pinning and conventional stitching. After several studies and publications, the I-Fiber stitching process is a promising technology that combines the advantages of both z-pinning and the conventional stitching process. In this paper, the reinforcing effect of the I-Fiber stitching process was verified by fabricating composite single-lap joint specimens with different thicknesses, number of I-Fibers, and stitching angles to evaluate the lap shear strengths. Experimental results showed an improvement of up to 52.1% using the I-Fiber stitched process compared with the unstitched specimens. In addition, a better ratio of improvement in the reinforcement was observed with thinner composite adherends, and a higher failure load was achieved using a 45° stitching angle compared with 0°. Finally, through finite element analysis, it was possible to study the behavior and predict the interface failure of the single-lap joint. The results obtained showed good agreement with the experimental data and supported the failure mechanism’s understanding using the I-Fiber stitching process.",

First, an innovative experimental matrix is established considering the material and process variability, environmental conditions, lay-up, thickness, radius-to-thickness ratio, defects, and thermal cycles. Subsequently, four-point bending tests are performed on the L-shaped laminated specimens. The effects of each condition on ILTS are obtained, with an interpretation of the corresponding mechanism. The results demonstrated that the material and process variability for the ILTS is about 24%. The stress of the hygrothermally aged specimens was reduced by 34.84%, but the performance was improved by 64.63% at −55 °C. Moreover, it is worth noting that, among all the design factors, the initial defects resulted in a significant stress reduction of up to 63.94%. Finally, the design allowable values under different environmental conditions were accurately calculated by the proposed method. The experimental results have been compared with corresponding observations reported in the literature, exhibiting a good agreement.

In this approach, radar absorption performance is defined by the impedance characteristics from the pattern configuration, resistance, and properties of the substrate surrounding the pattern. Generally, a metal tends to reflect incident EM waves, but they can also have resistive characteristics for thicknesses of the material less than the skin depth. In this study, a periodic patterned layer was proposed with an ultra-thin layer of metallic particles using physical vapor deposition. The properties of the deposited layer for several metal types were studied; Ni was selected for the proposed layer for the patterned EM wave absorber based on its sheet resistance and low standard deviation. The sheet resistance of Ni was controlled by the deposition time, with a sheet resistance of 53 and 35 Ω/sq attained at deposition times of 4 and 9 s, respectively. The pattern configuration was designed and fabricated with consideration of the design frequency. The absorption characteristics were estimated by unit cell simulation and also measured in free space. The designed absorber exhibited a minimum reflection loss at 12 GHz. This work suggests the feasibility of a periodic patterned wave absorber made using a pure metallic layer.",

A common issue in the recycling processes is that neither oxygen nor solvents can easily penetrate dense CFRP; therefore, penetrating diffusion paths such as voids is expected to improve the separation efficiency. This study presents voids formation characteristics by low-temperature annealing as pre-treatment in typical epoxy-based cross-ply CFRP laminates. The void characteristics were evaluated by electrical treatment and observations after the annealing in the air or N2 atmosphere. Annealing in air resulted primarily in ply delamination and matrix cracking through slight oxidative reactions. By contrast, annealing in the N2 atmosphere denatured the epoxy resin, resulting in the formation of voids and swelling that reached the interior of the specimens. The void characteristics could be controlled by the atmosphere in the low-temperature annealing, leading to the penetrating diffusion paths.",

At sintering temperatures above 1500 °C, liquid-phase sintering occurred, resulting in substantial changes to the microstructure. The addition of alumina accelerated the phase transformation of hydroxyapatite into α-tricalcium phosphate. Furthermore, it was suggested that a mixture of calcium phosphate and alumina was formed at a sintering temperature of 1550 °C. Additionally, Young's modulus and compressive strength increased with increasing sintering temperature. The increase in compressive strength was due to the smoothening of the microstructural surface via liquid-phase sintering.",

Therefore, the study aimed at demonstrating how a finite element analysis (FEA) can assist the experimental design of an LW driven NDT process. For that, a numerical model was developed, capable of computing LW propagations in an exemplary component: Stringer-stiffened C-FRP panels. The study was divided into two parts: In this part, all information regarding the model building is presented and principal functionality demonstrated. In the second part, the FEA is validated and then used to perform parameter studies, highlighting important conditions for practical application. The results of the present paper showed that stiffeners provoke varying interactions with LW modes – effects that increase wave field complexity but do not limit defect identification within or behind the stringer.",

An interfacial debonding and sliding problem was formulated in this study, using the constrained conditional finite-element method (CC-FEM). In this formulation, the equivalence of nodal displacements at the interface and the equilibrium of contact forces are assumed as constrained conditions in which Coulomb’s law of friction is taken into account. As a distinguished advantage, numerical solutions are obtainable by a single calculation without an iterative algorism. We earlier treated a case in which fibers were oriented along the loading direction. In actual CMCs, however, fibers are not necessarily oriented along the loading direction. The fiber diameter also fluctuates along the axis. In this study, therefore, the off-axial interfacial debonding and sliding problem based on CC-FEM was formulated. Its validity was discussed by comparison with ANSYS. In both cases of on-axis and off-axis, the resultant fiber and matrix stress distributions agreed well with those of ANSYS. Comparison between on-axis and off-axis cases showed that the matrix stress in the latter recovered more steeply because of the higher equivalent friction coefficient.",

The stress concentration at the ends of the bondline for a single-lap joint can be suppressed by utilizing flexibility of the double-sided tapes. The double-sided tapes also make it easy to control the bondline thickness and to hold the adherends with their stickiness until complete cure. A tensile-shear test of the aluminum/acrylic joint verified that replacing both ends of the 30 mm bondline by the 3 mm double-sided tape improved the maximum load by more than 20%. The observation on the bonded area through the transparent acrylic plate revealed the suppression of the debonding initiation. On the other hand, the aluminum/aluminum joint did not show the significant increase in the maximum load, but suppressed the unstable interfacial debonding. The strain distribution obtained by digital image correlation method proved that the double-sided tape has the same effect of compressive strain generated in the flexible adhesive in bi-adhesive bondline.",

In this study, we create paint- and protective film-coated samples to reproduce repairs, measure their erosion resistance, and study underlying factors in an effort to verify the erosion resistance of repaired materials and associated mechanisms. The low erosion resistance of GFRP can be significantly improved by applying a protective film made of a ductile material. Such material effectively protects the surface of the GFRP. Moreover, the erosion resistance of protective films made from polyurethane material is superior to that of paint. We recommend use of protective film with wind turbine blades when manufacturing blades and regular maintenance.",

    "abstract": "In existing power devices, various insulating parts are manufactured with petroleum-based epoxy resin. However, as petroleum-based resources are gradually depleted and environmental problems have emerged, research on replacing petroleum-based products with eco-friendly materials as insulators has been actively conducted. Therefore, in this study, a molding simulation study of the Auto Pressure Gelation (APG) process, one of the leading technologies, was conducted to manufacture a gas insulated switchgear (GIS) spacer using an environmentally friendly bio-based epoxy composite. Using the heat dissipation and degree of cure obtained through the dynamic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test, it was applied to the Kamal-Sourour model which is a representative curing dynamics empirical formula. In addition, the viscosity change during the curing process was measured using a rheometer and applied to the cross Castro-Macoskco model. The results obtained were in good agreement with the experimental values. The parameters calculated above and other physical property values were input into Moldflow software, and simulation was performed targeting the three-phase spacer. While changing the temperature setting of the mold, the change and distribution of flow, temperature, and curing degree inside the product were observed during the reactive molding process. As a result, it was found that there was a possibility of clogging of the mold entrance at some set temperatures, and it was possible to suggest improvement directions to solve this problem. Through this series of research process, it is considered that it will be of great help in improving the quality problems of molded products and the process accordingly.",

    "abstract": "The success of replacement of damaged bone tissue by porous ceramic scaffolds is determined not only by biochemical compatibility of the artificial material, but also by a set of interrelated morphological and mechanical characteristics. But even if all parameters are optimized, the implant can be rejected on account of the low cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is the first step towards the survival of the implant material. Therefore, a challenging issue is still the search for mechanisms of controlling the behavior of cells on the surface of the implant. According to new ideas, the cellular response is influenced no only by the chemical composition and surface energy of the implant but also by the material structure at the micro- and nanoscale levels. To date, the only way to take into account structural features of a material is to determine the fractal dimension. The paper is devoted to the study of structure-property-adhesion relationships at different scale levels of ZrO2 and ZrO2-Al2O3 bioceramics with pore structures of different morphology. Physical regularities are revealed for the relationship between the geometry of pore-forming particles, crystal structure parameters, strength, and fracture toughness of the ceramics. The correlation between the fractal dimension as an integral morphological characteristic of the material and the cellular activity of the 3T3 line is evaluated for the first time. This can be a universal method for assessing the relationship between the structure and osteoreplacement efficiency of ceramics.",

Though ultra-high temperature experimental studies for C/C composites have been performed, the effect of neither temperature nor heating/cooling speed on material properties have been fully made clear yet. In this paper, highfrequency induction heating material testing system developed by us is presented first; the main advantage of this system is the capability of quite fast heating and cooling speed. After verifying the temperature distribution of the specimen, some experimental studies are performed for two types of non-oxidation-protected C/C composites whose heat treatment temperatures are 1600 and 3000° C. Obtained results are summarized as follows; (1) Only tensile strength tends to decrease when cooling speed becomes fast although heating speed does not have an influence upon both thermal and mechanical properties of C/C composites. This phenomenon may be the effect of microcracks in the matrix of C/C composites. Therefore, it is important to investigate the effect of cooling speed and the number of heat cycles on material properties for the practical use of C/C composites. (2) Serial data are obtained about the dependence of temperature on tensile modulus, tensile strength and coefficient of thermal expansion. Especially, a characteristic feature of C/C composites which is so called 'inverse temperature dependence of the strength' is made clear, i.e., the strength increases gradually with elevating temperature. Furthermore, the mechanism of this phenomenon is discussed from the viewpoint of the release of residual stress.

The results were then compared with microscopic observations of fracture surfaces and dynamic viscoelastic properties to explain the radiation-induced degradation mechanisms. The sensitivity of radiation-induced degradation was much more pronounced in GIc than in Gmc, or in the interlaminar shear strength. Interlaminar fracture toughness measurements were found necessary for proper evaluation of the radiation-induced degradation of FRP composites. For GFRP, a significant decrease in GIc was found. Debonding of glass fibers and epoxy matrix (or degradation of silane coupling agents) plays an important role in degradation, in addition to resin degradation. Thus, the improvement of the radiation resistance of fiber-resin interfaces as well the matrix itself is of supreme importance in order to increase the radiation resistance of GFRP. For CFRP, on the other hand, no degradation in fiber-resin interfaces was found in irradiated specimens, and the slight decrease in GIc seems to be due to resin degradation.",

The formulation is rigorous in the sense that if the effective moduli (compliances) are exact, the effective thermal expansion coefficients are also exact. The transversely isotropic nature of the whole composite is incorporated in the self-consistent model in which a single fiber is surrounded by an infinite matrix whose composite properties are transversely isotropic.

The mode II interlaminar fracture toughness was determined by a compliance calibration method. The tests were performed in the range of the a/L ratio from 0.5 to 0.9. Both composites, T300/M10 and HTA/6376, exhibited brittle unstable and brittle stable behavior of crack growth. Stable mode II crack growth was observed during fatigue loading with R = 0.1 in a large range of cyclic strain energy release rate. A consistent relation of the crack growth rate to the cyclic strain energy release rate was obtained for both T300/M10 and HTA/6376 composites. Within the range of moderate crack growth rate, the data of mode II fatigue crack growth for the composites obeyed a power law. The trend of reduction in the crack growth rate data with degradation in the cyclic strain energy release rate suggests the presence of a threshold strain energy release rate. Compared with T300/914C, HTA/6376 and T300/M10 have a higher crack growth resistance. Keywords: Carbon/epoxy compositeDelaminationStrain energy release rateFatigue crack growthThreshold",

    "abstract": "Abstract Continuous fibre reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CFCCs) show a scatter in parameters such as first matrix cracking stress, initial elastic modulus, ultimate strength, etc. which characterise their mechanical behaviour. This scatter can be attributed to a large extent to variations in the axial residual stress state from specimen to specimen. Under some circumstances even negative strain accumulation with increasing stress has been observed during tensile loading of CFCCs. Examples of such anomalous stress-strain behaviour are shown, and its occurrence is explained by the presence of an axial residual stress state which differs from that induced by the thermal expansion mismatch between the fibres and the matrix. Microstructural features leading to the establishment of such an abnormal residual stress state are indicated. Combining these observations it appears that variation in the residual stress state explains both the scatter observed in tests exhibiting normal behaviour, and in tests with anomalous stress-strain behaviour. The latter is hence only a manifestation of extreme scatter in the axial residual stresses. Keywords: Continuous fibre reinforced ceramic compositestress-strain behaviourscatterresidual stress",

Materials and processes were appropriately selected, validated with flexural tests on scaled-down and full-sized concrete beams and implemented in a vehicular bridge in the field. The durability of this rehabilitation scheme was evaluated from actual exposure in service. From the results emerged a novel concept: the use of composite rods (instead of plates), embedded in longitudinal grooves in the lower face of the beam to improve flexural strength and stiffness. In addition to improved affordability, convenience and performance, this approach provides the unique ability to rehabilitate deteriorated concrete beams, in service, without the necessity of strengthening or otherwise preparing the concrete.

After solid solution and aging treatment, the bending strength of the composites in both 0% and 50% f s process was decreased.

Microyield strength could be strongly affected by heat treatment routes.

An optimization technique is utilized to determine the optimum stacking sequences. An alternative method is developed based on the identification of a parameter controlling the optimum stacking sequence. Comparison of associated extension–twist coupling values demonstrates their accuracy. It is observed that as the number of plies increases, the optimum stacking sequence follows an asymptotic behavior and that an angle ply system does not represent an optimum stacking sequence. The results are validated through manufacturing of candidate laminates.",

Since the application of linear control theory to the vibration control is very difficult due to the intensive nonlinearity of the ERF actuator, a fuzzy model of the controlled element containing two actuators is constructed. In this study, the time delay of the response of the actuator is also taken into consideration. A controller for vibration suppression of the composite beam is designed based on the fuzzy model for guaranteeing stability of the vibration control system.

The sensor feasibility was confirmed by investigating the erosion characteristics of FRP with an embedded OF and conducting tests to detect abrasion based on the light attenuation.

    "abstract": "This study focuses on understanding and modeling the physical phenomena that occur in degraded zones of silica-phenolic (SiFRP) materials under exposure to high-temperature gasses when applied to a liquid rocket engine (LRE) combustor. Although understanding and modeling these phenomena is considered essential in designing an LRE combustor, few studies on these fields can be found in the available literature. Basically, it is well known that when ablators are heated, a pyrolysis reaction proceeds in them, forming three distinct zones: a charred, a decomposed, and a virgin zone. The obtainable information for the thermal response of SiFRP in ground-firing tests is classified in two categories. The first category involves the equilibrium state characteristics after a long time has elapsed following burnout. This refers to the degraded thickness distribution, which reflects 3D information (the combustor's inner surface x the thickness direction) regarding the heat load distribution over the entire combustor's inner surface, owing to the highly insulating nature of SiFRP. The second category involves the transient characteristics of the propagation of the degraded zones in SiFRP, which can be detected using an ultrasonic testing (UT) method. In this paper, the progress of in-depth phenomena of SiFRP and their physical variations were intentionally studied. Our aim was to clarify and specify the quantitative threshold values of the interface points that characterize each degraded zone and the UT reflection point, and then express these values in terms of physical quantities that could appear in a numerical analysis.",

The domain switching effect that has strong influence on the performance of LIPCA was recorded. While a longitudinally compressed stress state within the PZT (lead zirconate titanate, Pb[Zr(x)Ti(1–x)]O3) layer in LIPCA is preferable to avoid failure during operation, experimental results showed that, for the transverse loading cases, the actuator should be arranged in a manner such that the stress state within the PZT is in as much tension as possible to encourage the non-180° domain switching. With investigated loading cases in this paper, suitable arrangements could help improve the actuation performance. The improvement can be up to almost 33% in simply-supported with center loading and 140% in clamped tip loading case.",

The plate is a simplified model of stiffener plates. In the present paper two loading edges are fixed and a side edge is simply-supported. The delamination locates at the free edge over the whole length. A Rayleigh-Ritz approximation method is adopted in the analysis. A constrained point is used to allow contacts between the two delaminated surfaces. At this point, relative displacement and two relative slopes are constrained through imaginary springs. The buckling load of the geometrically admissible buckling mode is obtained by an ordinary eigenvalue analysis. The analytical results are compared with the experiment and the results agree well. The effects of the width and the location of the delamination on the buckling behavior are studied analytically for the plates with various aspect ratios. Low local delamination buckling can occur at very low load when the delamination locates near the surface and its size is relatively large compared with that of the plate. The constrained point is shown to be effective for the buckling analysis of the delaminated plates.",

For delamination fatigue crack propagation tests, double cantilever beam specimens made of unidirectional laminates were used. For the tension fatigue tests, the slope of the relation between the normalized maximum stress and the number of cycles to failure was very small. For delamination fatigue crack growth tests, the exponent of the power function in the relation between the crack propagation rate and the stress intensity range was very large. The analysis of the equivalent stress intensity range proposed by the authors showed that the contribution of the maximum stress was large in delamination fatigue crack propagation. A similar analysis was applied to the results of the tension fatigue tests. The contribution of the maximum stress was also large in tension fatigue fracture. The degree of the contribution of the maximum stress in the tension fatigue tests was almost the same as that in the delamination fatigue crack growth tests.

These preforms can be used as basic filament yarns that can be interwoven, braided or knitted for making two- or three-dimensional composite parts. Commingled yarns and powder/sheath fibre bundles retain the flexibility of a tow such that when a fabric is woven from these materials, the fabric can be designed to be highly conformable and drapeable. When heat and pressure are then applied, the thermoplastic yarn or powder/sheath melts, thus wetting the reinforcing fibres and forming a thermoplastic resin binder. In the subsequent cooling step, the system is transformed into a rigid composite material. In this paper, major achievements in the study of the fundamental mechanisms which govern the impregnation process, the consolidation quality and the resulting mechanical properties of CF/PEEK commingled yarn and powder/sheath fibre bundle composites are highlighted.

This theory is based on the superposition of a global higher order shear deformation displacement field and a local linear zig-zag displacement field (RHOT). RHOT automatically satisfies displacement continuity at the layer interfaces and by further application of stress continuity at the layer interfaces and traction free boundary conditions, the unknown degrees of freedom are reduced to seven regardless of the number of layers. These are two in-plane displacements, two shear rotations, a transverse displacement and two section rotations. A four-node sector finite element in a cylindrical coordinate system is developed using RHOT. Two in-plane displacements and two shear rotations which are C0 continuous are interpolated using bilinear functions and a transverse displacement and two section rotations which are C1 continuous are interpolated using higher order Hermitian functions. In-plane normal stress and inter-lamina transverse shear stress variation through the thickness are calculated for laminated disks using a RHOT sector element and comparison is made with first order shear deformation theory predictions. The present work precedes the application of the zig-zag theory to transient dynamic analysis and is a first step at establishing the accuracy of implementing the zig-zag theory into a sector finite element.",

This paper describe the results of the compression response of E-glass/epoxy composite laminated tubes under an axial compression pressure using a finite element method and experimental test. Normal stresses as well as the interlaminar normal and the interlaminar shear stresses are calculated using the finite element method. The effect of the thickness of the layers, the winding angle, and the endcaps on the strength of the composite tubes are investigated. The Tsai-Wu and the maximum stress failure criteria are used to discuss the failure response of the tubes. Although the samples which have only layers with fiber orientation ±10° should give the highest compressive strength according to the classical laminate theory, the experimental results do not agree with the lamination theory in this point and delamination of the ±10° layers occurs and the maximum strength drops. The results also indicate that the interaction between the stresses can lead to failure processes even the stresses are still under the maximum allowable values.",

We utilized 480 pieces of PZT bonded on the inner surface of the structure as sensors and actuators. We applied random noise in the low frequency range from 0 to 500 Hz to the test model. By controlling the PZTs, we tried to reduce the vibration level of the structure and the internal air due to the external load. Two control methods, gain control and feed-forward control, were tried. We measured internal sound pressure at 150 points and compared the overall values of sound pressure with gain control to those without control and evaluated the reduction capabilities. The tests demonstrated a maximum 4.0 dB O.A. reduction with gain control and a maximum 3.5 dB O.A. reduction with feed-forward control. Keywords: PZTVIBRATION CONTROLACOUSTIC CONTROLC/EP COMPOSITE",

When the tensile pre-strained SMA foil is heated, the SMA produces appropriate compressive stress (recovery stress) to suppress the transverse cracks in the laminates. In order to investigate the damage suppression effect, tensile loading–unloading tests were conducted for the CFRP cross-ply laminates. The test results implied that the recovery stress of embedded SMA foil suppressed the occurrence and the progress of the transverse crack. Then, to confirm that the damage suppression effect was caused by the embedded SMA foil, the one-dimensional (1D) shear-lag model considering the behavior of SMA was newly derived. Using this model, the progress of transverse crack density was predicted probabilistically. The simulation results showed the same tendency as the experimental results. As a result, it was proved that the embedment of SMA foils into CFRP laminates is effective to suppress the occurrence and growth of the transverse cracks.",

Unfortunately, the present synthesis technique of calcium carbonate whisker starts from calcinations of limestone, which involves high energy consumption and furthermore is a highly environment polluting reaction. In this report, needle-like aragonite was synthesized with a reversible solution reaction from limestone without calcination. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were used to characterize the morphology and crystal structure of intermediates as well as that of the product, aragonite. GCC (grinding calcium carbonate) powder was dissolved in an aqueous solution of magnesium sulfate with reflux and air flush. EDTA titration was used to evaluate reaction rate of the dissolution. A kinetics equation of the dissolution reaction was constructed, which displayed second-order kinetics with respect to the concentration of magnesium sulfate. A rate constant of 0.0015 l–3 · mol–1 · h–1 was obtained. The dissolution reaction gave fiber-like magnesium hydroxide sulfate and gypsum crystal. Then needle-like aragonite with a length of 9.13 ± 1.02 μm and an aspect ratio of 5.64 ± 1.37 was synthesized from the dissolution product with CO2 bubbling at 70°C.

In this type of joint, the sandwich panel is tapered to form a solid laminate comprising two face plates near the joint, and the two panels to be joined are mechanically fastened at the solid laminate with a splice plate. This type of joint may be suitable for aircraft panels because a flat surface can be obtained at the joint, which is advantageous from an aerodynamic viewpoint. However, in a previous study on such a joint, it was found that a delamination crack initiated from the tapered core end and propagated through the interface between the two face plates as an initial failure mode at a much lower tensile load than the final failure load in a tensile strength test. In this study, the angle of the tapered panel was focused on and the effect of changing the taper angle on suppressing the initial failure was investigated through experiments and numerical analysis. It was found that a smaller taper angle is more effective for suppressing the initial failure.",

Numerous researches have been reported about residual stresses in the composite structures.

Therefore, in this study, the thermal residual stresses of FSS-embedded composite structures were analyzed using finite element analysis, with considering the effect of FSS pattern and size. Various FSS patterns, such as square loop, gridded square loop, and double square loop, are considered in the analysis.

They are mostly used in laminate form and are stronger within layers than between layers, making them prone to cracking and peeling. This type of structural degradation can be dangerous during operation. For this reason, research on FRP composites with the ability to self-repair has attracted much attention. In this study, we developed a new method to repair glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites by using ultraviolet-(UV) cured resin. As GFRP composites are UV transmissive, the repair process can be carried out externally by exposing the damaged part to UV light. The transmittance of EP GFRP is about 40%. Holes were pre-drilled with wires in order to facilitate the injection of UV resin between the layers of the composite, and this process was accomplished without degrading the mechanical properties of the material. A double cantilever beam (DCB) test was performed on the GFRP composite to induce interlaminar fracturing. UV-curable resin was then injected between the layers of the composite through a series of pre-drilled holes. Following this repair, the DCB test was performed again to evaluate the repair rate. A compressive after impact (CAI) test was also performed on the GFRP composite to induce delamination. Compressive strength before and after the repair was also evaluated.",

    "abstract": "One of the methods most widely used in non-destructive testing of materials is ultrasonics. However, in many applications the result is treated as a binary value (good or bad) regardless of the enormous amount of information embedded in an ultrasonic A-scan. A small number of users can go beyond this binary threshold by identifying the defect based on years of practical experience. However, when material properties differ from the isotropic ones, the complexity of the total system becomes such that identification by human judgment becomes practically impossible even though this information is available in the signal. Pattern recognition techniques applied on these ultrasonic signals have proved the ability to identify defects with a much lower error rate (compared with the statistical one) when no prior information is available. Thus providing a non-binary result by high-level expertise of the signal. At first, the time domain signal (A-scan) is digitized and stored. Based on these data, numerical algorithms return frequency, autocorrelation, crosscorrelation, convolution and deconvolution domain data. In order to reduce the number of data without losing any information, descriptors are defined and calculated in each domain (i.e. number of peaks above a certain level, peak amplitudes, peak position, peak area, interpeak distance and many others). These descriptors are believed to 'fully' describe the original A-scan. Identification of defects is done by classifying the signal under investigation in one of the predefined classes to distinguish. Before classification is possible, the system has to be 'learned' by a given set of signals of which the class is known a priori. Depending on these classes, only a small number of descriptors will be sensitive, meaning that the variability of a descriptor must be minimal in its own class compared with its variability between classes. This is known as the Wilk's lambda criterion. Choosing the most sensitive descriptors defines the features which are going to be used for further classification. Classification of unknown signals in comparison with the known signals based on these features can be done by different classification schemes. The ones used in this application are the k-nearest neighbor classifier, the modified k-nearest neighbor classifier, the potential function classifier, the linear classifier and the F-machine. Practical results will show classification success on laminated carbon/epoxy specimens with embedded foreign bodies like aluminium and teflon as defects. Discussion will be made of different values of this success rate using different features and different classification schemes.",

    "abstract": "Several kinds of SiC-based ceramic fibers are presently fabricated on an industrial scale using precursor polymers. The Si-C-O ceramic fiber that was first developed in 1975, has high tensile strength and relatively high heat resistance. The Si-Ti-C-O fibers emerged after the Si-C-O fiber was developed. These fibers have been applied as reinforcement for aluminum wire, glass-ceramics, or silicon carbide matrix composite materials. Through the research work on these fiber reinforced metal or ceramic matrix composites, these fibers have increased heat resistance. In the past ten years, a new fabrication process of the fiber, a radiation curing method, has been developed. In addition, the conversion process of polymer precursors to ceramics and the thermal stability of the fibers have been widely studied at high-temperatures ranging above 1500 K. These research works have successfully produced excellent SiC-based ceramic fibers with high-temperature resistance. These fibers are mainly prepared from polycarbosilane family polymers. In the future, in order to strengthen the ceramic fibers and to establish a low-cost fabrication process, more effective precursor polymers will need to be developed.",

The similarity law to estimate the two-dimensional (2D) elastic bulk wave behavior in CFRP with concentrically curved fibers was presented in our previous study. In this research, the three-dimensional (3D) propagation of bulk waves in CFRPs with concentrically curved fibers was examined. Using 3D-printed CFRP specimens, the 3D propagation behavior of the quasi-longitudinal wave emitted from the point source was visualized virtually. Considering these results, the similarity law was expanded to the case of the 3D propagation behaviors of the bulk waves. Mathematical discussion based on the governing equations shows that the expansion parameters need to be equal in both the thickness and the radial directions to satisfy the similarity law in the 3D case, in addition to the conditions required to satisfy the 2D similarity law. By conducting the experimental visualization, it was demonstrated that the shape changes of quasi-longitudinal waves follow the similarity law, which was eventually verified for 3D propagation.",

Fatigue behaviour is an important aspect in metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) and needs to be investigated. In the proposed model, the low cycle fatigue (LCF) behaviour of MMNCs is considered as a localized damage development (i.e. fatigue crack growth) phenomenon under cyclic loading. The actual degradation takes place within the fatigue damage zone (FDZ) that lies very near to the crack-tip and dominates the whole LCF behaviour. The strengthening factors considered in the present study include: Orowan strengthening effect, dislocation density of matrix, load-bearing reinforcement effect, the porosity and microstructural properties of the MMNCs. For validation, the proposed model has been explored to fit on several reported experimental data sets and it is found to offer good prediction and statistically in agreement with the data. Further, to observe the impact of various model parameters, sensitivity analysis has also been performed and reported that a small change in cyclic strength coefficient resulted the maximum deviation and the change in porosity the least. The presented investigations in this work, represents detailed model development and sensitivity analysis of fatigue crack growth life of MMNCs.",

The tests were conducted with the samples with and without channel according to ASTM D7264. Interestingly, the vascularized samples showed a higher maximum flexural modulus and stress than the non-vascularized ones. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed to analyze the stresses at the regions close to the channel.

Notably, the fatigue strength of the NM configuration was 1.7 times higher than the virgin configuration, and the run-out point analysis revealed that the nanofiber veil has excellent potential to extend the material fatigue strength range and optimize the fatigue energy absorption capability of composite material.

It was observed from the experiments that diameters of reinforcement and matrix filaments have strong effects particularly on the pattern of mixing of filaments over a cross-section of hybrid yarns such that the hybrid yarns with more or less equal diameters of reinforcement and matrix filaments showed considerably even distributions over the hybrid yarn cross-section. This paper also investigates the possibility of hybridizing carbon/aramid, carbon/glass and aramid/glass matrices through the commingling process. In the experiment, several process parameters were selected and they include pressure, yarn oversupply-rate and different nozzle types. As a result of these experiments, it was concluded that the hybridized materials show better performance than individual reinforced filament yarns in terms of mechanical properties.

A one-parameter and a two-parameter plastic potential are employed to describe post-yielding behavior of composite laminae. Nonlinear elastic shear strain is measured by means of loading/unloading tensile tests of [±45°]s specimens. Off-axis tensile tests are performed to obtain the universal effective stress-effective plastic strain relation under monotonic loading.

    "abstract": "In this paper the post-impact cyclic-dynamic properties and the compression-after-impact strength of glass/epoxy laminates with different fiber surface treatment are discussed. It was found that the fiber/matrix adhesion quality significantly affects the compression strength of glass/epoxy cross-ply laminates. The residual compression strength is a function of the adhesion quality at the fiber/matrix interface. The cyclic-dynamic tests have shown that the dynamic strength under tensional loading is qualitatively comparable to the results of the compression-after-impact test with respect to the examined materials. The dynamic stiffness of the plates is significantly reduced in the case of poor fiber/matrix adhesion compared to the specimen with good and medium adhesion. The damage growth in the impacted plates during the cyclic-dynamic testing is also a function of the adhesion quality. The stiffness decreases and the energy absorption increases much faster in the case of poor fiber/matrix adhesion which indicates the poor damage tolerance of these laminates. A linear relation was found between the accumulated dissipated energy and the specimen temperature rise.",

    "abstract": "An advanced solid reducing agent, i.e., a CaO/SiO2 composite has been optimized to improve the hydrogen fluoride (HF; a green house gas) elimination in semiconductor-based industrial applications. To avoid the Ca(OH)2 formation and enhance the HF removal efficiency of CaO, the hydrophobic properties of silica (SiO2) have used as a catalyst materials to enhance the stability of CaO/SiO2 solid reducing agent in the present investigation. The novel composite structure based on CaO/SiO2 was prepared using various concentrations of hydrophobic nano-silica sol and Ca(OH)2. The composite was characterized by contact angle goniometry, thermogravimetry analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The water contact angle of the CaO/SiO2 composites significantly increased with increasing SiO2 content. In particular, angles of 61.6°, 73.7°, 84.8°, and 84.9° were obtained for SiO2 concentrations of 20, 40, 60, and 80 wt.%, respectively. These results suggest that the hydrophobic nature of the composites was improved with the addition of 60 and 80 wt.% of SiO2. Moreover, the surface properties were measured using the nitrogen Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method for obtaining the weight ratios (wt.%) and calcinations times. The determined specific surface areas (SSAs) were 16.19, 27.25, 32.86, and 40.56 m2/g for 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, and 20:80 CaO/SiO2 composites, respectively. From the water contact angle and SSA analysis, the optimum hydrophobic nature of CaO/SiO2 composites for HF removal was achieved at a weight ratio of 40:60 (Ca(OH)2/SiO2) at the calcination temperature of 650 °C. The perfluorinated compound (PFC) removal rate is 80 and 88% for a common regenerative catalytic system (RCS) catalyst and the CaO/SiO2 reaction-enhanced (RE)-RCS catalyst, respectively. In addition, higher amount of HF elimination is successfully achieved using CaO/SiO2 solid reducing agent. During the RE-RCS process, SiO2 acts as a catalyst to prevent the formation of Ca(OH)2 when CaO is exposed to water.",

PEI melt viscosity significantly decreased with addition of PEN and PET, which greatly improved impregnation during GMT manufacture. The tensile strength and CTE of GMTs containing up to 30% PEN or PET remained similar to that of PEI/GM, while the flexural modulus increased and the gas barrier properties improved two fold.

A column-like pillar was observed between the fronds during the crushing.

    "abstract": "Epoxy resin is a thermosetting resin with excellent mechanical properties. It has been pointed out that there are problems on its mechanical properties due to poor polymerization of the epoxy ring caused by water and chlorine impurities during resin production. In this study, we focused on the electrochemical behavior during curing reaction of epoxy resin. To investigate the electrochemical reaction, galvanostat meter was used to measure the voltage behavior during chemical reaction. Molecular Orbital (MO) method was used to understand the mechanisms of voltage behavior during curing reaction. Furthermore, the effect of water existence during curing reaction was investigated by experimentally and analytically. As a result of experimental electrochemical reaction, we successfully measured the voltage behavior associated with the curing reaction. In the case of MO analysis, the epoxy and curing agent models were prepared. Before the reaction, each molecule had zero charge, but after the reaction, it was confirmed that the epoxy had a positive charged and the amine had a negative charged. It is thought that the voltage could be observed due to the movement of this charge during curing reaction. It has been also demonstrated through experimentation and analysis that water accelerates the curing reaction. It was observed that the accelerating effect amplifies as the quantity of water increases. Building upon these results, it was confirmed that the factor leading to the increase in voltage is due to the amount of water. To examine the presence of chlorine impurities during the production of epoxy resin, MO analysis was conducted on the production reaction of epoxy prepolymers. The findings indicated that as the water content increases, the reaction that results in the production of by-products is amplified. This outcome suggested that by-products were already incorporated during the formation of the epoxy. In conclusion, this study provides significant insights into the electrochemical behavior during the curing reaction of epoxy resin, the role of water in accelerating the reaction, and the impact of chlorine impurities during resin production. The findings pave the way for further research to optimize the production process and enhance the mechanical properties of epoxy resin.",

Furthermore, the pull-off fatigue strength achieved by the jagged pins was 52% higher than that of regular pins.

    "abstract": "This study aims to derive explicit solutions for the effective thermal and electromagnetic properties of composite materials containing coated fillers oriented randomly. In this study, the coated fillers are modeled as double inhomogeneous inclusions with anisotropic properties and ellipsoidal shapes, without loss of generality. This model is analyzed by combining the double inclusion method with the self-consistent method or the Mori–Tanaka method. The derived solutions for the effective properties are expressed in explicit form by the physical properties of constituents and the difference in shape between the inner and outer regions of the coated fillers, and confirmed to be consistent in the limit of no coating layer. In addition, the solutions of effective properties are also derived for composite materials containing many kinds of coated fillers with different shapes and physical properties. The solutions allow the prediction of thermal conductivity, permittivity, electrical conductivity, and magnetic permeability of a wide range of composite materials by analogy with thermal and electromagnetic properties. These solutions are applied to the following two composites: diamond fillers coated with TiC/Al, and Co fillers coated with Co3O4/Mg. The effect of the thickness of the coating layer on the effective thermal conductivity of these materials is investigated. As a result, our analytical results for these composite materials generally agree with the experimental results. Moreover, from the viewpoint of maximizing the thermal conductivity of diamond fillers coated with TiC/Al, the optimal combinations of the thickness of the coating layer and the shape of the diamond fillers are identified. For Co coated with Co3O4/Mg, we find that the shape of Co fillers should be long fibrous from the viewpoint of giving high magnetic permeability while maintaining high thermal conductivity due to Mg. Thus, the analytical solutions are demonstrated to be powerful tools for designing composite materials containing coated fillers.",

The novelty of this study was the obtained Mn0.5Fe2.5O4@C/ZnO-DOX nanocomposite as a good candidate as an antibacterial agent and drug delivery material. The IR spectra showed that the samples were successfully formed. The vibrations of Fe–O and Mn–O were detected at 678.94–563.21cm−1, and that of Zn–O was located at 933.55–867.97cm−1. Meanwhile, the XRD pattern showed that the samples have two crystal phases, i.e. magnetite and ZnO. The nanostructure of the samples was studied by SAXS, showing that the Mn0.5Fe2.5O4@C/ZnO-DOX nanocomposite formed clustering particles that were structured by secondary and primary particles. The secondary particles in the samples contained about 3–4 primary particles. The magnetic properties were characterized using VSM, showing that the samples have superparamagnetic behavior. The increase in ZnO mass affected the saturation magnetization value. The highest saturation magnetization value was approximately 8.66 emu/g for the sample with the smallest ZnO mass. The samples contained Fe2+, Fe3+, and ZnO2+ ions, which created oxidative stress that damaged the DNA cells of bacteria, as seen from the results of the antibacterial activity test.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the energy absorption performance of braided composite tubes under combined shear-compression loading is investigated. ABAQUS/Explicit is employed to analyze the energy absorption of braided composite tubes, and quasi-static compression tests are carried out. Braided composite materials absorb energy through the damage accumulation in laminate. Thus, to maximize energy absorption performance, a progressive crushing mode should be induced. While extensive research has been conducted on cases of axial loading, understanding of the energy absorption performance of braided composite tubes under combined shear-compression loading remains limited. Experimental results reveal that under both axial and combined shear-compression loading at 30 degrees, the braided composite tube exhibits a progressive crushing mode. The test results are utilized to validate the finite element model. Through finite element analysis, it is confirmed that the damage accumulation in laminate is maximized due to the induction of a progressive crushing mode. It means that the energy absorption principles of braided composites apply similarly to combined shear-compression loading, allowing for the maintenance of superior energy absorption performance of braided composites under various load angles.",

    "abstract": "Biomass and its derived carbon materials, due to their glorious application value in the field of microwave absorption, have sparked a new round of research boom. Hereinto, platan seeds-derived carbon-based materials (PSC), offspring from direct carbonization of platan seeds, were ulteriorly processed and subjected to high-temperature carbonization treatment to synthesis PSC/Ni/Co composite with diversified morphology and tunable microwave absorption performance. The effect of nickel and cobalt ion concentrations on the absorption performance of composite materials was investigated in depth. The optimum reflection loss value (RLmin) of PSC/Ni can reach −47.36 dB, while its effective absorption broadband (EAB) is 5.8 GHz, ranging from 12–17.8 GHz, covering almost the whole Ku band. Compared with PSC/Ni composites, PSC/Co fulfils greater advantages in thickness and bandwidth. As for PSC/Ni/Co, the sample exhibits the optimal performance when Ni and Co ions are at equal concentrations, with an RLmin of −48.3 dB and an EAB of 5 GHz (13–18 GHz), which congealed the edges of both. Unequivocally, the morphological polymorphism of carbon-based-derived microwave absorbing materials with platan seeds as the carbon source is crucial to harvset lightweight, efficient and adjustable absorption properties, let alone its relatively simple and feasible preparation method. This may provide a new approach for engineering light-weight, cost effective and eco-friendly absorbing materials.",

The local buckling coefficient for various geometries and different composites are obtained.

The addition of decreased amounts of the curing agents significantly lowers the degree of cure and the properties of cured resin, but that of the accelerator does not.

The compressive failure tests were also carried out and the acoustic emission was measured. The shear modulus of epoxy did not decrease until a high compressive strain was applied. Therefore, the previous theories for the compressive strength which require the decrease of shear modulus of epoxy under the compressive stress should be questioned. Young's modulus and the shear modulus of composites suddenly decreased at a load about 10-20% lower than the compressive fracture load, and the numbers of events of acoustic emission rapidly increased. Scanning electron micrographs have shown that the section of the failed fiber is skewed and stepwise, (characteristics different from those of the tensile fracture). The stresses caused by the difference between Poisson's ratio of the fiber and that of the matrix under a compressive load and the thermal residual stress produced in the process of curing have been analytically calculated on the assumption of an hexagonal array of fibers. The results have revealed that those two stresses cannot be the factors that determine the compressive strength of the composites. A formula to express the effect of compressive load on the torsional deformation has been obtained for the square section on the assumption of no warping constraint.",

The dependence of the extent of damage in the samples with a hole under tensile loading on the laminate lay-up was analyzed by a finite element analysis. The damage tolerance is then related to the actual damage extension from the hole perpendicularly to the applied load. It is shown that the damage tolerance of biomimetic laminate is more advantageous than the two other laminates. The implications of the findings for the design of damage-tolerant laminates are further discussed. It is also shown from the results of compression after impact test that the sensitivity of biomimetic laminate to the presence of delamination damage is significantly lower than that of quasi-isotropic and cross-ply laminates.",

Then, the energy release rate is calculated by finite element analysis. From the in-situ observation, it is found that the interface fracture initiates when the radial stress around the fiber changes from compression to tension due to the Poisson's effect (applied stress ⩾40 MPa). The length of the crack is proportional to the stress as the load increases. It is also found analytically that the energy release rates remain constant once the interface fractures, independent of the initial crack length. It is suggested that the critical energy release rate can be appropriated for the interface fracture criterion.",

Shear waves transmitted through or reflected from a laminate therefore contain information about its stacking sequence and layup orientation. In the case of transmission, one can also exploit the analogy with the polarizer-analyzer configuration in optics. It has been shown that the interaction between shear waves and fiber directions can lead to high sensitivity for the detection of certain errors in the layup or stacking sequence of a laminate. This paper describes a complete analytical model for the propagation of shear waves in a laminate using local and global transfer matrices. Transmitted and reflected signal amplitude as a function of angle and time (or frequency) can be predicted for a given input. Experimental results are also shown for a transmission setup that uses electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) for the generation and reception of normal incidence shear waves in cured and uncured composite laminates.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental investigation of the effect of concrete compressive strength, strengthening ratio and corner radius on the behavior of small-scale square columns wrapped with carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials. A total of 39 specimens (150 × 150 × 300 mm) wrapped with one, two, and three plies of CFRP wraps were tested. In addition to the FRP jacket thickness, the effect of three different concrete mixes and four cases of corner radius were examined. The effective circumferential CFRP failure strain and the effect of the effective lateral confining pressure were investigated. The obtained results show that the CFRP reinforced columns provide a significant increase in ultimate conditions (strength and ductility) compared to the case of the unconfined specimens. It can be seen that higher concrete compressive strength and lower strengthening ratio reduce the effect of confinement with CFRP material. The test results demonstrated that the corner radius ratio is in direct proportion to the increase in confined concrete strength. A new model is presented to predict the compressive axial strength and corresponding strain of CFRP-confined columns based on the effective lateral strain of FRP material.",

Good agreement between the theoretical prediction of dense FSMA models and published experimental data is observed.

First, these models' accuracy was verified by comparison with an elastic modulus measured for injection molded dumbbell specimens of CFRPA6. Although there was a slight difference between the elastic moduli estimated from the N–H models and the M–T model, the difference was discussed in terms of model properties. Next, estimation errors caused by assuming carbon fiber (CF) as isotropic were calculated under several conditions. The maximum error occurred in the condition that the tensile direction was perpendicular to the fiber axis. Despite CF had large anisotropy, it was approximately 10% for both models. We infer that the small error was caused by a specific stress field.",

    "abstract": "Epoxy resins are commonly used as external insulating materials for high-voltage outdoor applications. To improve the moisture and heat resistance of epoxy resin materials, this research carried out experimental tests and theoretical simulations on a variety of epoxy resin materials, including the biphenyl type. The theoretical simulation used the Materials Studio software to model the biphenyl epoxy resin and bisphenol A-type epoxy resin at different humidities. The simulation results show that the biphenyl epoxy resin has a higher glass transition temperature, at which the water molecules have a smaller root-mean-square displacement and a lower probability of forming hydrogen bonds. Experimental tests illustrated that biphenyl-type epoxy resins exhibit enhanced stability, lower hygroscopicity, and minimal changes in the permittivity in hot and humid environments. The agreement between the theoretical simulations and experimental tests indicates that the simulation calculation method is applicable to studying the hygrothermal resistance of epoxy resin materials. This study also lays the foundation for improving various aspects of the performance of epoxy resin materials through simulations, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the development of hygrothermal-resistant epoxy resins.",

Traditional heat treatment methods, including boriding, surface induction hardening, and tempering, improve the steel's surface hardness. Additionally, the Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) coating process develops a novel Cr- TiB2 composite coating on the heat-treated AISI 1045 stainless steel. The investigation explores the influence of varying TiB2 content (10%, 20%, and 30%) on the mechanical properties of AISI 1045 steel. Microhardness and tensile characteristics are analyzed, considering the impact of TiB2 percentage. Surface morphology and interfacial bonding are examined using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDAX). Results reveal notable improvements, including a 2.65 times increase in microhardness compared to untreated AISI 1045 steel, uniform TiB2 distribution, and a crack-free coating. The addition of TiB2 particles in the Cr- TiB2 composite coating enhances microhardness. Improved mechanical properties are attributed to surface treatments, incorporation of hard and wear-resistant materials (Cr and TiB2) in the composite coating, microstructure modifications, and crack prevention, collectively resulting in increased hardness, wear resistance, and durability. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel hybrid Deep Neural Network-based Sandpiper Optimization Algorithm (DNN-SOA) for predicting experimental outcomes with superior accuracy. This research not only enhances the understanding of the coated steel's mechanical properties but also presents an innovative predictive model for future material engineering applications, demonstrating the significance of advanced heat treatment and a novel composite coating in improving AISI 1045 steel performance.",

The crack monitoring and repair model of SMA composite material based on strain transfer are established using SMA resistance-sensing characteristics and SMA constitutive model. Based on this monitoring and repair model, the crack monitoring behavior of SMA under different initial states and temperature conditions is discussed, and the crack repair behavior of SMA under specific initial states and temperature conditions is also discussed. The research results show that the change in SMA resistance and the strain of the composite material crack are linearly segmented, and as the temperature increases, the composite material crack is gradually repaired.

The value of standard deviations of mechanical properties, taken as a rudimentary measure of reliability of IM PLA-HA composites, was found to have influence from the distributions of HA. Among the composites studied, PLA-HA composite with 4 and 5 HA wt.% found exhibiting reliable mechanical property due to crystallinity of 31.83% and a comparatively better homogenous dispersion of HA in PLA.

Aging of the specimens were carried out at 130°C for 5000 h and wetting was carried out at 21°C in distilled water for 5000 h.

The values of E' increased in the range from a low temperature (-140°C) to a room temperature (25°C) but they decreased at a high temperature (200°C).

    "abstract": "Abstract The dynamic viscoelastic properties of an immiscible blend of polyamide and poly(phenylene ether) were analyzed by a nonresonant forced vibration method. The blend material used was a commercial product (Ultranyl KR4520 from BASF). SEM photographs of blend specimen after dissolution of PA66 showed a clear spherical structure of poly(phenylene ether). Also, the variation of storage modulus E' with temperature and the peaks of loss modulus E\" exhibited characteristics of the immiscible blend system. The effects of drying conditions and heat-treatment on dynamic mechanical properties of blend were studied. At least 120 h drying was necessary to reach the constant weight for PA66/PPE blend at 80°C under vacuum. The dynamic viscoelastic properties of blend materials containing polyamide phase were sensitive to moisture contents. The temperature dependence of dynamic storage and loss moduli of PA66/PPE blend and PA66 can be accurately measured by performing careful and adequate conditioning of specimens.

This concrete can harden at low temperatures. The test also includes polymer concrete using unsaturated polyester resin(UP) and cement concrete. The thermal fracture test was carried out at a constant rate of cooling in order to record stress-temperature curves. It was concluded that the thermal stresses of GM/St mixtures cured at a low temperature were smaller than those in the same mixtures and UP mixtures cured at a normal temperature. Those polymer concretes could resist the thermal stress at low temperatures until -40°C and did not fracture. The flexural strengths of those are found constant regardless of temperatures. On the other hand, cement concrete was fractured by a smaller thermal change from the initial temperature than that of polymer mixtures.",

The mushy zone effect during solidification was taken into account in the model. Numerical results from the finite element analysis were compared with the analytical solutions using Neumann's method. Based on the study, it was found that numerical results for the unreinforced aluminum A357.0 overestimated solidification time as compared with the analytical solutions, which do not take the mushy zone effect into consideration. As compared with the unreinforced aluminum, composites have a lower solidification rate. In addition, at a lower volume fraction of particles, the effective thermal diffusivity of composite is the dominant factor in determining the solidification time, whereas at a higher volume fraction, the initial thermal energy of composite is the dominant factor.",

Paint films function as foreign objects amongst the materials from recycled bumpers and this results in degradation of properties. Several methods to remove paint films have been proposed, among which mechanical and chemical decomposition methods are explained in this report. As conventional instrument panels are made from composite materials where three types of different materials are laminated together, methods to detach each material are also discussed.",

An X-ray diffraction technique applied to polished surfaces of composite blocks was found to be a useful method for analyzing such composites. The deformations of the unit cell volumes for 6H-SiC (shrinkage) and 2H-MeB2 (expansion) were respectively intensified and reduced in accordance with the increase of dispersed MeB2 particles. Both detected deformations were relaxed by a pulverizing procedure. The origin of both deformations was not any residual surface strain but the residual bulk strains which originate from a thermal expansion mismatch between the dispersed particles and the surrounding matrix. Moreover, Selsing's formulas for the residual bulk strains need to be improved to more generalized formulas.",

In this study, pultruded composite pins (unconfined and confined) were manufactured and tested by using a custom double shear testing fixture. Different configurations were applied for confinement of the composite pins, including weft-knitted fabrics (plain, 1 × 1 rib, and Milano), woven fabrics and E-glass 130 tex fibers/adhesive cloth. They were externally wrapped and bonded to the unconfined composite pins. In each case, five identical specimens were tested, and shear strength data were analyzed by using two-parameter Weibull statistics. The results showed that the maximum shear strength took its highest value in the unconfined case for both average values of the test results and for 99% reliability under Weibull distribution. The confinement had a negative effect on the average shear strength of the unconfined pins. It was also seen that the 99% reliability values of shear strength were approximately equivalent to the 0.7 average value of the shear strength.",

A simulation code for the SHB test was developed using finite element analysis. In the code, the Hashin failure criterion is used to characterize the impact failure phenomena in composites. Material characterization is achieved to identify the material parameters for the Hashin criterion through inverse analysis from the measured strain histories during the SHB test. The advantage of this characterization is to obtain the true dynamic failure properties of composites without strict assumptions of elastic wave propagation on a specimen during the SHB test. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present characterization.Keywords: CFRPmaterial characterizationfractureimpact behaviornumerical analysisinverse analysis Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.",

    "abstract": "Fracture behavior of unfilled (N-PP) and short glass fiber filled polypropylene (GF-PP) has been studied with compact tension specimens by varying annealing temperature and loading rate. Crystallinity measurements and dynamic mechanical analysis were also carried out. The filled specimens exhibited an increase in the maximum load at a temperature below - 30° C, and an increase in the fracture toughness (Jm) in a temperature range between - 30° C and 0° C corresponding to the glass transition region of PP. They showed ductile fracture behavior beyond 0° C. The fracture toughness of N-PP exhibited a decrease with increasing loading rate. On the other hand, GF-PP showed little dependency of the fracture toughness on the loading rate. The annealing of the specimens just below the melting temperature of PP resulted in an increase in the crystallinity and the dynamic modulus. However, it induced a decrease in the maximum load and the fracture toughness. Optical and scanning electron microscope observations were made for fractured specimens. In the temperature range from - 60° C to 23° C a low speed fracture zone appeared on the fracture surfaces of N-PP. The zone increased in area almost linearly with an increase of logarithmic value of the fracture toughness (Jm).

For thermosetting polyester composites, different fiber surface treatments were applied to study the effects of interfacial strengths on the impact fracture threshold conditions and the spall mechanism. The static interfacial strength could be well correlated with the threshold condition for the spall fracture initiation, but not with that for the complete separation fracture. Brittle debonding between fillers and resin was the main spall fracture mechanism. For thermoplastic polypropylene composites, on the other hand, plastic deformation played an important role in spall fractures to absorb considerable impact energy. Ellipse-shaped spall fractures were found in accordance with the fiber orientation of short fibers.",

Pits are formed on the fiber surface during heat-treatment and these pits can be fracture origins under tensile stresses. From the results by TEM, WDS, XRD and SEM analyses, the pits can be identified as a SiC crystal region which grew abnormally with many microvoids. From the SEM observation, it is seen that all the fracture origins are surface flaw-pits. The shape of the fracture origins is a half-penny shaped crack on a surface perpendicular to the tensile axis and the relation between the depth (b) and the width (c) is found to be b = 0.5c. The fracture toughness, KIc, of the heat-treated fibers has been calculated from the relation between the depth of the fracture origin and the tensile strength and it was found that the value of fracture toughness is 1.3 MPa √m which is slightly lower than that of the as-received fibers.",

These include choice of reinforcing fibers and matrixes, their processing, fiber/matrix interactions as well as performance under varying conditions. Present studies have been performed to fabricate carbon fiber reinforced Silicon oxy-carbide matrix composites through sol-gel route using tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and 1,4-butanediol as starting precursors. The composites have been fabricated by a polymeric composites route. The structural development specially at the fiber/matrix interface have been studied using SEM. On pyrolysis of the composites at 1000°C, the matrix has been found to be well surrounding the fibers; still, the composites exhibit mixed tensile cum shear mode failure under flexural loading. No oxidation of the fiber surface by oxygen present in silicon oxy-carbide is observed. The composites have been further heat treated to a temperature of around 1450°C. Though consolidation of the matrix is observed to be increased, the fibers are not damaged. XRD analysis of the matrix in the composites exhibit development of SiC. SEM examination of the composites' cross-section does not exhibit any strong reaction between fibers and matrix. Composites heat treated at 1450°C exhibit about 30% improvement in flexural strength over those processed at 1000°C, maintaining the non-catastrophic fracture.",

The next most important factor was the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between the skin and rib materials of the composite isogrid itself. A new tooling design eliminated the first factor, producing a rib-only panel with no warping. An analytical model was developed, which predicted that warping caused by the rib/skin mismatch would be 3.31 mm over a length of 147.32 cm. A panel with the skin was manufactured and found to have a warp of 3.80 mm. Further improvements in producing flat panels will depend on finding appropriate materials for the rib and skin.",

EOG-coated CFs with rough surfaces improved the specific surface area and adhesion strength with the nickel-plating layer. To evaluate the adhesion strength, the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) was investigated using microdroplet testing. After EOG coating, the interfacial bonding strength was enhanced by about 65%. The composite nickel-plated carbon fabric with EOG coating showed EMI shielding of around 58 dB, which is significant for future EMI shielding applications.",

A similarity way is used to simplify the one-dimensional model and the parameter is ascertained by an iterative method. The results indicate that the increase of superheat, initial preform temperature, porosity tends to enlarge the remelting region and decrease copper solute concentration at the infiltration front. Higher angular velocity leads to smaller remelting region and solute concentration at the tip. The pressure in the infiltrated region increase significantly when the angular velocity is much higher, which requires a stronger preform. It is observed that the pressure distribution is mainly determined by the angular velocity, and the macrosegregation in the centrifugal casting is greatly dependent on the superheat of inlet metal matrix, initial temperature and porosity of the preform, and the angular velocity.",

The incorporation of polyimide raised the glass transition temperature (Tg) of both epoxy resin and epoxy-silicone alloy. The storage modulus (E') of composites increased with increasing volume fraction of imide powder. E' of epoxy-silicone alloy composites was higher than that of epoxy resin though the silicone had a low storage modulus. This fact was explained by assuming that below Tg, the presence of silicone in the matrix facilitated molecular rearrangement during cooling from the cure temperature and above Tg, increased the interaction between filler particles and the matrix.",

    "abstract": "Abstraet-Large strain measurement and axial contraction of a fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) tube under biaxial loading were investigated theoretically and experimentally. The equation for calculating strains from strain gage measurements for the case of large deformation and large rotation was derived based on the analysis of kinematics of deformation. Axial contraction of a tube could be predicted as a function of stresses, a twist angle and an initial elastic modulus of the axial direction. To demonstrate applicability of the equations, the tests of a cross-ply carbon/epoxy composite tube were conducted under uniaxial and tension/torsion biaxial loading up to failure. The signal of a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) and angular displacement transducer (ADT) of a testing machine could be adopted in strain measurement of the biaxial test for fairly large deformation. The prediction of axial contraction of a CFRP tube agreed well with the LVDT result of the testing machine.",

At moderately large loads the polymeric adhesive material behaviour tends to elasto-plastic and elasto-visco-plastic. In the present work, a finite element code is developed and visco-plastic analyses of adhesively bonded joints are carried out.

Validation of the SHM techniques is one of the issues to be addressed yet. Moreover, cost-efficient and reproducible ways to compare SHM methods can be attractive for researchers and end users. NLR has recently developed ways for automated production of rib-stiffened composite panels using an Automated Fibre Placement (AFP) machine. Without human interference and a fully automated manufacturing process, multiple panels can be cost-effectively laid-up with limited quality variation. In this paper, Modal Strain Energy Damage Index (MSE-DI) method is applied on two impact-damaged panels manufactured in this new way. The results show that the panels have slightly deviating natural frequencies even though the C-scan revealed no major quality variation. Secondly, the presence of the impact damage can be successfully detected by the MSE-DI algorithm, but the localization was inaccurate, contradicting the expectations. This is attributed to the specific characteristics of the panel and indicates a dependency of the performance of algorithms on structure to which they are applied. Future work will include a further exploration of this dependency.",

Nonetheless, different shell thicknesses and stiffeners cross-sectional areas were reported for the specimens. Since the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells is highly sensitive to their thickness, the difference in the reported numerical linear buckling loads of the mentioned studies could be due to different thickness values used as inputs for their numerical analyses.

    "abstract": "Pultrusion molding is one of the high-cycle molding methods for continuous fiber-reinforced plastics using thermoplastic resin, and considering the expansion of industrial applications, shaped parts, such as pipes and L-shapes are more desirable. The following is an example of a product that can be used to achieve this goal. Braided fabrics are one of the most useful preforms for achieving pipe shapes. In this study, commingled yarns and partially impregnated commingled yarns were used as intermediate materials, because excellent impregnation properties and textile workability are required to the fabrication and pultrusion molding of the braided fabrics. However, when forming a pipe shape by pultrusion, the mandrel must be placed in the hollow of the molded product, which causes an increase in pull-out resistance due to shrinkage of the pipe diameter. To solve this problem and achieve high-speed molding of pipe-shaped products by pultrusion molding, this study examined the effects of different intermediate materials and molding conditions on the impregnation state and mechanical properties of molded products, as well as the optimization of the mandrel location. The first part of this study revealed that the impregnation time of partially impregnated commingled yarns is shorter than that of commingled yarns, and as a result, the decrease in void ratio and unimpregnated ratio is smaller, and the decrease in mechanical properties is smaller even if the molding speed is increased. The second part of this study, it was found that the mandrel tip should be positioned so that the temperature of the inner diameter side becomes lower than glass-transition temperature (Tg) during cooling to prevent separating. In addition, it was found that temperature history analysis based on heat conduction calculations is effective in predicting the optimum mandrel position, which varies depending on molding conditions. These results provide a guideline for high-speed pultrusion molding.",

Based on this assumption, we experimentally evaluated the 'multiscale' solidification (solidification of matrix resin and that of prepreg) process using dynamic mechanical analysis during gelation. The solidification of matrix resin was examined by observing the development of loss angle, which provides a continuous description of the solidification process.

Unfortunately, in the past, this advantage was always accompanied by a significant loss in mechanical properties. Therefore, a new aligned short-fiber reinforced thermoplastic prepreg (HTA7/PEI) has been developed to minimize this drawback. It has already been shown that the unidirectional mechanical properties of this new composite are only slightly less than those of a similar long-fiber material [1 ]. This paper will focus on the fatigue behavior of aligned short-fiber tensile specimens with a center hole. The various fatigue crack forms around the hole, such as inter-fiber splits and delaminations, are investigated and compared to those of long-fiber specimens. Then, the dependence of crack propagation on fatigue time and the response to residual stiffness was studied in detail. A linear relationship between split length and residual stiffness was found and used to predict residual stiffness as a function of split length and fatigue time. The predicted residual stiffness showed good agreement with the measured values.",

Amplitude distribution during the tests show three types of fracture mechanism, such as fiber breakage (over 70 dB), delamination (between 60 and 70 dB) and matrix cracking (under 60 dB). After the middle stage of the burst test, the AE event rate shows saturated behavior, and large scale delamination is observed on the fracture surface. The upper limit speed for data acquisition (40 events s-1) of AE equipment (3000/3104: PAC) underestimated the number of middle amplitude events of the delamination. During the hydroproof test, both large amplitude events and a large number of AE events are detected in spite of the higher threshold (+ 20 dB) than that of the burst test. The strain gages on the hydroproof sample indicate higher strain than that of the burst test. Both AE and strain results show that the hydroproof test sample would have more damage than the burst test sample.",

A shrinkage-reduction agent is added as an important component to the binder system. The initiator was methyl acetoacetate peroxide (MAAPO). The accelerator was mainly cobaltnaphthenate (CoN) and partially N, N-dimmethyl-p-toluidine (DMT). Optimization studies were carried out to find the recomendable levels of the initiator and the accelerator. These levels were to insure not only working time (Twm) of polymer mortar (PM) over 20 min, but also a flexural strength over 100 kgf/cm2 at 5 h. The experimental results suggest a good correlation of linearity between the working time (Tw) of binder and the working time (Twm) of polymer mortar. A linear correlation was also found between Tw and the setting time (Tsm) of polymer mortar. Twm was about two times and Tsm was about four times of Tw respectively. Polymer concrete or mortar of this binder was found to have some salient properties: (a) easy mixing with aggregates and good workabilities due to low viscosity of the binder, (b) rapid hardening at low temperatures from 0 to -20°C, (c) the high strength with a small amount of binder content, (d) low hardening shrinkage under 0. 1 %. Thus, this polymer concrete may be applicable to civil constructions and precast concrete in cold areas.",

So we examined the shock absorption performance and the safety of three full-face rider helmets (samples A, B, and C) of which the laminated constitutions of the FRP shell part were respectively different. The effect of the hybrid lamination, composed of aramid and glass fabrics, on the shock absorption performance has been discussed also. Testing was performed twice for the same impact site of a helmet hit flat and with semi-spherical anvils, according to the JIS-C shock absorption test method. The following results were obtained: The acceleration waveform measured at the forehead part of Helmet-A, which was hit on a semi-spherical anvil, behaved flatly while the part on the left side of the head behaved parabolically. In the case of Helmets-B and -C, which have an aramid fabric layer, they behaved conversely, such that a flat waveform was observed on the part on the left side of the head. All helmets hit on the semi-spherical anvil showed a flat acceleration waveform regardless of the impact site of the helmet, and showed a maximum acceleration of less than 120 g, which is exceedingly small compared to the results from the case with the flat anvil. For all the helmets, the maximum acceleration and the elapsing time of more than 150 g in the second test were higher values than the values in the first test. The values of Helmet-B, in particular, were recognized to change remarkably. The hybrid lamination, composed of aramid and glass fabrics, was not so effective. However, it was remarkable that the maximum acceleration and the elapsing time at the forehead of Helmet-B in the first test were the smallest values in all of the data collected from hitting a flat anvil.",

New composites theory will have to be developed in the next two decades. An example is in the reinforcement of rubbers by carbon black. Its reinforcement is remarkable and the strength of the composite becomes about ten to twenty times that of the original pure rubber, achieved by putting a small volume of carbon black particles in the rubber; this reinforcement effect could not have been predicted by the old theories. Textile composites will become more important materials in the future. As to their application, freedom of design of textile structure will enable the design of much more sophisticated fiber-composite materials and intelligent materials in the future.",

(1) In the case of the pure magnesium matrix FRMg, the thermal stress originating in the difference of the thermal expansion coefficients between the fiber and the matrix is effectively relaxed by the plastic deformation in the matrix upon quenching. As a result of the stress relaxation, the FRMg shows excellent dimensional stability during subsequent annealing. (2) In the case of Mg-Nd alloy matrix FRMg, a high residual tensile stress is induced in the matrix by quenching, because slip deformation is highly suppressed owing to the high flow stress level of the alloyed matrix. The FRMg undergoes creep elongation during subsequent annealing. (3) The thermal dimensional stability of the FRMg depends on the thermal stress and the amount of stress relaxation induced by slip deformation in the matrix. In order to obtain superior dimensional stability, it is important to select the system in which the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients between the fiber and matrix is small and in which the flow stress level of the matrix is low.",

The initiation as well as stable growth of matrix damage can be predicted in terms of composite microstructural properties and damage configuration. The results show that the high stress region at the tip of a longitudinal matrix split influences the failure of the adjoining fibers.

It is shown that there exists a critical volume fraction of inclusions at which the compressive stress begins to appear in the neighbourhood of fibre matrix interface; hence we can always select a particular volume fraction of inclusions to avoid the unnecessary clustering of compressive stresses near the interface. The mixture is assumed to be homogeneous on a macroscopic scale but not necessarily isotropic. However, two phases themselves are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic. Further, no condition is placed on the shape of the inclusions which may for example be fibrous or plate like.

It is assumed that debonding of the fiber/matrix interface initiates at the end of fibers, and progresses to the center, as predicted by classical shear-lag theory. Debonding along only a few percent of the fiber length substantially reduces the moduli of the composite material, especially for materials with high volume fractions of reinforcement. Degradation of the bonding can also lead to the growth of preexisting interface imperfections which can add to the deterioration of the material properties. Results are presented for the cases where the fibers are substantially stiffer than the matrix and where the matrix is stiffer than the fibers. It is also observed that a decrease in aspect ratio of the fibers leads to decrease in the moduli of the system in general.",

Subtle defects or flaws may occur as a result of material fabrication or through \"in-service\" use. These defects may upset the unique balance of fiber, matrix, and interface that provides the composite with high performance characteristics. Quality control during various phases of manufacture and assembly is critical.

The poor quality of the carbon preforms including missing rods cannot provide tailored composite to meet desired properties. By the way, the carbon preform is manufactured manually now and often there happen a mistake that a carbon rod is omitted. Therefore, an effective solution for guaranteeing the quality of the carbon preform is needed. For that reason, this paper proposes new inspection method that can detect the missing rods of multidirectional carbon preform. This method utilized some image processing techniques to simplify the image of carbon preform. In this method, the carbon preform image is modified so that the carbon rods and background can be easily separated. Thus, this new method found all missing rods and marked missing space with red circle. Moreover, because the inspection method suggested in this paper can be easily converted into the form of software, it is expected to be applied effectively to the fields of manufacture of the multidirectional carbon preform.",

    "abstract": "Although the mechanical properties of carbon fiber reinforced carbon (C/C) composites under high temperature environments have been widely studied to date, the influence of thermal shocks on C/C composites have scarcely been investigated due to the lack of high-speed heating equipment. Our equipment based on a high frequency induction heating method provided a solution to this problem. In the present study, we examined the influence of thermal shocks on the inter-laminar shearing strength (ILSS), which is one of the most important subjects of designing a plain woven C/C composite with a three point bending test. By the change of the span-to-height ratio (l/h), the failure mode shift of the inter-laminar shearing to the bending was observed. By a series of tests, we proposed an appropriate l/h ratio to obtain a reliable inter-laminar shearing strength of C/C composites, which would be higher than that for the conventional CFRPs. The observation of the failure specimens was done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy. Not only debondings at 0°/90° interface but also propagation of transverse cracks were observed in the thermal shocked specimens. The 0°/90° interfacial debondings were suggested as the main source of the inter-laminar shearing strength deterioration.",

Using this method, the capacitance is monitored for a capacitor formed using the base material, an electrolyte such as aqueous NaCl, and an insulating coating layer in between. The capacitance increases when the distance between the base material and the electrolyte decreases in the diffusion of the electrolyte through the insulating coating layer. Therefore, the change in the capacitance provides a diffusion rate related to Fick’s diffusion constant. Conventional gravimetric methods require a long measurement time to reach saturation, and thin coating layers of minimal weight increment through water diffusion were demonstrated to be inadequate for the methods. However, the new electrochemical method is appropriate for thin coating layers and requires a limited duration after the onset of diffusion. Experimental for 1-mm thick PA6 films provided Fick’s diffusion constants of safer side with the new method of 15h by reflecting the heterogeneous properties of the surface, while the conventional gravimetric method in 360h provided smaller or danger-side values.",

This ideal model predicts inaccurate properties due to oversimplification of tow shapes. In this paper, we present a more accurate method to predict properties of the 3D woven composite considering waviness and contraction of tows due to interference between them. The tow waviness is defined by elliptic and trigonometric functions. The shrinkage of the tow cross-sectional area is modeled using a cubic polynomial. The elastic moduli are predicted using the modeled tows and the weighted average model. The predicted properties are compared with test results to verify the accuracy. In addition, the usefulness of the present method is verified by comparing the calculated moduli using the ideal model. We conclude that the present method is useful for the design of structures to which 3D woven composites are applied.",

Two forms of prepreg edges can exist: one where the prepreg edge has a gap, and the other, where the prepreg edge overlaps. This research examined the effects of the forms of the prepreg edges on the cure-induced internal states using a fiber-optic-based method. In the case of the edge involving a gap, strain level peaks at the prepreg edges were observed throughout the curing process. Meanwhile, the sample containing an overlap presented no strain level peaks during cooling. According to the results, it would be preferable to have overlapping present at the prepreg edges.",

In this earthquake, damage that could not be explained by conventional engineering theory was observed, such as the destruction of buildings, highways and underground structures. Much damage to water tanks made of FRP were reported. However, damage to those water tanks manufactured after the revision of the earthquake resistant standards based on the revised construction standard act (1981) was much smaller than that on tanks made before the act. Damage to ceilings of many water tanks was also reported in this earthquake which were not observed previously and which therefore also characterizes this particular earthquake.",

Parametric studies were performed to determine how the types of boundary conditions and loadings influence the deformed shape (flatness) and temperature of PV sandwich structures with four types of skin materials and three different core structures. High temperature in silicon layer as well as high deviation in flatness are undesirable. The high flatness deviation can lead to high variation in incident angle. Our simulation results show that the CFRP skin provides the smallest flatness deviation followed by steel, aluminum and PLA, respectively. Temperature of silicon layer for the CFRP skin configuration is comparable with that of skin configurations using high thermal conductivity skin materials (aluminum and steel). The reentrant core demonstrates the smallest flatness deviation but approximately the same temperature compared to honeycomb and semi-reentrant cores. Furthermore, introducing a double-skin configuration (PV/ CFRP skin/ aluminum core/ CFRP skin) while maintaining the total thickness of the skin causes no effect on temperature but tends to increase flatness deviation. Therefore, the single-skin configuration (PV/ aluminum reentrant core/ CRFP skin) is a potential candidate for lightweight multifunctional PV sandwich composites.",

But steel has its disadvantages in this application: It is difficult to handle during installation, and rust causes poor appearance and, ultimately, failure of the part. A new GRP pole guard has been developed and is already in use in Japan. This new pole guard takes advantage of GRP's elasticity to offer better durability and easier handling. The new GRP pole guard is self-attaching; thus it can be installed and removed without bolts or belts. In addition, posters and fliers will not adhere to the GRP's textured surface. We studied the optimum design to capitalize on GRP's properties. We used curved beam theory and finite element analysis to design the shape, and studied fiber structures to improve strength and rigidity. This specially shaped GRP pole guard is made using the pultrusion molding method. Keywords: Fiber reinforced compositepultrusionself-holding forcepole guard",

    "abstract": "The need for toughened or damage tolerant composites arose in the late 1970s when airlines were faced with escalating fuel costs and hence the need for lighter-weight, more fuel-efficient aircraft. Airframe companies identified toughened or damage tolerant composites as a means to reduce aircraft weight. A key requirement of damage tolerant composite structures was the ability to sustain compressive loading in the presence of impact induced damage. Critical structural components included wing skins which could involve thick (6.25 mm or greater) laminates. A real life complication arising from thick laminates is that impact damage is generally not visible from the impact side i. e. the impact event often causes a delamination zone in the laminate interior and/or reverse side damage, neither of which are readily assessed.",

Both the criterion of the fracture theories and the nondestructive evaluation methods for FRP are discussed. The developed AE criterion is based on statistics which include the prior distribution, the data distribution and the posterior distribution. The AE criterion shows the equivalent pressure which relates to the damage extension of the master sample. Three types of the equivalent pressure criteria, such as the fiber breakage criterion, the fiber breakage and delamination criterion, and the all fracture criterion are based on AE amplitude distribution. Weight functions are used in this treatment based on the AE source characterization theory. The predicted burst pressure and the safety ratio are calculated by the equivalent pressure and the proof test pressure. The results of the evaluation indicate that the predicted burst pressure is 7.9 MPa and the safety is 1.6. These results are in good agreement with the strain measurement.",

The static flexural tests were carried out at various deflection rates and temperatures. The master curve of flexural strength of CFRP was obtained by applying the reciprocation law of time and temperature to these experimental results. Furthermore, the flexural creep fracture of CFRP was estimated by utilizing the linear cumulative damage rule adapted to this master curve.

So, a study was made to make the upper complete resin denture base thinner while maintaining the strength of the resin denture base currently in use. To make the palatal area of the denture base thinner carbon fiber (CF) cloth reinforcement was used. The resin denture base reinforced by the CF cloth was 0.7 mm thick and was evaluated for the mechanical properties of bending.

It is often necessary to measure these parameters in addition to directly measuring mechanical properties of composites. This paper explores an objective, easy and quick method to determine fiber orientation in composite materials. In this method, fibers are stuck out of the cross section perpendicular to the the extrusion direction of the specimen by polishing and etching. Scanning electron micrographs of fibers are then taken from an oblique angle and the fiber orientation angles are measured from the pictures. The number of fibers is then counted for each angle with 2° increment. The orientation degree is defined by the intersection and the slope of a line at 0° of orientation angle after converting the frequencies in natural logarithm and performing linear regression analysis. The orientation degree can be fully estimated with only about 300 fibers. Such an evaluation and method is simple and useful for accurate prediction of the fiber orientation degree.
