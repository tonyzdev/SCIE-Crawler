    "abstract": "We conducted an online consumer survey in May 2020 in two major metropolitan areas in the United States to investigate food shopping behaviors and consumption during the pandemic lockdown caused by COVID-19. The results of this study parallel many of the headlines in the popular press at the time. We found that about three-quarters of respondents were simply buying the food they could get due to out of stock situations and about half the participants bought more food than usual. As a result of foodservice closures, consumers indicated purchasing more groceries than normal. Consumers attempted to avoid shopping in stores, relying heavily on grocery delivery and pick-up services during the beginning of the pandemic when no clear rules were in place. Results show a 255% increase in the number of households that use grocery pickup as a shopping method and a 158% increase in households that utilize grocery delivery services. The spike in pickup and delivery program participation can be explained by consumers fearing COVID-19 and feeling unsafe. Food consumption patterns for major food groups seemed to stay the same for the majority of participants, but a large share indicated that they had been snacking more since the beginning of the pandemic which was offset by a sharp decline in fast food consumption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study explores the extent to which members' assessment of their cooperatives' degree of success is related to various member attributes, notably the members' perception of their participation in the governance of the cooperatives. Three categories of member attributes are identified: satisfaction with the profitability of farm operations, age of the member, and experience from board work. The cooperatives' degree of success is measured as members' commitment towards cooperatives, and members' trust in the board of directors. The data originate from a mail survey among 2,250 Swedish farmers. The results indicate differences in members' commitment and their trust towards directors to be due to farm profitability, the members' age and experience as directors. After adding members' perception of their participation in the governance as a covariate, most of the other differences are explained by this variable. Age is still partly associated with trust towards directors; older farmers have less trust. [EconLit Classifications: Q13, D23, D72]. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Three functions of traceability systems are identified: ex post reactive systems that allow the traceback of affected products in the event of a contamination problem so as to minimize social costs, ex post systems that facilitate the allocation of liability, and information systems that provide ex ante quality verification. A taxonomy of traceability systems illustrates the multidimensional nature of the information problems related to food safety and food quality. A model of ex ante quality verification and ex post traceability systems is used to demonstrate the different functions and incentives of a traceability system. Finally, examples of private sector and regulatory traceability initiatives are discussed within the context of the ex post and ex ante models developed in the paper.

    "abstract": "Abstract Twelve food‐manufacturing companies in six European countries have been studied with respect to the way in which they innovate, their motivations, and their emphasis on product or process innovation. It is suggested that the traditional “demand‐pull” versus “technology‐push” versus “a mixture of both” debate is too simplistic. Firms behave differently depending on their dominant “orientations” towards the product, the process, or the market, the types of market they supply (particularly whether they supply branded or private‐label products), the nature of their ownership (public, private, co‐operative), market size and scope, and company size. The suggestions of the case studies are, in general, supported by quantitative results from a survey of food manufacturers, though the survey was not designed specifically for this purpose and further quantitative model development is proposed. The findings reported in this article and the proposed refinements are important to firms and policy‐makers concerned with the efficiency and effectiveness of food industry innovation [JEL Classification Codes: L100, L200, L660] © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The structural modeling of the innovation accounts for farmers' adoption incentives and for the observed pricing of RR soybean seeds as a proprietary technology. The calibrated model is solved for various scenarios to evaluate the production, price, and welfare impacts of RR soybean adoption. The United States gains substantially from the innovation, with the innovator capturing the larger share of the welfare gains. US farmers benefit in the base scenario, but would be adversely affected if the RR innovation were to increase yields. Spillover of the new technology to foreign competitors erodes the competitive position of domestic soybean producers, and export of the technology per se may not improve the welfare position of the innovating country. Consumers in every region gain from the adoption of RR soybeans. [JEL Classification: F14, O33, Q16]. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

More specifically, the authors evaluate how the region of origin as a component of a wine brand adds value to a wine purchaser. Previous research suggests that the region of origin equity is significantly moderated by the other wine attributes with which it is combined on the wine label: commercial brand, level of price, type of bottler, grape variety. The authors test whether the moderating effects depend on self‐perceived consumer expertise. They use a discrete choice method to survey 1,162 European wine purchasers, about equally selected from France, Austria, Germany, and the UK. Results show that the region of origin equity is indeed significantly moderated by the other wine attributes. They also show these moderating effects are more important for consumers who perceive themselves as “more expert” than for consumers who feel they are “novices.” [EconLit citation: M310]. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study examines to what extent consumer ethnocentrism (as measured by the CETSCALE) can singularly, as well as in concert with other variables, predict consumers' evaluation of a domestic versus foreign food product. A conjoint experiment was utilized in an exploratory analysis to ascertain the value consumers in Czech Republic place on yogurt being from their own or other countries. The resulting utilities were related to a consumer's level of ethnocentrism. The findings suggest that consumer ethnocentrism is a strong and significant predictor of consumer product evaluations. Adding the ethnocentrism variable to a set of demographic and psychographic variables significantly improves the predictive ability of the set. Potential applications at the practitioners' level include the identification of market segments that react more favorably to domestic produce.

This empirical study describes the perceptions and attitudes of 108 Millennials regarding wine and what the wine industry can do to better market to them in a responsible manner. Results indicate that there is a need for greater wine advertising to this group utilizing fun, social, and relaxed settings; more innovative packaging and labels; a focus on “value” wines; as well as taste enhancements and environmental emphasis.

On one hand, the responses to the competition with new actors coming from emerging countries and the reaction to high‐tech products demand evolution. On the other hand, endogenous dynamics appear to become more important for the strategic behaviour of the firms: a higher qualification of the human capital, a more clear orientation for high quality products, organization changes, and relation capacity development. Starting from these considerations, this paper developed an econometric analysis using information from one of the most important national dataset for innovation analysis. The results pointed out that a determinant to successfully develop and introduce product innovation is the capacity to built relationships on the product markets (i.e., with the modern distribution), while the territorial context determines a higher/lower relevance of each of the driving factors of innovation.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT During the last 20 years many traditionally organized agricultural cooperatives have been forced to abandon their business form. Explanations have been put forward, comprising a variety of economic and sociological theories. The present study suggests that the social capital paradigm may add explanatory power when analyzing this development. It is claimed that the problems are due to the members having increasingly little trust in the cooperatives and in each other. The cooperatives’ decision makers have no instruments for estimating how much social capital is lost when they pursue strategies of vertical and horizontal integration. Therefore, they do not consider this loss in their calculations. Thus, the problems caused by the cooperatives’ vaguely defined property rights are becoming increasingly serious. This reasoning is summarized into a model, which is influenced by the consumer choice model.[EconLit Classification; A130; P130; Q130].",

In witnessing these structural changes, scholars have proffered analyses of nontraditional ownership models focusing on residual claim rights. However, crucial information on the allocation of control rights in cooperatives is missing. This study sheds light on alternative ownership‐control models adopted by agricultural cooperatives in different regions across the world. In each of these models, we describe the allocation of formal control rights with a focus on decision management and decision control rights. We thus provide empirical evidence on the “separation of ownership and control” in agricultural cooperatives. We also analyze each of the governance models in terms of the associated ownership costs, including risk‐bearing costs, the costs of controlling managers, and collective decision‐making costs. In doing so, we are able to better understand the forces influencing the organizational efficiency of each cooperative model.",

In contrast to high quality producers from France and Italy, their counterparts from the New World never exceed prices for high quality Napa Valley brands. Thus, New World wine still has to catch up with the Old World in terms of regional reputation, but leading brands are able to pick up much of the price differential.

This corresponds with the variety in the definition of food chains and networks that might focus on either closely cooperating enterprises along the value chain with an executive coordination element or, alternatively, on a network of enterprises in dynamically evolving business relationships. Management challenges in closely cooperating enterprises are closely linked to challenges in enterprise management and can draw on research in this domain; however, management activities in and for networks involve additional challenges that require focused research engagement. The dependency of all participants in the chain on consumers as the ultimate customers and the dependency of the quality of final products on the engagement of all participants in the production and distribution of products require new managerial activities and, in turn, support by research.

Nonetheless, European consumers' definition and perception of TFP have not been thoroughly addressed thus far. The specific aim of this study was to provide an all‐embracing consumer definition of the concept of TFP that is comfortable for the largest possible majority of European food consumers. Cross‐sectional survey data were collected from representative consumer samples from Belgium, France, Italy, Norway, Poland, and Spain in November 2007, yielding a total sample of 4,828 participants. The study elaborates on country‐specific peculiarities and identifies consumer segments that differ in the emphasis they place in the conceptualization of TFP. The following definition emerged, A traditional food product is a product frequently consumed or associated to specific celebrations and/or seasons , transmitted from one generation to another , made in a specific way according to gastronomic heritage , naturally processed , and distinguished and known because of its sensory properties and associated to a certain local area , region or country . Cross‐European homogeneity was found in the elements to include in the definition, across and within‐country heterogeneity existed regarding the specific emphasis of particular elements. Four consumer segments were distinguished by whom TFP are predominantly defined as multiconcept, usual/familiar, authentic/typical, and inherited. The first segment displayed a very broad conceptualization, without a clear differentiation. For the latter three segments, particular elements dominated their conceptualization. Product positioning, marketing, and communication challenges for TFP facing these consumer segments are discussed. [EconLit citations: D12; M39; Q13]. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Agricultural cooperatives increasingly operate in strictly coordinated supply chains. It is important that members of a cooperative are committed to a customer‐oriented strategy, otherwise vertical coordination can be costly and the loss of autonomy at the farm level might negatively affect the members’ commitment to collective action. In this context, how can both types of commitment be strengthened? This study decomposes the member–cooperative relationship into four organizational mechanisms—market, hierarchy, community and democracy, which all play a role in generating commitment. Data originate from 148 farmers, all members of the same agricultural cooperative in Brazil. The results suggest first, that it is possible to disentangle commitment to collective action from commitment to a customer‐oriented strategy. Second, although members’ commitment to a customer‐oriented strategy might be affected by market and hierarchy mechanisms only, commitment to collective action might depend on the four organizational mechanisms.

We employ a treatment effects model to account for potential selection bias that arises from the fact that cooperative members and nonmembers are systematically different in terms of both observable and unobservable factors. Our analysis reveals that cooperative membership has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple price, gross income, farm profit, and ROI. In addition, we find that the highest profit effect of cooperative membership does not in fact result in the highest ROI effect of the membership, revealing differences in farm income and profitability of investment.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT There has been a great deal of increase in the production and consumption of organic foods. As a result, many researchers have attempted to explain the motivations and marketing issues dealing with the topic. Many of the previous studies provide conflicting results. With this in mind, we attempt to perform a comprehensive study of organic food consumption by examining the roles of a variety of factors on intention to purchase organic foods through a survey of consumers in a large metropolitan area in Europe by utilizing the scales developed in earlier studies. The results indicate that socially responsible consumption, health orientation, utilitarian, and hedonic consumption patterns are significant predictors of intention to purchase organic foods and consumption while controlling for demographical variables. In addition, environmental responsibility acts as a moderating factor in the relationship between socially responsible consumption behavior and intention to purchase.

Data from an Internet‐based survey of consumers ( n = 1,139) was analyzed using a bivariate probit model. The bivariate probit model related attitudinal, behavioral and sociodemographic factors to the intention to purchase fresh and nonfresh locally produced foods. Although sociodemographic characteristics play a limited role in shaping local food purchase intentions, attitudinally based variables have far greater influence. Positive views towards local farmers and agriculture in general, as well as food quality, are positively related to purchase intention. The importance placed on brand‐specific quality is inversely related to the intention to buy local food. Consumers with heightened levels of food involvement, either growing food or preparing most meals from scratch, are more likely to purchase local foods. (EconLit Citations: L660; Q130; Q180)",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present research analyses how Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices affect Green Innovation Performance (GIP) in the Spanish wine industry. To this end, a conceptual model is proposed and contrasted through a quantitative approach based on structural equation modeling with data collected from 202 Spanish wineries between September 2021 and January 2022. The results of the research indicate that there is a positive and significant relationship between CSR and GIP. In addition, Green Intellectual Capital (GIC) and Knowledge Management (KM) partially mediate the relationship between these two variables, playing a key role in the environmental management of wineries. The present research therefore contributes to the literature in several ways. First, the study advances the understanding of CSR in the Spanish wine industry, as well as its relationship with GIP. Second, the research aims to fill a gap in the literature by studying GIC and KM as mediating variables in this link, given that, to our knowledge, there are no previous studies that have analyzed mediating variables in the CSR–GIP relationship. Third, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed model has not been previously addressed in the academic literature, which represents an advance in scientific knowledge.

The literature on the current use of sustainability claims and labels (SCLs) in the EU market is scarce. This paper analyzes the trend developments of SCLs in product launches by food companies across different product groups and countries. The analyses are based on Mintel Global New Product Database on newly introduced products with SCLs, covering 24 food product categories and 19 European countries over the 2005–2021 period. The results show that, on aggregate, across all covered countries and products, the share of product launches with SCLs increased by 2.83% annually from 2005 to 2021. This trend varies greatly among countries, product categories and SCL types. Further, the results show that products covering environmental only SCLs make the highest contribution to the overall sustainability trend (68.2%), followed by products with a combination of both environmental and social SCLs (27.5%), whereas only social SCLs have a minor representation (4.2%).

Based on taste panel rankings and bid differentials between paired steak samples, consumers were grouped into one of three beef‐preference categories: corn‐fed beef preferring, grass‐fed beef preferring, and indifferent. A multinomial logit model and regression analysis were used to identify consumers who prefer a particular flavor of beef. On average, consumers were willing to pay a 30.6% premium for corn‐fed beef. Sixty‐two percent of the participants were willing to pay an average premium of $1.61 more per pound for the corn‐fed beef, 23% of the consumers were willing to pay a premium of $1.36 more per pound for the grass‐fed beef, only 15% of the consumers were indifferent. The results have important implications for country‐of‐origin labeling of beef products, as well as niche marketing of corn‐fed and grass‐fed beef.

This article addresses the question of whether reliance on voluntary approaches is likely to lead to adequate consumer protection. Drawing on recent literature on the choice between voluntary and mandatory approach to environmental protection and standard models of product liability, the article develops an analytical framework to determine the conditions under which firms are likely to invest in food safety voluntarily. The results suggest that for goods for which consumers can readily detect safety characteristics, market forces can create incentives for voluntary provision of safety. However, for goods for which consumers cannot readily detect food risks, market forces are not likely to be sufficient to afford adequate protection. Even in such a context, however, direct government regulation is not always necessary. The threat of the imposition of mandatory controls (possibly coupled with financial inducements for undertaking voluntary approaches) may provide firms with sufficient incentives to invest in food safety in an effort to avoid those controls. However, if firms do not respond, regulators must be prepared to follow through on their threats and impose a regulatory system of protection. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The issue is of importance in order to ensure an economically viable pig industry while applying an increasing number of animal friendly practices. In order to obtain information about consumer demand, an indirect utility function and willingness to pay (WTP) for animal welfare attributes are estimated. The attributes are solely associated with animal friendly practices. An investigation of numerous housing and managerial practices of pig production has not yet been performed. The indirect utility function is estimated using a random parameter logit model. A realistic approach when modeling consumer choice is to allow for heterogeneity in preferences. The relevance of assuming randomness of some of the parameters is evaluated by using a specification test developed by McFadden and Train ( 2000 ). The WTP is also estimated at the individual level. The results indicate that WTP for animal welfare attributes may be negative or positive. The preferences are also heterogeneous among respondents, which may be explained by a segmentation of preferences. Finally, the WTP estimates for animal welfare practices are compared with cost estimates for such production systems. [Econlit subject codes: C010, C500, Q100] © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Employing nationwide discrete choice data for Italy, we investigate the strength of the ROO attribute across three food product categories. Moreover, in addition to treating taste heterogeneity as conditional on socioeconomic factors, we employ recent advances in discrete-choice modeling to test for unobserved heterogeneity in consumer preferences for domestic and territorial origin of production certification. The results show evidence of home bias in preference across all three food products, while preference heterogeneity is exhibited for table grapes and oil, but not for oranges. The analysis shows that unobserved heterogeneity, as represented by mixed logit models, appears to explain more of the observed choice variation than heterogeneity associated to socioeconomic characteristics.

A main‐effects model as well as an interaction‐effects model is estimated based on four attributes: designation of origin, price, wine aging, and grape variety. Willingness‐to‐pay estimates, depending on the price segment, is derived for switching from one attribute level to another. Consumer segmentation is undertaken based on purchase frequencies. Market simulations are presented for consumer segments. Empirical results indicate the importance of the DO and the wine aging attributes on wine selection. The interaction‐effects model shows the importance of attribute interactions on consumers' choice process. Differences as well as similarities are detected among consumer segments.

Analysis is based on a variety of survey questions relating to preferences for various fresh produce traits and process attributes, as well as willingness to pay for a subset of these attributes. We find that although there is only a small degree of correlation between tested variables, four consumer clusters can be identified as market segments: Urban, Assurance Seekers, Price Conscious Consumers, Quality and Safety Consumers, and Personal Value Buyers. Each cluster values both private and public attributes, though with differing intensities and focus. [EconLit citations: Q130, D120]. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Additionally, the results of probit models indicate that the probability a consumer will pay more or less of a premium depends on purchase behavior and shopping location, stated importance of production attributes, awareness and interest in private and civic agricultural issues, in addition to some typical demographic variables such as income.

Using this classification and integrating concepts from the business literature (i.e., market and brand orientation), we hypothesize three types of relationships: (a) the influence of organizational attributes, i.e., ownership, control and cost/benefit allocation, on organizational performance; (b) the influence of strategic, i.e., market and brand orientation, attributes on organizational performance, and (c) the influence of organizational attributes on market orientation. We examine these relationships empirically in two studies. In study 1, using data from 114 agribusiness cooperatives, we demonstrate that strategic attributes have a greater influence on organizational performance than organizational attributes. In study 2, we replicate the design from study 1, i.e., tracking attribute scores over time, with a subsample of 25 cooperatives 4 years later. This second study generally confirms the findings of study 1. Taken together, the results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on strategic attributes both in the literature and in practice.",

This paper proposes a framework that combines transaction cost and relational contracts models to capture this variety while characterizing some representative forms. The framework distinguishes between organizational structures differing according to the intensity of control exercised over the rights to use resources, and the modalities of governance through which these structures operate. The combination of these two dimensions provides tools for understanding the existence, characteristics, and conditions under which some organizational arrangements tend to prevail. Based on these premises, the paper proposes an analysis that goes beyond the dichotomy between “markets” and “hierarchies.” This framework is inclusive of those hybrids arrangements that play such an important role in the agrifood industry and it explores two modalities that are particularly challenging to standard theories: cooperatives and plural forms.

We adopted an exploratory mixed‐method approach, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative investigations undertaken in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Our results suggest that organic food consumption is mainly motivated by personal well‐being and less by social or environmental concerns. Most participants perceive organic food as higher quality products, based upon which they show an acceptance of a price premium for organic food. The group of organic food consumers in our study relies on organic agriculture as one possible strategy to cope with food safety problems. The presence of strict standards for organic food, the trustworthiness of foreign certifications and the perceived higher quality of foreign products (especially from Europe) are perceived together as a safety guarantee. Our results further indicate that the widespread confusion regarding product recognition represents an important obstacle for organic food consumption growth. Implementing a coherent legislative framework to allow product labeling is apparently crucial yet not sufficient for developing the organic sector in Russia; moreover, trust in food labeling and control systems as well as awareness about organic standards is also required.",

However, besides the rationale of ethnocentrism or the desire to support domestic farmers, the underlying motivation for such behavior is not well understood. This study assesses consumers’ preferences for imported and domestic beef through a choice experiment. We found that willingness to pay for country‐of‐origin labeled imported beefsteak is associated with (a) consumers’ perceptions of the categorical risk from consuming beef, (b) consumers’ risk aversion to risks from beef consumption, and (c) consumers’ perceptions of the food‐safety level of imported beef. Results from this study suggest that the advantage of domestic beef over imported beef can be partly explained by consumers’ risk handling behavior. [EconLit citations: Q130].",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted many activities along agri-food supply chains in developing countries and posed unprecedented challenges in particular to small and medium agri-food enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on a survey of 166 Egyptian agri-food SMEs, this study investigates differences in- and determinants of COVID-19 business risk perception among these enterprises. The empirical results showed that risk perception was highly asymmetric across geographical regions. Enterprises with longer cash flow coverage periods and higher values of total assets perceived significantly lower risk levels, as cash and assets functioned as a buffer against the impact of COVID-19. The findings of the study imply that the \"just-in-time\" approach and the absence of a proactive and preventative stance to risk management reduced the resilience of agri-food SMEs to the risks presented by the pandemic. Generally, enterprises that operate both in domestic and export markets perceived lower COVID-19 risks. Finally, the main export destination to which the surveyed enterprises export was a significant determinant of their risk perception. These findings could be useful to managers of agri-food businesses in terms of better understanding of risks and promotion of risk management practices. More so, they can help design effective policy interventions to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on Egyptian agri-food SMEs and build up their resilience to future pandemics and shocks.",

If the pledges are upheld, about 75% of the egg laying flock will have to be converted to cage‐free by the year 2025. However, it is an open question as to whether the market will support such a change. To address this issue, a national survey of over 2,000 US egg consumers was conducted to estimate cage‐free egg demand among consumers exposed to different types of information. We find a high degree of heterogeneity in willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) for cage‐free eggs. Half of the consumers are WTP no more than a $0.30/dozen premium for cage‐free eggs; however, the mean premium is $1.16/dozen, suggesting a small fraction of consumers are willing to pay sizeable amounts for the cage‐free label. Ultimately, the results suggest there is potential for the market‐share for cage‐free eggs to rise above the current state even at premiums as high as $1.00/dozen. However, even at much more modest price premiums, the potential for cage‐free eggs to attain majority market share is unlikely, particularly if conventional eggs advertise other desirable attributes. We also find that retailers who completely remove more affordable, conventional eggs are likely to experience a significant increase in the share of consumers who choose not to buy eggs.",

However, few studies on FPCs have measured the benefits to gain farmers who participate in FPCs after controlling for observable attributes of farmers. This paper investigates the treatment effect of participation in a rice‐producing cooperative in suburban China using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Estimated results show that a significant difference is observed between participants and nonparticipants of the cooperative in terms of net income from rice production. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity of the treatment effects between large and small farmers. Therefore, we can conclude that the participation in agricultural cooperatives is more beneficial to relatively small farmers who are subject to suffer from higher transaction costs.

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) disrupted the food system motivating discussions about moving from a dependence on long food supply channels toward shorter local supply channels, including urban agriculture. This study examines two central questions regarding the adoption of urban agriculture practices at the household level during the COVID-19 pandemic: whether the outbreak of the novel coronavirus elicited participation in urban agriculture (e.g., community growing and home growing) and what are the characteristics of individuals who participate. To answer these questions, we conducted two online surveys in Phoenix, AZ, and Detroit, MI. The first round occurred during 2017 and the second during the lock-down in 2020. Using bivariate probit models, we find that (1) considerably fewer individuals participate in urban agriculture at community gardens compared to at-home gardening; (2) participation overall is lower in 2020 compared to 2017; and (3) respondents in Detroit practice urban agriculture more than respondents in Phoenix. Across both cities, our results suggest that the continuity of individuals' participation in growing food at community gardens and home is fragile. Not all characteristics that determined who participated in community gardens before COVID-19 are determining the likelihood to participate during the pandemic. In addition, growing food at home before COVID-19 was practiced by larger households and employed respondents, yet, during the pandemic, we find that home-growing was more likely when children were in the household and households were smaller and younger (Detroit), and younger and more educated (Phoenix). These findings suggest that many urban households' food-growing practices may not yet be mainstream and that other barriers may exist that inhibit households' participation.",

These features describe most firms in the livestock industry. However, studies on WCM related to these firms are scarce. Using a sample of 444 Spanish cheese‐manufacturing companies during the period 2010–2016 and applying a dynamic panel data methodology, this paper analyzes the extent to which the main components defining the WCM policies—days sales outstanding, days inventory outstanding (DIO), days payable outstanding (DPO), and cash conversion cycle (CCC)—affect firms' profitability. Empirical evidence reveals a negative effect of DIO and the CCC on firms' profitability, suggesting the need to reduce the level of inventory of cheese‐manufacturing companies. Similarly, the empirical evidence confirms a negative relationship between DPO and firms' profitability. [EconLit Citations: C23, G31, L25, L79, Q12].",

We calculate the annualized volatility per sector, screen the contents of the reports for stated effects of the pandemic on profits, and analyze stock price reactions in four different phases of the pandemic. The results show that stock markets have reacted with an increased price volatility. Manufacturers of fertilizers and agrochemicals as well as food distributors show particularly high volatilities in their stock prices. Low price volatility was observed in the stocks of food retailers. This pattern is also reflected in the profits of companies published in financial reports.

Digitizing procurements and other forms of transactions using mobile money technology among value chain actors is essential for ensuring financial inclusion and enhancing agricultural value chain transformation. This study examines the factors influencing the adoption of mobile money technology and the impact of the technology on production input use and farm output, utilizing data from a cross-sectional survey of smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. A linear regression with endogenous treatment effects method is employed to account for both observable and unobservable selection bias. The results reveal positive and significant marginal effect of mobile money technology on input use and farm output. Adopters of the technology applied 18% and 13% more fertilizer and herbicides, respectively than nonadopters. The output increased by about 4% for the adopters. The results also show that mobile money technology adoption, input use and farm output are significantly influenced by education, farmer-based organization (FBO) membership, access to credit, input prices, and location fixed effects. Expansion of mobile technology networks, increased investment in education, credit facilities, and FBOs can be quite relevant in promoting the adoption of mobile money technology in Ghana.

However, weak market incentives threaten sustained production, jeopardizing indigenous communities' cultural heritage and the in situ biodiversity of rice genetic resources. Demand‐side policy interventions have been proposed to address these challenges. Drawing on the experience economy, we staged an experience with urban consumers, offering them the opportunity to participate in cultural heritage preservation through purchasing heirloom rice. Participants first self‐selected into white or brown rice market segments as a benchmark. Subsequently, each market segment was invited to (i) identify their preference between their benchmark and heirloom rice, and (ii) bid to upgrade their non‐preferred to their preferred rice through a Becker‐DeGroot‐Marschak (BDM) mechanism. The sample was randomly split between a control group and two “experience treatment” groups exposed to gain‐ or loss‐framed narratives about rice terrace preservation. Results reveal that a subset of consumers in each market segment switched to heirloom rice. White rice consumers were more reluctant to transition to heirloom rice, although they responded positively to the gain‐framed narrative, paying the highest price premiums for heirloom rice (PhP 92.55 or US $2.03 per kilogram). Brown rice consumers were more willing to switch but willing to pay lower premiums for heirloom rice, altogether suggesting the need for a segmented marketing strategy. Highlighting nutritional benefits and quality is crucial, but positioning heirloom rice within a gastronomic system that showcases its use in specific dishes and occasions is equally important for enhancing consumer appeal.",

Discrete choice models are specified for explaining consumer decisions to decrease fresh meat consumption since the BSE-crisis and toward to the future. Demographic consumer characteristics, consumption frequency and attention to television coverage are included as explanatory variables in the models. A major focus is the impact of television, which has carried several negative reports about meat safety during recent years. Television coverage is found to have a highly negative impact on decision making toward fresh red meat consumption. Model estimation and computation of predicted probabilities reveal that the likelihood of cutting fresh meat consumption increases with greater attention given to television messages, as well as with the presence of young children in the household and with increasing age of the consumer. Interaction between attention to television and age reveals that younger people's decisions are more susceptive to media coverage. Heavy meat consumers are least likely to cut fresh meat consumption. Findings include implications for future livestock production and communication by the meat industry. [Econ-Lit citations: D120, L660, M390] © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

More aggressive marketing, together with a more distinct and recognizable labeling scheme, are often regarded as the keys to the marketing success of these new wines. This article employs hedonic price analysis to identify the values that marketers and consumers place on the information carried by the label of Australian wines in the British wine retail market. Although many grape varieties are given a highly distinct valuation by market participants, our results also suggest that consumers consider regions jointly with grape varieties as proxies for brands. This contrasts with the general observation that grape varietal labeling is the distinctive feature of New World wines. Marketing implications are examined by considering the revenue impact of changes in labeling at the retail level. [JEL citations: L150, D12, C21.] © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Many consumers, however, are turning to organic foods in order to avoid GM foods. This report attempts to differentiate consumer valuation of functional health properties in conventional, organic, and GM foods. A representative sample of 1,008 Canadian household food shoppers responded to twelve stated‐choice experiments during a telephone survey. Because opinions about organic and GM foods varied greatly, random parameters logit models were used to analyze their choices. Results indicate that many Canadian consumers will avoid GM foods, regardless of the presence of functional health properties. For others, the introduction of GM functional plant foods should increase acceptance of GM production methods, but many consumers will likely avoid functional foods derived from GM animals. The organic food industry could also profit from the introduction of organic functional foods. [EconLit citations: I120; D120.] © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Agribusiness 20: 155–166, 2004.",

These groups combine different dimensions of the two arguments normally used to explain price asymmetry: market concentration and product storability. Results from the study area in Brazil showed that neither product storability nor market concentration were required for intense price‐increase transmission. High and increasing Brazilian inflation rates found through 1994 led the population to expect continual price increases; the society may have been able to assimilate the most intense transmissions of price increments, independent of industry market power. Consequently, our results demonstrate that the findings from previous price transmission studies cannot be generalized to other industries or for other periods. New theoretical and empirical studies are needed to improve our understanding of asymmetrical price transmission. [EconLit Citations: L660, 810] © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Knowledge of its present competitiveness and improvement opportunities are lacking. To close this knowledge gap, we measured the competitiveness of eight subsectors, benchmarked them with four leading world economies, assessed the effect of differences in legal requirements, and predicted future developments using scenario analysis. International economics indicators supplemented with data on legal issues from a survey conducted by leading experts were used to measure competitiveness. The results show that the EU food industry's competitiveness is weak. The legal system was positively evaluated compared to the U.S. system, but major improvements are possible. The recommendations are to improve economies of scale, economies of scope, ICT‐based supply chain management, and exploit cultural differences through innovation, within a more flexible and streamlined legal framework.

After a review of earlier agribusiness competitiveness studies, an Industrial Competitiveness Index is proposed as a composite measure for multidimensional economic performance, covering profitability, productivity and output growth. The index approach enables relative competitiveness comparisons across industries, countries and over time. In addition, cluster analysis is used for identifying distinct groups of industries characterized by similar performance patterns. The results suggest that the beverage manufacturing industry was the most competitive EU F&amp;D industry, while the United Kingdom was the country with the highest performance averaged across all F&amp;D manufacturing activities. As compared to the average of the period 1995–1998, overall competitiveness in real terms slightly increased. At the same time, overall competitiveness seems also to have converged slightly across countries, implying that the performance of EU countries in F&amp;D manufacturing has become more similar. As for the clustering results, it appears that competitiveness is in general fairly equally distributed across the different industries and that above‐ or below‐average performance is usually not sustained for long.

The authors use a double-hurdle model and the 2002 Agricultural Resource Management Survey to evaluate empirically the adoption of a DMS and its impact on gross sales of farm operations managed by American farmers. Results suggest that production of organic crops and the regional location of the farm positively affect adoption of a DMS. Adoption of DMS, however, has a negative relation to large farms, farms with production contracts, and farms specializing in cash grains. Farms adopting a DMS are typically those with organic crops and those located in regions with access to a large metropolitan customer base. Our results show that farmers who have adopted a DMS continue to capture a larger proportion of the consumers' dollar increase gross sales than those who have not adopted a DMS.

From the use of the Heckman two‐step procedure, they also calculate own‐price, cross‐price, and income elasticities by estimating demand relationships for both organic and conventional milk. They find that demographic factors play a crucial role in the household choice of purchasing organic milk. Furthermore, households are more sensitive to own‐price changes in the case of organic milk versus conventional milk. Evidence from estimated cross‐price elasticities indicates that organic and conventional milk are substitutes. However, quantities purchased of organic milk are more sensitive to changes in prices of conventional milk than vice versa. Consequently, an asymmetric pattern exists with regard to the substitution patterns of the respective milk types. Moreover, evidence indicates that organic milk is responsive to income changes, but conventional milk is not responsive to income changes. Finally, a 1% increase in the price of organic milk reduces total milk sales by 0.20%, but a 1% increase in the price of conventional milk raises total milk sales by 0.31%.

The results suggest that in the food industry the persistence of process innovation is higher than in product innovation. Environmental and market determinants such as market changes or appropriability are more decisive to explain innovation in food industry.

Further, farmers prefer market channels that do not require major upfront investments. The results suggest that the traditional marketing preferences of farmers could impede participation of small‐holders in emerging supply chains and take advantage of the potential opportunities that new agrifood supply chains can offer.

The objective of the study was to determine the impact of cowpea grain quality characteristics on market price. The data for the study were collected from markets in Nigeria, Ghana, and Mali. Hedonic pricing methods provide a statistical estimate of premiums and discounts. The results indicated that cowpea consumers in Ghana, Mali, and Nigeria are willing to pay a premium for large cowpea grains. Bruchid damage is not statistically significant in any market. The impact of price on other cowpea quality characteristics such as skin color and texture and eye color vary locally. Implications for development of the cowpea value chain are as follows: (a) researchers should identify cost‐effective ways to increase cowpea grain size because larger grain are preferred and (b) serving local markets requires a portfolio of grain skin and eye color and skin texture combinations.

The results suggest that, regardless of location, consumers place a strong premium on price and labeling claims. Three consumer segments are identified in each city; in Toronto, these segments are labeled Fair Trade‐Focused, Price Conscious, and Balanced Buyers; for Vancouver these segments are labeled Organic and Fair Trade‐Focused, Price Conscious, and Balanced Buyers. Although a broad spectrum of variables influences segment membership, no single variable explains membership in the same segment in each city.

Then the results of a survey of 170 German agribusiness companies are presented and using partial least squares (PLS) methodology for evaluating a structural equation model, they test their conceptual framework. CSR efforts in their sample are significantly influenced by the competitive strategy a company pursues, its number of employees, and the degree of altruism it incorporates. Moreover, in their model CSR efforts significantly enhance corporate reputation. They conclude with some theoretical and managerial implications and outline some future research directions.

This paper looks at this new perspective in value creation where personalized consumer experience takes central stage as opposed to a product and firm‐centric view. Through an explorative case study, the paper illustrates how a joint innovation effort between Molson Coors Brewing Company UK (MCBC‐UK) and a supplier is leading to more open approaches as consumers are involved in the process. By understanding what consumers' value and engaging in active dialog and interaction, MCBC‐UK has been able to develop superior value propositions relevant to their target consumer base. The case underscores the role of consumer value creation in a commoditizing world where companies can seek to maximize the lifetime value of desirable consumer segments by taking consumers as a partner or co‐producer instead of an external element.

The methods and major findings of the literature are discussed and avenues for future research are suggested. The literature review shows that price volatility is analyzed using a class of univariate and multivariate GARCH models. The reviewed studies conclude that price volatility transmits along food supply chains thereby exposing all chain actors to risk and uncertainty. Extension of the limited sample period, country, product, and chain stages coverage of the current literature are suggested as avenues for future research. A largely ignored aspect in the current literature is the identification and empirical testing of the role of contextual factors on the degree of price volatility transmission.",

With regard to brands, consumers prefer brands affiliated with proprietary enterprises over brands held by agricultural cooperatives. The interactions between organic label and brands as well as that between Green label and brands were significantly positive suggesting synergy between these labels and brands. Conversely, the interaction between the GRS label and brands was insignificant.

Although functional foods exhibit a significant level of information asymmetry, consumers appear to be increasingly appreciative, recognizing their role in preventing or reducing health risks and/or improving other physiological functions. This paper quantifies the willingness to pay of a representative sample of 600 Italian consumers for a hypothetical yogurt using a web‐based stated choice experiment. The willingness to pay for two functional attributes (probiotics and catechin enrichment) was measured using the panel data version of a Random Parameters Logit model. The results show that respondents are willing to pay a premium for a catechin‐enriched yogurt (0.38 €/jar), which is well above their willingness to pay for the probiotic attribute (0.21 €/jar). Averaging the individual values across sample sub‐groups indicates that the willingness to pay for catechin enrichment may be related to age, income, health status, lifestyle and education.

Several programs initiated in the region to increase food production and commercialization among smallholder farmers have had limited success. Over 80% of the farm households grow bananas and legumes as staple crops. We evaluate the impact of commercialization of these crops on‐farm income and the dietary diversity of rural households in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We employ three methods: propensity score matching, endogenous switching regression, and IPTW on cross‐sectional data. We find that commercialization has a robust and positive significant effect on dietary diversity and farm income, even after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across the households. In particular, commercialization increases household incomes by 67% and dietary diversity by 11%. We find strong evidence of the impact of commercialization on incomes but little evidence of dietary diversity of rural households. Wider policy recommendations to raise the capacity of smallholders to produce for the market and improve their livelihoods are discussed. [EconLit citations: Q13, Q12, Q11]",

Consumers also had higher WTP for origin labeling compared to uncertified traceability information. Moreover, traceability to slaughter and processing was viewed as a substitute for local farming labeling and complement to non‐local farming labeling. Despite the heterogeneity among consumer groups, all consumers had some positive WTP for the local farming labeling attribute of traceable pork.

    "abstract": "Abstract One longstanding research issue in agricultural marketing is the relationship between farm marketing channels and farm profitability. Due to the increasing consumer demand for food safety, direct‐to‐consumer marketing channels have been promoted. However, recent evidence shows that the adoption rate of farms that use direct‐to‐consumer marketing channels is still low, and it is not clear whether they can increase farm profitability. This study contributes to this issue in several ways. First, we examine whether the choice of different marketing channels, including sales to wholesalers, wholesale markets, and direct‐to‐consumer outlets by farm households affects farm profitability. Second, we discuss the mechanism behind these evident effects. We construct a large‐scale sample of fruit and vegetable farms drawn from the 2015 Taiwanese Agriculture Census Survey and estimate a semiparametric multivalued treatment effect model. Although the government is promoting direct marketing, we find that wholesale markets are the most profitable marketing channel for farms in Taiwan. Furthermore, results from the quantile analysis shows that this finding is more pronounced for farms with higher profits. With respect to the mechanism behind these observed effects, we find that profit differentials between marketing channels are likely attributable to the use of pesticides and fertilizers on farm production.

    "abstract": "Abstract By 2022, the European Commission seeks to introduce harmonized, mandatory front‐of‐pack (FOP) nutrition labeling. The color‐graded Nutri‐Score is at the heart of the European debate. Yet, little is known about how the information provided in back‐of‐pack (BOP) nutrition tables interacts with evaluative FOP labels, such as Nutri‐Score, and if different consumer groups use both information cues differently when making food choices. Our objective is thus to identify segments of nutrition label users and contrast their choice behavior and use of FOP and BOP nutritional information. Therefore, this study builds on an attitude‐based segmentation analysis and a survey‐based discrete choice experiment among German consumers. We identify five segments of nutritional information users and significant interaction effects between FOP and BOP nutritional cues. Consumers use supplementary nutritional information differently: relying on BOP nutrition facts only ( label‐resisters ) or combining both information cues ( majority ). For most, Nutri‐Score reinforces the positive effect of a healthier nutrient profile on purchase likelihood, while its use stigmatizes products of low nutritional quality. Overall, supplementary Nutri‐Score labeling enables better alignment of food choices and health preferences, especially for consumers overwhelmed by technical BOP nutrition tables, and helps differentiate products with relatively unhealthy nutritional profiles. We discuss implications for food policy and business. [EconLit citations: D12, Q13, Q18].",

The algorithms were applied to the data collected over 8 years in 2014 and 2021 related to the price of drinking milk in Turkey. The economic, social, and environmental factors that have an impact on the unit price of drinking milk were evaluated. Five ML algorithms, including random forest, gradient boosting, support vector machine (SVM), neural network, and AdaBoost algorithms, were utilized to predict the drinking milk unit price. ML also applied hyperparameter tuning with nested cross‐validation to calculate the prediction accuracy for each algorithm. The results show that the random forest algorithm based on the features of the ML algorithms has the best performance, with the accuracy of 99.30% for training and 98.10% for testing the dataset. The average accuracy of gradient boosting, SVM, neural network, and AdaBoost are obtained as 97.30%, 96.15%, 95.65%, and 96.05%, respectively. Random forest performed best as the target variable with the lowest deviation values of mean squared error (MSE) (0.004), root mean square error (RMSE) (0.060), and mean absolute error (MAE) (0.029) in the training and MSE (0.009), RMSE (0.096), and MA (0.055) in the testing dataset.

In this study, we collected 175 cross‐sectional household data and employed a probit regression model to identify the determinants of vegetable farmers' market participation. The study estimates the impact of market participation on households' income and per capita consumption using the propensity score matching approach (PSM). Subsequently, the study used the endogenous switch regression (ESR) model to control sample selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity. ESR also evaluates the robustness of PSM outcomes. Results from PSM and ESR approaches suggest that vegetable market participation positively and significantly impacts smallholders' income and consumption expenditure. The study rejects the null hypothesis that vegetable market participation does not significantly impact farmers' welfare. Results show that vegetable market participation increases the farmers' monthly income and annual per capita consumption expenditure on average by Indian rupee (INR) 8360 and INR 26,410, respectively. Findings also indicate that household size, distance to market, off‐farm income, access to training, price information, vehicle ownership, and storage systems are critical determinants of vegetable farmers' market participation. Identified determinants may support policymakers in designing suitable agricultural marketing policies to reduce market entry barriers and motivate farmers for market participation.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Integrating small‐scale farmers into large markets is crucial for agricultural modernization. To this end, China—as a ‘large country, small farmer’—has fostered socialized agricultural services (SASs). Although some studies have examined specific service components of SASs, a systematic analysis is missing and the mechanisms of SAS's effects on farmers' market participation has not been clarified. To address this gap, we use data from the 2020 China Rural Revitalization Survey to construct a motivation–opportunity–ability (MOA) framework for farmers' market participation behavior, uniquely introducing SASs to assess their impact on small farmers' market participation. This comprehensively examines farmers' market and deep‐market participation, as measured by their sales decisions and channel selections, respectively, and addresses model endogeneity using the conditional mixed process and Heckman model. The findings reveal that SASs promote farmers' market and deep‐market participation, augmenting the probability of participation by 39.6% and 14.2%, respectively. Mechanisms analysis reveals that this positive impact is brought about by increasing farmers' motivation to produce marketable products, providing farmers with direct access to heavily capitalized buyers, and increasing farmers' market participation ability. The heterogeneity analyses demonstrates that SASs improve the market participation of rice and corn farmers, having the greatest impact on the former. The findings provide policy guidelines concerning how to promote farmers' market participation in China, and provide a “Chinese experience” for other developing countries.",

This study utilizes dataset of Chinese administrative villages to investigate the impact of e‐commerce on poverty reduction and the potential mechanisms.

Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the poverty reduction effect of e‐commerce is especially significant in villages situated in the less developed western region, in plateau, in locations lacking a public transportation system, and in villages where the village secretary has a limited educational background. The poverty reduction effect of e‐commerce is significant in villages with lower propensity to have e‐commerce service stations. Additionally, the treatment effect of e‐commerce is not constant and homogeneous for those villages that are at the margin of no difference between adopting and not adopting e‐commerce. Furthermore, e‐commerce reduces rural poverty by enhancing collective action, improving the commercialization level, and facilitating participation in pension insurance. These insights reveal drivers of rural poverty reduction and suggest policies to boost rural e‐commerce and economic development.",

However, little is known about the effect of outsourcing fertilizer mechanization services (FMS) for fertilizer application to different types of service providers. This study simultaneously investigates the determinants and effect of outsourcing FMS to different types of service providers for fertilizer application in rural China. The multinomial endogenous treatment effects model that accounts for potential selection bias and endogeneity is employed to analyze cross‐sectional survey data of wheat producers. The results reveal that the likelihood of outsourcing FMS is influenced by household (gender, education, off‐farm employment, and risk attitude) and farm (farm size, land topography, soil fertility) characteristics, membership to cooperative, and the availability of AMS at village level. The treatment effect estimates suggest that outsourcing FMS can decrease fertilizer application by at least 6.6%. Outsourcing both FMS and fertilizer supply has a greater reducing effect on fertilizer application compared to only outsourcing FMS. Besides, outsourcing both FMS and fertilizer supply to organization providers has a higher effect on reducing fertilizer application and enhancing yield compared to outsourcing to individual service providers.

    "abstract": "Rapidly increasing concentration in food manufacturing and retailing has heightened concern about the exercise of market power by food manufacturers and retailers to the detriment of farm producers and consumers. Although market power in the food industry has been studied rather extensively, prior analyses have focused on the exercise of selling power, either by manufacturers or retailers. This study develops a simple but flexible model of a food market channel to study both buyer (oligopsony) and seller (oligopoly) power, and the potential impacts of successive market power at multiple stages of the market channel on the magnitude and distribution of economic welfare. Simulation results show that even modest market power can enable the food marketing sector to capture large shares of the market surplus. Efficiency (deadweight) losses, however, tend to be rather small unless the level of market power is high or if market power is exercised at multiple stages of the channel.

Each fish is individually inspected for various quality attributes before being flown to Japan for the fresh tuna market. The first objective of this study is to formally evaluate the degree to which the price of U.S. fresh bluefin tuna is determined by quality attributes of each fish, rather than by just the quantity supplied. This is accomplished using a Hedonic model. The results support the hypothesis that the fresh bluefin tuna price is, in fact, significantly influenced by the quality attributes of the fish, including the freshness, fat content, color, and shape. Interesting implications for public management of this highly valued resource arise from the results. [Econ‐Lit citation: L150, L190, L660] © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Previous research also shows that these attitudes are quite resistant to attempts to change them by giving additional information. The aim of the study was to investigate if positive sensory experience with a (purportedly) GMO‐based food product would influence consumers' attitude towards the use of GMOs in food production. An experiment was conducted in which subjects in the experimental group tasted cheeses, one of which was labeled as “produced using GMOs.” The cheeses were selected in a way that ensured that the subject had a sensory preference for the GMO cheese. A control group tasted cheeses that were unlabelled. After the tasting, subjects completed a conjoint analysis task about cheese, in which the type of starter culture used (GMO/conventional) was one of the attributes. Subjects also were administered a set of items measuring attitude towards the use of GMOs in food production. Results showed that for subjects in the experimental group (who believed that they had tasted a GMO cheese, with which they had a positive sensory experience) (1) attitude towards GMO in food production was less negative, and (2) type of starter culture used (GM/conventional) had less impact on their buying intentions with regard to cheese than for subjects in the control group.

There is a wealth of literature on the farm‐retail price spread for different commodities and countries. However, with one exception (Bojnec, 2002) none have studied price transmission and marketing margins in the transition economies. It is a common belief that because of the distorted markets inherited from the pre 1989 period, the deficiency of the price‐discovery mechanisms, and unpredictable policy interventions, marketing margins are generally larger in the transition economies than in competitive markets. Using cointegration analysis, we find that producer and retail pork meat prices are cointegrated, the retail prices entering the cointegration space as weakly exogenous variables. Structural tests imposing homogeneity conditions are carried out and show a competitive pricing strategy. Price transmission modeling suggests that, despite the common belief, price transmission on the Hungarian pork meat market is symmetric.

Empirical data originate from the 15 largest EU dairy firms during a 5‐year period (1998–2002). In total 198 activities are identified. They are classified into six categories: (a) mergers, (b) acquisitions, (c) strategic share holdings, (d) joint ventures, (e) licensing, and (f) general collaboration agreements. It is shown that cooperative firms prefer mergers, collaboration agreements, joint ventures, and licensing. All of these are relatively low in terms of both performance risks and relational risks, and they demand limited amounts of equity capital. Investor‐owned firms focus on take‐over strategies—acquisitions and share holdings. Other indicators of risk aversion are that cooperatives tend to collaborate with other cooperatives and that they prefer partners in their own home market.

The study identifies four broad groupings of barriers to HACCP implementation, namely perceptions that HACCP is of “questionable appropriateness” to the firm, the scale of change required to achieve implementation, low priority given to enhancement of food safety controls, and financial constraints. The severity of these identified barriers differs significantly between firms that have implemented HACCP and those that have not. In particular, HACCP implementation is impeded significantly by barriers related to financial constraints. The most important driver promoting implementation is customer requirements for HACCP to be implemented in supplier facilities. [EconLit citations: D210, L600, L660]. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

We also estimate the short‐run and long‐run elasticities of price transmission between the farm and retail levels of the marketing channel for whole milk and 2% milk for seven U.S. cities by model specification. We employ monthly data over the period from January 1994 to October 2002. Consistent with the extant literature, empirical results suggest that the farm‐retail price transmission process for milk is asymmetric. Price transmission elasticities, in conjunction with rising farm prices, are generally larger than corresponding elasticities associated with falling farm prices, but they all are quite inelastic.

The assessment procedure introduces a new financial decision‐aid approach, which is based on data‐analysis techniques in combination with a preference ranking organization method of enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE II). The application of this multicriteria decision‐aid approach allows the rank ordering of cooperatives based on the most prominent financial ratios. The financial ratios were selected using principal component analysis. This analytical procedure reduces the dimensionality of large numbers of interrelated financial performance measures. We assess the financial success of Dutch agribusiness cooperatives for the period 1999–2010. Results show that there is no clear‐cut evidence that cooperative models used to attract extra members’ investments and/or outside equity perform better than the more traditional models. This suggests that ownership structure of cooperatives is not always a decisive factor for their financial success. [EconLit citations: Q130, G320, C440].",

In this paper, values and food‐related lifestyles, as well as transaction costs and socio‐demographics, are used to analyze consumer participation in alternative food chains in Italy. Using a simultaneous system of equations, a model with instrumental variables is implemented to measure the relationships between values and food‐related lifestyles, and between the latter and participation in an alternative food chain. Our results show that Italian participants in alternative food chains have the profile of rational shoppers who typically look at price and taste criteria. Although transaction costs do not affect participation directly, they do so through food‐related lifestyles.",

Technical efficiency scores for the industry are estimated using the data envelopment analysis approach. Moreover, bootstrapped truncated regressions and OLS regressions are applied in order to investigate the factors affecting technical efficiency. The empirical results indicate that there is a fluctuation of technical efficiency scores among the sectors of the food and beverages industry. Furthermore, the findings obtained from both the Tobit and the OLS regressions support that the factors affecting positively the level of technical efficiency are sector size, capital productivity, labor productivity, and labor intensity. The results also show that the technical efficiency of the whole industry tended to decrease during the period 1984–2007. Moreover, the present paper provides some policy recommendations that may be useful for the industry to overcome the present economic crisis. Finally, in future research, the technical efficiency of the Greek food industry will be analyzed based on the meta‐analysis approach. [JEL Classifications: C60, L60, O14].",

The main results show that higher incomes, lower prices, cultural and geographical affinities, and trade agreements promote wine exports; the expansion of bottled wine trade, especially within the EU, is particularly highlighted.

To study how the globally active online grocer Amazon Fresh reacted to this extraordinary demand increase, we analyzed a large dataset of daily price quotes for over 19,000 products for the customer location, Los Angeles. We found that contrary to the US consumer food price index, the overall price level at Amazon Fresh did not increase during the pandemic, but even slightly decreased for several product groups. Amazon seems to follow its low-price strategy also in the grocery sector, even in times of high demand. However, during the lockdown phase, there were more price increases for certain highly demanded product groups such as frozen and prepared foods. Moreover, fewer prices were communicated as promotional prices. Because this change did not influence the general price level, we conclude that such promotional prices are used more as a marketing tool than as a price-setting instrument.",

To do so, this paper investigates the value addition relationships of different supply chain players from farm to retail level. Based on extensive literature review and deep discussions with supply chain practitioners as well as academicians, a conceptual framework is developed to assist those players in identifying the importance of adding value, defining a common definition of value addition practices, and getting motivation for superior value addition improvement. Value addition practices of five stages at the food supply chain, namely, farmer, supplier, processor, distributor and retailer, are conceptualized and formulated to tests the relationship among these stages. The study mainly focuses on the value addition of farm products in Indian scenario. The findings affirmed that the farmer's value addition is positively related to supplier's value addition, processor's value addition, and distributor's value addition. Moreover, supplier's value addition is positively related to processor's value addition, and processor's value addition is positively related to distributor's value addition. Besides, distributor's value addition is positively related to retailer's value addition. [JEL Classification: M210].",

New‐media marketing has gained attention as a relatively low‐cost and high‐exposure marketing strategy. This paper utilizes binary logit and interval censored regression to examine the use and the impact of social‐media marketing in the green industry. The analysis was based on primary data from a survey of US nurseries and garden centers. The findings reveal that the daily use of social‐media marketing is largely driven by the network effect and the managers’ attitudes. They also indicate that the small‐sized firms receive higher returns from social media use in terms of increased sales compared with larger firms.",

Using a between‐subjects design, we elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for healthy snack bars using two mechanisms, ask questions about ease of understanding and answering the valuation questions, and record the response times to the valuation questions. We do not find significant differences in estimated WTP and response times between the two methods. However, the respondents in the multiple price list (MPL) sessions found it easier to understand this mechanism and decide on a response than those in the BDM sessions. As a result of our findings, we recommend that MPL is adopted over BDM when there is limited opportunity to explain or learn the method before the valuation or when one is concerned that a complicated design can affect the willingness to participate and thereby create selection bias. Both concerns will often apply when small and medium size agribusinesses conduct market testing of their products in stores or field markets. [EconLit Citations: C18, C19, D44, Q13].",

Findings indicate that agricultural insurance led to a significant increase in aggregate agricultural output across provinces. The results remain robust when potential endogeneity in insurance uptake is considered. In addition, mechanism tests were performed to identify the channels through which insurance influences productivity. These show that agricultural insurance contributes to increasing labor productivity and the area of cultivated land per capita and encourages specialized planting, all of which promote growth in agricultural production. Finally, agricultural insurance plays a more important role in Eastern China and nonmajor crop‐producing areas [EconLit Citations: Q13, Q18].",

Specifically, we focus on the dyadic relationships between farmers and different types of buyers, including besides lead firms, intermediaries, and wholesalers, which have received little attention in the scientific literature. Our analysis focuses on formal and informal contracts as governance forms between farmers and buyers, and explores the correlation between contract provisions (e.g., quality, quantity, and the provision of services), relationship attributes (i.e., satisfaction, trust, and opportunism) and adoption of SAPs. We gathered survey data from 352 vegetable farmers in Chile and employed analysis of variance and logit modeling for our analysis. Our findings indicate that small‐scale farmers primarily engage with intermediaries using informal contracts, while medium‐scale farmers trade with wholesalers through spot markets, and large‐scale farmers with lead firms using formal contracts. We also found that farmers who traded through informal contracts, mainly with intermediaries, reported greater satisfaction in the farmer‐buyer relationship than farmers trading through formal contracts. However, farmers engaging in informal contracts were less likely to adopt SAPs than farmers trading through formal contracts. Our results suggest that the governance form (contracts or spot market) adopted for the relationship between farmers and buyers influences the adoption of SAPs, while the impact of relationship attributes on SAP adoption is less clear. A deeper understanding of buyers and their relationship with farmers is essential to enhance policies encouraging SAP adoption in regional and local fresh food supply chains.

    "abstract": "Abstract The establishment of agricultural cooperatives is widely viewed as an institutional arrangement to remove constraints that prevent smallholders from accessing profitable business opportunities in agriculture. Agricultural cooperatives in China offer a wide range of services within the framework of contract farming and vertical integration. This study empirically examines the multiple roles of China's cooperatives in improving farm production efficiency and conserving the agricultural environment. Considering that agricultural cooperatives' services can be broadly divided into biological and machinery services, we specify a stochastic frontier production function in a special form, called the separated Cobb–Douglas. The empirical results present clear evidence that Chinese agricultural cooperatives play essential roles in increasing biochemical technical efficiency and protecting the agroecological environment. However, the involvement of cooperatives as vertical integrators is demonstrated to have a detrimental effect on biochemical technical efficiency. The pressing challenge for agricultural cooperative development in China is to accommodate the conflicting consequences that their entry into farming has on biochemical and machinery technical efficiencies. This has strong policy implications, although our study has certain limitations in terms of the narrow focus on a single specific region. [EconLit Citations: C26, Q12, Q13, Q15, Q18].",

This study explores whether providing information about eco‐labels can improve consumers’ valuations of eco‐labeled foods. We tested three types of information—selfish (health related), altruistic (environment related), and combined (both)—and used a sample of 4523 Chinese consumers. Our results indicate that all three types of information increase consumers’ valuations of eco‐labeled foods. Consumers express the largest valuation for eco‐labeled foods when provided with selfish information, followed by altruistic information and combined information. We also found heterogeneous responses to all information treatments, with high‐income consumers being more responsive to selfish information, while more highly educated consumers are more sensitive to combined information. We discuss the implications for designing policies to develop eco‐labeled food markets, for example, by using redundant or identity‐based information on the labels, especially in developing economies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Straw returning is important for rural ecological management and sustainable agricultural development. Using farm survey data for Anhui Province, China, in 2020, we applied the double‐hurdle model to investigate the impact of agricultural machinery services and land fragmentation on farmers' straw‐returning behavior, and to explore the relationship between agricultural machinery self‐service and outsourced service. Self‐service had a significant positive effect on farmers' straw‐returning behavior, while outsourced service had a significant positive effect only on degree of adoption. Land fragmentation had a significant negative effect on farmers' straw‐returning behavior, and significantly inhibited the effect of self‐service on adoption decision. Complementarity existed between self‐service and outsourced service in farmers' straw‐returning adoption decision, and the effect was more pronounced among smaller‐scale farmers. There was significant substitutability between self‐service and outsourced service in degree of adoption among larger‐scale farmers. Transfer and integration of rural land, increasing agricultural machinery purchase subsidy, upgrading farmers' self‐service capability, and promoting development of socialized agricultural machinery services should be implemented to promote crop straw returning.

    "abstract": "Abstract This article investigates the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitment of small agri‐food businesses disclosed by 279 Italians using Thomson Reuters Eikon ESG indicators and its relationship with their financial dimensions, that is, the corporate profitability indexes (ROE and EBITDA) and cost of debt, used as a proxy of the ability to access credit. Findings showed the absence of social reporting and the disclosure of business governance, including sustainability strategy, and the poor reporting of the environmental and social pillars, except for product innovation, product quality, and responsible marketing themes. The capability of ESG disclosure to predict corporate profitability and access to credit is limited. Moreover, investments in product responsibility are negatively related to the cost of debt, while commitment toward the internal and external companies' community appears to predict their ability to access credit positively. In light of the new institutional pressures requiring small agri‐food businesses to change and combine intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for CSR, the study extends the literature on the sustainability of small agri‐food businesses, which is mostly limited, and provides significant practical and political contributions to foster the paradigm shift toward sustainability [EconLit Citations: M21, Q01, Q13].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite a rapid growth in olive oil consumption in recent few years, the culinary use of olive oil is still relatively new to UK consumers, and is still regarded as a set of particular attributes rather than as an everyday cooking oil. To increase sales and attract new users, olive oil needs to be seen by UK consumers as an ‘everyday’ cooking oil, and enter into direct competition with standard vegetable oils. To achieve this, we argue in this paper that standard olive oil needs to be repositioned and distanced from extra virgin olive oil in order to give customers sufficient cues to revise their opinions and consumption strategies. The objective of this paper is to report the results of a conjoint study as a tool for the analysis of attribute trade‐offs made in product choices by consumers, applied to the UK standard olive oil market. The ideal standard olive oil profile for 130 UK users of olive oil was found to be one packed in medium sized PET bottles (750 ml) at a price of £2.99.

    "abstract": "Wal-Mart's 1999 sales in its Supercenter stores will rival that of Kroger, the leading national supermarket chain. With estimated sales at $45–47 billion plus growth of 40% from $32 billion in prior year sales, Wal-Mart's growth has been accomplished without expansion by acquisition or merger. This growth was achieved by capital investment, building new or reformatting existing Wal-Mart stores with the Supercenter format, a hypermarket with general merchandising and full-size supermarket areas. Currently, the number of Wal-Mart Supercenters exceeds 721. Wal-Mart opened 275 Supercenters during 1998 and 1999 and will continue the pace, exceeding 1,400 by the year 2005. These Supercenters will affect the market position and competitive strategies of other food retailers. To date, most reformatting has been in smaller cities and rural areas, perhaps because they tend to have less organized labor markets. This study finds Wal-Mart Supercenter entry had little impact on food seller concentration in major metropolitan areas between 1993 and 1999. Wal-Mart entered 54 of the largest 100 metro areas. Wal-Mart tended to enter cities in the south and east. There is no correlation between entry and city size. Multiple linear regression analysis however indicates that Wal-Mart's market shares are highest in lower income and smaller metro areas.

    "abstract": "Abstract We explore whether current innovation has an enduring effect on future innovative activity in large, global food and beverage (F&amp;B) companies. We analyze a sample of 16,698 patents granted in the United States over the period 1977 to 1994 to 103 F&amp;B firms selected from the world's largest F&amp;B multinationals. We test whether patent time series are trend stationary or difference stationary in order to detect how large the autoregressive parameter is and how enduring the impact of past innovation in these companies is. We conclude that the patent series are not consistent with the random walk model. The null hypothesis of a unit root can be rejected at the 5% level when a constant and a time trend are considered. Both utility and design patent series are stationary around a constant and a time trend. Moreover, there is a permanent component in the patent time series. Thus, global F&amp;B firms show a stable pattern of technological accumulation in which “success breeds success.” “Old” innovators are the ones to foster both important changes and new ways of packaging products among F&amp;B multinationals. The effect of past innovation is almost permanent. By contrast, other potential stimuli to technological change have only transitory effects on innovation. Patterns of technological accumulation vary in specific F&amp;B industries. Past experience in design is important in highly processed foods and beverages, but not in agribusinesses and basic foodstuffs. Patterns of technological accumulation are similar in both smaller multinationals/newcomers and large, established multinationals.

Yet, there is little understanding of how these organizations contribute to sustainability. This study therefore presents a case study of the strategies by which CCOs aim to achieve their sustainability objectives. A cross‐case comparison indicates that many strategic differences between codes of conduct can be traced back to two types of CCOs: those weighting principles over size, and those weighting size over principles. The former put a measuring rule in the market, and enable primary producers to differentiate themselves from mainstream production. The latter set lower requirements, but target mainstream production and involve large retailers and processing firms. Given the unique roles played by these types of organizations, sustainable development is best served by the synergy that results under “co‐opetition”: when the two types of rival organizations coexist.

Although there is a long tradition in transaction cost theory of analyzing the determinants of make or buy decisions in manufacturing, surprisingly few empirical studies have been conducted in the agriculture and food and beverage industry. Likewise, although quality is a key competitive variable in many food sectors, only a few studies have analyzed quality in their models. The authors find that transaction costs and product quality provide a useful explanation of vertical integration in the wine industry in the Rioja DOCa. Wineries that produce high‐quality wines are more likely to integrate vertically than those producing low‐quality wines. They also find that the size of the winery significantly affects make or buy choices. Implications are explored for managers facing a governance mode choice.

A probit model was used to determine the factors influencing the EurepGap compliance decision while descriptive statistics were used to identify the major constraints to compliance. Results indicate that the high initial cost of compliance is a major constraint on compliance. This arises from the need to purchase recommended agro-chemicals and fertilizers, and the hiring of additional labor. The key factors that are likely to enhance compliance with the standards include socioeconomic and farm characteristics such as area under French beans, household size, total number of farm enterprises and access to extension services. However, compliance is also negatively influenced by access to off-farm income. The authors make several policy recommendations that could be implemented to enhance and upscale compliance with EurepGap standards in the study area.

In the meantime the organic market has matured. Consequently, results in literature need to be reviewed. This study specifically addresses own‐price elasticity estimates for organic and conventional milk. The analysis is based on a household panel dataset of 20,000 German households. A two‐step estimation procedure is applied. First, a probit regression examines which household characteristics affect the probability of buying organic milk. Second, a linear approximated almost ideal demand system provides detailed demand elasticity estimates. By using up‐to‐date data, distinguishing between different consumer groups, incorporating sociodemographic information and relying on a considerably large sample size this study is both an update and a refinement of previous research. In contrast to previous studies, econometric results suggest that demand for organic milk is absolutely price‐inelastic in Germany. However, price responsiveness differs substantially between milk types and consumer groups. (EconLit classifications: C33, C34, D12). © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Results of the model show that the incentive strength regarding the member CEO is stronger compared to that of the outside CEO in order to shift some effort of the member CEO from individual farming into the task of adding value to the cooperative enterprise. A cooperative with a member CEO is uniquely efficient when upstream and downstream tasks are substitutes to a certain extent, or complements. When the tasks are substitutes, the efficient CEO identity depends on the strength of the substitution effect and the difference of the marginal productivities between the two tasks. The scope of cooperatives with a member CEO being efficient becomes smaller when the substitution effect is at an intermediate level or the productivity difference between the two tasks is limited.

We study if and how farmer cooperatives can build brand equity to drive or support product differentiation. With emphasis on ownership type and product origin, we conduct two choice experiments with cheese and cereal consumers in the United States. The results of our multinomial logit model indicate farmer cooperatives can command a price premium as compared to store brands, but not as much as non‐cooperatives. Cheese and cereal consumers also indicate a general willingness to pay for product origin and family ownership attributes, but the effects are not always compatible with farmer cooperatives. Overall, although price premiums for cooperative brands and labels may exist across various product categories, the heterogeneity in willingness to pay estimates for other product attributes is suggestive of the difficulties farmer cooperatives face in pursuit of product differentiation.

This study is focused on the analysis of yogurt retail prices that show a great variability in the Italian market. In fact, our survey, carried out in a selected area of Italy during the last months of 2010, showed that yogurt retail prices range from 0.9 Euro/kg to 9.6 Euro/kg. We deemed the hedonic price model to be the most appropriate analytical tool for this investigation because it allows explaining how the price of yogurt varies depending on its main quality attributes. The study's results may be useful in better understanding the evolutionary dynamics of an important market, such as yogurt in Italy, and, second, in addressing the marketing strategies of yogurt manufacturers facing an expanding market that is also characterized by an increasing competitive pressure and a rapid change in consumer preferences.

We conducted online choice experiments with a sample of over 1,400 consumers from the U.S. to determine WTP for production and region of origin labeling accounting for simultaneous versus individual labeling. Results indicate consumers prefer dates grown in Arizona over dates not labeled for region of origin. Also, pesticide-free and GMO-free dates are preferred, with pesticide-free having a larger impact on choices. Furthermore, accounting for interactions between these two labels reveals that they can be considered subadditive in that labeling the product with both designations reduces WTP relative to “pesticide-free” labeling only.

These technologies often require prohibitively high upfront costs. One potential solution for these brewers is to market their product as sustainable and charge a premium to offset some of the costs. We undertake a stated preference choice experiment targeting a nationally representative sample of beer buyers and elicit preferences for multiple attributes related to environmental sustainability in beer. We find that, on average, beer buyers are willing to pay $0.70/six‐pack for beer produced using water and wastewater reduction technologies, $0.85 for carbon reduction practices, and $0.98 for landfill diversion practices, though water sustainability practices appeal to a largest share of beer buyers. We also find that preferences for sustainability attributes are widely distributed among beer drinkers, largely irrespective of sociodemographic characteristics. The positive price premiums across sustainability attributes suggest beer buyers value sustainable brewing, and brewers could attract new consumers by simultaneously communicating their commitment to sustainability and differentiating their product [EconLit Citations: D12, L66, M31].",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the main barriers to adopting smallholder agricultural mechanization in developing countries is the mismatch between the economies of scale of machines and farm size. Private sector‐led mechanization services hold a promise to address this challenge, but there is a lack of evidence on demand for smallholder mechanization services. This study estimates the farmers' willingness to pay for mechanization services using the double‐bounded contingent valuation method and data from 1512 households. Results show that, on average, farmers are willing to pay 11%, 33%, and 5% more than prevailing market rates for land preparation, maize shelling, and transportation services, respectively. The amounts farmers are willing to pay for the mechanization services vary by sex, age group, size of cultivated land, the value of farmer assets, market access, and agroecology. Men are willing to pay 26%, 25%, and 11% more than women for land preparation, maize shelling, and transportation services. Moreover, 40% of female and 90% of male farmers are willing to pay more than or equal to the prevailing market rate for land preparation services. The high demand for mechanization services among smallholder farmers points to the need for making the machinery available to rural communities through mechanization service providers or machinery hiring centers run by the private sector. The paper concludes by discussing the contextual factors and policy options for promoting smallholder mechanization in Malawi. [EconLit Citations: O33, Q11, Q13, Q16].",

For this purpose, a theoretical model is elaborated based on the literature review carried out, which is contrasted following a quantitative approach by means of structural equation modeling (PLS‐SEM) with primary data collected from 202 Spanish wineries between September 2021 and January 2022. The research results show that there is a positive and significant relationship between OA and sustainable performance. Likewise, OA partially mediates the CSR‐sustainable performance and KMI‐sustainable performance relationship. Thus, the present research contributes to the literature in several ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies that have analyzed the effect of OA on sustainable performance in the wine context, which represents an opportunity to advance scientific knowledge. Second, to our knowledge, there is no previous scientific production that has analyzed what may be the triggers of OA. Third, the proposed theoretical model has not been addressed previously, so that, through the research, a new way of understanding the improvement in the economic, social and environmental performance of wineries is formulated [EconLit Citations: L66, 03, M1].",

    "abstract": "Abstract We examine the relationship between demand for plant‐based milk alternatives and dairy milk using data from a survey and a discrete choice experiment completed by 902 Canadians. Our survey results show that most individuals who drink milk alternatives also consume dairy milk, and preferences for milk alternatives vary across consumption contexts. Using our experimental data, we estimate consumer preferences via a mixed logit model. These preferences are then used to calculate a set of price elasticities and to predict market shares for dairy milk in counterfactual simulations that exclude select milk alternatives. Although the elasticity of dairy milk with respect to the price of milk alternatives is relatively low, we predict that between 57% and 83% of respondents who purchase milk alternatives would have purchased dairy milk if milk alternatives were not available, depending on the counterfactual. We also show that preferences for milk alternatives are linked to age and food values. Finally, we use our experiment to test the impact of additional information about the impact of dairy milk on animal welfare, the environment, and nutrition on preferences for milk alternatives. The treatment effects are generally statistically insignificant. [EconLit Citations: L66, Q18, D12]",

    "abstract": "Abstract E‐commerce is gaining importance in the food sector of many countries, and its potential influence on people's access to food and dietary choices is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we analyze data from a food consumption survey conducted in rural China in 2021 to examine the impact of e‐commerce on individual food consumption patterns and dietary quality. Our results with instrumental variable models show that e‐commerce significantly reduces the consumption of staple foods, such as cereals and potatoes, while it increases the consumption of legumes, nuts, milk, and milk products, even after controlling for income and other confounding factors. Additionally, e‐commerce contributes to higher dietary diversity and dietary quality among rural households. In the face of shrinking physical markets in rural areas, it seems that rural e‐commerce can serve as an important mechanism to improve food access and meet the diversifying dietary demands of rural residents.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT ESG (environmental, social, and governance) practices, an internationally recognized concept of a firm's sustainability, can serve as a bridge to enhance effective communication between firms and various stakeholders. It is also a new tool for measuring firms' value. This study employs a balanced panel data set of 114 publicly traded agricultural and food firms in China from 2016 to 2022. It empirically investigates the relationship between ESG and financial performance based on shareholder primacy theory and stakeholder theory. Employing a two‐way fixed effects (FE) model, our findings reveal a U‐shaped nonlinear pattern in how ESG impacts financial performance. It differs from previous studies that found predominantly positive relationships: Specifically, the average ESG score for firms is 0.396, the median is 0.390, and the inflection point of the U‐shape occurs at 0.53. When firms' ESG investments are less than 0.53, the high initial ESG cost makes it difficult to transform ESG into financial improvement. However, once this threshold is surpassed, good ESG can convey an excellent reputation to the public and increase anti‐risk ability—which, in turn, significantly improves firms' financial performance and facilitates long‐term development. Also, our study demonstrates that firms' ownership and different positions in the supply chain differentially affect the relationship between ESG and financial performance. This paper also offers insights into promoting the sustainable development of Chinese agri‐food firms.",

Given the importance of the Chinese beef market to domestic beef producers as well as foreign beef exporters, we evaluated the factors associated with how often Chinese consumers purchase beef. Using a 2021 survey of 560 beef consumers in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, we found that nearly 50% purchased beef at least two to three times a week. Results of an ordered probit regression suggest that respondents who purchase steak, flank, shank, and brisket are more likely to purchase beef more frequently than those who do not purchase those cuts of beef. Similarly, those who purchase beef more from wet markets and supermarkets, younger shoppers, and those with higher incomes were more likely to purchase beef more frequently. Respondents who considered country of origin and hormone‐free production to be important factors purchased beef more frequently. Consumers who thought price and premium quality grades were more important purchased beef less frequently. These findings provide insights for domestic and foreign beef producers regarding the factors associated with consumer preferences and their frequency of beef purchasing in China.

We employ a novel digital advertisement dataset from Nielsen Ad Intel to investigate the market entry and advertising patterns of the Impossible Burger, one of the leading brands in the plant‐based meat market. By merging weekly ad views at the DMA market level with Nielsen Homescan Panel, we find that prior purchases of meat burgers reduce the likelihood of consumers buying the new plant‐based burger, whereas past vegan burger purchases elevate this probability. While advertising did boost the average purchasing likelihood for the Impossible Burger, the enhancement in purchase probability for meat burger consumers is approximately one fifth of that observed for vegan burger consumers.

Few studies, however, have used empirical methods to examine the social impact of urban–rural integration. Against the Chinese background, this study adopts an empirical method to analyze the impact of urban–rural integration on rural poverty reduction at the micro level. The study finds that urban–rural integration can reduce rural households' absolute poverty and relative income poverty. The main channel is the access of rural households to medical services. However, there is regional heterogeneity and household heterogeneity. Urban–rural integration cannot reduce rural household poverty for the western regions with backward economies. Household heads' age, health and job will impact the effect of urban–rural integration on reducing rural household poverty. Urban–rural integration and poverty alleviation development work should pay more attention to access to resources and services and adopt differentiated policies for different regions.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) serves as a critical platform for promoting mutually beneficial agricultural cooperation. Utilizing panel data from 151 countries spanning the years 2001–2020, this research empirically investigates the policy effects of the BRI on the agricultural trade status of these countries from a trade network perspective. The findings indicate that the initiative significantly boosts the trade network status of BRI countries, with marked advantages observed for countries along the “One Road,” economic corridor countries, and developing countries within the BRI framework. Further mechanistic analyses suggest that the success of the BRI can be attributed to improvements in the “five‐pronged approach,” which includes enhancing facilities connectivity, promoting unimpeded trade, fostering financial integration, facilitating policy communication and strengthening people‐to‐people bond. These results highlight the reciprocal and beneficial nature of the BRI in the context of agricultural trade, providing valuable insights for improving the quality of agricultural trade under the BRI and advancing the contribution of agricultural trade to building a community of shared interests.",

Using an output distance function and its duality with the revenue function, we estimated the technical efficiency of sugarcane production in Brazilian municipalities and the shadow price of reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from the production of this crop. The main result was an overall technical efficiency average of 81%, which indicates that if producers adopt better management practices, the sugarcane production could be expanded by 19% with a contraction by the same magnitude in CO 2 emissions. We also estimated a mean shadow price of R$9.18 per ton of carbon dioxide, with the highest estimated values in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Mato Grosso, and Bahia. However, in the state of São Paulo, the most representative national producer, the estimated shadow price is R$6.34 per ton of carbon dioxide. In this sense, public policies, especially through public financing and public technical assistance, could potentially mitigate the producers' losses in the short run since pollution decline usually requires more mechanization.",

We analyzed 72,067 US tweets discussing food and COVID‐19 from January 20, 2020 to March 20, 2021. The analysis examines tweets mentioning together the topics “food” and “COVID‐19” to grasp the sentiments of users regarding food amidst this health crisis. Using sentiment analysis and multilevel modeling, our results show that users with a high number of followings tend to express fewer positive sentiments, whereas the opposite is the case for users with a high number of followers. We found that a worsening of the epidemic conditions increased the propensity to express fewer positive sentiments and that the relationship of community healthy habits with pandemic‐driven food sentiments is contingent on these conditions. At low levels of COVID‐19 cases, users in healthy‐eating communities tend to express positive sentiments, but at high levels, they express more negative sentiments. Regarding community exercise habits, people in these contexts often express fewer positive sentiments. However, as the pandemic worsened, individuals in these communities tended to express more positive sentiments.

Over the 15 year period 2007–22, nearly US$10 billion flowed into 547 startups via more than 1100 business deals. The real annualized growth rate of 52% in such investment has gone largely unnoticed. The South American agrifood‐tech ecosystem is heavily concentrated in Brazil and Argentina, which together account for 75% of the population of startups. Likewise, the ten largest deals over this period account for 48 percent of all investments; the median investment in South American agrifood tech is modest, roughly US$100,000. Pre‐farm gate technologies captured over 42% of the deal flow but only 15% of the total capital invested. By contrast, investments at the consumer‐facing end of the agrifood value chain, into on‐demand delivery startups, represent 51% of all investments in the region but only 8% of the deal flow. Just 46% of firms raised two or more funding rounds over the 15‐year period. Multivariate regression models show that country‐year‐level macroeconomic, financial and agricultural indicators fail to explain much variation in private capital investments in South American agrifood tech. Drawing on key informant interviews, we identify some of the main barriers to and accelerators of adoption and uptake at scale of agrifood technologies in South America.",

The investigation utilizes data on grain trade between China and these nations, along with corresponding data on carbon emissions from grain production. The results reveal that China's grain trade contributes, to a certain extent, to the reduction of carbon emissions from grain production in partner countries. This conclusion withstands various robustness tests conducted. Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the impact of grain trade in driving the reduction of carbon emissions from grain production is more notable in developing countries. Moreover, soybean trade emerges as particularly advantageous in promoting carbon emission reduction from grain production in these trading partner countries. Mechanism tests conducted to explore further aspects indicate that the establishment of free trade areas (FTAs) plays a crucial moderating role in China's grain trade, fostering carbon emission reduction. This is deemed beneficial for advancing efforts in reducing carbon emissions from grain production. The increased use of fertilizers has intensified carbon emissions in the grain production and distribution process. The findings not only offer fresh insights into understanding China's role in global grain trade and its impact on carbon emissions from global grain production but also provide strategic considerations for global grain security governance, international collaboration addressing climate change, and avenues for accessing green dividends.",

Remoteness is defined using two variables: geographical remoteness (location in mountain areas) and remoteness from the urban poles providing public services (inner areas). Results show that farmers in remote areas are more likely to diversify crop production, but the overall magnitude of this difference is small. With regard to the inseparable non‐agricultural secondary activities, the core‐periphery differences are significant only in mountain areas. Inseparable non‐agricultural secondary activities are uncorrelated to commodity prices and produce larger value‐added and should be encouraged across marginal areas.",

The analysis employs negative binomial and hurdle regression models. Results, interpreted through Stakeholder Theory, Global Value Chain Theory, and Resource Dependence Theory, highlight that firm size, value chain position, consumer engagement, and risk identification are key factors influencing sustainability practices. Larger, consumer‐facing firms tend to adopt in‐house practices, while smaller firms and publicly listed companies prefer certifications for market differentiation. Traders and grinders, as midstream actors, play a crucial role in driving sustainability efforts, particularly through sourcing practices. Firms with high consumer engagement and risk awareness are more likely to adopt a broader range of sustainability initiatives. These findings offer practical insights for managers and policymakers, helping firms align their strategies with industry standards or tailor them to specific needs. The study also underscores the need for policy interventions to promote sustainability adoption, particularly among SMEs, contributing to the broader literature on corporate sustainability and value chains.",

However, the relationship between global climate risk and firm performance turns positive for exporting agricultural firms, confirming learning‐by‐exporting hypothesis. On the contrary, the relationship between Vietnam's increased temperature and agricultural firm profitability is negative for exporting firms due to the growing difficulties in maintaining diversified export strategies for exporting firms. Finally, our findings reveal that exporting agricultural firms still gain benefits under both global and national climate risks, especially for small and medium‐sized firms in Vietnam. Our study provides insights into the potential of export activities to mitigate the effects of climate variability on agricultural sector in Vietnam and other agricultural nations.",

This study investigates the dynamic connectedness in global biofuels, China's grain and vegetable oil markets using a time‐varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP‐VAR). Moreover, based on this dynamic connectedness, we calculate dynamic hedge ratios and the optimal dynamic biofuel portfolio using the minimum variance portfolio, the minimum correlation portfolio, and the minimum connectedness portfolio. The results reveal three key findings: First, the increased total connectedness index (TCI) in global biofuels, China's grain and vegetable oil markets suggests that global biofuel expansion has heightened the vulnerability of China's grain and vegetable oil markets in the post‐pandemic era. Second, biofuels and soybean oil are net spillover transmitters, but corn, soybeans, palm oil, and rapeseed oil serve as net spillover receivers. Third, the cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and hedging effectiveness show that the minimum variance portfolio achieves the optimal portfolio through biofuel feedstock futures in the absence of biofuel futures contracts. These findings offer critical insights for energy transition strategy, biofuel expansion in developing and emerging economies, and risk management in the postbiofuel policy era.",

The research is motivated by the increased popularity of EVA in corporate finance and by the claims that high EVA causes incremental gains in share price values. Using1996 annual reports to compute EVA, and daily stock prices for 1994 through 1998, we attempt to correlate EVA with a variety of measures including accounting return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), share price, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) returns and risk, and others. Results find little support for the conjecture that high-EVA firms lead to higher shareholder value, however, because the management logic that has popularized EVA is so logical and fundamental to common practices in corporate finance that we resist dismissing EVA as a valued paradigm. Rather, we suggest that market volatility and other factors mask the short-run increments to shareholder wealth from EVA-implemented strategies.

Empirical results reveal that price increases due to oligopoly power outweighed those caused by the NEDC by nearly seven times. In fact, markups are estimated at approximately 25% of the retail milk price, translating into approximately a little less than $0.75/gallon. We also estimated that only around two-thirds of the raw milk price changes were passed forward to consumers. This helps explain why consumer prices have come down only little after elimination of the NEDC. In fact, the new milk income-loss contract program, which basically provides partial price subsidies to farmers, has contributed to low raw milk prices that have generated substantial benefits to milk processors and retailers, modest benefits to farmers and consumers, all at the expense of taxpayers.

Trends in Malaysian food consumption are typical of those of developing countries. The overriding objective of this article, therefore, was to explore the structural changes in food consumption expenditure in West Malaysia after the early 1970s when its food consumption diversified under rapid economic growth and urbanization. We have estimated Engel's expenditure elasticities for food items using aggregated cross‐sectional data from the Household Expenditure Survey. Our estimated results clearly indicate that while the expenditure elasticities of away‐from‐home food, and the elasticities of at‐home expenditures for meat, fruits and vegetables, milk and dairy products are relatively high, those of rice and sugar are low. This suggests that the food expenditure structure in West Malaysia has diversified, adding meat, fruits and vegetables, milk and dairy products to the most dominant food item, rice. Moreover, it is likely that the share of food away from home will increase with income enhancement and urbanization due mainly to economic growth.

Correlations of retail price changes indicate considerable pricing independence among retailers across cities, while rankings of retail prices by milk product provide significant evidence that prices are not based primarily on costs, as would be true if pricing were competitive. Estimated retail price responses to farm price changes are consistent with monopoly pricing behavior for several of the milk products in several of the markets.

Retail prices respond rapidly to farm price increases, but slowly to farm price decreases. This study also finds evidence of long-run asymmetry.

Results show that WASDE reports lead to a statistically significant reduction of implied volatility that averages 0.7 percentage points for corn and 0.8 percentage points for soybeans. The magnitude of the reduction is largest for the group of WASDE reports containing both domestic and international situation and outlook information. This group of reports reduces implied volatility by an average of 1.1 percentage points in corn and by almost 1.5 percentage points in soybeans. Results also reveal that the market impact of WASDE reports is strongest in the most recent 1996 to 2002 subperiod. Overall, the results indicate that WASDE reports provide valuable information to corn and soybean market participants. [JEL classifications: Q100, Q110, Q130]. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The analysis draws on data from a consumer survey conducted at several grocery stores in Alabama in 2003. The results revealed a diversified set of preferences toward GM tomatoes. Logit results suggest that attitude toward the use of genetic modification technology in food production, opinion about labeling, and consumer perceptions about the safety of GM foods strongly influence consumers' decisions. The utility advantage of purchasing non‐GM tomatoes corresponds to an average premium of $0.39 per pound, implying that consumers would be willing to purchase non‐GM tomatoes at a price $0.39 higher than the price of GM tomatoes.

Milk characteristics include price, fat content, brand name, and the organic and/or lactose‐free nature of the product. Empirical results show that consumer valuation of fat decreases with income, but increases with the number of children. Low‐fat and specialty milks, such as organic and lactose‐free milks, are preferred by high‐income consumers with no children. Although all milks are price elastic at the individual brand level, the cross‐price elasticities are quite low and negligible for specialty milks. Based on calculated Lerner indexes, private label milks have the highest percent markups despite their lower prices, whereas specialty milks have the lowest markups despite their higher prices, which attests to a greater degree of market power for conventional and particularly for private label milk.

Because of limited production, pricing, promotions, and consumer‐related variables are essential to explain olive oil consumer behavior. As a consequence of this increasing consumption, it is fundamental to analyze the main factors influencing consumers' olive oil choices for both brands and retailers to be able to compete more efficiently and satisfy consumer needs more closely. But, few such studies are concerned with olive oil (although a great many works in the literature analyze the influence of these factors in other product categories). In a sociocultural context like the Spanish market, in which brand awareness is strong and the use of the product is very high, these factors are even more important. Thus, the main objective of this article is to determine and assess how different marketing variables, such as price, price discounts, use of store flyers and loyalty, explain olive oil brand choice.

    "abstract": "Abstract This article argues that collaboration has been a key piston in the engine that is driving economic growth in the new millennium. Innovation in information technology, institutions, and strategic reorientation of technological change has opened opportunity, and competition has put strong imperatives in play for collaborative innovation. First, these imperatives have forced a reorientation of private enterprise from push to pull systems. Second, they have catalyzed a strategic unbundling of integrated firms to create specialized enterprises with enhanced productivity and flexibility, though with increased demand for virtual integration through less formal relationships to establish and manage collaboration. This article presents the hypothesis that these changes induced a fundamentally new dynamic in innovation processes that we label as collaborative pull innovation. This new form of innovation encompasses and directs product, process, and organizational innovation toward fulfilling consumer demand. To examine this hypothesis, the nature of private‐sector innovation is assessed within the context of the food sector. This sector is of special interest due to important roles played by small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As worldwide consumer demand for high‐quality products and for information about these products increases, labels and geographical indications (GIs) can serve to signal quality traits to consumers; however, GI systems among countries are not homogeneous and can be used as trade barriers against competition. Philosophical differences between the European Union (EU) and the United States about how GIs should be registered and protected led to the formation of a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute‐settlement panel. In this article, we discuss the issues behind the dispute, the WTO panel decision, and the EU response to the panel decision leading to the new Regulation 510/2006. Given the potential for GI labels to supply consumer information, context is provided for the discussion using recent literature on product labeling. Implications are drawn regarding the importance of the panel decision and the EU response relative to GI issues yet to be negotiated under the Doha Round.

French wine companies are small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs), so the task is (a) to measure their intangible expenses and capital, and (b) to estimate their impact on companies' performances. The authors then analyze the effect of property structures (cooperatives and corporations) and business activities on the intensity of the relationship between intangibility and performance. Relationships between intangibles and performance were tested empirically by means of a questionnaire carried out in 2005–2006. Questionnaire data were completed using financial statements for 207 companies whose activity included one or more stages in the production and marketing of wine. Using MANOVA and the production function approach, the authors found evidence that intangible proxies had a negative impact on the firms' economic performance measurements and a positive impact on commercial performance for intermediate values of intangible ratios. They also found that production functions were very different with regard to legal status and business activity, but that the negative impact of intangible proxies remained. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Traceability can be used as a tool to gather information about and manage food safety risks associated with these types of products. The authors investigate the choice of voluntary traceability in three‐tiered multi‐ingredient food supply chains. They propose a framework based on vertical control and agency theory to model three dimensions of traceability systems: depth, breadth, and precision. Their analysis has three main results. First, full traceability is feasible as long as there are net benefits to a downstream firm that demands traceability across all ingredients. Second, horizontal network externalities are positive because an increase in the level of traceability in one ingredient requires a similar increase in others. Finally, vertical network effects will be positive insofar as willingness to pay and probabilities of food safety hazards increase.

The finding that generalized trust (measured by trust in strangers and past trusting behavior) also affects consumers' choices of GM food, suggests that some concerns about GM‐derived food are related to an individual's worldview and may be beyond the control of the food system.",

Although there has been some theoretical discussion about this issue, no empirical research has been done on these costs; the present study aims to bridge this gap. Following the literature, the main source of democratic costs in agricultural cooperatives is the level of member participation in cooperative governance. We have developed more specific theoretical insights about this special kind of decision‐making cost by showing the effect of differences in the level of member participation on democratic costs, differences in terms of democratic and influence costs and in terms of agency costs, and differences between both direct and opportunity democratic costs. Members should take both the relative direct and opportunity costs within total democratic costs into account when determining the optimal size and composition of their board.

Market analysis and marketing strategy planning capabilities are positively related to the price‐making ability of a firm, while firm size is not. Supply chain relationships play a crucial role in price‐making due to the strong constraint presented by the presence of vertical competition between food SMEs and supermarkets. (L25, L66, M31)",

For that purpose, a random utility model is applied to elicit the WTP for the most important rice purchase criteria. The model is estimated using a survey of consumers from 15 prefectures in Togo. The results show that imported rice is largely preferred to local rice, especially in urban areas. Cleanness and whiteness appear to be the most preferred attributes, especially for imported rice. Togolese consumers are willing to pay a premium of up to 46% of the actual price for cleanness and 53% for whiteness in locally produced rice. Also, taste and swelling capacity play an important role in the preference for locally produced rice. The results might be useful for breeders and policy makers in the ongoing effort to improve the competitiveness of local rice in West Africa both from quality and price perspectives.",

This article, therefore, aims to determine the sources of firm profitability variation for EU food processors using the classical approaches of hierarchical ANOVA and COV.

However, fostering acceptance of new stipulations (e.g., volume control, pricing systems) requires that the attitudes of farmers be taken into consideration. Thus, in this article, the authors analyze how dairy farmers’ attitudes vary towards both contracting in general and specific contract attributes. Using a survey of 161 dairy farm managers, the research question is addressed by means of a latent class cluster analysis. Three clusters are identified. Their attitudes are heterogeneous, ranging from suppliers who are clearly convinced of the value of contractual relationships to farmers who reject contracts explicitly. Results may be utilized to match the preferences of farmers regarding contracts with modified dairy marketing contracts. [EconLit Classification: Q130].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Because of inherent constraints, few farmer cooperatives use branding to pursue differentiation and competitiveness in the agri‐food industry. Considering the complete lack of applied research on the brand–performance relationship for farmer cooperatives, it is unknown if branding is even profitable. This paper addresses the gap in our understanding with a novel panel study of 707 US marketing cooperatives for the 2005–2011 period. Informed by lagged observations of trademark and service mark data, the empirical analysis indicates a positive relationship of brand equity to the financial performance of marketing cooperatives. Specifically, 1% increases in the total stock of trademarks and service marks have a positive impact of $130,441 and $141,921, respectively, on the net sales of the mean marketing cooperative. The corresponding impact on net income is estimated at $3,815 and $17,286, respectively. Following the estimation of further specifications, there is also indication most of the impact is facilitated by older trademarks (&gt;3 years) in the stock, which implies a delayed impact of brand equity on financial performance. Overall, the reported evidence serves as motivation to directors and managers of marketing cooperatives to pursue opportunities to build brand equity. To do so, however, may first require a solution to the equity constraint which appears at the foundation of most farmer cooperatives.",

Consumers with strong individualistic domains of hedonism and stimulation are more likely to have a higher demand for organic, the same holds for consumers with the strong collectivist domain conformity, and those values that regard both (security and universalism). Also, consumers distinguish between conventional and organic tomatoes, such that personality has a differential impact with regard to predicting demand for organic products. The more agreeable the consumer, the higher the demand for organic tomatoes. In addition, results indicate that when modeled simultaneously, values are more stable in affecting demand compared to effects resulting from personality.

The unique features of the dataset allow us to study the price formation in the different market segments. The analysis shows that in the large‐scale retail trade consumers value most what is written on the label, but only if it is a verifiable characteristic; label characteristics are also important in wine shops, but a selection process exists to enter this market. Finally, selling wine via both channels appears to be a winning strategy: it allows the price to be increased in the large‐scale retail trade, but it does not reduce the price in wine shops.",

Results from both a random parameter logit and a latent class models show that consumers have heterogeneous preferences for chicken meat attributes. Specifically, findings indicate that consumers prefer domestic to imported chicken and are willing to pay a premium for domestic chicken. In addition, antibiotic/hormone‐free, fresh, and cuts are preferred with antibiotic/hormone‐free having a larger impact on choices. Furthermore, consumers’ preferences differ across segments and are largely based on their attitudes towards food. [EconLit citations : C25, D12, Q13].",

This study evaluates how information about organic status affects consumers’ willingness to pay and sensory liking for beer. Consumer sensory panels were conducted for the purpose of this study with information treatments and valuation questions. In our sample, informing consumers that beer is organic or certified organic does not significantly affect sensory liking scores, and certified organic has a negative marginal effect on willingness to pay, providing evidence that organic is not a vertical quality attribute for beer. However, panelists who regularly purchase craft beer, care about the environment, and/or have an openness to new foods have a higher willingness to pay for organic beer. Our findings suggest that organic beer appeals to a niche market of consumers. [EconLit citations: L15, L66, Q13]",

Following the results of our Cox proportional hazard regressions, we find (a) relatively young and old farmer cooperatives are more susceptible to exit; (b) the relationship of membership size to the survival rate of farmer cooperatives is U‐shaped; (c) farmer cooperatives with intangible asset portfolios have lower survival probabilities; and (d) the survival function of farmer cooperatives is not explained significantly by efficiency, leverage, or liquidity. Overall, we use our findings to inform recommendations in terms of cooperative firm behavior, in particular in relation to member heterogeneity and strategic orientation.",

We administer an experimental survey of US food consumers ( n = 2325) with five treatments. The surveys include contingent valuation exercises to assess consumer WTP for six products in active packaging relative to conventional packaging. We find that consumer acceptance of this technology is dependent on the product packaged and related directly to the specific relative benefit. In addition, consumer WTP is impacted by the framing of the technology in relation to other available technologies, information about the developer of the technology, and the degree of specificity of information regarding benefits. Notably, impacts of framing and use cases are primarily apparent among those who are resistant to the technology. A cluster analysis finds that those more likely to resist the technology include households that are lower income, less educated, and more likely to be white [EconLit citations: Q18, M31, D12, D83].",

This paper studies consumer demand for organic and conventional milk, using weekly scanner data from the Swedish retail market for the years 2011–2017. Own‐ and cross‐price elasticities of demand are estimated using a quadratic almost ideal demand system. While previous studies on this topic show that demand for organic milk is commonly more price elastic than for its conventional alternative, this paper complements previous literature by (i) studying a market with relatively small organic price premiums, (ii) using a highly representative sample of retailers, and (iii) differentiating between private labels and brands. Results show that demand for organic milk is relatively elastic, despite relatively small organic price premiums in the Swedish milk market. Results also show that demand for branded products is, generally, less elastic compared to private label products, suggesting that consumers have strong preferences for traditional, regional brands.

The impact of COVID-19 has been especially devastating for low-income families in rural areas of India. Soon after the nationwide lockdown was announced, food insecurity became pervasive in rural areas, as many families relied on daily wage work to fund necessities. By providing cash transfers and additional foodgrains, Indian policymakers acted swiftly to reduce the financial impact on family income and consumption. This paper investigates the factors affecting rural families' participation in the cash transfer program and the effect of government cash transfers on food insecurity. Results indicate that India's government cash transfer program decreased moderate food insecurity by 2.4% and severe food insecurity by about 0.92% [EconLit Citations: O12, I31, I32, I38].",

    "abstract": "Abstract The COVID‐19 crisis has severely impacted the wine industry, with producers in different countries affected differently and, therefore, differing in their perceptions toward it. These differing perceptions are assumed to be due to different business models, mainly linked to the distribution system adopted and resulting in varying distances of producers to distributors and consumers. While upstream integration characterizes the Old World, the New World applies a downstream business model, being more closely linked to distributors and consumers and, therefore, more vulnerable to shocks, which should lead to higher perceived impacts of the COVID‐19 crisis. This study analyzes 542 surveys collected from wineries in nine countries, divided into New World, historical Old World, and emerging Old World. Econometric results show statistically significant differences in both the perceived impact of COVID‐19 and wineries' responses in terms of planned investments, with the New World being more affected. A common desire by wineries to direct future investments towards direct‐to‐consumer sales and communication was found, to the detriment of investments in vineyards and cellars. This desire is particularly strong in the New World, in line with their focus on the downstream part of the value chain, underlying their greater reactivity to shocks and capacity to innovate.

A panel dataset of the census of farmer cooperatives in China from 2014 to 2019 is used for the empirical analyses. First, the Pareto indices of farmer cooperatives' size distribution are calculated, and the results feature the dominance of small cooperatives and the underdevelopment of large cooperatives. Second, membership size has a positive effect on the total profit of cooperatives. Third, the impact of membership size on the profit per member displays an inverted “U” pattern, and the optimal membership size is 19 members. These effects are heterogeneous across product categories and cooperative ages. The robustness of the results is confirmed by alternative key explanatory indicators and estimation methods.

From the perspective of the interest linkage across the entire agricultural industry chain, the potential entrepreneurial effects of agricultural outsourcing have rarely been discussed. The study innovatively treats a Chinese policy as a quasi‐natural experiment, uses cutting‐edge econometric methods to make rigorous causal inferences, and addresses the difficulty of quantifying agricultural outsourcing. We find that agricultural outsourcing significantly increases rural entrepreneurship activity, with an increase of 9.1% of the rural population working for rural private enterprises and rural self‐employed businesses. From the perspective of heterogeneity, the entrepreneurial effect of agricultural outsourcing is more impressive in nonmajor grain‐producing areas. In addition, agricultural outsourcing mainly promotes opportunistic entrepreneurship. Influencing mechanisms include industrial chain extension, off‐farm employment and credit access. Accordingly, we suggest that policymakers take agricultural outsourcing as a starting point to promote rural innovation and entrepreneurship to complete industrial upgrading and transformation.

For example, the Direct Trade label, which highlights a direct relationship between roasters and farmers, has gained popularity to strengthen the industry's efforts to make coffee production more sustainable. This leads to the question of whether consumers prefer coffee carrying this label. Hence, this research analyzes consumer preferences and willingness to pay for coffee labels representing sustainability efforts, such as the Direct Trade label. We informed participants about the efforts reflected by each sustainability label and utilized a hypothetical online choice experiment to determine US consumers' preferences and willingness to pay for coffee sustainability labels. The highest willingness to pay was found for coffee carrying both the Fair Trade and Organic labels, and the Direct Trade and Organic labels. The key findings of this study demonstrate that consumers are willing to pay more for sustainability labels that communicate efforts on solving social issues, followed by labels that highlight environmental issues.

This paper extends previous work on single-product retailer competition to a multiproduct setting. Specifically, we derive equilibrium pricing strategies for perishable and nonperishable goods. We find the intuition used to explain pricing dynamics for nonperishable items in single-product models generalizes to the multiproduct setting. Moreover, because goods are substitute means of attracting customers within the multiproduct setting, price changes for the nonperishable good will affect the perishable good price. In addition, the multiproduct setting generates a rich set of implications, some of which we empirically examine. For example, we find that, consistent with the theory, perishable and nonperishable price changes are negatively correlated. This and other evidence suggests that pricing dynamics are related in predictable ways to product characteristics, such as consumers' storage costs.

Through in-depth interviews with CEOs from 21 northeastern US cooperatives, it was determined that: the taxonomy of theoretical strategies matched will with actual strategies, cooperatives use a mix of returns and risk-management strategies, actual strategic motivations are sometimes at odds with those suggested by theory, and cooperative information systems appear inadequate to support strategic decision making. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Almost 36% of respondent firms were ISO 9000 certified. The desire to improve customer service, a basis for quality improvement, and the need to improve operational efficiency (reduce wastage) were the most important factors influencing certification. Respondents reported financial, managerial, and production benefits following certification. Two-group and three-group discriminant analyses were performed. Results revealed that ISO 9000 certified firms tended to be larger, established firms with parent company affiliation, manufacturing products derived from agricultural output and exporting to developed countries. Most non-ISO 9000 certified firms had adopted an alternative quality assurance system.

The data are much more useful for studying output markets and fail to provide much guidance regarding oligopsony issues, which are perceived to be widespread in food processing. In output markets, evidence suggests that a market's use of media advertising contributed to advanced market concentration prior to 1977, but subsequently concentration has been rising in all industries. Producer good industries have posted the largest increases in concentration as they narrowed the difference in average concentration between themselves and the group of advertising-intensive industries.

Decision makers are contemplating whether it is necessary to register to one or more of the ISO and other international standards and, if so, which ones. Furthermore, an organization that has registered separate departments to different standards and contemplates integrating such standards across the different units may be interested in attributes of particular units that will facilitate integration. Discriminant analysis was conducted to characterize the factors that distinguish between organizations that adopted ISO 14001 alone (single standard), versus those that registered to ISO 14001 along with other quality, health, and safety standards (i.e., multiple standards). The most important factor that motivated adoption to ISO 14001 was to establish a positive environmental profile, thereby promoting goodwill and integrity. Internal factors tended to dominate the motivations for adopting ISO 14001, supporting the hypothesis that external benefits may not be fully realized due to market and policy failure. Internal costs associated with registration depended on the size of the organization and ranged, on average, from CND$17,000 (for organizations with less than 100 employees), to CND$42,000 (for organizations with more than 500 employees). External costs depended more on the type (i.e., sector of the Canadian economy) than on size of the organization. The most important variable that distinguished between Canadian organizations that adopted ISO 14001 alone versus those that adopted ISO 14001 and other standards was whether the organization had an international orientation, that is, those with more than 50% of services or exports to other countries.

A research project in Northern Germany reveals the following results: consumers' stated preferences show clearly potential demand for regional food, in particular if environment‐friendly produced and controlled. The main influencing factors that could be identified by means of a rank‐ordered logit analysis are consumers' regional, nutrition, and environment consciousness as well as a low price sensitivity and mistrust in conventional food from somewhere else. Also some retailers indicated interest in regional marketing concepts, but rarely in environment‐friendly produced food: listing of regional specialities and a seasonal offer as well as a farmer's market outlet in a shopping center. Further, farmers showed general interest in regional marketing, but not combined with environment‐friendly production. Overall, one can conclude of these results, that the limiting factor for regional marketing seems to be more the supply than the demand side.

While some studies found a positive relationship between exchange rate volatility and trade, others argue for the opposite. Furthermore, the vast majority of past studies only focused on aggregate trade flow data. The lack of extensive literature on studies based on disaggregated and commodity-level data may partially explain the ambiguity in past empirical evidence. This paper re-examines the relationship between exchange rate volatility and U.S. poultry exports using a panel data for 49 importing nations over two subperiods: 1976–1985 and 1986–2000. The analysis uses a fixed-effects model specification and three alternative measures of exchange rate volatility. The empirical results suggest that the choice of volatility measure matters as there is a positive relationship between exchange rate uncertainty and poultry exports. These findings are consistent with those from several previous studies. [JEL classification: F310, Q170]. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Agribusiness 22: 233–245, 2006.",

Then, a heteroscedastic logit model is developed to relate the varying number of alternatives and choice sets to changes in the error term by parameterizing the scale factor of the heteroscedastic logit model. The authors study the effects of two simultaneous forms of complexity on the consistency of respondents' choices, i.e., the number of choice sets per questionnaire and the number of options per choice set. Their findings suggest that respondents' choices do vary with the amount of information given resulting in an optimal five options and six choice sets per survey. Results from the marginal effects and willingness to pay (WTP) estimates indicate that varying the number of alternatives and choice sets can also affect consumers' marginal WTP estimates.

The application of the discrete choice experimental technique on a sample of 140 parents with at least one 5- to 14-year-old child was selected as the most suitable methodological pproach. The sample purposively comprised two subsamples of 70 parents each, based on their real awareness of the term ‘‘functional’’ and of the health benefits of specific functionality types. Parents generally perceived functionality as a product attribute that contributes positively to the image enhancement of the (unhealthy) target product and affirmed that they are willing to pay reasonable premiums for it. However, the level of consumers’ prior awareness of functionality played a decisive role in their preference for functional products. The type of food that ‘‘carries’’ functionality was also more important when consumers had no knowledge of functionality. Overall, prior and accurate awareness was found to increase the variety of functionality types and preferred carriers, the strength of preference per functionality type, and the price premiums willingly paid.",

The results show that, in the category analyzed, high prices deter the market success of some functional alternatives; this does not apply to drinkable ones, whose demand shows lower own‐price and larger cross‐price elasticities compared to the other functional alternatives. In addition, health‐related consumer characteristics play an important role in shaping the demand for both conventional and functional yogurts in Italy. In particular, an aging, increasingly health‐conscious population is likely to provide fertile ground for the success of functional yogurts in this market.",

Furthermore, this study is unique in determining the minimum level of transaction costs.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sri Lanka introduced farmer companies to link smallholders with high‐value markets. This study examines how the institutional, group, and management characteristics of these farmer companies affect their performance. Theories about causal relationships are tested using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. The results indicate that farmer companies perform better when shares are tradable between members, and patrons pay and receive market‐related prices for their inputs and products. All directors should be nominated by shareholders and voting should be conducted by secret ballot. To strengthen accountability, the right to hire and fire executive managers should vest with the board of directors and should not be appropriated by government agencies that facilitate these companies. Although directors and managers should monitor shareholder views, they must take policy and strategic decisions themselves as failure to centralize decision‐making results in severe influence problems. Farmer company performance is compromised by the absence of well‐defined and regularly observed processes to develop and implement strategies, and by inadequate or inappropriate management skills. These management problems may diminish if government facilitators had a clear exit plan from the time the company is established as this would help to focus their attention on the critical task of empowering farmer shareholders to direct and administer their company.

For example, we find that category‐level organic sales are associated with higher organic price premiums, whereas category‐level nonorganic sales are associated with lower premiums.

Small dairy producers have expressed concerns about the competitiveness of the dairy supply chain, arguing that price changes are not being transmitted efficiently from wholesalers to producer at the farm gate level. In this context, this study examines the degree of vertical price transmission between wholesalers and small dairy producers to assess the efficiency level of the dairy market chain in Panama. The findings of this research provide original and important contributions to the policy dialogue uncovering two key issues: 1) a unidirectional transmission of milk prices from producers to wholesaler, and 2) that the transmission of milk prices is asymmetric depending on whether prices are increasing or decreasing.

The results revealed that the marketing, network, and innovation capabilities directly and positively affect performance. SMEs benefit from selling their products in the national market. The network capability plays a dual role: It has a direct positive influence on performance as well as an indirect effect on the capability to acquire information about market and supply chain agents. The acquired market‐ and consumer‐related information is extremely valuable in enhancing the marketing capability and improving performance. The innovation capability is slightly less significant than the others in affecting performance.[EconLit citations: L11, L25, L66, Q13]",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Linking smallholder farmers to large enterprises could be a powerful mechanism to improve input and output markets as well as other productivity‐enhancing services for liquidity constrained smallholders. Dairy hubs promoted by East African Dairy Development project are collective farmer‐owned milk bulking and/or chilling plants through which farmers get access to output markets and inputs as well as other services necessary for their dairy enterprises. The hubs act as a linkage between large processors and smallholder dairy farmers. They enable farmers to supply milk to large dairy processors who are emerging key players in the East African dairy industry. In addition to the different forms of linkages with large processors, these hubs also differ in their level of growth toward sustainability. In light of this background, this work aims to provide evidence on the effects, at farm level, of different types of linkages between smallholder dairy farmers and large processors through dairy hubs. The study uses cross‐sectional survey data collected from 993 smallholder livestock keeping households living within the dairy hubs’ catchment areas in Kenya and Uganda. Statistical tests on technical efficiency estimates from dairy farm enterprises were conducted in order to provide evidence of the effects of the types of processor linkages on the performance of the dairy farm enterprises. The results provide evidence of no strong influence at farm levels that can be attributed to different forms of linkages with processor that dairy hubs adopt. Moreover, though hub sustainability is directly linked to the producer organization's efficiency level, our results show that it does not sufficiently translate to more productive farmers. These findings call for concerted efforts by development agents in the dairy sector, policy makers, and even large processors to intervene in order to support improved farm performance. As evident from the study, one direct policy tool at the disposal of these agents is extension messages. [EconLit citations D24; L25; Q12].",

Two price equations are deduced from simultaneous partial equilibria of the endogenous variables and are embedded in a VECM to account for a long‐run cointegration relationship. The model is estimated via the Kalman–Filter to allow for time variation in the long‐run parameters, and a dynamic factor model used to extract a common factor from the time‐variant coefficients. The results are then used to calculate the industry average input conjectural elasticities. The framework is applied to German dairy value chain data over the time period of January 2000 to March 2011. The results indicate almost perfect competition in the raw milk market and imperfect competition in the dairy output market, which is however far from monopsony.

In Spain, there is an ongoing debate about the importance of women in business management. Spain is also a pioneer in terms of enacting specific legislation for the social economy.

Using data from surveys of members of 60 cooperatives in Fujian province, China, this study shows that social capital is related to cooperative financing performance, interpreted as (1) members’ willingness to provide equity, (2) loans from members and from banks, and (3) cooperatives providing financing services to members. Three dimensions of social capital are identified; external, relational, and cognitive. The findings indicate that Chinese cooperatives obtain bank credit more easily if they have been granted government “honors” and if the chairperson has government contacts (external social capital). Loyal members (relational social capital) are more likely to obtain financial services, such as guarantees for member loans. Cooperatively convinced members (cognitive social capital) are more willing to provide capital. [EconLit citations: A13; P13; Q14].",

A best–worst choice experiment was employed to determine farmer perceptions of five general risk areas: production, marketing, financial, human, and legal risks. Results indicate, on average, farmers were more concerned with traditional farm business risks (production, financial, and marketing risks) relative to human and legal risks when managing their farm businesses. However, significant heterogeneity in perceptions of risk areas was observed. A latent class model identified three segments of producers that were characterized by preferences for traditional farm business risks, well‐balanced preferences for all five risks, and a large preference share for human risks. Understanding how different farm types and managers with varying demographics prioritize risk areas is helpful for targeting specific risk management programming and support services to relevant farm audiences.

We compare the quality of wine producers with and without GIs and test for the effectiveness of GIs based on (a) the strictness of GIs’ production standards and (b) GIs’ organizational characteristics as a collective brand. We argue that GIs encourage producer quality because they attenuate free‐riding problems, provide incentives to invest and facilitate knowledge sharing. Focusing on the Spanish wine industry, the results reveal that except for wineries with the lowest GI category (i.e., protected geographical indication), GI wineries show higher quality than non‐GI wineries. We also observe that more stringent categories increase quality but at a decreasing rate. Regarding the influence of organizational features, we found that collective action problems seem to be relevant. First, above a certain threshold, the number of producers affiliated with a GI decreases the wine producer's average quality (i.e., it shows an inverted U‐shaped relationship with quality). Second, GIs covering very large geographic areas are found to be less effective. [EconLit Citations: L15, Q12, Q18].",

The selected loglog fractional regression model revealed that mean technical efficiency (MTE) increased over time with a mean value of 62%. MTEs of geographical sections of Ghana are also similar. Time series models possess higher MTE than panel data MTEs. In line with theory, models without functional forms and distance functions elicited higher MTE than Cobb–Douglas and translog functions. Nontraditional agricultural production showed higher MTE than traditional agriculture. MTEs in the production subsector do not differ from those in the manufacturing subsector. While this indifference suggests that value adding manufacturing subsector is as efficient as the primary production agriculture, and the increasing MTE notwithstanding, efficiency improving measures including training in farm management are required to make up for the mean difference of 38% found.

We model farmer cooperation inside such agro‐clusters as a two‐stage decision process. From 1,151 completely filled‐in questionnaires, we find that being located in an agro‐cluster increases farmers' likelihood to cooperate as well as enhances their income. Farmers' attitude towards cooperation is positively influenced by being male, having more assets, and operating a larger farm, but negatively affected if the farmer reports that her household is food vulnerable. The number of hours worked by farmers on the farm and the frequency of face‐to‐face meetings also raise the probability of engaging in cooperation. A higher density of agro‐clusters, higher crop diversity and being located farther away from urban centers are found to increase on average the income level of a farmer. Hence, the promotion of agro‐clusters also in rural regions remains a promising initiative for increasing farmer income.",

Several researchers assert that member interest in cooperative governance is related to social factors. The empirical basis consists of surveys of random samples of Swedish farmers conducted in 1993, 2003, and 2013. The results indicate a strong relationship between the social networks and the farmers' propensity to participate in cooperative governance. This relationship has persisted even though the investigated 20‐year period was very turbulent for Swedish agriculture. Over time, members have become more willing to be elected when they receive backing from their social networks, with personal networks being more important than professional networks. The professional networks are related only to the level of aspiration and not actual participation in governance. [EconLit Citations: D73, P13, Q13].",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study analyzes how corporate social responsibility (CSR) influences consumer behavior in the case of the Spanish agrifood sector. The originality of the study resides in the proposed model that explains that CSR influences perceptions of food safety and health, and quality, and that this perceived quality influences consumer behavior, that is, satisfaction and loyalty. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data from 295 personal interviews; satisfactory results were obtained for all the proposed relationships. Therefore, we suggest that, to achieve consumer loyalty, agrifood companies should orient their strategies toward creating sustainable relationships based on CSR actions. Other academic and management implications are proposed to complete the paper. [EconLit Citations: M14, M310, Q13].",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aims to understand and profile smallholder farmers' technology adoption status. We collected cross‐sectional data from 600 smallholder dairy farming households in West Java, Indonesia. A Latent class cluster analysis identified two unique clusters of smallholder dairy farmers based on patterns in their adoption status of multiple dairy farming technologies. Cluster 1 (Low awareness/low adoption) had significantly lower awareness of all technologies, and among the “aware” farmers, technology adoption rates were also significantly lower compared to Cluster 2 (High awareness/high adoption). The Low awareness/low adoption cluster was older, had less formal education, managed fewer dairy cows, had less productive and less profitable dairy enterprises, lived further away from their cooperative and farmer group leader, and had fewer contacts with dairy extension staff. Farmers' responses to questions regarding reasons underpinning nonadoption decisions suggest that farmers face multilayered and heterogenous constraints to adopting dairy technologies. This insight can assist government, policymakers, and development professionals in designing technology dissemination programs that meet the unique characteristics of subgroups of farmers, ultimately improving the adoption of technologies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Efforts to improve cacao value chains often assume that production of fine and flavor varieties will raise smallholder incomes. Undertaking postharvest practices of fermentation and drying is another exercise assumed to increase value‐added capture by smallholder producers. This study employs household data from 340 cacao farms in 15 villages in coastal Ecuador during 2018 to empirically assess these assumptions. Contrary to the common belief of the international development community, we find that the production of fine and flavor cacao varieties has no association with the price received by small‐scale producers. This is mainly due to (i) low productivity and (ii) nonexistent price premiums. Findings also suggest that the use of postharvest practices of fermentation and drying may lead to substantial price responses irrespective of the type of variety grown. The results presented here have implications for program interventions aimed at increasing farmer revenue. Programs promoting the use of fine and flavor varieties alone might be misguided and can be improved by training in modern processing techniques, regardless of the variety produced.

    "abstract": "Abstract Sub‐Saharan Africa has the least mechanized agriculture in the world due to various reasons including low effective demand at farm level, low policy attention, and ineffective mechanization strategies. However, the situation has changed since recently in favor of mechanization while limited empirical evidence is available on how mechanization can be enhanced among smallholder farmers. In this study, we explore farmers' willingness to invest in mechanization services by considering the group business model (GBM) and the individual business model (IBM) of mechanized maize shelling in Tanzania. Moreover, we analyze the potential financial benefit for those farmers who would like to invest in mechanized maize shelling. We use data mainly collected through a household survey and apply econometric and mathematical models for analysis. The results show that about 65% of the sample farmers are willing to invest in mechanized maize shelling within the GBM, while about 10% of them would like to do so within the IBM. Moreover, the results show that investment in mechanized maize shelling is profitable considering both small‐scale (4 and 7 HP engine capacity) machines and medium‐scale (16 and 20 HP engine capacity) machines. The results show that expanding agricultural mechanization in Tanzania through investments coming from smallholder farmers, as also experienced elsewhere, is possible while they suggest that policy instruments such as targeted loan programs, entrepreneurial and technical trainings, and smart subsidies or tax exemptions are important to encourage and enable smallholder farmers to participate in the mechanization supply chain.

We focus on consumer trust in eco‐friendly food regulator, manufacturer, certifier, and farmer. Evidence from Chinese consumers reveals that individuals with low trust in the certifier have high intention to purchase green food but fail to make actual purchases. Trust in the manufacturer is positively associated with actual purchases of organic food regardless of intention. We also find that trust exerts the greater impact in bridging the intention‐behavior gap among female, younger, more educated, and more environmentally conscious consumers.

    "abstract": "Abstract Seafood products are mainly provided through trade to international markets and Norway is the major international player for the export of salmon products. It is argued that fresh or chilled salmon, which are perishable products and Norway's main seafood export, need stable trade partners to safely and properly reach consumption markets. In this study, the firm‐to‐firm level trade transactional data for both exporters and importers for the 2005–2018 period was utilized for a trade duration analysis. The Kaplan–Meier survival estimators, Cox proportional hazard model, and frailty model were used to study the stability of trade relations between the partners through survival and hazard models. The study considers the heterogeneous firm trade model along with a theoretical framework. The results show that, on average, the trade duration for the salmon trade between firms is 2.39 years, which is relatively low for a perishable product such as salmon. It shows that the market entry and exit is relatively fast, and that the survival rate between the EU as a major demand market and non‐EU countries is not very different. However, core and periphery markets can be defined by considering the survival rate, as major processing hubs in the EU, such as Poland and France as core markets, have higher survival rates compared with other countries that can be considered peripheries. Both extensive and intensive margins were found to reduce the hazard ratio. Different hazard ratios were also found between different types of exporter or ones utilizing different means of transport. We conclude that the trade duration between the partners can be increased if the competition in the market increases, which is probably possible in markets like the United States where other exporters such as Chile are available.",

The use of bioengineered crops has been controversial since their introduction in the 1990s due to concerns about their potentially harmful effects to human health, the environment, and other socioeconomic issues. To identify grower preferences, perceived opportunities, and barriers to growing bioengineered crops, we surveyed Minnesota specialty crop growers using a web‐based survey. The survey measured whether adoption rates are influenced by the specific trait of the modification, the method of bioengineering (genetically modified [GM] vs. genetically edited [GE]), or the end use of the crop being grown (ornamental vs food). Overall willingness‐to‐pay for both GM and GE potatoes was significantly lower than for conventional potatoes, and nearly a quarter (25%) of our respondents never chose a bioengineered option no matter the benefits. Results were similar for petunias, but fewer respondents (18%) refused to consider the bioengineering option. The type of bioengineering did not have as significant an impact on adoption rate as price or end use. The bioengineered ornamental crop had a higher willingness to adopt than the bioengineered food crop.

    "abstract": "Abstract The transition from subsistence to market‐oriented agriculture holds the potential to boost rural economic progress and improve the well‐being of the rural poor in developing countries. Despite this potential, there is limited understanding of the key drivers for smallholder commercialization. In this study, we utilize comprehensive three‐wave panel data collected from three major maize‐producing regions in Ethiopia to examine the role of agricultural cooperatives in promoting smallholder commercialization. Employing a double‐hurdle model, we model smallholder commercialization as a two‐step decision process involving market participation and the extent of participation (sales quantity), conditional on market participation. Unobserved heterogeneity is accounted for using a correlated random effect procedure, and the potential endogeneity of cooperative membership is addressed through a control function approach. The findings reveal that cooperative membership increases the probability of market participation and the intensity of sales. However, further analysis demonstrates a heterogeneous relationship between cooperative membership and commercialization, underscoring the importance of targeted interventions to boost the contribution of cooperatives to rural development through commercialization. The main findings highlight that promoting smallholder commercialization through farmer groups necessitates implementing policies to increase cooperative membership, coupled with allocating resources that enhance the contribution of agricultural cooperatives [EconLit Citations: Q12, Q13, Q18].",

Losses sustained from the apparently ineffectual media were more than offset by gains from the effective media (magazines and radio), so that returns overall, net of opportunity cost, were positive.

For this study of supermarkets in 34 local markets in six southwestern states, market share and concentration are not significantly related to any service factors. However, concentration has a significant positive relationship with price in the full sample, and share also is significantly related to price in subsamples of large, leading firms.

After a description of important structural features in the milk production, milk processing and food retailing sectors in European countries and the discussion of different approaches to measure international competitiveness, the analysis is carried out at the meso-economic level by using “Revealed Comparative Advantage Indicators” to determine the competitive position of the German dairy industry. In comparison with other EU countries, the German dairy sector seems to have international competitive advantages in fresh, dried, and evaporated milk products.

Trade balances by product are used to indicate successful competition in trade. Export and import unit values are used to determine if competition is dominated by price or nonprice competition. Trade flows are then categorized in four ways: successful price competition, unsuccessful price competition, successful nonprice competition, and unsuccessful nonprice competition. This categorization is applied to 372 food products using the Standard International Trade Classification. Nearly 40% of U.S. food exports could be characterized as dominated by nonprice competition. In those instances, we contend that unit values are not valid proxies for price, thereby limiting their usefulness in traditional import demand estimation and trade policy simulation models. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This research examines the potential market for natural pork in the Intermountain West, with emphasis on targeting the market segment most likely to purchase this product at a significant premium. High‐income, frequent pork consumers, and those that have purchased natural beef are most likely to purchase natural pork products. With respect to production‐related attributes, those concerned about feed additives, and to a lesser degree, the effects of pork production on the environment, are likely target markets.

In this article, the authors will analyze questions addressing brand management, especially the activities of retailers who are developing their own brands. As evidenced by the steady increase in market share for retail brands, nowadays consumers see little significant difference between retail brands and processor brands. Being the trustee of credence characteristics of food items, brands have to guarantee the correctness of their products throughout the whole food supply chain. In order to ensure this, vertical coordination mechanisms have to be installed. This is leading to competition among retail chains in the area of vertical coordination to ensure quality and to build brand equity.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the non‐linear adjustments of prices in the poultry marketing chain in Spain. The methodology used is based on the multivariate approach to specify and estimate a threshold autoregressive model. Price relationships at feed industry, producer, and retail levels are considered. Results indicate that, in the long run, price transmission is perfect and any supply or demand shocks are fully transmitted to all prices in the system. In the short run, price adjustments between the feed and the farmer levels are fairly symmetric and are representative of a cost‐push transmission mechanism. On the other hand, retailers benefit from any shock, whether positive or negative, that affects supply or demand conditions when price spreads are increasing, while price behavior is closely related to competitive markets when faced with declining price spreads.

The way producers deal with this complexity can vary and may influence the impact that the determinants, such as risk aversion, have on their choices. A recently developed choice bracketing framework recognizes that producers are unable to evaluate all alternatives simultaneously and that to manage a complex task, they often group or bracket individual alternatives and their consequences together in choice sets. Data on 1,105 U.S. producers show that producers do not use all available combinations of risk management tools and that the influence of the determinants of producer's risk management decisions are not necessarily the same across risk management strategies within and across bracketing levels. The findings may help resolve puzzling results on the role that well‐known determinants of risk management behavior have on producers' choices, extending knowledge on producers' risk management behavior. Further, the findings have managerial implications for policy makers and agribusiness companies that provide risk management services. [EconLit citations: M000, G1000, Q130] © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Food industry cartels achieve lower overcharges than domestic cartels. Longer cartel episodes generate higher levels of overcharges. Cartels that were found or pled guilty achieve approximately the same levels of overcharges as legal cartels. [JEL classifications: L1, L2, L4, L6]. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

More specifically, the markets examined are vegetables, fruits and the whole food. Using cointegration techniques, two alternative dynamic models are estimated: an error correction model (ECM) and a LSE‐Hendry general‐to‐specific model (GETS). The results indicate the existence of a long‐run Granger–causality relationship running from producers to consumers in the vegetables market, while the opposite applies for food and fruits. In addition, asymmetric price transmission appears to apply for food and vegetables, but not for the fruit case. Both models agree upon the asymmetric nature of food and the symmetric nature of fruits but disagree for the case of vegetables. [JEL Classification: Q110, Q130] © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The use of traditional feedstocks for biofuel production has brought about large changes to food and agricultural systems. As livestock producers adapt to rising feed costs, the prospect of incorporating dried distiller's grain with solubles (DDGS) at higher than traditional levels becomes an important consideration. Given prices for feedstuffs and supplies of DDGS that are outside the historical data range, forward-looking analyses of the agricultural economy (even those with explicit derived demands for livestock feed) are poorly equipped to represent the farm- and sector-level tradeoffs that will emerge. The authors' results indicate that DDGS demands are more responsive to price changes in energy-oriented feeds than protein, despite the predominant historic feeding use of DDGS as a protein supplement. They extend their empirical analysis to account for the role of heterogeneous DDGS feed quality, identifying this as a critical consideration for sector-level substitution patterns. The price elasticities they report from their two-stage farm-level feed mix simulation and sector-level cost function estimation offer a robust picture of feedstuffs substitution of the type necessary for understanding the livestock component of demand response in the biofuels era.

In March of 1997, Japan imposed an import ban on Taiwanese pork. At the time, Taiwan was supplying 41% of Japan's pork imports. The authors rely on the framework developed by Goldberg and Knetter (1999) and implement a generalized method of moments procedure to estimate the inverse residual demand elasticities of the current three largest exporting countries: United States, Canada, and Denmark. Structural change was investigated by adapting Qu and Perron's (2007) methodology that endogenizes the break dates. The authors found that foreign exporters were delayed by 2 years in making adjustments after Taiwan's exit. The ban on Taiwan's exports made the U.S. residual demand more inelastic and reinforced the case for U.S. market power. Denmark's reduction of market power may be due to their export product mix.

To model the preferences, a random parameter logit model and a latent class model are estimated and compared. The comparison, based on predicted probability distribution, regression analysis of the probabilities, and investigation of the probability ratio, suggests that the latent class model is preferred to the random parameter logit model. Estimating a latent class model with three latent classes, using group dependent variables, i.e., class indicators, suggests that preferences may be characterized by food safety and animal welfare dimensions. Calculating the willingness to pay for the variables within each class, the author found that Class 1 is oriented towards animal welfare, Class 3 is oriented towards food safety, and Class 2 is intermediate of Class 1 and Class 3. Moreover, class membership and its implication for the assessment of organic pork are investigated. The respondents within the “food safety-conscious” class have a strong belief that organic food products are safer, though this class is also found to be the most price sensitive. The “animal welfare-conscious” respondents are also price sensitive, but to a lesser extent than the food safety-conscious consumers. Moreover, respondents that show a concern for animal welfare do not believe that organic pork is produced under more animal friendly conditions. The relatively large size of the animal welfare-conscious class and the negative perception of organic pork found in this group suggest that market opportunities exist for the marketing of animal welfare-certified products.

In response to intensifying competition, the industry has introduced new apple varieties that are more desirable to consumers in terms of eating quality and improve growers’ profitability. British Columbia (BC) apple sales data were employed to examine the implicit value of apple attributes for apples sold in several metropolitan areas of western Canada (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, and Winnipeg). Linear hedonic price functions were estimated to determine price premiums paid for newer varieties, higher grades, and larger fruit size. In addition, the price effects of cold storage and seasonality were considered because of their association with apple quality. Wholesale prices were significantly influenced by apple fruits of newer varieties, grades, fruit sizes, and metropolitan area. Wholesalers also distinguished between Canadian and BC grades of different varieties. Wholesale prices varied across urban centers; they were relatively higher in Winnipeg and Saskatoon than in Vancouver [EconLit Classifications: Q110, Q130].",

Basis relationships have become more volatile and less predictable. Greater volatility results in more risk for producers and shippers, and exacerbates planning and investment for handling and shipping infrastructure. The purpose of this study is to analyze relationships and impacts among shipping costs and basis values at origins and destinations. The results indicate that (1) basis values have become more risky; (2) all marketing costs have increased; (3) increases in rail tariffs were less than those for barges; (4) daily car values, on average, declined; (5) fuel service charges had moderate changes in absolute terms; and (6) handling margins have had fairly substantial increases, particularly at port. The econometric results indicate that the following variables were significant in explaining variability in origin basis values: shipping costs, Gulf-PNW ocean rate spreads, outstanding export sales, shipping industry concentration, measures of rail cars late, the ratio of stocks to storage capacity, futures prices, and varying measures of futures and destination spreads. Finally, implications for rail pricing, capacity and understanding basis pricing are discussed. [Econ Lit citations: Q130, L900]. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Consumers often favor locally over nonlocally produced foods in the belief they have higher quality and provide the quasipublic service of conserving local agriculture. The aim of the present study is to clarify these two motivations’ relative contributions to product demand by considering consumer reference points, that is preferences for remaining at present consumption and price levels. A stated‐preference method is applied to the Japanese demand for bread from local wheat. We find that Japanese consumers pay a significant premium for local wheat bread and that more than half the observed demand variation is explained by a product's quasipublic nature. In contrast, reference‐point effects suggest that those who frequently buy local food have a negative willingness‐to‐pay for imported or nonlocal‐domestic breads. Appealing to local food‐buyers’ preferences for a local source and for environmental quality thus appears to be the most effective way of promoting local wheat bread.

Hence, one would expect transaction costs to increase when a traditional cooperative is transformed into a hybrid cooperative. The present study investigates this hypothesis. The empirical data originates from a survey with suppliers of Swedish Meats, a cooperative that used to dominate the Swedish meat sector. However, it lost the cooperative elements as external investors got a share of the ownership in 2007. Results indicate that the importance of typical drivers of perceived transaction costs are not homogeneously distributed. A subgroup of respondents still considers the former cooperative as a safe and trustworthy partner with reliable market information. Successful, entrepreneurial farmers instead perceive higher transaction costs when dealing with the hybrid cooperative. Geographical location and neighboring networks are insignificant. In general, the results confirm that the hybrid cooperative has lost its role as a cooperative.",

Information sources include a thorough review of the literature, a statistical survey of farmers in the major maize‐producing areas of the country, and key informant interviews conducted with seed company representatives. We discuss the merits of two strategies: (1) liberalizing the provision of original orange maize planting material to all seed companies with the aim of maximizing the impact of this public health intervention, and (2) exclusive rights granted to companies with the goals of preserving differentiated products and ensuring standard seed quality to protect the brand. We find that, exclusive or not, risk‐sharing contracts with any company that takes up this product, as well as building and maintaining a unique brand for orange maize would be essential for the success of this product.",

This paper aims at investigating the bargaining process leading to the definition of a Geographical Indication area. Drawing on historical evidence from three cases, we build a three‐stage Political Economy Model in which the size of the protected area is endogenously determined. The resulting politically optimal area is compared to the social optimum. Results show that lobbying strength, quantity supplied, and market potential play an important role in explaining deviations from the social optimum.",

With Western‐style products becoming increasingly popular across China, more information is needed to better evaluate the future market opportunities of different juice products. In this regard, we investigate Chinese consumer perception, knowledge, and willingness‐to‐pay for different types of orange juice products. Results show that Chinese consumers have limited knowledge of juice products, especially for Western‐style juices. Although consumers are willing to pay more for products with higher juice content, 10% orange juice drink will probably continue to dominate the orange juice product market in China unless there is a significant drop in the price of 100% not from concentrate orange juice. Consumers with better knowledge of juice products, females, and those with higher income are more likely to be willing to pay more for 100% not from concentrate orange juice.

Cognizant of market access, farm produce value, sustainable production, and reduction of postharvest losses, this paper investigated whether farm size, schooling, producer price, farm visits, and social capital networks condition these strategies. The results show that use of written contracts is conditioned by farm sizes, more extension, and number of producer groups (PGs) while farm certification is positively predicted by farm sizes, more extension, number of sellers in the village and seasons with the same buyer. However, certification is less responsive to producer prices. Crop rejections are predicted to be less depending on a farmer's education, number of PGs, and the producer price but are more likely to increase the more the number of sellers. Further, the results show that a forward pricing incentive is highly correlated with higher producer prices, more extension, and number of seasons with the same buyer. Finally, uncollected produce at harvest is likely to decrease with farm sizes, more education and extension, higher producer price, number of PGs, and seasons with the same buyer but is more likely to increase the higher the number of sellers.

Moreover, there are often only descriptive impact assessments of individual programmes available. In our study, we respond to this issue through the empirical analysis of the effects of the EU public policy on the example of the Czech food processing industry. We assess the impact of the Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation (OPEI), which took place during the years 2007–2013. We applied counterfactual impact analysis based on firm‐level data with the aim of investigating the effects of this support on the financial performance of the supported enterprises ( N = 143, 70% of the supported companies) 2 years after the end of the intervention. The results show a positive effect on the performance of supported firms measured by a price‐cost margin, value added per labour cost, the growth of sales and growth of tangible assets. The study offers several policy implications. First, the policymakers should impose a reporting duty on the supported firms. That would help policymakers to conduct more easily programme evaluations. Second, they should employ the cost‐benefit analysis as a part of the programme evaluations in the future. Third, growth aspirations of the applicants for receiving public subsidies should be taken into account already during the application process.",

The results show that the price transmission regime was not changed by the export ban. Thus, the export controls were not successful in dampening the domestic wheat price level. We make evident that the expected price decreasing effects of the export ban were offset by inconsistent additional policy measures and their faulty sequencing. Further, the governmental market interventions had even long‐lasting destabilizing market effects. Market instability was increased particularly after the cancellation of the export ban.",

We hypothesize that locality information on food may also influence consumer perception of the three types of attributes of food products: search (i.e., color, size, freshness, and shape), experience (i.e., flavor and texture), and other credence attributes (i.e., nutritional value). We conduct an experiment with a total of 100 participants. We combine the consumer sensory analysis with the CVM to determine the impact of locality information on consumers' perception of strawberry search, experience, and credence attributes, and how these three types of attributes affect consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) at different consumption stages. Results show that providing locality information affects the sensory attributes of color perceived by consumers. Color, size, and freshness have a significant impact on consumers' WTP before consumers taste the strawberries, while flavor and texture exhibit an influential impact on consumers' WTP after tasting. Locality information is not a significant factor in determining consumers' WTP before and after they taste the strawberries. However, for some consumers, it significantly affects their WTP if locality is perceived to be associated with improved nutritional quality and food safety comparing to people who perceive local food to be fresher.",

Results show that the number of ratings and each of these moments of the distribution of online consumer ratings affect ground coffee sales ranking. The size of the effect of the distribution of ratings was found to vary with respect to the sales level of the coffee products. The results suggest that the distribution of online ratings plays an important informational role in e‐commerce platforms. As online grocery shopping continues to increase in popularity, a greater understanding of how online ratings and reviews may impact sales or products are needed by those in the agricultural and food supply chain. In particular, these results provide retail managers with an array of online consumer rating attributes to use in their demand forecasts. [EconLit citations: D12, D83, L81, M31, Q11].",

The perishability of these products appears to challenge conventional wisdom when it comes to food trade, which emphasizes the importance of large shipments to reduce transportation costs. In this paper, gravity models and several margins of trade are estimated for the trade with fresh salmon, a highly perishable product. The results indicate that increased geographical distance have a larger negative effect than what is generally reported in the literature. Most interestingly, the number of exporters and the shipment frequency increase while there is little impact on shipment size when trade increase. Hence, freshness and possibly avoidance of losses by not selling products by the expiration date seem to be emphasized rather than economies of scale in transportation.

Price and product characteristics are collected from 264 honey labels found on the shelves of the main representative retail stores available in the national territory. The marginal effects and the implicit prices of honey characteristics are assessed through a hedonic price approach. Results show that the prices of honey are affected by leader brands sold in gourmet stores and hypermarkets in glass packages compared to producer brands sold in discounts stores and supermarkets in plastic packages. The organic production and the protected designation of origin quality labels generate positive marginal effects on the prices of honey, as well. Regarding the origin of honey, the highest relative and absolute consumer price premiums are received for honey coming from the European Union and Spain compared with blend honey coming from EU and non‐EU countries. Consumer implicit prices are also influenced by mono‐floral and gourmet honey with additional properties (e.g., ginseng) compared with the multifloral varieties. These findings are a useful source for a better understanding of the evolution of honey in the Spanish market. Spanish beekeepers who can differentiate their honey, may use these results as an orientation for their business strategies.",

Although the government introduced the dairy best practices scheme that stipulates standards and practices for proper handling of raw milk, consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for such milk has not yet been assessed. It is also unclear whether consumers are aware of and/or value the safety‐ and quality‐related information on types of milk sold in different marketing channels. In this study, we use the second price auction mechanism to elicit consumers' WTP for pasteurized but unpackaged milk in Rwanda and we estimate the effect of providing safety‐ and quality‐related information on WTP using the random‐effect Tobit model. Our results show that consumers are willing to pay a price premium for safe and quality milk, implying that there is an opportunity for market transformation in the dairy sector. Furthermore, we find a positive and significant effect of providing information to consumers on WTP for safe and quality milk. Based on our results, we recommend policies that promote private sector investments in upscaling of milk zones and the establishment of milk‐dispensing machines selling this type of milk. There is also a need for information campaigns that increase consumers' knowledge and awareness of the quality of milk consumed. [EconLit Citations: C34, C91, D12, D44, M31].",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the effect on the demand of pasta following the introduction of the mandatory country of origin labeling for wheat in Italy. This regulation opened a debate between producers, farmers, and consumer organizations on the opportunity posed by this policy. Using an online survey with a choice experiment conducted on 551 Italian pasta consumers, we demonstrated that consumers strongly approve this mandatory policy. This support suggests that place of wheat origin is relevant in driving the pasta choices of consumers and that they are willing to pay a premium price for pasta made with Italian wheat. Moreover, the extra utility that the consumers receive from purchasing pasta made with locally produced wheat is due by their support for the farmers and the agriculture sector [EconLit Citations: D12, Q13, Q18].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Formal credit plays an important role for the development of the agriculture sector in developing countries because many farmers are characterized as liquidity constrained. Access to credit can increase farmers' purchasing power for inputs and agricultural technology, thus raising the overall productivity. Farmers in Mali are particularly vulnerable to shocks, such as heavy precipitation events. Access to liquidity to increase the resilience of the agricultural sector is essential. Therefore, higher financing volumes are required, which make the analysis of loan demand in agriculture of interest. The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the role of the interest rate, the macroeconomic environment, the agricultural cycle and the gender of the farmer on the loan demand in the agricultural sector from a country in the Sahel. Unique and comprehensive loan data at the farm level, provided by a commercial Malian bank, is used for this analysis. The analysis covers the period from 2010 to 2020. Two different estimation strategies are combined. First, an ordinary least square regression is applied with the granted loan amount as the dependent variable. Second, the machine learning technique, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, is applied to select the most relevant features to be used as explanatory variables in the estimation. The results reveal that the interest rate, the gross value added, the farmer's gender as well as the agricultural cycle have statistically significant effects on the granted loan demand in agriculture. These results are of interest to policymakers, who deal with financial inclusion as well as market failures, and agricultural financial institutions who could incorporate such information in the design of future loan products to stimulate farmers' loan demand, especially for female farmers.

Based on a theoretical analysis of the impact mechanisms of the agricultural digital economy on agricultural exports, this study empirically examines the impact and mechanism of the agricultural digital economy on agricultural exports using Chinese agricultural export data from 2011 to 2016. The relevant findings are threefold. (1) The agricultural digital economy significantly enhances the growth of China's agricultural exports, and the result remains robust after a series of robustness tests. (2) The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the agricultural digital economy has a greater role in promoting exports from quality frontier firms, primary agricultural products and exports to developed countries. (3) The mechanism analysis demonstrates that the agricultural digital economy promotes exports of agricultural products on the supply side most strongly through quality–enhancing and the information cost effects, improving product quality and reducing information expenditure to achieve export growth. On the demand side, domestic demand traction and external–demand creation effects exert a local market effect and stimulate import market demand to promote export growth.

Yet, evidence‐based study on the impacts of AAS on farm performance are scarce, especially in West African countries. This study evaluates the impact of access to AAS on input use and farm performance in Senegal, employing the instrumental variable and control function approaches accounting for selection bias. The approaches are also employed to several sub‐samples to see if the impacts are heterogeneous across crop types and fertilizer use, and matching techniques are applied to test the robustness of the results. Results show that the highest positive impact of AAS is on yield, while the impacts on gross margin and improved seeds uptake are very modest. Access to AAS has no effect on fertilizer uptake. It also finds that AAS impacts positively cereal production and farmers using no fertilizer but has no effect on the legume and horticultural crop production and on farmers using fertilizer. Given the Senegalese government and donors have put a lot of effort into developing an efficient AAS system, a consideration of the identified weaknesses is required to improve its efficiency.

    "abstract": "Abstract Unlike genetic modification, genome editing (GE) technologies can be used to yield transgene‐free outcomes, which is an important aspect in promoting consumer acceptance of GE foods. In addition, with the advent of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system, which is known to be exceptional among genome editing tools, GE has numerous potential applications in plant breeding technology to create diverse desirable traits, especially consumer‐targeted traits such as improved product quality and nutrition. It is expected that the GE foods market will overtake that of genetically modified (GM) foods. Although few GE products have been introduced to the market, some studies have already evaluated consumer acceptance and valuation of GE foods in comparison with GM and conventional foods. However, these studies mainly focused on traits relevant to cultivation efficiency and ignored consumer preferences for desirable traits. Further, it has been shown that consumers evaluate GE foods somewhat higher than GM foods; yet, as observed for GM foods, consumers expect a discounted price for GE foods. GE application for consumer‐targeted traits could, however, have a potentially positive effect on consumer acceptance. This study was conducted to evaluate consumer acceptance and valuation of quality‐improved consumer‐targeted GE products. We defined the determinants and estimated the willingness to pay a price premium for GE rice compared to GM and conventional rice by using the double‐bounded contingent valuation method under different information treatments. The survey was conducted in Vietnam, where consumers have not been exposed to information regarding GE via social media that could lead to a biased perspective. This context is ideal for investigating the effect of information provision during the introductory stage of GE products to the market. Our main findings suggest that consumers will widely accept quality‐improved GE foods targeted at consumer preferences, as well as the positive influence of in‐depth information provision on potential consumer acceptance.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Africa's cultural and colonial heritage has profoundly segmented rice markets. Whereas in ancient centers of rice domestication, consumers maintained preferences for local rice consistent with their cultural heritage, preferences have shifted toward imported Asian rice in coastal areas around seaports, due to prior exposure to colonial import substitution policies. To enhance the competitiveness of locally produced rice relative to imported versions, it is necessary to tailor new local rice products to both market segments. A study was conducted in Senegal to test branding strategies for local rice in a country where both market segments coexist. Brands that mimic local and international labels were developed for local rice, and urban consumers bid to upgrade non‐preferred to preferred brands through the Becker–DeGroot–Marschak (BDM) mechanism. Contrary to expectations, results from an endogenous switching regression show that descendants from ancient Senegalese rice domesticators placed premiums on local rice with foreign‐looking brands, indicating that foreignness is perceived as a quality cue even in market segments rooted in cultural heritage. Thus, branding local rice using a combination of local and foreign cues could be an effective strategy in promoting domestic rice to both segments shaped by cultural and colonial heritage.",

The proportion of the intra‐industry trade was higher for food products involving a greater degree of processing, whereas trade in bulk commodities with little or no processing was predominantly inter‐industry. U.S.–Canada bilateral trade has been increasingly more dominated by intra‐industry trade. On the other hand, Mexican bilateral trade with both the United States and Canada has been predominantly inter‐industry in nature. The study also indicated a decline in the proportion of intra‐industry trade in U.S. trade with the rest of the world during this period.

In this article, we use an extensive data set on the cattle procurement activities of four large packing plants in the Texas Panhandle from early 1995 through mid‐1996 to examine this relationship at the plant‐level. We find evidence to support the hypothesis that plants that anticipate near‐term future deliveries of captive supply cattle that are high relative to their regional‐market rivals' degrees of reliance on captive supplies tend to pay spot market prices that are below average. The effect, while statistically significant, is relatively small in magnitude, however. [EconLit citations: Q130, L200] © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Agribusiness 19: 489–504, 2003.",

The paper charts the entry of Wal-Mart into Europe within the context of increased competition in international markets among the “elite” group of transnational corporations which have the capability of disrupting the structure of foreign markets which they enter. Using a mixture of primary and secondary data sources, the purpose of the paper is to evaluate the success or otherwise of the implementation of the “Wal-Mart way” of doing business in Germany and the UK and to assess its impact on both markets. The results show that the German acquisitions have not been particularly successful because of the problems in integrating two disparate chains with different organizational cultures and a heterogeneous portfolio of stores. The highly competitive German grocery market has precluded Wal-Mart from realizing a key element of its global strategy—Every Day Low Prices (EDLP). Discounters, especially Aldi, are the price leaders in Germany. By contrast, the Asda acquisition in the UK has been much more successful. Asda was a good strategic fit for Wal-Mart and had already embraced aspects of the Wal-Martian retail proposition and corporate culture prior to the acquisition in 1999. The entry of Wal-Mart has led to a restructuring of the UK grocery market with low prices and value for money becoming key store choice attributes for UK consumers.

Timing is used as a performance measure of managers' response to recalls of food, using survival distributions of times between production and recall, and recall case duration. The objectives are to understand how these time periods vary across plants and to determine factors explaining such variability. Survival distributions are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier and life table methods. Subgroups of the population are compared using plots of the estimated survival functions and statistically compared using log-rank and Wilcoxon tests. Managers at large plants, in multi-plant firms, and at plants with prior recall experience do not perform better. Cox regressions indicate that government agency sampling programs enhanced the speed of discovery, and that national distribution networks contributed to the risk that cases remained open for a longer period.

Three regions are defined for this purpose and the notorious problem of zeros in survey data is addressed by endogenizing the probability of purchase through the Shonkwiler and Yen approach applied to a QUAIDS demand system for each region. Probabilities of purchase and marginal effects are computed and compared as well as price and expenditure elasticities. The empirical distributions of the elasticities are simulated through bootstrapping. This allows us to formally test the null hypothesis of no regional differences between elasticities for central, western and Atlantic Canada and the null hypothesis of weak separability of fish from meats. While some significant regional differences were uncovered that can be exploited by food retailers, other findings were robust across regions. For example, the demand for fish tends to be more price and expenditure inelastic than the demand for meats. [EconLit citations: D120, C150, L660]. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Building on the resource‐based view, both drivers and outcomes of firm performance were defined as relative concepts. Performance was measured as relative return on assets and sales, relative change in sales, and by combining these variables into an integrated performance measure. Data for the analysis was gathered in an online firm survey and analyzed by means of nonparametric correlation and regression analysis. The survey response was very low and the sample may not be a good representation of the population. However, the results indicate that the main drivers for firm advantages lie within technology and production‐related areas. They further suggest that with firm‐specific variables, it is possible to explain as much as two‐thirds of the variation in profitability. [Q130, L250, D240]. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The results reveal a differential impact of the exogenous shock on producers and retailers, which leads to widening of price margins and points to imperfect price transmission, specifically at the retail level, with consequences for the efficiency and equity of the marketing channel.

They use monthly national data for the period 1986–2008, which includes records of FSIS recalls of varying severity and BSE events in the United States and Canada. The authors account for immediate and delayed effects of food scares and for potential cross effects across industries and countries. The results indicate that beef and food recalls do not affect their corresponding price margins and overall food safety incidents have minor cross‐industry and cross‐country effects. However, BSE discoveries in the United States considerably affect marketing margins in the beef industry, particularly at the wholesale‐to‐retail level. Interestingly, subsequent discoveries had smaller impacts on price margins. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy outbreaks also appear to affect the extent of price transmission between wholesalers and retailers.",

    "abstract": "The recent rapid growth in modern food retailing can be either driven by price decreases associated with efficiency gains in the supply chain over time, or it can be driven by growing consumer demand for nonprice characteristics, such as added convenience and higher quality goods. However, the price decreases associated with efficiency gains are likely to have a much larger effect on food demand and welfare in developing countries. Despite the importance of the question, few studies have empirically analyzed which driver has been more important to the spread of modern food retailing. Using a newly constructed data set of 103 developing countries, we find suggestive evidence of the expansion being primarily driven by growth in demand for nonprice characteristics. Specifically, we find that variation in demographic characteristics, such as share of the population who would benefit most from the convenience offered by modern formats, are associated with large variations in supermarket growth over the past decade. On the other hand, growth in modern food retailing appears uncorrelated with variation in the ease of developing efficient supply chains. Thus, although having the possibility to deliver large welfare gains to developing countries, the expansion of modern supermarkets likely has had much more muted effects.

Factors determining the selection of marketing channels and their implication on the agri-food industrial organization have been given little attention in the literature. This paper uses a transaction cost economics (TCE) approach to explain farmers' choice between wholesale traders and marketing cooperatives. By using a Tobit model, an effort is exerted to demonstrate the empirical application of TCE theory and to measure transaction costs that influence agricultural marketing. The results on the basis of survey data collected in 2007 from different villages in Southern Ethiopia suggests that transaction costs play an important role in determining farmers' marketing channel choice decision.

    "abstract": "Abstract Although uncertainly is a common feature of agricultural markets, we know little about the effect of uncertainty on farmers’ choice of business relationships. This paper distinguishes production uncertainty, environmental uncertainty, and behavioral uncertainty in examining four kinds of business relationships of Chinese vegetable farmers: market exchange, cooperative membership without marketing transaction, cooperative membership with marketing transaction, and contract farming. We applied a multinomial logit model to data collected among 413 farmers in Hebei and Zhejiang provinces. The results suggested that all three types of uncertainty significantly affect the business relationships chosen by vegetable farmers. In particular, it was found that as production uncertainty increases, farmers prefer contract farming and both cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction over market exchange; while as behavioral uncertainty increases, farmers are less likely to be involved in contract farming. Environmental uncertainty does not affect the likelihood that farmers choose market exchange or contract farming, while mixed results are obtained for its effects on cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction.

The analysis allows for asymmetric adjustment among food prices when the wholesale or retail stages exert oligopoly power. The study provides a theoretical underpinning of the relationship between domestic and international prices. Asymmetries in price transmission are examined using the Houck as well as the error‐correction approaches. The impulse response analyses show that red pepper prices return to their long‐term equilibria relatively quickly, whereas onion prices settle at a new equilibrium after a price shock. Market power in the wholesale sector affects the responses of onion prices but has little or no effect on the responses of red pepper prices. Market power in the retail sector does not affect the onion prices or the red pepper prices. Analysis of weekly price data over the period from 2005 to 2008 suggests asymmetric adjustment in producer‐wholesale and international‐producer prices in the Dutch onion supply chain. The results also show asymmetric transmission between producer and retail prices for red pepper.",

A rating‐based experiment and eye tracking measures were integrated to investigate the relationship between consumers’ perceived benefits of local production, purchase likelihood, and visual attention. Local economy benefits were perceived as the most beneficial (compared to environmental or product quality benefits) with participants’ demographics influencing their perceptions of those benefits. Visual attention to the agricultural promotional campaign logo increased consumers’ purchase likelihood if they perceived locally grown plants as benefiting the local economy. The local production attribute had a positive impact even though consumers who became familiar with the visual stimulus (after repetitive exposures) spent relatively less time visually attending to the campaign logo.

We find evidence of both substitution and complementary effects between brands and certifications. Results from a latent class model reveal three latent consumer groups for fresh milk: brand/certification seekers, price‐sensitive shoppers, and habitual buyers. Habitual buyers are loyal to the brand they most frequently purchase, whereas respondents who exhibit higher levels of trust and education are more likely to be brand/certification seekers.

A cheap talk script combined with a trap question designed to simultaneously reduce hypothetical bias as well as measurement error caused by inattentive respondents is included in the survey. Results indicate even slightly discolored beef may require at least a 50% discount before the average consumer will purchase it. However, through latent class analysis, consumer preferences for discolored steak and ground beef are found to be heterogeneous with several latent classes identified. Thus, if the quantity of discolored meat to be sold is low, retailers can sell discolored meat at smaller discounts to consumers in one of the subgroups with less discriminating discoloration preferences [EconLit Citations: D10, D12, Q18].",

To understand this phenomenon better, a classification scheme for strategic entrepreneurial choices in agriculture is developed for family farmers. The choices that are scrutinized are reduction, continuation, expansion, diversification, and the dual strategy of expansion and diversification. Each farmer is uniquely assigned to one of these choice classes according to their implemented entrepreneurial activities. Determinants influencing these choices are investigated with a multinomial logit model. The data are derived from a quantitative survey among German farmers ( N = 745). Strong effects are observable within the area of personal factors; creativity and risk affinity benefit entrepreneurial strategies connected with diversification. Farmers with a third‐level education qualification are less likely to follow expansion strategies, and those with off‐farm employment and risk‐averse farmers mainly choose a reduction strategy. Family involvement, especially the farmer's spouse, proves to have stabilizing and even enhancing effects on certain strategies. Implications for policymakers and actors within the agricultural sector can thus be derived.",

However, organic dairy prices recently collapsed along with conventional prices when several large producers entered the organic market. The current study explores the patterns and determinants of organic dairy premiums. We estimate monthly price premiums for organic whole milk, other fluid milk, yogurt, and eggs over the period 2008–2017 using US retail scanner data. The premiums were 56%, 51%, 27%, and 38%, respectively, with annual compound growth rates of 8%, 7%, −1.42%, and −2.86%. We identify the determinants of price premiums with a vector autoregression to account for endogeneity and autocorrelation, and a machine‐learning algorithm—extreme gradient boost—for data‐driven insights. Holding the premiums fixed, growing input costs may induce organic sellers to sell more to compensate for costs. Holding organic sales fixed, organic premiums decrease in conventional share of organic, cost of diesel, electricity, and feed grains in general; but increase in the number of shoppers and wages.

In addition, the correlation of markups between the two methods is low. This can have implications for the consistency of policy recommendations based on the SFA and the PFA as they yield different outcomes with respect to the state of competition in a market. Last, we find a link between market concentration and markups for the PFA pointing towards adverse effects of further concentration on consumer welfare, whereas our results show no evidence for a relationship between SFA markups and market concentration.

The processing of organic baby food involves minimal use of toxic chemicals and synthetic food additives which may be attractive to health‐conscious parents. On the other hand, organic baby food is generally more expensive than nonorganic alternatives due to the cost of organic certification. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the price premium that parents are willing to pay for organic baby food and how it varies along several dimensions: organic label, food type based on developmental stage, retail channel, frequency of purchase of organic products, and over time. We apply the hedonic price model to Nielsen consumer panel data to isolate brand effects from the organic effects on product prices. The empirical results show that parents pay 17%–27% more, on average, for organic baby food than conventional alternatives, after controlling for a series of product and market characteristics.

The multiple indicators multiple causes model was used for the estimation of levels and development of informal economies of these countries. The results show higher levels of informal economies in agriculture compared with those in the overall economies. One main contributing factor to this development was a change in the subsidization regime, namely, decoupling Common Agricultural Policy payments from quantities of products produced, introduced in 2003. The effects of taxation, share of imports, and factor income in agriculture are also important for the size of the informal agricultural economy. Finally, we disaggregate the informal work into subcategories, such as self‐employed, family and nonfamily, and household work. The biggest potential for the development of informal economy comes from taxation, regulation, and self‐employment, followed by family work and unreported employment.

The ESR model accounts for selectivity bias associated with observed and unobserved factors. We find that agri‐value chain participation improves vegetable farmers' welfare. Participation significantly increases household income and consumption expenditure by about 22% and 40%, respectively. Our results also reveal that agri‐value chain participation is significantly determined by education, household size, mobile phone ownership, irrigation, farm size, farmer group membership, and extension visits.

The commercial success of gene‐editing technology depends on the public's acceptance of its foods. This study used data from a national survey of United States consumers to identify the determinants of consumer acceptance of gene‐edited foods and compared them with those of genetically modified foods. Our study shows that consumer awareness and knowledge of gene‐edited foods are almost half those of genetically modified foods. In the study, we classified survey respondents in three clusters based on their attitudes toward food technologies and corporate distrust: technology‐loving, neutral, and technology‐averse. The technology‐averse cluster has the greatest share of individuals who indicated being aware of and knowledgeable about gene‐edited foods, and the largest share of respondents who stated having negative views toward agricultural biotechnology. Technology‐loving individuals have more positive perceptions about agricultural biotechnology and are more likely to consume genetically modified and gene‐edited foods in the future than neutral and technology‐averse individuals. Findings indicate that providing information on the technology and its health and environmental benefits did not affect consumers' willingness to consume genetically modified and gene‐edited foods. Prior perceptions of agricultural biotechnology, beliefs about safety, benefits, labeling, and the type of technology developer are important determinants of anticipated future consumption of genetically modified and gene‐edited foods.

    "abstract": "Abstract Working capital management (WCM) is a critical matter for the growth of firms, especially small and medium‐sized manufacturing companies faced with liquidity shortages whose current assets account for a significant part of their investments. These characteristics describe most companies in the fish processing industry. Using a sample of more than 1050 European fish processing companies during the period 2013–2020 and applying dynamic panel data methods, this paper analyses the extent to which working capital investment and financing policies affect firm's sales growth. The empirical evidence reveals that the trade credit channel (i.e., accounts receivable and accounts payable) enhances sales growth, while the opposite effect is found for investment in inventories. Additionally, the findings insist on the importance of financing current assets with positive working capital to boost sales growth. [EconLit Citations: C23, G31, L25, L79, Q22].",

Using total assets as the measure of cooperative size, we present long-term, time-series data from seven of the largest regional agricultural cooperatives in Canada and the United States. We then examine the issue of growth from a theoretical perspective, integrating the literature on investor-oriented firm growth with the literature on cooperative growth. The empirical analysis that follows from the theoretical analysis suggests it is not possible to reject Gibrat's Law for six of the seven cooperatives; that is, that a cooperative's long-term growth rate is independent of its size. The empirical results also suggest the growth rate for the cooperatives in the sample is low, perhaps even zero. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The primary objective pertained to the impacts of federal promotion programs on the foreign demand for U.S. pecans. Based on previous literature, a single-equation framework was specified for estimation of the pecan model. Based on promotion elasticities, impacts on pecan export revenue from promotion were evaluated. The returns per dollar of promotion expenditure for pecans were $6.45 for Asia and $6.75 for the E.U. Further, some spill-over benefits for pecan exports were detected from almond export promotion in Asia and walnut export promotion in the E.U. It appears that the U.S. pecan industry can benefit substantially from increased export promotion in both Asia and the E.U. [L660, Q130, Q170]. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The model links individual consumer characteristics (e.g., income, knowledge about nutrition, nutrition label use) to underlying product characteristics (e.g., price, nutritional attributes) and allows us to obtain preference parameters for each consumer as well as demand elasticities with regard to product characteristics for each product considered. We find that prices, advertising, price reductions, and consumer preferences for taste have a significant effect on the demand for prepared frozen meals whereas concerns and knowledge about nutrition and health do not. Using the estimated demand parameters we then evaluate price competition in the industry and the impact of the new mandatory labeling policy. The results show that collusive pricing behavior by manufacturers is not supported by our data and that the 30% margins in the industry are due to the exercise of unilateral market power and differentiation strategies. The results also show that consumer preferences and purchasing patterns within prepared frozen meals category did not change significantly after the implementation of mandatory nutrition labeling.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a concept some marketers have employed to better understand the long-term profit potential of specific customers or groups of customers. CLV is the net present value of the cash flow stream a customer is expected to generate for a firm over time. In this study, the CLV concept was employed to better understand the profitability of customers in the rural petroleum market. Findings suggest that customers in this market vary dramatically in the level of profits they generate for a firm. In addition, customer retention is important in this market with small reductions in customer retention rates leading to large reductions in CLV. A framework and modeling approach is also developed that marketers in other agribusiness industries may find useful as they attempt to measure and use customer lifetime value. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

For example, a VaR of 1 million dollars at the 95% level of confidence implies that overall portfolio losses should not exceed 1 million dollars more than 5% of the time over a given holding period. This research examines the effectiveness of VaR measures, developed using alternative estimation techniques, in predicting large losses in the cattle‐feeding margin. Results show that several estimation techniques, both parametric and nonparametric, provide well‐calibrated estimates of VaR such that violations (losses exceeding the VaR estimate) are commensurate with the desired level of confidence. In particular, estimates developed using the RiskMetrics TM method appear robust for instruments that have linear payoff structures such as cash commodity prices. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Third, marketing research plays a specific role, as it provides the information and knowledge which marketing brings into its NPD roles. We show that use of marketing research is the most important determinant of higher NPD success in Thailand's food processing industry.

However, no researchers have yet analyzed or defined what is meant by retailer value. In this study, building on a solid theoretical background, we propose a definition of “retailer value.” Subsequently, this concept has been used in an empirical study of retail chains in Denmark and Germany. The study was designed as a means‐end chain approach to the buying of pork and fish products by retail buyers. The results revealed that it is possible to analyze the hierarchy between attributes, consequences, and values sought by retail buyers when buying for their companies, and to identify relevant differences across countries and products. These differences across the value maps are used to propose ideas for how manufacturers of pork and fish products can improve their marketing activities and thereby obtain competitive advantage.

This food scare, on the one hand, strongly affected consumers' attitude, making meat safety one of the most important issues of product quality for both consumers and retailers and, on the other hand, had important effects on the supply chain organization. The coming into force of the European Regulations (EC) No. 1760/2000 and No. 1825/2000 on beef labeling has partly led to a reshaping of the structure and organization of the Italian beef chain. The new relationships and contracts along the chain have been analyzed, and the strategies set up by the retailers to improve beef safety and quality and reinforce market segmentation have been discussed. The experience of the COOP Italia, the most important Italian large‐scale retailer, has been studied and discussed considering its chain organization and contract designing for beef products.

This paper presents a first attempt to estimate a demand system for selected brands of red tetra‐packaged, plastic packaged, and bag‐in‐box table wine using scanner data providing new and useful insights into the marketing of Italian wine. Price and expenditure elasticities of Italian red table wine demand drawn from a linear almost ideal demand system are provided. Results suggest a partially loyal market of table wine, showing a tendency to substitution across brands and a degree of competition among the leading brands.

Results based on a bivariate probit model of purchase propensity for GM sunflower oil and table potatoes show that consumers in Romania are generally opposed to GM food consumption, similar to consumers in Western Europe, but contrary to consumers in many developing nations. Purchase probabilities carry across GM foods, indicating homogeneity in consumer risk perceptions. Additionally, income levels and risk perceptions are the primary drivers of purchase decisions, whereas positive or beneficiary product attributes (e.g., health, environmental, economic) are currently not considered by consumers. Negative consumer risk perceptions of GM goods in Romania will likely make the implementation of these crops for economic development purposes difficult.

    "abstract": "Abstract The viability of introducing milk futures contracts in Brazil was assessed through a combination of multiple criteria decision analysis and the application of traditional principles from the theory of success and failure of futures trading. Commodity‐specific attributes and market‐related aspects were analyzed for chilled raw milk, ultra high temperature (UHT) milk, and milk powder. The analytic hierarchy process methodology was used to rank the commodities in terms of their feasibility prospects. Among them, it was ascertained that chilled raw milk is the most suitable for futures trading. Major reasons for this result are the product's high price volatility, the competitive nature of its markets, the absence of competing risk‐management tools, and the impossibility of cross‐hedging. Complementing the analysis, interviews were conducted with the 100 largest milk producers in the country to assess their perceptions regarding futures trading. Approximately 92% of these farmers expressed an interest in adopting milk futures contracts as price risk management tools. In conclusion, the analysis indicated that the introduction of a milk futures contract in Brazil has a high probability of success.

Count data models are developed to relate firm, market, and regulatory covariates to the number of FFN product lines firms have under development, on the market, and in total. Canadian firm‐level innovation data were taken from Statistics Canada (2003) Functional Food and Nutraceutical Survey. Firms involved in product development/scale‐up had more product lines in total and on the market. Firms with a strong and positive perception of the impact of regulatory reform related to generic health claims and harmonization of Canadian regulations with U.S. regulations had fewer product lines in total and on the market. Firms with more positive perceptions of the business impact of structure and function health claims had more product lines on the market. One implication of the study is the importance of developing policies and reforming regulations which better enable use of generic health claims on FFN products. Further, policies which better enable or foster development/scale‐up of product lines would increase the Canadian FFN sector's ability to develop new products.

Empirical testing of consumers' FAFH behavior reveals several interesting and important findings. Results show that negative attitudes toward FAFH reduced consumers' frequency of eating out, whereas the availability of healthy food, good service, and convenience in restaurants increased consumers' frequency of eating out.

Using a very simple discrete choice experimental design, the authors aim (a) to provide an example of consumer research implementation in food‐related NPD and to assess its marketing value, and (b) to evaluate the quality of the acquired consumer‐related information for marketing decision‐making in food consumer‐led NPD processes against a number of criteria set in the relevant literature. “Functionality” is found to be a statistically significant attribute for all three children's snacks of the research design compared to other attributes such as flavor and price. Parents seem to perceive the functional snack alternative as offering greater utility as compared to its conventional (i.e., nonfunctional) counterpart. Overall, the authors conclude that, despite some inherent weaknesses, the advantage of the discrete choice methodology in connection with consumer‐led food NPD lies in its ability to describe current consumer needs and desires realistically and to contribute to the optimization of existing products.

The method is used to compute price‐reaction functions that show how the prices of the different stages in a food supply chain dynamically respond to each other and whether or not these responses reveal any asymmetric patterns. Empirical applications for the U.S. pork‐meat and broiler‐composite chains illustrate the convenience of the method and reveal that in the pork chain asymmetric price transmission enables retailers (wholesalers) to increase their marketing margin vis‐à‐vis the wholesalers (farmers), whereas in the broiler sector the retailers face both temporary decreases and increases in their marketing margin as a consequence of asymmetric wholesale‐retail price transmission.",

A survey was administered to 566 consumers to elicit their desire for GM labeling of sugar and sugar in soft drinks. Results of a bivariate ordered probit model suggest that less conscientious individuals, males, and individuals who have a greater trust in food manufacturers and the government to ensure the safety of food are less likely to desire GM labeling. Cluster analysis further identified market segments of individuals based on their level of desire for GM labeling. Results are informative to policy makers and GM technology participants.

They can take two basic forms: consumers going to buy agricultural products at the farm (on‐farm sales) and farmers selling their products in urban areas. We investigate the territorial distribution of direct sales practices (on‐farm and off‐farm) in Piedmont (Italy) and we assess the main determinants of these choices via probit models, separately for on‐farm and off‐farm sales. The explanatory variables comprise structural characteristics of the farms, type of farming, characteristics of the operators and of their products, and the proximity to urban and commercial areas. The most important factor affecting these choices is the type of farming (TF). The effect of other variables differs according to the TF. Conditional on it, other significant variables are generally farm location, organic farming and, especially for on‐farm direct sales, the complementarity with agro‐tourism and recreational activities. Operators’ and farm characteristics are found to affect the choice of selling directly rather weakly. [EconLit citations: Q13, Q12, R12].",

Market power is found to reduce the likelihood of violation but not the degree of violation. Other factors such as traceability systems, adoption of risk control systems and industry standards, and the scale and scope of operations also impact food safety violations. Findings suggest that market power in China’s pork industry provides incentives for firms to mitigate risk and improve food safety.

Applying choice experiment method, we find significant preference for hub options with higher milk prices and payment for milk on a fortnight rather than cash basis. Farmers also prefer options that bundle milk marketing with input provision. For bundled inputs, farmers prefer hub options that allow payment for such inputs via credit or check‐off rather than cash. Our analyses also reveal significant heterogeneity in preference among farmers that should be considered in adapting dairy hubs to Tanzania. Emerging dairy hubs in Tanzania should be supported to either establish in‐house input provision arrangements or to enter contracts with agro‐input dealers in their environs.

Formal statistical tests are conducted based on Johansen's co‐integration, Granger causality and the Garbade‐Silber approach for the corn spot prices and futures prices. All empirical analysis is also performed for GMO and non‐GMO soybeans to provide a contrast with the corn futures market. The results suggest that Chinese corn futures prices guide the spot prices; that is, the corn futures market can serve as legitimate guide for future cash prices. This conclusion is valid for GMO futures market, but is not found to be the case for non‐GMO soybeans, where spot prices guide futures prices.",

The driving force for this policy is the need to ensure consumers' freedom of choice. The aim of this study is to analyze whether preference heterogeneity for a GM and an organic variant of the same product exists among German consumers. The analysis is based on a survey conducted in spring 2007 in Germany. The specified mixed‐logit and latent class model show significant preference heterogeneity for both production technologies. We found one consumer segment with opposing preferences for GM and organic products and a second one exhibiting positive preferences for GM and organic products. The consumers in the second segment are possibly those who would most benefit from the EU co‐existence strategy and would probably be willing to cover the additional costs associated with a co‐existence strategy in the existing food value chains (D12).

Yet less is known about the extent to which consumers may purchase GM food products given suitable price positioning and marketing information on nonprice attributes of the products. In this study, we examine consumer acceptance of GM late blight resistant potatoes in Ireland. Our analysis uses an experimental auction methodology that facilitates positive and negative bids to provide a more complete revelation of preferences. Results show that a majority of participants preferred conventional potatoes to GM potatoes. Favorable information about GM increased subjects’ valuations of GM potatoes. After being informed about potential economic and health benefits, up to two‐thirds of our subjects indicated that they would choose GM potatoes at a 20% price discount, while 14% of subjects would still reject GM potatoes at any price. Higher levels of education, greater familiarity with GM, and the presence of children in the household were associated with lower valuation of the GM product. [EconLit citations: C91; D12].",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT During the last several years, wheat‐pasta chains have been affected by Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms in the durum wheat sector that have progressively reduced government intervention in the market. Specifically, the mid‐term reform, implemented in 2005, represented a deep change in the tools applied in the CAP, with a change from coupled income support to a single decoupled aid where farmers’ incomes are directly supported and are no longer linked to levels or types of production. We hypothesize that price transmission along the wheat‐pasta supply chain has been affected by CAP reform and other events through greater price volatility for durum wheat and market power exerted by some firms along the supply chain. For the present study, we are particularly interested in examining whether and how CAP reform has altered price transmission in the Italian wheat‐pasta chain, from farmer to retailer, including the wholesale stage. We employ the Kinnucan and Forker model, which provides a convenient instrument for analyzing the impact of policy intervention, and adapted its structure to the characteristics and the composition of the pasta supply chain by introducing an intermediate level (wholesale price), represented by semolina producers. The results suggest that pricing behavior has changed after CAP Reform introduction. [EconLit citations: Q110; Q130; L110].",

However, additional personal guidance does not support the intended goal of reducing the application of either fertilizer or pesticide. This study also detects technology diffusion effect in that farmers who are not offered education but are in the same village where the education programs are offered are more likely to change their behavior.

A combination of two successive CEs are designed with focus on consumers’ demand for the attributes of baby milk formula in China, where the first CE includes the full set of attributes and the second excludes consumers’ self‐reported nonattended attributes in the first CE. Significant discrepancies are detected for both WTPs for an individual attribute and the total WTPs (the sum of all WTPs for individual attributes in each CE), and in most cases WTPs decrease as a result of excluding the ignored attributes. Changes in WTP are mainly driven by the variation of choice task complexity. However, there is no significant difference in the influence of excluding nonattended attributes on the WTPs for the same attended attribute in different subsamples. In addition, we also find that consumers in China have significantly higher but dispersed WTP values for imported (11.6–47.0%), organic (6.9–52.5%), and probiotics (7.3–35.5%) and sugar‐free (5.9–26.0%) attributes for baby milk formula.

The control treatment is a typical DCE questionnaire survey. Treatment 1 is identical to the control except that respondents are asked to taste the buns before answering the questionnaire. In Treatment 2, respondents are also given the tasting experience but they additionally observe their peers' taste preferences for the buns. The results suggest that tasting experience is important since Treatment 1 obtains significantly higher WTP estimates than the control. However, allowing additionally for peer effects in Treatment 2 significantly reduces the WTP estimates again countering the effect of tasting in Treatment 1.

Using a nested constant elasticity of substitution production function, finance has an indirect influence on productivity through its effect on capital augmenting‐technological change and depends on the elasticity of substitution between equity and debt, as well as on the quantity and price of external finance and net value added. We develop and test a theoretical model using Farm Accountancy Data Network regional data covering all EU Member States and different subsamples by EU regions, size of farms, and farm types. In the 2004–2018 period, land, labor, and capital complemented each other but had a decreasing or stagnating productivity, reaffirming the importance of external finance to improve productivity. Results suggest that external finance and productivity follow an inverted U‐shaped curve, with a positive impact on less capitalized farms with lower debt‐to‐equity ratios, while capital‐intensive farms are not benefiting from excess finance. Rethinking the general assumption that agricultural growth has a positive and linear effect with access to credit lead to different strategies in the use of external finance.

Using a participatory Bayesian network, we aimed to identify and assess the farm, farmer, and environmental characteristics that explain and predict investment strategies. The variable policy uncertainty is modeled as a multidimensional concept that is a function of objective and subjective variables. We found that the most important variables influencing investment timing are succession, risk attitude, perceived policy uncertainty, and earning capacity. The insights derived from this study are useful for policy advisors, finance providers, farm advisors, and also farmers themselves to enhance their understanding of why and when farm investments are likely to occur despite the high level of policy uncertainty.

Food companies' productivity dynamics can be driven by intangible assets, financing, economies of scale, lifecycle, and technological convergence. We confront this by studying productivity drivers for detailed food manufacturing industries using cross‐country firm‐level panel data. The results show that intangible assets nonlinearly and heterogeneously affect productivity growth, and countries with fewer product market regulations demonstrate higher productivity benefits from asset intangibility. Intangible assets do not play a major role for start‐up companies, while technological convergence drives productivity growth as they learn new technology in the food markets. Regarding the industrial differences, the bakery sector benefits the most from asset intangibility because of its brand images. Financing is particularly important for the meat/fish and dairy sectors, where capital equipment is necessary, and leverage effects are larger for countries with more access to financial institutions. Economies of scale are a vital productivity enhancer in the grain and starch sector for lowering fixed costs. Industrial policies to (i) raise the quality of intangible assets, (ii) promote financial access, and (iii) utilize scale economies are critical for improving the productivity of food manufacturers [EconLit Citations: D24, G32, L66, O34].",

However, the average vegetable consumption among Chinese rural residents does not meet the minimum intake (300 g/adult person/day) recommended by the Chinese Dietary Guidelines. Homestead gardening—defined as growing vegetables or other food for home consumption, usually in the backyard of the household or on collectively allocated garden land—can play a significant role in promoting vegetable consumption in rural areas of developing countries. But empirical evidence on the effects of homestead gardening in China is scarce. This paper sheds new insights on the impacts of homestead gardening on rural households' vegetable consumption. We employ the three‐stage procedure instrumental variables methods to disentangle the endogeneity of the homestead garden variable and propensity score matching for robustness check. The results show that homestead gardening increases vegetable consumption by 12.7% on average. Further heterogeneous analysis shows that homestead gardening has a larger effect on those groups with vegetable intake levels in the middle of the distribution. The impact of homestead gardening was strongest for the consumption of dark‐colored vegetables. Our results can provide new perspectives for future rural planning, dietary and nutritional health transformation, and precision policy formulation. [EconLit Citations: Q1, D1, Q13].",

However, the extent to which CSA practices contribute to smallholder food security and dietary diversity remains unclear. In this study, we use panel and nationally representative data from Tanzania to examine the association between two climate‐smart agricultural practices, namely, improved maize varieties and maize‐legume intercropping, and food security in smallholder farm households. We use maize yield per acre, adult‐equivalent food expenditure, and household dietary diversity scores to measure household food security, representing three of the four food security pillars: availability, access, and utilization. We also examine the complementarity and potential advantages of combining improved maize seeds with fertilizers. Using standard panel data estimation approaches, we find a positive association between the adoption of improved maize varieties and maize‐legume intercropping and an increase in food production measured through higher crop productivity. However, we do not find a corresponding improvement in household dietary diversity or increased food expenditure, despite the higher crop production. Several factors might explain this outcome, including the challenges faced by farmers in accessing markets to sell surplus produce, the influence of established dietary habits, gender issues, and other local factors that promote the consumption of cereal‐based foods such as maize. Our findings suggest that CSA practices may help improve food production and availability, but more effort is needed to translate increased food production into improved dietary diversity and better food security among smallholder farmers in sub‐Saharan Africa.

Consumption functions are estimated for white and red meats and dairy products and used to make projections to the year 2002. Consumption projections are next compared with likely developments in domestic production of livestock products. It is concluded that increased volumes of red meat imports will be required, that increased demand for white meat imports will be partially satisfied from within the region, and that all study countries will require increased dairy product imports.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the exercise of market power in vertical marketing channels in a more general and novel fashion than prior research. Neoclassical models arising from the work of Adam Smith, George Stigler, Harold Demsetz, and John Spengler are presented in juxtaposition to the more commonly advanced agency theoretic explanation of vertical organization and performance. The paper develops a structural model of price transmission in a channel that has differentiated product oligopolies at two stages. Increasing concentration at successive stages creates a problem of double marginalization. Vertical trading partners reduce it by avoiding vertical Nash (arms length) pricing via the use of trade promotions and other coordination methods such as private label. Finally, the rise in retail buyer concentration, six supermarket chains now control 52.6% of supermarket sales in the U.S., portends a possible shift to the European model wherein food retailers develop and promote their own brands.

Results of the analysis suggest concurrence with scientific and industry claims about the environmental qualities of these technologies. Herbicide treatments on herbicide-resistant acreage were, on average, less than on other acreage, with more of the treatments in post-emergent applications. The mean value of insecticide treatments for target pests on Bt cotton acreage was reduced relative to other acreage with these pest problems. However, mean costs and mean yields on acreage planted in GM seed relative to other acreage did not indicate a cost advantage, or disadvantage, for the GM seed technologies. Additional research is needed to determine whether these suggested relationships hold when critical variables within aggregated groups are tested for their independent influence.

    "abstract": "Abstract The successful introduction of futures contracts to industries unfamiliar with futures markets is likely to become increasingly important as futures exchanges move to alternative governance structures (e.g., for‐profit corporations), trading platforms evolve (i.e., electronic/Internet trading), and regulatory requirements relax. Here, we examine the performance of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange's white shrimp futures contract, one of the first futures contracts aimed at the aquaculture industry. Although the market structure largely conforms to the traditional criteria for a successful futures market, the contract's performance is disappointing in terms of liquidity, basis behavior, and ultimately, hedging effectiveness. Furthermore, nonpar‐size delivery options embedded in the contract design likely impact basis behavior for certain hedges. While these reasons contributed to the ultimate demise of the contract, a general lack of knowledge regarding futures markets among the shrimp industry was also a factor. Given these findings, pragmatic implications for the introduction and marketing of new futures contracts into new industries are discussed.

Consumers, however, may reject pale cuts of veal labeled as “grain‐fed.” This article uses questionnaire data from six groceries in the province of Quebec, Canada, to investigate frequency of veal purchases and perceived importance of price, color, and production type as determinants of veal purchases. Consumers do not appear to have clear preferences for milk‐fed veal characteristics. Frequency of consumption and importance of veal meat attributes were influenced more by variables of habit formation than by price, income, or education. The veal industry might be advised to encourage consumption of veal as a means to diversify consumers' meat menu. [Econ‐Lit citations: D120, Q130] © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Using quarterly data from 1976 to 2000, a linearized Almost Ideal Demand System was estimated for beef, pork, poultry, and fish. Simulation results indicate that the increased food health concerns for fat and cholesterol have resulted in a 6% reduction in the consumption of beef per capita per quarter since 1987, and an 18% increase in the poultry consumption. The results also indicate that there is a significant negative spill‐over effect of beef advertising on pork consumption and vice versa. However, a positive spill‐over effect of pork advertising on poultry consumption is also identified. [Econlit citations: D120, Q110, Q130]. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness statistics resulting from this analysis are reported. Second, based on follow-up discussions, this article reports on whether the recommended hedging strategies were adopted, how they were applied, the difficulties in implementing these strategies, and differences between managerial and academic perceptions of hedging strategies.

The potential, upper‐bound volume of marketed StarLink‐commingled corn from the 2000 crop located near wet and dry millers prior to October 1, 2000, is estimated at 124 million bushels. The percentage of corn shipments that tested positive mostly ranged from 5 to 10%, varying by mode of transportation. Price differentials between StarLink‐commingled and StarLink‐free corn commonly ranged between 7 and 12 cents per bushel during the early stage of the incident. These differentials eroded quickly due largely to Aventis' compensation of additional transportation costs when StarLink‐commingled shipments had to be rerouted to approved uses. While StarLink had a negative impact on U.S. corn exports, most of the reductions in exports to Japan and South Korea during the period from November 2000 through March 2002 were due to increased competition from rival exporters.

For example, Gulf soybean shocks, which reflect unexpected increases in soybean export demand, are simultaneously transmitted to internal markets, and result in correspondingly higher Arkansas Delta basis levels. Domestic market disturbances such as crush margin and financial storage cost shocks are found to immediately affect barge rates and to subsequently impact both Gulf and internal basis levels.

This paper aims to identify the determinants of the wine brokers' use. We use a transaction cost approach and we hypothesize that buyers and sellers use brokers because they may reduce costs associated with transactions on bulk wine. A database of contracts on bulk vins de table and vins de pays is used to estimate a logistic regression of the probability of “broker intervention.” We show that if the sellers do not belong to a cooperative production structure and if the buyers do not belong to the productive sphere it increases the recourse to brokers. Also, the extent of the production area and the potential quality variance among wine growers and the size of the contract positively influence the use of brokers.

Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is one system for evaluating which hazards need to be controlled and where in the production process they can be controlled. Firms may choose among many competing technologies that differ in cost and effectiveness at controlling pathogen growth. To evaluate a firm's pathogen control options, a probabilistic risk analysis model based on typical slaughterhouse practices is linked to a decision model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of seven combinations of pathogen‐reducing technologies. The likely comparative advantage of different strategies for large vs. small slaughterhouses is examined. Risk is compared for two cases with the same mean risk to illustrate the importance of correct model specification. The report concludes with a discussion of the institutional barriers and incomplete markets that affect the adoption and development of more effective pathogen reduction technologies.

This study aims to analyze the consumer cognitive structure for a functional food using a means–end chain approach, through the association pattern technique (APT). A further objective is to verify whether consumer cognitive structures vary with household structure (children vs. no children), as reported in the literature on new product acceptance. The results reveal a higher degree of abstraction in the cognitive structure of households with children, incorporating more values in the means–end chains. In line with other research approaches, our study also confirms the stronger confidence‐seeking tendency typically associated with the cognitive structure of this type of household.

The demand for French wines became more price inelastic in the latter period while the demand for other European wines became price elastic. If the UK government is concerned with decreasing alcohol consumption, an increase in the wine excise tax would lead to a relatively larger decrease in imports from Italy, Portugal, and Spain.

Studying the role of brands in this market is particularly interesting given the introduction of several patented or so‐called managed apple varieties. We run an experiment to measure consumer response to a suite of apple varieties; treatments employ different branding strategies using different names for a new managed variety included in the experiment. Results suggest that the name does influence consumer valuation of the new variety and existing managed varieties, but has little impact on the willingness to pay for traditional apple varieties.",

Using survey data from New York food processors, an ordered logit analysis reveals that firm growth is related to important upstream and downstream market condiations. The clustering of similar manufacturers was found to have important effects on firm revenue growth, with the benefits of firm clustering increasing significantly with the level of local urbanization. For these reasons, policies that promote intra‐industry or cross‐industry collaboration would likely benefit food manufacturers, but these benefits would not be limited to firms in close geographic proximity to one another. Moreover, in rural areas especially, manufacturing firms and community planners need to be aware of possible negative effects of competition from growing concentrations of firms so that these issues can be addressed before local business growth is adversely affected.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In green marketing, the motivations for purchasing environmentally friendly products are often elusive, e.g., altruism mixed with some egoism, or a mixed‐up means and ends. The purpose of this study was to apply the means–end‐chain framework to build a model for the different motivations that consumers would have in favor of organic cotton products in Taiwan. Three hierarchical levels of means–end were included in the framework for organic cotton products: product attributes, consequences of using products possessing certain attributes, and fulfillment of personal values achieved through positive consequences after using the organic product possessing certain attributes. A survey questionnaire was designed based on product attributes and consequences identified from the Kahle, Beatty, and Homer's List of Values (LOVs; 1986) for respondents to rate their importance on a 5‐point Likert scale. The LOVs included nine values of common purchasing motivations, such as sense of belonging, excitement, and warm relationship with others, etc. For the 399 usable cases, fuzzy logic association mining rules were applied. The findings indicated that there were four significant routes by which respondents could achieve the personal value of security. However, knowing respondents’ personal value of security as the ultimate motivation for favoring organic cotton is only part of the picture. Only through a full understanding of different paths that lead to security can firms effectively design communication strategies to reach potential consumers.

Although the existing research has widely used the stochastic frontier methodology and the data envelopment analysis nonparametric approach to assess farming performance, the use of the local maximum likelihood (LML) approach proposed by Kumbhakar et al. is scarce. This study represents the first analysis that compares the efficiency levels of organic and conventional farms in Egypt. To do so, we apply LML methods to cross‐sectional, farm‐level data collected from a sample of 60 Egyptian farms. Results suggest that performance of organic farmers is slightly better than performance of their conventional counterparts. Further, we find a positive relationship between technical efficiency and farm size. [ EconLit citations: C14, Q12, D24].",

This study examines whether pricing these goods as a function of firm advertising investment and firm reputation depends on a collective, versus noncollective, brand strategy. The central assumption of this article is that a collective brand can increase perceived differentiation among the individual brands associated with it, and thus, that collective brand membership can moderate the effects of firm advertising investment and firm reputation on product price. The results obtained from a panel of companies in an experience‐goods industry (i.e., wineries) between 1999 and 2013 show that the relative effect of collective brand membership on product price is higher when the company has higher advertising investment and a higher reputation.

Many producers in the northern United States are attracted to aquaponics for its potential to produce indoors year‐round. However, little is known about consumer preferences for products grown in aquaponic systems. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an experimental auction to measure the impact of information about production method on consumers’ willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) for lettuce. For most participants, WTP was similar for both aquaponic and soil grown lettuce with overall average bids of $1.47 per 8 ounces and $1.48 per 8 ounces, respectively. Learning how samples were grown (either aquaponic or soil‐grown) rarely changed bids significantly, although on average, participants with environmental group membership lowered their bids for aquaponic lettuce samples. In general, higher frequency shoppers expressed higher average WTP for all types of lettuce. [Q100 Agriculture: General, Q220 Renewable Resources and Conservation: Fishery; Aquaculture]",

Beef price was negatively associated with restaurant adoption of TCB. Restaurants that were located in a city, located in the eastern region of Tennessee, offered local foods, and had a higher percentage of adults as clientele were more likely to purchase TCB ground beef. A restaurant's decision to offer TCB sirloin steak was positively associated with locations in Middle Tennessee, if the restaurant offered local foods, and if managers placed importance on sustainability.

The intention of the programs is to increase consumer demand for locally grown foods. However, the benefits of such programs are likely to be reduced when multiple states simultaneously market their own local foods. To investigate this issue, we conducted a survey of 6,900 consumers residing in an eight‐state contiguous region. We find that preferences are heterogeneous when neighboring state‐branded products are available, and some consumers will instead buy products from other states. The results suggest caution in estimating the policy impacts of state branding programs without considering how neighboring states react.",

The downward trend coincides with increased competition in the dairy industry and with the growing market share of the formal sector at the expense of the informal sector.

Given the numerous attributes that can be present in a product, characterizing those leading to a higher premium can help manufacturers to engage in profitable product formulation. This paper investigates the role played by health and nonhealth‐related attributes on yogurt prices in the United States, both at the national level and in different geographic markets, by means of a large scanner database of yogurt sales and a hedonic price model. The findings indicate that health‐related attributes more commonly associated with yogurts such as the presence of probiotics, specific health claims, and other credence attributes (i.e., organic and “natural”) are valued positively while others, which may lead to lower product acceptance (e.g., fibers, Omega‐3) are not. Nonhealth‐related features, such as “for kids” and Greek‐style, show a positive market value, thus helping in product differentiation. The magnitude of the implicit price of most product attributes is found to vary across markets, hinting that food manufacturers should consider market‐specific product formulation strategies to achieve product differentiation more effectively.",

We find significant differences between these firms, with slower adjustment rates for current and debt ratios in cooperatives. These findings may arise from the weakness associated with ownership structure in cooperatives, which reduces their adjustment processes compared to those of IOFs. The identification of differences in adjustment processes between cooperatives and IOFs may provide us with additional information regarding the specific management characteristics of these agri‐food firms, thus identifying those firms that are most dependent on external market conditions.

The purpose of this paper is to gain a more in‐depth understanding of the strategies used by those farmers to manage these risks by analysing portfolio strategies in marketing methods and in production decisions. The findings show that three main categories of marketing methods can be adopted in different proportions: forward contracts, average price contracts and spot market selling. A hundred farmers are surveyed in South‐West France. An empirical analysis of the determinants of their marketing methods show that risk perceptions and the farmer's level of education influence the choice to sign a preharvest contract for part of their production. In addition, agricultural diversification is negatively correlated with the choice to use forward contracts to hedge against market risk. [EconLit citations: Q13, L24, C24].",

Our findings indicate that ornamental plants are predominantly price‐elastic with foliage plants being more price‐responsive vis‐a‐vis other plant categories. Further, a majority of plants are expenditure‐elastic with the estimates of foliage plants manifesting the greatest variability. Finally, plants in the same category appear to be closer substitutes.

The empirical application uses primary data collected by the authority in charge of the monitoring and repression of fraud in food value chains between the years 2007 and 2015. This is a unique dataset to analyze the issue, although it includes only data on food fraud within the country. The results of the SAM simulations show that the share of economy directly and indirectly linked to the supply of irregular food products accounts for 0.5% of the total value of output and is able to activate up to 156 thousand labor units. The net impact of food fraud on output and employment in the whole economy is negative, with losses averaging up to 1.8 billion euros of output and of 20,000 jobs per year, with a relative impact significantly larger in agriculture than in the food industry. These figures reveal an intrinsic fragility of the agri‐food system, especially in those subsectors featuring relatively large price elasticities such as quality products (e.g., wine, olive oil, cheese). The overall conclusion is that food fraud is not only a source of unfair competition to regular production activities but also has an overall contractionary impact on the whole economy due to its directly unproductive rent‐seeking nature.

Mitigating food stigma during the pandemic is vital for consumption replenishment and economic recovery and helping the stigmatized people. We conduct an empirical study to examine consumer behaviors using Wuhan hot instant noodles (WHINs), a packaged version of the famous Chinese dish reganmian , as a case study. Although WHIN's name and origin signify Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic, the noodles could be actually produced elsewhere, but since the COVID‐19 outbreak, WHIN has been avoided. On the basis of our results, we find that providing scientific information about the irrelevance between WHIN and the coronavirus is not effective in changing the minds of people with stigma. Moreover, stigma is more emotional than rational, especially among people with a lower self‐identified social class and poor psychological state. Therefore, psychological intervention programs may be warranted during pandemics to avoid potential stigmatization. The findings of this study could help to resolve the stigma affecting regional agriculture and the food economy. [EconLit citations: Q11, Q13].",

    "abstract": "Abstract New breeding techniques (NBTs) for genetically modified (GM) crops, such as CRISPR/Cas9, could represent a valuable solution for achieving a sustainable agricultural system. This study examines Italian farmers' attitudes toward CRISPR/Cas9‐modified blast‐resistant rice in a hypothetical context. It is one of the first studies to investigate farmers' attitudes toward NBTs. Additionally, it explores the role of sociodemographics, farm characteristics, knowledge, perceived risks, and the locus of control (LOC) in shaping attitudes toward CRISPR/Cas9‐modified rice. The results show that farmers are open to this innovation and will cultivate CRISPR/Cas9‐modified rice if it is available in the market. Moreover, we find subjective knowledge, practice experience, and low perceived risk in the agri‐food business to be positively associated with attitudes toward CRISPR/Cas9‐modified blast‐resistant rice. Notably, LOC is found to be inversely related to attitude, indicating that having an external LOC improves attitudes toward CRISPR/Cas9‐modified rice. The findings suggest that farmers are generally favorable to the introduction of CRISPR/Cas9 technology; thus, a revision of the current European Union policies on GM crops could meet their needs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Animal‐source foods (ASF) are an important source of nutrients in many developing countries. However, there is limited information on the demand for ASF and the factors influencing their consumption. This study assessed spatial and temporal patterns of ASF consumption in Tanzania using data from a nationally representative household survey. Price and expenditure elasticities of ASF demand were estimated by applying a censored Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model. Results showed a 30% increase in weekly household expenditure on ASF from USD 3.02 in 2008 to USD 3.94 in 2014. The likelihood of a household purchasing ASF was 4.5 percentage points higher in urban compared to rural areas. With the exception of dried fish, the expenditure elasticity of ASF demand was positive and statistically significant. Expenditure and own‐price elasticities were largest for chicken and lowest for dried fish. The responsiveness of ASF demand to own‐price changes was higher in rural than urban areas in all cases. The findings imply that public policies that either raise household incomes or lower ASF prices have the potential to increase the consumption of ASF and consequently improve food and nutrition security in Tanzania.

    "abstract": "Abstract Access to credit is a key prerequisite for the development of smallholder agriculture. However, rural credit markets are typically characterized by market failures and smallholder credit access is limited. Resource‐providing contracts are an institutional tool to overcome credit market failures through the provision of production inputs in the form of in‐kind credit. Previous research has shown that interlinkage of contract and credit helps farmers overcome financial constraints, foster production investments, and hence increase productivities and income. However, if and how such contract schemes affect farmers' overall demand for and access to formal credit from other sources is not yet well understood. In this article, we therefore investigate the associations of the provision of in‐kind credit and farming households' formal credit demand and ability to receive formal credit. We use data of 463 oil palm producers in Ghana and show that participation in contract farming is associated with an increase in credit demand. Concerning credit approval, we find that the outstanding debt of the in‐kind credit scheme is associated with a substantially lower likelihood of credit acceptance. However, the results also suggest that farmers can fully compensate this negative effect by informing the bank about the contract, and thus the source of the debt. This indicates that debt acquired from resource‐providing contract schemes does not necessarily pose an additional credit constraint to farmers. [EconLit Citation G21, G23, O16, O17].",

Considering several coronavirus transmission incidents related to aquatic products and the location of wild freshwater fish in aquatic consumption in China, the effects of COVID‐19 on the purchase intention of wild freshwater fish was investigated. Based on 1163 online questionnaires from eight provinces (including two province‐level municipalities) in the Yangtze River Basin, ordered logistic regression was carried out to analyze the influencing factors of purchase intention of wild freshwater fish during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The empirical results indicated that the COVID‐19 pandemic had changed consumers' perceived risk and purchase frequency of wild freshwater fish. External stimulus caused by the COVID‐19 pandemic had little influence on perceived risk and purchase intention. Consumer preference had a significant impact on perceived risk and purchase intention. Therefore, efforts should be put to strengthen the popularization of aquatic product knowledge, guide the public to develop scientific and civic eating habits, and improve the traceability system of aquatic products.

The use of technologies to automate production processes is one means to address labor challenges. This study investigates ornamental nursery industry firms' current use of specific automation technologies, including granular fertilizer applicators, foliage pruners, irrigation scheduling, and trikes. Additionally, this study evaluates the correlation between perceived barriers of adoption, firm characteristics, and the US nursery industry's likelihood of adopting automated technologies. A mixed‐mode survey was used to elicit responses from firms. Overall, barriers to adoption include the costs associated with the initial purchase and installation costs. Several firm characteristics and actions to address labor issues are correlated with the use of the automated technologies evaluated in this study. We observed both positive and negative associations between actions to address labor issues and adoption of specific technologies that suggest that decisions are complicated by the firms' production needs, strategies, perceived benefits, and potential return‐on‐investment of the various automation and mechanization. Perceived improvements in product quality from adopting automation technologies are positively correlated with the likelihood of adopting all of the technologies evaluated.

    "abstract": "Abstract Farmers across the world have been using antibiotics in poultry production for both therapeutic and nontherapeutic purposes since the mid 1900s. The literature on antibiotic diffusion and intensification is largely focused on developed countries in North America and Western Europe. There is some literature on Asia where the emphasis has shifted from antibiotic diffusion to concerns about antimicrobial resistance due to excessive use of antibiotics. Although there is evidence of farming intensification across sub‐Saharan Africa, few studies have looked at antibiotic use among livestock farmers. We fill this gap by studying antibiotic use over farm size and regions in Nigerian poultry farming. We find that antibiotic use for nontherapeutic purposes is rapidly expanding among small farms (already over 60% for those with 50–100 birds) and widespread among medium and large chicken farmers (75%–95%) across both richer and poorer regions of Nigeria. While large farmers are more likely to adopt antibiotics, their indiscriminate use is more evident among small farmers. Further, our results reveal that information dissemination through social networks and extension services could play a crucial role in the efficient use of antibiotics. This suggests a need to promote awareness regarding excessive use of antibiotics, particularly in the absence of regulation in Nigeria and other developing countries.

Accounting for selection bias, we show that SSC participation significantly decreased the comparable TE of cucumber production but accelerated TC. The disaggregated analysis reveals that the comparable TE for SSC participants was generally smaller than that for nonparticipants. Furthermore, comparable TE for nonparticipants consistently increased year‐over‐year, whereas, for SSC participants, it increased during some years and decreased during others.

Changes in income, increased information about taste, protein and minerals, fat, revocation of the USDA grass‐fed certification program in 2016 and COVID‐19 pandemic, also affected premiums for several individual cuts.

It applies the random effects model and augments the standard specification of FDI determinants with a set of factors related to the agricultural sector performance, hypothesized to be essential from the perspective of supply chain linkages and access to raw materials. The results indicate that well‐performing and well‐capitalized agricultural sector of the host country is a key factor associated with the choice of investment location by foreign investors, especially those from the Global North. Capital investment in agriculture, as proxied by agricultural gross fixed capital formation and net capital stock, is particularly important. Public investment in agriculture, in the form of government expenditure and official development assistance, is also associated with higher FDI. These factors, however, are not significant in case of the least developed countries where only market potential appears to matter for foreign investors. The results suggest that complementarities may exist between different types of investments and that policy‐makers willing to attract food and beverages FDI should prioritize agricultural sector development.

This study estimates the impact of GlobalGAP adoption on net incomes earned by small‐scale pineapple farmers in Ghana's main producing region, and examines size‐induced heterogeneous effects of adoption on income. Household and farm‐level data gathered from 546 small‐scale farmers were analyzed using a two‐stage regression model to estimate the impact of GlobalGAP adoption on per hectare pineapple net income. Robustness of the results was checked by re‐estimating the two‐stage model using a maximum likelihood extended regression model. GlobalGAP adoption reduced net income on small farms growing less than 1 ha of pineapples, but increased net income on small farms growing more than 1 ha of pineapples. We conclude that GlobalGAP adoption and farm size are not independent determinants of profitability, and recommend that extension and other interventions intended to promote GlobalGAP adoption among pineapple farmers in Ghana should be targeted at those who are willing and able to grow more than 1 ha of pineapples [EconLit Citations: Q16, Q13].",

This paper contributes to reducing this gap by carrying out an empirical study of 10 types of farming in Spain based on a dynamic panel model with microeconomic data from a large sample of farms provided by the Spanish Farm Accountancy Data Network. The generalized method of moments system estimator is used to assess profit persistence, including all significant lagged profit rates explaining the adjustment of abnormal profits over time. Moreover, the dynamic of farms' economic performance is analyzed considering the return on assets as a dependent variable (i.e., measuring farms' profitability), as well as an alternative indicator that also accounts for opportunity costs (i.e., measuring farms' viability). The results show that profit and viability persistence in the farming sector are complex dynamic processes that depend on several lags of the aforementioned dependent variables (between 2 and 5 years), with high abnormal profit and viability persistence being widespread. In any case, heterogeneous persistence results are achieved depending on the type of farming. The differences found can be explained by disparities in several explanatory variables contributing to above‐ or below‐average performance. The conclusions reached could lead to sounder decision‐making regarding agricultural policy (i.e., farm subsidies) and competition policy (i.e., exceptions to competition law).

Based on panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2007 to 2021, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of digital transformation on food security using fixed effects model, mediation model, moderation model, and spatial Durbin model. The research results show that: (1) digital transformation has a promoting effect on the level of food security, and there is regional heterogeneity in this promoting effect; (2) digital transformation has a mediating effect on the level of food security, which can improve the level of food security by promoting technological innovation, agricultural scale management, and marketization levels; (3) environmental regulations play a positive moderating role in the process of digital transformation promoting the level of food security; (4) there is a spatial spillover effect of digital transformation on the level of food security, which has a positive spillover effect on surrounding areas. Therefore, moving forward, it is imperative that we prioritize the digital transformation of the entire food industry chain, promote the coordinated development of digital industries in various regions, further improve the R&amp;D innovation capability of digital technology, promote the integration of farmland to achieve large‐scale agricultural operation, and enhance the level of marketization, and at the same time improve environmental monitoring standards, fully tap the promoting effect of digital transformation on regional food security level.

However, the balance between sustainability and agricultural productivity, a central concern for policy makers in developing countries, has not been sufficiently addressed. In this paper, I evaluate farmers’ fertilization practices and their effect on yield using unique plot level data from India. I estimate quadratic crop response functions for different crops and cropping systems. To address endogenous input choices, I use input prices and cost shifters from the fertilizer industry as instrumental variables for the fertilization practice. I find that a large share of Indian cultivators overuse nitrogen relative to the other two nutrients, and could benefit from simply reducing the amount of nitrogen used while keeping the other nutrients fixed. This suggests a potential win‐win situation where both productivity and sustainability can be improved by changing fertilizer application. The widespread “nitrogen‐only” fertilization pattern is rejected as optimal in most cases. [EconLit Citations: Q12, Q15, Q16, E23, C26, C14].",

The current paper decomposes the approximating Bennet indicator, which results in determinate components of technical change, technical efficiency change, scale efficiency change and mix efficiency change that are always feasible. The application focuses on the German dairy‐processing sector, an important postfarm supply chain actor. We compute 558 growth rates for the period 2011–2020. The results show that the LHM‐approximating Bennet indicator decreases by on average 1.14% p.a., with substantial annual fluctuations. The underlying components of output‐ and input‐oriented technical change also fluctuate substantially, and often conflict. Moreover, output‐ and input‐oriented TFP efficiency change fluctuate moderately on average, which is mainly driven by scale efficiency change and mix efficiency change. The components of technical efficiency change remain relatively stable on average. Indeterminateness is a relevant problem when decomposing the original LHM indicator for the current sample: depending on the specification, the proportion of infeasibilities when decomposing the original LHM indicator ranges between 6.09% and 15.95%. Our proposed determinate decomposition is thus a valuable complement. [EconLit Citations: D24, D25, Q13].",

We estimate the asymmetries in price transmission using the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags model and found the asymmetry in both magnitude and speed in the case of wholesale–retail chain of Onion and Potato, asymmetry in magnitude in wholesale–retail chain of Tomato, and asymmetry in speed in farm–wholesale chain of Potato. The results of asymmetric coefficient, long‐run elasticity of price transmission, speed of adjustment and implied half‐life of disequilibrium indicated that farm–wholesale chain is more efficient than wholesale–retail chain. Further, market chains of Onion and Tomato are more efficient than Potato chains. The magnitude of the adjustment was found to be larger for the long‐run positive shock in wholesale–retail market chain of Onion, Potato and Tomato, and it concluded that retailers enjoy an advantage over wholesalers as well as farmers.

In this article, we use barcode‐level nutrition and sales data on the near‐universe of all packaged food products in the United States over 2007–2015 to investigate whether food manufacturers have reduced added sugar in their product offerings and whether these reformulations have played a role on consumers' sugar intake. We find that reformulation efforts would have reduced sugar intake by 52.8% between 2007 and 2015 had households' shopping baskets in 2015 remained the same as in 2007. However, consumers' purchases have gravitated toward more sugary products over time, thereby negating more than twothirds of the reduction in sugar intake that reformulation could have brought about. As a result, sugar intake has only decreased by 15.6%. Evidence shows that the largest reformulation effects come from product groups that have received the greatest scrutiny. Sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweets together represent 89% of pure reformulation, where sweetened beverages alone represent 43%. We also analyze the change in added sugar intake across income and find larger reductions in higher‐income households; this finding suggests that existing disparities in diet quality have become more pronounced over time [EconLit Citations: D22, I12, I18, L66].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Food reformulation can contribute to achieve public health objectives by facilitating access to healthy and sustainable food choices to consumers. Vitamin D is an important micronutrient that contributes to calcium absorption and bone health. Low vitamin D levels may lead to having a higher risk of poor bone and muscle for human health. In this manuscript we investigated, for the first time, United Kingdom consumer willingness to pay (WTP), and heterogeneity preferences for vitamin D fortification of eggs. We used a choice experiment (CE) involving several hypothetical egg products (i.e., pack of 10 eggs) that vary across three attributes levels such as production method (i.e., Cage, Barn, Free‐range, and Organic), vitamin (i.e., no information or by reporting on the pack the claim “Vitamin D added”), and price (i.e., £0.80/pack, £1.90/pack, £3.00/pack, and £4.10/pack). Results suggest that, although on average consumers prefer low‐price eggs produced using the free‐range production method and the information about vitamin D fortification does not affect their valuation, there is a significant preference heterogeneity in consumer preferences associated with animal welfare, environment, health, and price attributes. Particularly, there is a significant preference heterogeneity towards the purchasing of eggs produced using the barn production method. Furthermore, we found that consumer preferences for vitamin D fortification of eggs is affected by consumer's age and the price of eggs. These findings provide useful insights into the psychology of consumer acceptance and attitudes that can be used in communicating the nature of the fortified vitamin D eggs to the public. They also have important implications for future labeling policies and marketing strategies of egg industry.",

However, there is a notable gap in the literature, with few studies effectively estimating the impact of land consolidation on microlevel crop changes. In our study, we estimated how land consolidation affects cropland use and vegetation productivity in Turkey, specifically examining wheat and corn. To analyze microlevel datasets from various villages, we applied multiple difference‐in‐differences approaches. Our results show that land consolidation affects farmers' cropland usage, particularly transitioning from wheat to corn. Land consolidation also leads to increased yields for both wheat and corn, although these benefits are not long‐lasting and diminish within a few years. Thus, our findings provide valuable insights for land‐use policy and planning, highlighting the critical role of land consolidation in determining farmers' cropland uses and its effect on overall productivity [EconLit Citations: Q12, Q15, Q18].",

Overall, the findings show that firms in the food value chain were negatively impacted, with regional and sector‐specific differences. Agribusiness firms in Europe and Japan were more negatively impacted by the war than those in the United States. Stock prices of Brewers, Packaged Food and Meats, Soft drinks, and Tobacco firms were negatively impacted by the invasion, while other sectors experienced no or little impact on stock prices.

    "abstract": "Abstract Latin America is a major agricultural producer with important natural resources. Efforts have been made to protect sensitive areas but are hindered by agricultural trade disruptions outside the control of individual countries due to globally integrated crop markets. This analysis assesses the effects of two trade shocks, that is, the war in Ukraine and vehicle decarbonization in the United States (US), on biodiversity and water resources in Latin America. Results show that an increase in maize and wheat exports from the region triggered by the war in Ukraine negatively affects biodiversity in Brazil and leads to cropland expansion into drought‐prone areas in Argentina and Chile. For the case of reduced crop exports from Latin America due to US vehicle decarbonization and the corresponding shift away from US maize ethanol, the pressure on arable land in areas of high biodiversity and water stress is eased. As opposed to agricultural carbon emissions, which have global impacts, biodiversity and water issues have a strong local and regional significance. Regulatory frameworks aiming to protect these regions should be forward looking to detect and shield vulnerable areas from future threats. Other changes affecting global agriculture and trade, for example, sustainable aviation fuels in the US or the European Farm‐to‐Fork policy, need to be anticipated for effective policies in Latin America [EconLit Citations: Q13, Q25, Q34, Q56].",

Although numerous studies have investigated various advantages of outsourcing PDC, little is known about its impact on pesticide expenditure. This study addresses the gap by estimating the impact of outsourcing PDC on pesticide expenditure using data collected from 448 rice farmers in China. We employ an endogenous treatment regression (ETR) model and an instrumental variable quantile regression (IVQR) model to investigate the homogenous and heterogeneous impacts of outsourcing PDC, respectively. The results estimated by the ETR model show that outsourcing PDC decreases total pesticide expenditure. The reduction in herbicide expenditure due to outsourcing PDC is greater than the reduction in insecticide expenditure. The results estimated by the IVQR model reveal that the pesticide expenditure reduction effect of outsourcing PDC is larger among farmers with higher pesticide expenditure. Our findings generally suggest that it is necessary to take outsourcing PDC into consideration when designing policies to promote pesticide expenditure reduction and protect the ecological environment and human health.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Like other Latin American economies, Chile has significantly increased its presence in international agriculture markets. Agricultural commodities are primarily developed within specialized exporters or multinational enterprises and exported to several different countries. In Chile, the fruit sector accounts for almost half of total exports. Internationally oriented companies explore business opportunities in foreign markets and invest adequate resources in international operations. In addition, more internationally oriented companies could be more inclined to invest in green practices due to external pressures and, consequently, achieve higher environmental performance. In this context, environmental performance is related to the extent to which available natural resources are protected during the production, delivery, and consumption of agricultural products. To the best of our knowledge, there is scattered evidence of the relationship between international orientation and the environmental performance of agri‐food companies, especially in Latin America. Grounded on the natural resources‐based view theory, this study assessed the effects of environmental collaboration on five dimensions of environmental performance (greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency, food loss and waste, food quality and safety, and water footprint management) in agri‐food companies with a survey with Chilean firms. Data were analyzed using the partial least square—structural equation modeling. We found that international orientation positively influences all five dimensions of environmental performance. Our study identified that the dimension most impacted by international orientation is water footprint management, and the least impacted is food quality and safety. With the aid of multi‐group analysis, we concluded that there are no significant differences in these relationships between micro/small and medium/large companies. A significant difference was observed in food loss and waste between fruit and nonfruit producers. We expect the outcomes of this study will support exporting‐related decisions and public policies in Latin America.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Vegetable enterprise in the valley of Kashmir holds tremendous significance as it ensures the nutritional requirements of the population, enhances the profitability of the farming sector, and has enormous employability potential in this predominantly agrarian economy. The present study explores the logistics of vegetable enterprises, primarily focusing on the spatial spread of market centers, their functioning, role, and efficiency of supply chains, postharvest losses, and constraints. The study used Nearest Neighbor Analysis, Location Quotient, and Rao's Sphere of Influence method to demarcate the Trade Area. It was found that there is a random distribution of vegetable markets with the Rn value of 1.12 across the region, with the largest trade area (27 sq km) in the second‐order market center at Srinagar. From the Boxall postharvest loss method, it was found that between 20% and 25% of the vegetables are lost along the entire supply chain on account of inadequate infrastructure and a lack of technology and awareness. The efficiency analysis reveals that shorter supply chains exhibit higher efficiency as compared to extended supply chains. However, despite lesser efficiency, these extended supply chains comprised of producers, preharvest contractors, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers are more prevalent (51%) on account of small farm size, low income, and quantity of produce, which is validated from the results of Chi‐square and Analysis of Variance tests at the ( p &lt; 0.05) level of significance. From the constraint analysis, it was revealed that numerous intermediaries, small farm sizes, inadequate counseling and training, an improper support system, and a lack of market information are the main obstacles in this enterprise. Policy interventions for the upgradation of infrastructure, strengthening farmer's cooperative societies, easy access to finance, training, and awareness are needed for streamlining operations, reducing wastage, and improving efficiency and productivity to ensure the long‐term sustainability of this enterprise.",

They play a crucial role in guiding businesses toward improvements in their sustainability practices. The main purpose of this study was to identify, localize, and validate sustainability indicators for agribusinesses, with an emphasis on greenhouses in Iran. The study used a mixed‐methods design, combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. First, the literature on the sustainability of agricultural systems and businesses was comprehensively reviewed to identify sustainability indicators, which were then localized by conducting semi‐structured interviews and analyzing their content qualitatively to extract a list from the perspective of experts. The statistical population of this phase comprised scholars of sustainability in the agricultural sector. In the final step, the extracted indicators were validated using the fuzzy Delphi technique. The statistical population for this step was comprised of experts who had practical experience in agribusinesses in addition to possessing knowledge of sustainability. The samples for both the interviews and the fuzzy Delphi technique were chosen purposively. Eventually, 31 indicators were identified within eight components in three sustainability dimensions. The components included resource quality preservation, input management, resource preservation, profitability, vulnerability, social justice and security, knowledge and empowerment, contribution to local development, and safety and health. With only a few studies conducted on the sustainability of greenhouses and no past studies on sustainability indicators for the study area, this study can contribute significantly to the exiting literature on the subject. Indicators identified will serve as a roadmap for achieving sustainability in agribusinesses, especially in greenhouse operations. By assessing sustainability through these indicators, a more profound understanding of the actual status of sustainability can be gained. National and local policies can be developed based on these to increase the level of sustainability of agribusinesses. If these indicators are integrated into the strategic framework of agribusiness, this will definitely improve their sustainability performance and enhance their reputation, build stakeholder trust, and also increase their competitiveness in the growing eco‐conscious market.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nationwide food consumption surveys often find no difference in the diets of lower and higher income Americans, while studies of particular food commodities find major differences. These contrasting results represent a consumption paradox. We attempt to gain an understanding of this paradox by using supermarket scanner data to examine food purchases and, by extension, consumption patterns for consumers in two, geographically distinct, income areas. These areas are part of the larger Columbus, OH, metropolitan area (CMA) and six stores are selected for purchase and consumption analyses—three from the lowest income areas of the CMA and three from the highest income areas. Seven product categories are analyzed in this study and these categories are subdivided into meaningful nutritional classes. An Almost Ideal Demand System is employed and the empirical results reveal major differences in consumption behavior for the two groups.

Consequently, (a) estimates of producers' returns to advertising that ignore the incidence of the advertising tax will be understated, (b) the ability to shift the advertising tax gives producers an added incentive to support check-off programs, and (c) because advertising check-off programs affect consumer as well as producer surplus (i.e., have social welfare implications) government oversight is warranted.",

The results indicate that generic milk advertising is positive and statistically significant at the 10% significance level in each market. The highest advertising elasticity is in the Buffalo market, while the lowest is in Albany. The results also indicate that blend prices in the two New York milk marketing orders increased by 5.94 and 8.05 cents per cwt due to advertising, on average; while farmers invested 3.89 and 4.87 cents per cwt (in 1986 dollars) in fluid milk advertising for each market.

    "abstract": "Abstract This article shows that marketing channel theory, which has been extensively applied in developed countries, can also be of great value to the developing world. Notably, the channel approach makes it possible to explain the number of trade levels observed in food marketing systems. We propose here a vertical disintegration model for horticultural marketing channels in Kenya. It contains one dependent variable (the degree of vertical disintegration of a channel) and five independent variables (the population size of the market center served by the channel, the population density of the rural hinterland of that market center, the transport time from farm to market center, the turnover of the retailer involved, and the keeping quality of the commodity traded). Binomial and multinomial logit analyses show that the probability of encountering a more disintegrated horticultural marketing channel increases when the market center has more inhabitants, when the center's rural hinterland is more densely populated, and when the transport to the center takes more time. The probability of encountering a less disintegrated channel increases when the retailer in the channel has a larger turnover and when the traded commodity is a leafy vegetable.

Some empirical evidence suggests that there is a negative short‐run relationship between the two: Cash market prices tend to be low in weeks in which captive supply shipments are high. We advance a different perspective on the relationship between captive deliveries and cash prices, arguing that the incentives that influence cattle delivery‐scheduling decisions could lead to a negative relationship, not between the contemporaneous levels of captive shipments and price, but between the volume of captive deliveries, on the one hand, and an ex ante expectation of a week‐to‐week price change , on the other. Econometric testing provides some evidence of this empirical regularity in the cattle procurement activities of four large packing plants in Texas in the mid‐1990s.

Previous studies have tested the hypothesis that ownership‐specific advantages are a major determinant of performance differences. This study analyzes the processed food sector (SIC = 20), using a panel data set for 75 firms and 5 years. The model is evaluated using a random effects model. The results indicate that the determinants of profitability differ between MNEs subsidiaries and DMEs. MNEs' profitability depends on their market share, knowledge, and experience of the local market; training intensity; and product differentiation through the use of technological inputs from abroad and local advertising. DMEs' profitability depends on their market share and product differentiation, through local advertising and local R&amp;D. Size has a negative effect on profitability for both groups of companies. Even after allowing for all of these determinants of profitability, ownership has an independent effect on profitability (namely higher for MNE subsidiaries than DMEs).

Segregation costs were incurred by the U.S. grain-handling system in order to ensure that domestic and export sales of food corn and export sales of non-food corn to Japan meet stringent tolerance levels. These costs reduced the revenue that U.S. corn producers would have received in the absence of StarLink. However, the Loan Deficiency Payment Program (LDP) effectively reduced the loss in revenue attributed to StarLink. This study develops a partial equilibrium model that encompasses both segregation costs and the LDP program in order to obtain empirical estimates of the impact of StarLink on U.S. corn producers over the 2000/2001 marketing year. It is estimated that StarLink caused U.S. producers to lose between $26 and $288 million in revenue. [EconLit citations: Q18, Q17, L51.] © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

First, a least-cost food poverty line was determined. Then, some aggregate poverty measures, namely the Head-Count Ratio, the Poverty Gap Ratio, the Sen Index and the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke Index, were calculated and employed for assessment of poverty levels in Turkey as a whole and in both urban and rural areas. These indices indicate that approximately 46.8% of the households are poor, and 7.0% of the households are extremely poor in Turkey. Moreover, the extent, depth, severity, and intensity of poverty in rural areas of Turkey seem to be fairly high compared to urban areas. In order to firmly combine food poverty and actual food consumption behavior, the Linearly Approximated Almost Ideal Demand System (LA/AIDS) was estimated. The results show that food demands of extremely poor households are more responsive to income and prices than are those of poor households in Turkey.

The model compares the processors and producers' bargaining strengths in order to determine the equilibrium price of live chickens in Ontario. The theoretical results show how the equilibrium price of live chickens and each party's profit depend on the coefficient of bargaining power. The stochastic properties of price and cost data call for cointegration techniques to infer the bargaining weights. The hypothesis of equal bargaining strengths between processors and producers in Ontario over the 1997–2002 period is strongly rejected by the data. It is shown that chicken processors had greater bargaining power than chicken producers because live chicken prices were highly correlated to chicken producers' average costs.

Larger brewers are faced with low prospects for volume growth in developed markets leading them to seek growth either via acquisition of other brewers or by aggressive participation in developing markets or both. This study employs event study analysis to examine 31 mergers and acquisitions among leading European brewing groups.

Detailed household consumption data for a number of vegetable commodities are utilized in the analysis. The results show that most of the expenditure and own‐price elasticities of the vegetables analyzed are near or larger than unitary in both rural and urban areas. For majority of the vegetable commodities examined, only the expenditure elasticity is significantly different between rural and urban households. On the other hand, own‐price and cross‐price elasticities of most vegetables do not significantly differ between rural and urban households. The disaggregate vegetable demand elasticities in this study, as well as the insights from the rural/urban comparisons, provide valuable information that can be utilized for the analysis and design of various food‐related policies in the Philippines.

Firms' marketing strategies tend to concentrate on product purity while we believe there exists a well‐defined path worth: 1. introduction of a traditional (original) product on international markets; 2. local firms' imitation of the successful good; 3. local firms redesigning original products according to local consumption models and preferences. A representative sample of American consumers were interviewed in 12 US cities. Econometric analysis results suggest that a strategy aimed at emphasizing the authenticity of the origin of any product may not lead to any improvement in its market share, but it might very likely affect that market as a whole. Products should be offered as part of a sort of traditional product package to promote food habits rather than just commodities. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Retailers are often criticized for a slow response in retail prices to changes in wholesale beef prices. The unresponsiveness, especially when wholesale and farm prices are declining, is seen as a lack of competitiveness and as a reason for congressional action to regulate behavior of processors or retailers. The validity of the historical analyses of retailer price responsiveness is questionable, however. Traditional Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) retail beef prices biased upward and do not account for large volumes sold at discounted prices. This article uses newly available scanner‐based quantity‐weighted retail prices to suggest that retailers' response to changes in wholesale beef prices is significantly larger and possibly quicker than is shown by traditional BLS measures of retail prices. Recent efforts to prompt legislation to regulate how firms behave along the beef supply chain, which are based only on arguments that retailers are not responding to price changes at the wholesale level, may be inappropriate.

They disaggregate conventional milk products into four categories based on fat content (whole, 2%, 1%, and skim); organic milk is disaggregated into these same categories, but for empirical estimation, some categories are combined. Their descriptive statistics show that suburban consumers, relative to inner-city consumers, purchase more organic and lower-fat conventional milk. These same consumers pay higher prices for conventional and organic milk, save for conventional 1% and skim milk. Our econometric results indicate that suburban consumers are price insensitive toward the purchase of all conventional and organic classes; inner-city consumers are price-sensitive toward conventional whole and 2% milk—products that constitute 89% of their milk expenditure; these same consumers are price insensitive toward all other classes of conventional and organic milk.

Confidential profit and loss data were examined from all the individual packing plants within the four largest packing firms for a 30‐month period. Alternative marketing agreement use resulted in improved beef supply chain efficiency, product demand, and plant profitability. The slaughter and processing costs were lower for plants with higher volumes of AMA cattle relative to cash market cattle. Plants that slaughter cattle from AMA sources operated at higher volumes, had less variable volumes, and had lower average total costs per head because of the substantive economies of size. Plants that slaughter cattle from AMA sources also had higher gross margins and average profits per head. The general conclusion is clear: If policies are implemented that limit AMA use then packing industry efficiency would be negatively impacted.

In addition to the log‐normal distribution, the Weibull, gamma, exponential and log‐logistic distributions are employed for a comprehensive data set of over 6,000 Australian wines. Estimates of marginal attribute impacts do differ with distribution employed with the Weibull being the most different. On average for all wines, the log‐logistic distribution produces the most accurate predictions, however, the performance of distributions differs according to price range. Combining the predictions can produce substantially lower absolute errors on average, because of the varying accuracy performance of the distributions.

This rule established that retail prices of fluid milk products higher than 200% of the Class I milk prices were unconscionably excessive. There is empirical evidence suggesting that supermarket whole milk pricing strategies and the nature of Class I milk price transmission tend to be different in the law period as compared to the period prior to the MPGL enforcement. During the pre‐law period, supermarkets used retail price stabilization practice characterized by an incomplete and asymmetric price transmission. During the law period, supermarkets used marketing margin stabilization practice characterized by more than a complete and a much more symmetric price transmission. The institutional environment affected by the interaction of the analyzed regulatory mechanism and the changes taking place in the economic environment (increasing Class I milk price volatility and increasing concentration in the fluid milk processing and supermarket retailing) was likely to cause the observed changes in the supermarket whole milk pricing strategy and Class I milk price transmission process.

The VAR, exogenous variables—intercepts, seasonal dummies, and export unit value first lags—and covariance estimates all had statistically significant changes for each of the four types of exports, indicating that BSE caused structural changes in U.S. exports of the four meats. To demonstrate the effects of these coefficient‐estimate shifts, post‐BSE exports were forecast using both sets of coefficients, the pre‐ and post‐BSE periods. These forecasts were in concordance with actual U.S. export data, showing that the structural changes lead to a decrease in U.S. beef meat and offal exports and a strong increase in U.S. pork meat and offal exports in the post‐BSE years.

The results obtained indicate that foreign investments and consolidation have a positive and significant impact on food processors’ and retailers’ mark‐ups. Food processors, agricultural producers, and wholesalers have lower price‐cost margins than retailers, whereas retailers exert monopsonistic power in the upstream food market as well.

Different regions of the country are able to supply a variety of agricultural products due to the wide‐range of climate conditions and high land quality. Also, the majority of the water resources in the region are located within the country. Hence, with the implementation of the effective agricultural policies, agricultural products can be significantly increased in terms of quality and quantity. In this context, this study investigates findings from an explanatory study of dried fruit production and exports to improve SMEs’ competitiveness in the agriproduct export business. Turkey reported a trade deficit equivalent to USD 7533 million in November of 2011, and this shortfall is becoming more threatening day by day. Because Turkey has a comparative advantage in the dried food industry, it would be valuable to conduct a study to present a management decision tool to determine which factors are more important and to identify the weights that are most significant for dried fruit exporters. The analytical network process (ANP) method was selected to solve the problem because it has been successfully used to evaluate the factors when interdependency exists in between the decision criteria. The contributions of the study could be extended to other sectors and problem areas of business management because the approach, model, and methodology can be easily adopted by practitioners.",

Gala apples are one of the cultivars that have gained ground in popularity. In this article, the authors compare how internal fruit qualities affect consumers’ willingness to pay for apples and whether these effects differ across these two cultivars. Consumers are willing to pay more for firmness for both cultivars, with a larger effect for Red Delicious. Using consumer assessments of sweetness acceptability, consumers are willing to pay a positive amount for both cultivars, but the effect of sweetness is higher for Gala apples. The only significant ethnicity variable is being Hispanic , which is associated with lower willingness to pay for Gala and higher willingness to pay for Red Delicious. One possible explanation is that the Hispanic consumers may have stronger food traditions associated with Red Delicious. [EconLit Citations: Q13, L15].",

Specifically, it provides insights about the direct effect of FDI on performance, as well as about the joint effect of firm size and FDI, marketing intensity and FDI, and capital intensity and FDI on performance. These findings provide evidence that FDI activity is an important factor for U.S. agribusiness financial strength. [JEL classifications: F230, Q130, L250].",

A new biological control product, called Aflasafe, has been introduced in Nigeria to mitigate aflatoxin contamination of maize in the field and in storage. No known prior work has estimated how much African agribusinesses using maize for animal feed will pay for aflatoxin‐safe maize. This study measured the levels of Aflasafe awareness, surveyed current aflatoxin management practices, and estimated, using choice experiments, willingness to pay (WTP) for aflatoxin‐safe maize by Nigerian poultry producers and feed millers. Data was gathered from 272 orally administered surveys, which included discrete choice experiments examining maize purchasing decisions. Results suggest that the proportion of enterprises that were aware of aflatoxin was found to vary across states. Two latent classes of Nigerian poultry producers and feed millers were identified that were willing to pay average premiums of 4.9% and 30.9%, respectively for maize with 10 parts per billion (ppb) aflatoxin concentration relative to maize with 20 ppb aflatoxin concentration. Both latent classes were, on average, willing to pay larger premiums for maize with 4 ppb aflatoxin concentration. There was evidence that latent class membership, and hence WTP, varied based on awareness of aflatoxin and across geographies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Switzerland applies a number of different border protection policies for milk products. While dairy products such as butter and milk powder are still subject to tariffs and tariff‐rate quotas, cheese trade with the European Union (EU) is fully liberalized. To understand how such different levels of protection affect spatial price transmission, we analyze price transmission between Germany and Switzerland for several products at the wholesale level, and for raw milk producer prices. We find that not the level of border protection determines the degree and speed of price transmission, but rather the qualitative differentiation of the Swiss products. While prices of tariff‐protected dairy products are influenced by German price developments, cheese prices are not. Also, at the producer level, milk prices for cheese processing are less strongly linked to foreign prices than milk prices for industrial dairy production. Our results suggest that for small high‐income countries such as Switzerland, promoting high‐quality products and hence reducing international substitutability alleviates international price pressure more than protection via tariffs.

Empirical results rejected the validity of the Law of One Price, identified Hungary as the price‐leading market, confirmed competitive symmetric price adjustment, and emphasized the role of Hungarian market share in total Slovenian imports with respect to wheat price transmission elasticity. The results imply that wheat producer prices in both of the analyzed countries tend to be internationally determined. Hungarian exports are unable to price discriminate in wheat trade between the two neighboring markets.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this research, we explore the market potential of a domestic agricultural product, the early potato, in two countries, Italy and Germany. We conducted two parallel marketing studies aimed at revealing the most desirable characteristics for the commercialization of this product in each of the two markets, and made comparisons among consumers’ attitudes for several attributes (country of origin, carbon footprint, production method, ethical certification and packaging). Motivation for this study is the declining market share of the domestic early potato, considered an important crop in both countries, due to the competition from abroad. A focal aspect of this research is the recent public interest for social justice, traditionally reserved for products imported from developing countries, with respect to ethical products made in developed countries. The possibility for Italian and German early potatoes to regain important market shares depends on the ability to differentiate their potatoes from potatoes supplied by competing extra‐European countries.

The estimated VECM shows that violations of spatial price equilibrium are corrected faster between Arkansas River‐New Orleans prices than New Orleans‐Middle East prices. The long term adjustments to deviations from spatial equilibrium in the New Orleans‐Middle East price relationship are made through adjustments in the New Orleans price. The PBM shows that New Orleans‐Middle East price spreads are greater than transportation costs about 23% of the time. [EconLit citations: C32, Q13, R32].",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Crop breeding research and seed industry development are critical to promoting sustainable growth in agricultural production and ensuring food security. The Chinese government introduced a significant reform to the original seed regulation system, which was overly focused on market access management. This revision can profoundly impact the licensing market of seed varieties in China. However, the licensing issue in the seed industry has barely been tapped owing to the limited availability of real licensing data. This study aims to analyze the impacts of the seed regulation reform on the licensing fees of varieties in China based on some unique actual transaction data of variety licensing. We employed a nationwide in‐person survey of seed companies and used a multivariate analysis. The results indicate that most seed companies in China were obliged to buy licenses for new varieties bred by others. An upfront lump‐sum fixed‐fee payment had also been the most used strategy for variety licensing. The estimation results of the multivariate analysis indicate that seed regulation reform in China led to an average decline of nearly half of the licensing fee of a variety. After the reform, the licensing prices of conventional rice varieties decreased the most, followed by maize varieties. By contrast, the reform did not significantly affect the licensing fees of hybrid rice varieties. The reform resulted in a 63% drop in licensing fee of a public‐bred variety, while having no significant impact on that of private‐bred varieties. Post reform, the licensee fee of a variety paid by smaller seed companies and non‐state‐owned enterprises (SOEs) decreased by 62% and 65%, respectively, while the fees paid by bigger seed companies and SOEs were not significantly affected. Moreover, the results confirm that newer varieties and the varieties with higher yield and exclusive contracts have significantly higher licensing fees, and large seed companies paid significantly more on a variety license. These results have important implications for market participants and policymakers in China's seed industry as well as other industries.",

When we introduce information about food miles, the WTP for imported organic potatoes decreases by NTD10.2, without significantly impacting other varieties. A different information treatment featuring pesticide residue information boosts the WTP for local organic potatoes by NTD8.3 but has no significant effect on the other categories. Providing both types of information diminishes the local premium for non‐organic potatoes while enhancing it for local organic varieties. The influence of the information varies by shopping venue: farmers market shoppers give more weight to food miles information, whereas supermarket patrons are more responsive to pesticide residue information.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper analyzes the cost competitiveness of rice production in Myanmar by examining production costs, cost efficiency, and the potential effect of improving cost efficiency on the country's global competitiveness. To achieve this, we conduct a comparative analysis of production costs among major rice‐producing countries and estimate the cost efficiency of rice farming in Myanmar using a stochastic frontier cost function model. Subsequently, we examine how cost efficiency affects domestic resource costs (DRC), a key indicator of global competitiveness in rice production, by addressing the endogeneity issue that prior research has not dealt with. We also consider seasonal variations across both the dry and wet seasons in Myanmar, an aspect often overlooked in previous research. Our findings reveal that Myanmar ranks as the second least expensive rice‐producing country among selected Asian countries. The mean cost efficiencies are 89% and 86% for the dry and wet seasons, respectively, indicating high cost efficiency during these seasons. Both dry and wet seasons of rice production demonstrate a comparative advantage, with DRC values of 0.31 and 0.54, respectively. The results also show that cost efficiency positively contributes to global competitiveness in both seasons, implying that the global competitiveness of Myanmar's rice sector can increase by improving cost efficiency. Therefore, policy interventions aimed at developing demand‐driven high‐yield potential with stress‐tolerant rice varieties, promoting the utilization of quality seed, and providing more extensive training on input management practices and educational programs are recommended to enhance cost efficiency, which can further strengthen the country's competitiveness in the global rice market.",

By employing linear regression model estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) alongside conditional quantile regression (CQR) and unconditional quantile regression (UQR), we provide a comprehensive analysis of how various factors influence meat expenditure across different quantiles of the income distribution. Our findings indicate that income, age, education, homeownership, and marital status are significant determinants of bovine meat expenditure. Notably, the CQR model reveals that the impact of income on meat expenditure is more pronounced at higher quantiles of the conditional expenditure distribution, indicating that households with higher conditional meat expenditures exhibit greater responsiveness to income changes. In contrast, the UQR model shows a diminishing effect of income at higher quantiles, highlighting different expenditure patterns when considering the entire distribution. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as eating out and participation in sports activities significantly affect meat consumption, with wealthier households displaying more diverse dietary preferences. These insights highlight the importance of targeted policies to improve nutrition and public health, particularly by enhancing the affordability and accessibility of animal‐based proteins for lower‐income households. Rather than relying solely on broad supply‐side measures, such as livestock imports, demand‐side interventions—including targeted food assistance programs and nutrition education campaigns promoting home‐prepared balanced meals—may offer more effective solutions, especially for lower‐ and middle‐expenditure groups.",

An instrument variable approach was employed to mitigate potential endogeneity concerns associated with trader competition. The results indicate an inverted U‐shaped relationship between farm‐gate prices received by herders and the intensity of trader competition. These positive effects can be attributed to the increased information that herders acquire regarding their livestock's quantity and quality due to more frequent interactions with traders. However, the abundance of information may lead to excessive patience among herders, driving them to seek higher prices and potentially causing them to miss out on optimal offers. The results suggest an essential role of increased competition from traders in improving the market gain of small farmers in developing regions.",

Furthermore, Poland had the lowest technology level among the three countries, while Germany and Italy produced close to the metafrontier. We found that subsidies significantly increase inefficiency in apple production in the three countries, while the effects of the share of family labor, and specialization in apple production differed among the countries.

However, a higher density of convenience stores negatively impacts food healthfulness for nononline grocery shoppers, while having no significant effect on adopters. Moreover, the adoption of online grocery shopping affects food purchases differently depending on the local food environment: it tends to reduce the healthfulness of food purchase in less favorable food environments but improves it in more favorable ones.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Promoting sustainable, innovation‐driven growth is crucial for achieving high‐quality economic development in the new era. As a key indicator of companies' sustainability, ESG practices have gained significant attention. However, the lack of a unified ESG evaluation framework and standardized disclosure regulations has led some companies to exaggerate or misrepresent their ESG performance—an issue known as “ESG decoupling.” This study examines the impact of ESG decoupling on agri‐food companies' innovation, using panel data from 2011 to 2022. The results show that ESG decoupling undermines a company's credibility, hindering innovation. However, independent directors mitigate the negative effects of ESG decoupling on innovation. Further analysis reveals that the impact of ESG decoupling is less severe in companies with low digital transformation levels and state‐owned enterprises (SOEs). In contrast, the negative effects are more significant in large companies and the food industry. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between ESG decoupling and innovation. It offers empirical evidence and expands the theoretical framework linking ESG behavior with innovation. Ultimately, the study highlights the need for improved ESG disclosure systems and enhanced companies' credibility to foster a more innovation‐friendly environment.",

Given global concerns about oil palm's role in deforestation and land use change, the focus is on enhancing productivity on existing farmlands. Utilizing a unique, nationally representative dataset of 2046 farm households spanning 1987−2017, we evaluate the current state of oil palm production technologies and the efficiency of their use by farm families in Ghana. The study employs the stochastic metafrontier framework to account for regional differences in production technology and managerial capacity and gauge the performance of these productivity indicators across Ghana over these three decades. Our findings indicate that, on average, smallholder producers use only 44% of their accessible stock of oil palm technology, operating at an average managerial capacity of 69%, with a very low metafrontier technical efficiency score of 28% over the period. These findings suggest that had oil palm technology and managerial performance kept pace with time over these three decades, technical efficiency relative to the metafrontier would have expanded by 72%, leading to an average land savings of 37% for other uses.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Risk and volatility for many commodities escalated sharply following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, creating numerous uncertainties for trading firms and importers. The purpose of this study is to analyze the bidding behavior in Egyptian wheat import tenders in the pre‐ and post‐invasion periods. Bids for each bidder in individual tenders were analyzed for the period from 2017 to mid‐2023. The results indicate that before invasion, there were lower standard errors, margins, and higher probabilities of bidding. These changed in the post‐invasion period and as a result the probability of winning, optimal bids and implied margins increased. Implications were identified for buyers, sellers and industry and policy analysis. First, bidding competition is important and strategically important. Second, for sellers, determining optimal bids is a strategic calculation and requires knowledge about competitors, competitor bids, and relationships over time, as well as a derivation to determine optimal bids. Third, buyers require a larger number of independent and symmetrically well‐informed bidders to fully exploit the virtues of bidding competition.",

Traceability contributes to environmental protection and supports sustainable development by fostering transparency in agricultural practices and encouraging the responsible use of resources. This study examines the effects of traceability‐related Nontariff measures (NTMs) on international trade, focusing on origin and processing traceability in the agricultural sector, with specific analyses in the meat, fruit, and fisheries sectors. We analyze trade flows across 53 exporting and 56 importing countries, using a structural gravity model and Poisson pseudo‐maximum likelihood estimation with high‐dimensional fixed effects, covering 2081 agricultural products from 2012 to 2021. The results show that origin traceability NTMs enhance the trade of fruits, fisheries, and all agri‐food products, whereas processing traceability NTMs may restrict trade unless combined with origin traceability measures. The interaction between both types of NTMs generally has a positive effect, reducing costs and adding value. Nevertheless, this effect varies by income level: high‐income countries imposing both measures on low‐income exporters hamper trade (for all products and fruits), whereas origin traceability promotes trade among similar‐income countries (except for meat between high‐income nations). Simultaneous adoption benefits overall trade for lower‐ and middle‐income countries. These findings highlight that traceability effects depend on the sector, requirement type, and trade partners’ economic profiles.",

This study employs a single‐sector structural gravity model within a general equilibrium framework, integrating the Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator and counterfactual simulations to analyze the agricultural trade effects and economic welfare changes induced by the China‐ASEAN regional trade agreements and intra‐ASEAN trade agreements. Within this focused analytical framework, the findings indicate that it significantly boosted agricultural exports within the region by 28.07%, corresponding to a tariff equivalent of 3.60%. At the country level, all member states, except the Philippines (−0.04%), experienced trade growth, with the largest increase observed in Brunei (32.28%) and the smallest in Myanmar (0.09%). China recorded a moderate rise of 9.14%. The agreements also contributed to GDP growth among member countries, led by Singapore (0.94%), while China showed a marginal increase (0.01%). For nonmember countries, the largest contraction in agricultural trade was limited to 1.24%, while the GDP impacts were minimal, with the most significant decline amounting to just 0.01%. Notably, a few nonmember countries experienced slight gains in both trade and economic performance. Additionally, the research discusses the welfare changes experienced by producers and consumers in different countries. The findings, which primarily delineate the direct effects within the agricultural sector under the model's general equilibrium assumptions, suggest that deepening regional trade agreements through liberalization and trade facilitation is vital for regional integration, while also necessitating attention to their varied impacts on nonmember countries to ensure equitable global trade. Additionally, targeted domestic support policies are crucial for stabilizing agricultural producer incomes and ensuring sustainable sector development.",

Results reveal that 47% of youth are driven into agribusiness by both necessity and opportunity, while 41% by necessity alone and only 12% by opportunity alone. Key factors shaping youth's perceptions include gender, education, food processing participation, agribusiness‐related training, land ownership, monthly income, and family farming background. The result further identifies significant heterogeneity in the drivers of perceptions—based on location, gender, and agribusiness roles, suggesting the need to tailor agricultural program interventions to ensure the best fit.

A stated preference survey, using an iterative bidding process, was conducted among 585 informal market consumers of Port‐au‐Prince and Cap‐Haitien, the two largest cities in Haiti. Results show that informal market participants are willing to pay a 12% premium for peanut butter that meets international aflatoxin standards. Based on the result of a previous revealed preference study on Haitian peanut farmers, the observed premium would be largely sufficient to incentivize farmers to adopt aflatoxin mitigation practices, which supports market‐based solutions to improve the safety of a Haitian staple food. Results also indicate that informal market consumers have greater confidence in a certification from an international institution rather than a domestic one.",

This caused concerns about increasing antimicrobial resistance, and in 2017 the US government banned the use of antibiotics important in human medicine and nontherapeutic uses in animal feed. It is not known, however, how these regulations influenced willingness to pay (WTP) for labels about antibiotic use or if consumers are aware of the changes. This study examined WTP for ground beef that was unlabeled or labeled as USDA organic, raised without antibiotics (RWA), or certified responsible antibiotics use (CRAU) before and after one of two sets of information on antibiotic use regulations or a third about antibiotic residue rules. Expectations of the taste, healthiness, and likelihood of antibiotic residues for each version were also examined along with consumer knowledge of the regulations. A field experiment in supermarkets in the US was conducted with 290 participants. Before information, consumers had higher WTP for all three labels, but after any information treatment, the premium for CRAU was no longer significant. Lack of consumer knowledge may therefore be inflating premiums for the CRAU label. WTP for RWA and organic held after information, suggesting regulations are not strong enough to override the value consumers see in a no antibiotics option. The largest factors in preferences though were the taste and healthiness expectations associated with each label.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In the context of the global shift towards a digital economy and the widespread implementation of strategies aimed at improving public health and food security, it is essential to investigate the influence of information and communication technology (ICT) on improving the dietary quality of rural residents and enhancing overall well‐being. This paper takes China as a case study, utilizing data from the 2020 China Rural Revitalization Survey (CRRS) to construct a theoretical framework that traces the path from “ICT access and application” to “income, food accessibility, and dietary cognition,” ultimately affecting “the dietary quality of rural residents” within the limits of consumption budgets and preferences. The study empirically explores the impacts and mechanisms by which ICT access and application affect the dietary quality of rural inhabitants. Results reveal that both ICT access and usage significantly ameliorate dietary deficiencies, correct dietary imbalances, and enhance dietary diversity among rural populations, although they do not substantially influence dietary over‐intake. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that ICT access and application have a more pronounced effect on individuals with low to moderate dietary quality compared to those with higher dietary quality. Mechanistic analysis further suggests that ICT access and usage improve rural residents' dietary quality primarily through increased income, better food accessibility, and optimized dietary cognition. Consequently, this paper advocates for the integrated promotion of ICT access and application in remote and underdeveloped rural areas of developing countries, as a means to alleviate consumption budget constraints and enhance nutritional literacy, ultimately improving dietary quality and well‐being.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper examines China's corn subsidy policy reform, aiming to provide insights for future policy adjustments and optimizations in China and other developing countries facing similar agricultural subsidy challenges. It constructs a partial equilibrium model of corn supply and demand to assess the effects of policies such as the temporary reserve program and producer subsidy on production, trade, and subsidy allocation, using cross‐country corn supply and demand data from 1990 to 2020. The findings reveal several key insights: First, both the temporary reserve program and producer subsidy distort corn production and trade, with the producer subsidy causing less distortion. Second, transitioning from the temporary reserve program to a producer subsidy can reduce policy costs by 7–15%, while maintaining the same level of corn self‐sufficiency. Third, within WTO rules, China can increase corn self‐sufficiency with minimal costs by limiting producer subsidies and investing in agricultural R&amp;D to boost yield per unit area, which cause minimal distortion to production and trade. This study highlights that, under open market conditions, the price support policy is ineffective in ensuring food security in developing countries such as China. Instead, the producer subsidy and agricultural R&amp;D subsidy, which are exempt from the Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) calculation, may offer developing countries a practical way to balance WTO compliance and domestic food security.",

However, consumer confusion regarding labels' meaning undermines their effectiveness. This holds especially for labels that are abstract in nature and lack concreteness. Could simple modifications to the design of such logos enhance consumer perceptions and purchase intentions? Two studies, drawing on signaling theory and using the EU organic green leaf logo as an example, reveal that design changes that improve signal clarity induce more favorable label perceptions (Study 1, seven countries, N = 9378) with Study 2 (Germany, N = 498) uncovering the mechanism by which this occurs. Specifically, Study 2 demonstrates that logo modifications that improve signal clarity, reduce consumer uncertainty, which in turn improves trust and ultimately consumers' intentions to use the label. These findings deepen understanding of how policymakers can improve the effectiveness of sustainability labels through targeted logo modifications.",

Extreme risk is assessed using parametric Value‐at‐Risk models, including the traditional normal VaR and three alternative non‐normal VaR models—logistic, hyper‐secant, and Laplace. The Omega ratio evaluates return‐to‐risk performance. In the precrisis period, the grains portfolio is found to be less vulnerable to extreme risks as grain commodities exhibit lower risk profiles. Conversely, during the crisis period, the softs portfolio demonstrates reduced exposure to extreme risks, attributed to the lower integration of soft markets.

Few studies have simultaneously addressed the impact of price volatility on both expected income and income risk. We establish a micro‐founded framework to examine the effects of hog price volatility and the efficacy of farmers' spatiotemporal sales strategy selection as a buffer. China, being the world's largest producer and consumer of hogs, faces a significant challenge where farmers are heavily impacted by price volatility. Employing the Method of Moments to estimate expected income and income risk, we analyze data from a survey of Chinese hog farmers. Our empirical findings support the hypothesis that price volatility exerts severe adverse impacts, not only reducing farmers' expected income but also increasing income risk, with price shocks disproportionately borne by relatively smaller‐scale farmers. Farmers' spatial sales strategy, namely selling in other regions, can alleviate the adverse effects of price volatility; however, the temporal sales strategy, which involves signing price contracts, only reduces income risk without enhancing expected income. Our research reveals the limitations of price contracts for smallholder farmers, indicating that they primarily reduce income risk without a significant improvement in bargaining power.",

The mechanisms driving this optimization include promoting green technology innovation and establishing brand reputation advantages. However, a detailed examination demonstrates that this positive impact of ESG performance is not absolute. Companies that implement quality competitive strategies, undergo digital transformation, engage in general trade, and export to regions with stringent nontariff barriers rely more on ESG capacities. Lastly, we also consider the international coordination of ESG standards. The findings reveal that firms adopting the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework in ESG disclosure are more likely to achieve quality upgrading through ESG.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT As climate change intensifies global challenges, agricultural systems face escalating risks, with vulnerable zones like Africa bearing heightened exposure. Climate risks refer to the economic and financial impacts arising from extreme weather events and the global transition to a low‐carbon economy. This study investigates how climate risk impacts Green Total Factor Productivity (GTFP) in African agriculture, using a balanced panel dataset with 630 observations from 30 African countries spanning from 2000 to 2020. The regression analysis reveals a significant stimulatory effect of climate risk on GTFP, primarily by fostering infrastructure development and accelerating digital transformation. Heterogeneity analysis further reveals that this effect is particularly pronounced in sub‐Saharan Africa and in resource‐dependent economies. Additionally, vulnerabilities related to water resources and infrastructure enhance the positive relationship between climate risk and GTFP. These findings offer a novel perspective on advancing sustainable and high‐quality agricultural development in Africa in the face of climate challenges, providing a scientific basis for policy optimization and bolstering the resilience of African agriculture.",

This topic would give us important information about the differences in food demand in both areas in the pre‐, early, and late pandemic periods. Our paper estimates household food demand in the rural and urban areas of Bengkulu Province, Indonesia, in the three periods using the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System on SUSENAS microdata. We test the differences in food demand between the two areas and the three periods of the pandemic. We find that cereal demand is expenditure inelastic and meat demand is the most expenditure elastic in both areas in all periods of COVID‐19. Comparing the two areas, in all periods, households in the urban area consume less cereal, oil and coconut, coffee, tea, sugar, and seasonings, and more eggs and milk, fruit, and prepared food (on condition that the period is unchanged). The demand for fish and meat is higher in the urban areas in the pre‐ and early COVID‐19 periods. Vegetables and fruit are substitutes for each other in both areas in the pre‐pandemic period and only in the rural area in the early pandemic period, whereas they complement each other in the urban area in the late pandemic period. In the pre‐ and early COVID‐19 periods, meat is the easiest to substitute in both areas, but in the late COVID‐19 period, seasoning is the easiest. All the demographic variables are found to be necessary in our demand system.",

One such niche is the fresh‐cut fruit and vegetable market, which has been steadily growing in Germany. This study examines whether the specialization of a German fresh‐cut producer grants it with market power within this niche market. Based on a unique price dataset from a German fresh‐cut producer, results of a Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag‐Model (NARDL) reveal significant price asymmetries: Depending on the product, increases (decreases) in purchase prices lead mostly to higher (lower) sales prices These findings provide no evidence of structural market power regarding input or output prices. The absence of consistent long‐term price relationships further underscores this finding. While we cannot find structural market power, sporadically higher than normal margins could be attributed to stochastic variation in the arbitrage process. Although the specialized producer in this study operates in a fast‐growing niche market, our results suggest that this alone does not provide the firm with any extraordinary bargaining power.",

Likewise, the farm management discipline does not emphasise the marketing behavior of farmers. This contrasts with the business management literature that places considerable emphasis on the marketing and strategic activities of individual firms. Strategic group studies empirically identify groups of firms within an industry that follow similar business strategies. Although the investigation of strategic groups within the agribusiness sector has been identified as an important area for future research, only a small number of studies have examined strategic groups at the farm business level. This article presents the results of an analysis of farm business marketing and strategic management processes. These show that strategic groups of New Zealand intensive crop farmers exist, and the marketing, business, and management characteristics associated with following each distinctive strategy are described. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests are used to obtain univariate time series properties of Del Monte and Dole's canned pineapple prices. Johansen's likelihood ratio cointegration test is used to characterize the existence of an industry pricing equilibrium. Vector autoregression and vector error correction models are employed to examine the multivariate time series properties of the two firms' prices. Granger causality tests are used to address the price leadership hypothesis, while impulse response functions are constructed to chronicle the intertemporal price response to an innovation in a rival's price series. The battery of tests indicates that Del Monte follows Dole's pricing decisions in this narrowly defined product market. A thorough understanding of empirical price reactions has far-reaching strategic management implications, such as forecasting a rival's response and avoiding costly price wars.

Although both South American countries suffered from the reintroduction of FMD in late 2000, and had to temporarily cease exports to FMD‐free markets, they are expected to eradicate FMD again and will continue to increase exports to FMD‐free markets. This article analyzes the changes in international beef trade and, especially, in beef prices that are expected. We use a simulation model that captures the effects of market segmentation due to the FMD status and of the trade policies of exporting and importing countries. The ongoing realignment of trade flows has potential to significantly affect prices in both the FMD‐free and the FMD‐endemic segments of the world beef market. We demonstrate how growing beef exports from South America to FMD‐free markets interact with other on‐going changes in international beef markets. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The benefit‐cost ratios for the Japanese and the United Kingdom markets were computed to be 5:1 and 15:1, respectively; indicating that the benefit of export promotion in terms of expanding export revenue was greater than the cost of the programs. Optimality analysis suggest that, while the current export promotion spending level in Japan is about optimal, the industry should explore the option of investing more money in its export promotion activities in the United Kingdom.

We carried out a rapid appraisal by means of extensive usage of secondary information, key informant semistructured interviews and direct observation all around the country. We found that beef has been losing competitiveness to other meats in part because of price disadvantage and in part because of marketing inefficiencies. The critical points are: the intermittent quality, unhealthy image and high price of beef, the low level of income of most consumers, inept enforcement of safety regulations, and failing vertical coordination. An important outcome of this study is that most of the problems faced by retailers do not depend only on them. However, retailers need to play a dominant role in dealing with these issues because they represent the most organized segment of the Brazilian beef system.

We investigate the potential off‐setting effects of advertising and promotion (positive) and heightened food safety awareness (negative). Empirically, we evaluate the economic effectiveness of a program that promoted Bavarian beef as safe at the same time consumers were becoming increasingly concerned over the safety of the beef supply. Econometric estimates of both effects are provided and a model proposed to assess the corresponding economic welfare implications. The results show that the regional promotion of Bavarian beef increased demand by 4.6%. This increase was offset with a 6.9% decline in consumption due to information and public awareness of the BSE crisis. In addition, secular declines in consumption due to preference changes away from beef amounted to 15.2%. The welfare effects of the Bavarian government‐financed program were positive for both producers and consumers. Private and social benefit cost ratios suggest that the aggregate welfare gains due to promotion more than compensated for the cost of the program.

Results indicate that advertising strategies and market environments play important roles in determining advertising effectiveness. Particularly, demographic factors were more important than economic factors. The results also suggest that when the market conditions are unfavorable due to increase in price, percentage of African Americans, and percentage of food expenditures for eating away from home, advertising becomes more important and effective.

Data on FDI inflows from three investor home country clusters is related to characteristics of 12 food industry branches. The results indicate that firm size, privatization speed, value‐added, and import share are important determinants of food industry FDI. The findings confirm the importance of a swift reduction of state control over agro‐industrial enterprises, while pointing to the need for effective competition policies in transition countries to contain potentially emerging market power of foreign multinationals in oligopolistic food industry branches.

We examined four possible sources of experimental error in this study. The most important source of error was the failure to exclude noncompeting grocery retailers in the construction of the concentration measure. The relationship was also sensitive to controlling for a subgroup of observations from one state, to alternative data sources, and functional form. When these changes were made, concentration was found to be positively associated with the cost of groceries across cities. The relationship was significant despite a small nonrandom sample of cities and unscientifically sampled prices. [Econ Lit citations: L130, L810, L100] © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Results suggest program intensification would have a positive effect on total (worldwide) producer surplus in the short run, but the gain's distribution is uneven. Specifically, Norway would receive 23% of the gain compared to 48% for United Kingdom producers. By way of comparison, Norway and UK world trade shares are 47 and 16%, respectively. The disproportionate gains to UK producers are due to a double free ride: from the export tax used to fund the advertising increase, and from the advertising itself.

One possible explanation for price rigidity is the existence of psychological pricing points. The authors analyze to what extent psychological pricing plays a role in grocery retailing and whether it contributes to the price rigidity of branded foods in Germany. Psychological pricing—defined here as just-below-the-round-figure-pricing—is empirically analyzed with scanner data of weekly prices for 20 food brands in 38 retail outlets from September 1996 to June 1999. Psychological pricing turned out to be extremely important in German food retailing. Branded food prices are remarkably sticky and psychological pricing points contribute strongly to price rigidity. Other factors like the sales phenomenon and firm-specific effects are additionally important. [EconLit Classifications: Q110, Q130]. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Agribusiness 22: 51–67, 2006.",

The test of structural changes, the analysis of the effects of demographic characteristics, and the estimation of expenditure and price elasticities are conducted from a random sample of 1,281 households from a Japanese household survey in 1997. Results show that each economic or noneconomic factor has a different impact on food consumption over a lifetime. Changes in consumption of some food groups can be explained by price and income effects where others can be explained by demographic characteristics. Financial constraint is not binding and residential location is likely to have little or no impact on predicting consumers' food choices at different periods of their lives. Other key factors that affect consumption pattern include family size, number of children, lifestyle, and health concern. [EconLit citations: C310, D120, D910.] © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract A persistent fall of coffee prices in the 1990s brought the International Coffee Organisation, national governments, and coffee companies to propose the promotion of good quality highland coffee as the exclusive strategy for Central America to neutralize the negative income effects. This implies that cultivation on low‐ and medium‐altitude lands should be discouraged, which means that 60% of the coffee growers and workers will lose their means of subsistence in this region. We have used a combined environmental‐global commodity chain approach to question the new common wisdom. In buyer‐driven chains, there are different quality attributes to satisfy consumers wants. As most food products, coffee receives quality premiums for both sensorial and non‐sensorial credence characteristics. However, mass consumption markets in developed countries are served by powerful downstream roasters with blends that contain a major part of low sensory quality coffees. Market demand and a credence characteristic as the highly rewarded environmental friendliness should both be considered in assessments. This creates opportunities for lowland growers to stay in business and for mass coffee markets to become more sustainable. [Econlit: L660, Q170, Q560] © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

With the help of a risk assessment model, the reduction in the incidence of Campylobacter infections due to a set of possible interventions in the broiler meat (chicken) chain was modeled. Separately, costs related to the implementation of these interventions in the broiler meat chain were estimated. For each intervention to be modeled, the net costs of an intervention—additional costs in the broiler meat chain minus reduced cost‐of‐illness—were related to the reduced burden of disease. This resulted in a cost‐utility ratio, expressing the relative efficiency of several policy options to reduce Campylobacter infections. [EconLit Citations: Q180, I180] © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A set of cost and revenue share equations estimated by Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) method revealed that vertical integration (measured in proxy by value‐added sales ratio) is feed and veterinary service using, labor saving, and output augmenting. However, the scale effect of vertical integration was found to be higher in layers production than what obtains in broilers and cock/cockerel productions.

Despite its relevance, little empirical research has focused on explaining the company's entry and expansion into food retailing. Wal‐Mart's expansion into food retailing through its store conversion strategy is analyzed using an industrial organization entry framework. The results show that Wal‐Mart's store conversion strategy has targeted largely populated areas with low population density, a high percentage of population receiving food stamps, and where the presence of incumbents is modest. The results also provide evidence that as the company moves toward saturation of local markets and increases store conversion rates, it may be forced to reconsider some of its strategic decisions based on the exploitation of economies of density and store conversion. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This study analyzes the effects of testing soybeans for specific quality traits including essential amino acids. A model was developed to analyze costs and risks that may arise for grain handlers to segregate soybeans into high‐ and low‐quality grain flows based on alternative importer purchasing specifications. A stochastic optimization model is used to determine optimal testing locations and intensities in addition to the costs and risks to grain handlers. The model allows for blending to determine optimal shipments from separate locations with differing quality distributions. This paper provides a framework for agribusinesses, grain handlers, and marketers to make decisions in response to importers’ purchasing requirements and strategies.",

Nevertheless, little is known about consumers’ attitudes, knowledge, and perception regarding CrM campaigns and the communication channels they use to learn about CrM. In this article the authors focus on the role of these and other success factors such as cause–brand fit and product fit influencing German consumers’ willingness to buy a CrM promoted product. Results from a consumer study provide evidence that consumers in general hold positive attitudes towards CrM, but that these are not strongly reflected in intended or actual purchase behavior. Based on factor and cluster analyses the authors derive marketing recommendations for companies on how to effectively address different consumer segments regarding the CrM products. We identify four groups of consumers that differ in their attitudes towards CrM products. While some consumers appreciate CrM products, others are more critical towards the concept of CrM.

    "abstract": "One of the impacts of higher prices along with greater volatility in futures, basis, and spreads is that there is pressure for greater use of cash contracts for grain. There is a wide array of cash contracts with varying terms that pose strategic alternatives for buyers, particularly as they seek to use contracting as an element of risk mitigation. Durum is a crop where many issues and challenges are apparent. Durum is more risky than competing crops with greater price, yield, and quality risk. In contrast to competing crops, futures do not exist, cross hedging is poor, and forward contracting has been used minimally. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to analyze alternative contracting strategies in the case of durum wheat. The authors introduce alternative pricing features, and explore contract terms and analyze them in terms of risk and return to growers using stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. Results indicate that contracts reduce risks to growers, and are preferred to no contracting of durum. In general, the results varied across grower risk aversions.

In this paper, the brand equity factors that affect willingness to pay (WTP) for private label vegetables are identified using the contingent valuation method. We consider four key dimensions of brand equity, namely brand awareness, brand loyalty, perceived quality, and brand associations. We find that brand loyalty factors based on the psychology of consumers who seek value‐added vegetables with health and safety characteristics have the largest effect on the WTP premium. Providing shoppers with clear information about the key product attributes of reduced use of synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers is particularly important to generate brand equity for private label vegetables.

The production of sliced fresh pears is a promising alternative to overcome the lack of supplying consistently a product with superior quality with added convenience, potentially able to increase domestic consumption. In this paper, we used sensory evaluation and a Vickrey experimental auction to elicit consumers' preferences and willingness to pay for sliced packed fresh pears treated with SmartFresh™ (1-methylcyclopropene)and subsequently with a ripening compound (RC) in the form of glyoxylic acid at different concentration levels (1%, 2%, 3%, and control). Panelists were willing to pay a price premium equivalent to $0.119/2 oz packet for the 2% RC sample, $0.055/2 oz packet for the 3% RC sample, and $0.025/2 oz packet for the 1% RC sample compared to the control sample. Results from a market segmentation analyses indicate the presence of two groups in the panelist sample. The group that liked sliced pears assigned higher importance to locally grown fruit and price, shopped at conventional retailer grocery stores, had fewer children in the household, and were younger compared to the group that disliked sliced pears.",

This paper presents the results of a choice experiment (CE) among smallholder farmers in Indonesia to assess their preferences for accepting contracts with modern retail. The CE was based on attributes of actual sales transactions in modern retail and traditional retail channels. A total of 301 vegetable smallholder farmers participated, consisting of 173 farmers participating in traditional markets and 128 in modern retail markets. A random parameter logit model estimates that, in general, smallholders do not prefer contracting with modern retail over spot market selling in traditional retail channels. Most contract attributes are perceived as negative by smallholders. A willingness‐to‐accept analysis shows that farmers are critical of most contract attributes, particularly those related to quality requirements. Producer organizations (POs) reduce transaction costs and increase smallholders' preference toward contracts. Contract designs that reduce transaction cost, mitigate risks for farmers, provide fair prices, and involve POs are more likely to attract smallholders to modern retail channels.

In this study, we investigated relatively large‐scale rice farms in Japan and assessed the relationship between the types of organization and farm attributes, such as farmland conditions and human resources. While adjusting this effect with propensity scores, we then estimated how the type of organization affects the number of major machines and machine workdays. When compared on a same‐scale, same condition basis, family farms were the most sparing in the use of machinery, and even the farmland concentration effect, achieved by community farms, could not compensate for this difference. Our findings also indicated that nonfamily farms achieved high levels of machinery utilization with a greater operational scale (L23, M11, Q12).",

The COVID‐19 outbreak has resulted in decreased global demand for products like clothing, directly affecting China's demand for cotton from exporting countries. In this study, we examined Chinese demand for imported cotton by product form (raw cotton and yarn) and by source (e.g., United States, India), as well as the dynamic price relationships across countries. Using year‐to‐date trade, demand estimates, and price forecasts, we assessed the impact of COVID‐19 on Chinese imports and the countries supplying this market. Depending on the projections, the most severe impacts of COVID‐19 on Chinese cotton imports are either behind us, or the latter half of 2020 could potentially be just as bad as the early part of the year. The outcome depends on the impact of manufactured‐product prices on imports; the effects of which are large but insignificant. As a consequence, even when imports from certain countries are projected to significantly decline, projection intervals suggest the possibility of a negligible decline or even a positive outcome.",

Mixed logit model estimations show that producers with higher levels of education and awareness about environmental and social requirements are more likely to adopt GLOBALG.A.P. standards. Prior experience in high‐value market channels and with public Good Agricultural Practice standards are also crucial factors that motivate producers to adopt GLOBALG.A.P. standards. However, certification costs and time needed for record keeping and training are major adoption barriers. Against this background, we propose more education and stakeholder workshops to increase the likelihood of adoption among Thai horticultural producers. The formation of regular discussion groups would allow fruitful interaction among producers and with advisors, eventually providing vital links between implementation of standards and day‐to‐day farm practices.

We analyze a unique dataset of 314 winegrape sourcing choices from 74 wineries located in five U.S. states, investigating how the pursuit of differentiation influences the likelihood of adoption of a plural form—that is, the simultaneous adoption of a formal arrangement (i.e., vertical integration or long‐term formal contract) and an informal arrangement (i.e., informal contracts or spot‐market transactions). Consistent with previous studies, measurement ability and the existence of trust are both associated with a higher likelihood of adoption of informal arrangements in comparison to formal arrangements. Moreover, we show that the likelihood of adoption of a plural form increases as the differentiation potential of a winegrape variety also increases. Finally, we find that the use of plural forms is associated with a reduction in the importance of trust in the relationships with external suppliers. This study is important because it sheds light on the role of plural forms in the pursuit of competitive advantage in an agri‐food system. Overall, it suggests that the current interpretations of the idea of “vertical coordination” may be enlarged to encompass a greater deal of organizational diversity.",

The causal effect was identified by constructing panel data mainly for Chinese counties between 2001 and 2017 using a difference‐in‐differences (DID) framework. The empirical results, after controlling for county‐specific linear trends, reveal that an HSR connection contributes to increasing agricultural value added and food output by approximately 4% and 6%, respectively. Moreover, the effects are mainly driven by increased productivity and adjustments to grain production and economic crops rather than the increased use of observed inputs. These results provide fresh evidence on the effect of transportation improvements on agricultural economies and highlight the need to control nonparallel trends when using the DID method to disentangle the effect.

The SCA model contributes to the existing toolbox for impact evaluation in commodity markets and provides insights into the timing of impact dynamics at refined time intervals. The SCA model is applied to evaluate five sets of shock scenarios, which include a demand shock, a corn price increase, pork import restrictions, a second wave of ASF, and a combination of these shocks. Simulation results demonstrate the reaction of the hog cycle to different shocks with quantitive outcomes. Based on the simulation results, we find that production and economic adjustment lags generate constant and predictable hog cycles, while the external shocks lead hog cycles to be irregular with varying phase and amplitude.

However, this rural digitalization follows a top‐down approach, from government guidance to private construction. Rural households' digital abilities have not received sufficient attention. This study explores rural households' digital abilities and their impact on production efficiency. One thousand eight hundred and seventy households are grouped into digital households (who have access to both digital and traditional channels) and traditional households (who only access traditional channels) based on their access to information channels for comparative analysis. The two‐parameter item response theory is applied to measure digital ability; stochastic frontier models are constructed to test the impact of digital ability on production efficiency; and a stochastic meta‐frontier approach is used to compare the efficiency between groups. The results indicate that: (1) digital households have stronger digital abilities than traditional households. (2) Digital ability is positively correlated with production efficiency. This effect is most evident among traditional households, followed by social households (digital households who use more social channels than nonsocial channels), and finally, nonsocial households (digital households who use more nonsocial channels). (3) Human capital (education, health, and skills) of laborers, off‐farm work, and village internet infrastructure all promote efficiency significantly. Research findings can help policymakers formulate targeted interventions to improve rural households' livelihoods.",

It was posited that Texas's international reputation as a cattle‐producing region could be used to promote Texas beef products. Data for this study were collected in 2019 and 2020 using an online survey of 1021 Mexican food shoppers. The survey included a choice experiment with 12 hypothetical choice scenarios of beef steak with different product attributes and prices. The product attributes considered were place of origin, food safety level, and production practices. Mexican consumers were found to have a strong preference for domestic beef products. Moreover, Mexican consumers are willing to pay $1.16 and $1.18/lb for enhanced food safety and natural production practices. Consumers are also willing to pay $0.19/lb more for US–Texas beef than that of US beef. The results of this project provide valuable information for developing marketing strategies and promotion campaigns aiming to improve the competitiveness of US and Texas beef products in foreign markets [EconLit Citations: D12, Q17, Q18].",

In this study, we examine whether nutrition knowledge training increases rural households' dietary diversity, nutrition intake, and total calorie intake. We consider three macronutrients (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) and three micronutrients (vitamin C, iron, and zinc) to capture nutrition intake. The doubly robust inverse probability weighted regression adjustment estimator is employed to estimate survey data of 765 rural households collected by the Institute of Food and Nutrition Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China. The results show that nutrition knowledge training enhances household dietary diversity, improves the intake of macronutrients in terms of proteins and fats and micronutrients in terms of zinc, and increases total calorie intake. In addition, the intake of nutrients and calories of males responds to nutrition knowledge training while that of females does not. The dietary diversity of females increases with nutrition knowledge training, whereas that of males is unaffected. {EconLit Citations: I12, I18, Q12, E24}.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The popularity of Internet usage in rural China is on the rise while improving the nutritional status of Chinese rural residents remains a major issue due to prevalent unbalanced diets and deficiencies in some nutrients. However, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence linking these two aspects. The relationship between Internet usage and dietary quality remains inconclusive in both developed and developing countries. Using data from a survey of 2053 households in rural China, this paper examines the relationship between Internet usage and dietary quality among Chinese rural residents by employing an endogenous switching regression model to address the issue of selection bias. The empirical results reveal that respondents' gender, age, years of education, and household income significantly influenced their decisions to use the Internet, and Internet usage significantly improve dietary quality of their household. The findings of the heterogeneous analysis show that the impact of Internet usage on dietary quality varies based on respondents' dietary knowledge, per capita annual income, and household food expenditure. Through mechanism analysis, we find that Internet usage can improve the dietary quality by increasing the possibility of online food purchasing and fostering a more positive dietary attitude.

However, mixed results can still be found regarding the determinants and consequences of the implementation of such practices. This study investigates the determinants of environmental proactivity in Spanish wineries, focusing on the role of company size in linking internal motivations and stakeholder pressure with proactive environmental strategy using the natural resource‐based view. So far, no research of this type has been carried out for the Spanish wine sector. A structural equation model is proposed based on partial least squares applied to a sample of 251 wine companies to evaluate both the direct relationships and the moderating effect. The study identifies internal motivations, community pressure, and regulatory pressure as determinants of proactive environmental strategy. Company characteristics play an essential role in decision‐making when dealing with environmental issues proactively. Small companies tend to be more influenced by internal motivations, while larger companies are driven to undertake environmental actions based on external pressures. Additionally, we found that managers who take a proactive approach to environmental protection can achieve financial rewards. These findings provide important implications for both policymakers and managers by offering new theoretical and empirical insight into how proactive environmental strategy affects financial performance in the case of Spain's wine companies.

The study examines how the drought disrupted agricultural shipments out of Louisiana ports and whether the disruption led to trade diversion to other ports. Our findings reveal that shipments out of Louisiana ports were 3.9% or $560 million below the counterfactual between July 2022 and January 2023. In addition, the dynamic treatment estimates provide evidence of immediate trade recovery after the drought receded in October 2022, indicating that the impact of the drought was short‐lived. Wheat exports were the most affected, experiencing a reduction in shipments from Louisiana ports of $150 million and being diverted to US ports on the West Coast. In contrast, corn and soybeans did not experience lasting trade destruction or diversion to other ports. Our analysis also reveals that export prices increased significantly above the counterfactual level at Louisiana ports, suggesting that the drought impacted the supply and export dynamics of agricultural commodities. In conclusion, this paper provides valuable insights into the short‐run implications of natural disasters on agricultural trade. [EconLit Citations: F14, Q17].",

However, the decision to transfer family farmland is influenced not only by macroeconomic policies and farmers' actions but also by the decisions of their adult children. This study investigates how the urbanization of adult children impacts household land transfer decisions. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies from 2012 to 2020, the research employs an Extended Regression Model to analyze this relationship. The findings reveal that adult children's urbanization significantly raises the likelihood of family farmland transfer. Further, heterogeneity analysis finds that this effect is more pronounced in households with smaller families, fewer children, no male offspring, and higher incomes. The study identifies three mechanisms through which adult children's urbanization promotes household farmland transfer: the aging effect, the accompanying migration effect, and the wealth effect.",

The findings reveal a direct positive association between perceived transparency and perceived performance, with a substantial mediation through relationship quality. Moderated mediation analyses underscore the significant roles of supply chain type and buyer type in shaping these relationships. Notably, the association between transparency and performance is more pronounced for farmers engaged in short food supply chains and with privately owned buyers, contexts characterized by lower transparency perceptions. This highlights the potential benefits of enhanced transparency, particularly in such farmer–buyer relationships. This study emphasizes the importance for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to identify and strategically target practices aimed at increasing transparency in agri‐food supply chains.",

This study is dedicated to exploring the reasons why farmers don't adopt online credit from the perspective of perceptions. Based on field survey data involving 698 farmers in Shaanxi province, six constructs derived from the extended theory of planned behavior are designed to identify the specific characteristic typologies of farmers’ online credit perceptions using the K‐means clustering method. Furthermore, the characteristics associated with farmers online credit behavior and intention are examined by an ordered logistic regression model. The results of cluster analysis reveal that five groups with differentiated perception characteristics are partitioned and labeled as (1) Socially influenced non‐believers , (2) Socially independent non‐believers , (3) Just see fraud skeptics/Socially independent skeptics , (4) Suspicious but socially influenced , and (5) Neutral independent and no distinctive perception . The results of ordered logistic regression show that distrust and suspicion among farmers towards online credit have significant relationships with shaping their behavior and intention. Concurrently, it cannot be overlooked the association between subjective norms and farmers’ online credit attitudes and perceptions. Additionally, farmers’ online credit behavior and intention also have correlations with various socio‐demographic factors, including gender, age, education, physical health condition, off‐farm work, and broadband coverage.",

Estimates from the random parameter logit model reveal that health information treatments outperform environmental information treatments in influencing consumer preferences for goat meat. Additionally, the results show that goat‐focused comparative information is more effective than generic information treatment. The market share simulations under different price scenarios suggest decreasing goat meat price to $4/lb. and informing respondents of the health benefits of goat meat over beef can yield up to 21% market share of the total US meat market for goat meat.

The global import demand for beef from major exporters decreases by 7% (Ireland) to 27.6% (Uruguay), underscoring the critical role of transportation costs in shaping international beef trade. Countries like Argentina, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Uruguay experience more than a 20% decrease in global import demand with a doubling of freight rates. Interestingly, despite the proximity of the United States to major markets like China, Japan, and South Korea, beef imports from Brazil and Australia are more impacted by freight rates than U.S. beef.",

Participants sampled four vanilla flavorings, including a vanilla extract made from vanilla beans grown in Florida, a commercially available vanilla extract made from vanilla beans grown in Papua New Guinea, a national‐brand vanilla extract made from vanilla beans grown in Madagascar, and a commonly available synthetic flavoring. Panelists were asked questions related to acceptability and contingent valuation. Mean separation analysis and regression analysis reveal that participants’ willingness to pay (WTP) for the three vanilla extracts are statistically indifferent, suggesting that the country of origin of the beans did not impact WTP for the extract. However, the synthetic flavoring received higher ratings and panelist indicated higher WTP for the synthetic flavoring than some of the vanilla extracts.",

Furthermore, we identify that the operating mechanism is driven by increased nonfarm work participation among peer households. The heterogeneity analysis indicates that the effects of output price risk are especially pronounced in the consumption of herbicides and conditioners and among small‐scale households. In the analysis of typical plots, we further find that agricultural households tend to increase spraying intensity instead of spraying frequency.

This study proposes a modeling framework to analyze the impacts of rising minimum wages and assess their effects on the U.S. produce sector, focusing on the strawberry industry, which confronts both escalating labor costs and competition from low‐cost imports. A structural model with a nested Synthetic Inverse Demand System (SIDS) is employed to analyze how wage increases affect the industry in both short and long terms. Our findings reveal that rising minimum wages will lead to a substantial increase in both the shipments (by 46%) and prices (by 23%) of strawberries from Mexico, the sole competitor of the US industry. As a result, the Mexican strawberry industry will see a significant revenue boost of $420 million (+ 79%). On the other hand, the U.S. strawberry industry could incur a potential revenue loss of up to $304 million (−17.9%).

The interaction between regulatory heterogeneity and SPS harmonization profoundly shapes the dynamics of agricultural trade. From the dual perspectives of regional cooperation and regulatory conflicts, this study analyzes the intricate relationship between regulatory heterogeneity, SPS harmonization under RTAs, and agricultural trade. Using China's agricultural export data (2012–2018), this study empirically examines how the interplay between regulatory heterogeneity and regional SPS harmonization influences China's fruit and vegetable exports. The Ad Valorem Equivalent (AVE) is employed to quantify the economic magnitude of this interaction effect. The results show that the interaction between regulatory heterogeneity and SPS harmonization under RTAs promotes China's fruit and vegetable exports, with an AVE of ‐3.35%. Mechanism analysis indicates that this interplay affects exports by reducing trade costs and lowering mandatory entry thresholds. Heterogeneity analysis further shows that the trade benefits stemming from the interaction are concentrated in exports to low‐standard countries (−5.57%) and vegetable exports (−4.01%).",

The tastes of rural households across regions are unique in their apparent convergence. Overall, ideological differences measured by “political distance” were more strongly associated with changing food taste differences than geographical and supply‐side differences. There is also evidence of divergence in nonfood tastes, but to a much smaller degree.",

This paper explores farmers markets as a business incubator, with a focus on beginning vendors and resilience to a shock, namely, COVID‐19 market restrictions. We investigate how vendor sales vary by the type of products a vendor sells (farm products, processed food, and crafts/art), their attendance, market experience and the presence of COVID‐19 restrictions. We use a unique dataset of 9,371 sales observations from 399 vendors at five small to medium‐sized farmers markets in rural Oregon from 2019 to 2021. We estimate that beginning vendors have, on average, 11% lower sales than established vendors, holding other factors constant. Vendors’ sales, on average, were higher with higher market attendance. Results suggest that farm product vendors have higher sales than processed food and craft and art vendors, larger crowds encourage higher sales, and rainfall lowers sales, all else equal. Individual market day average vendor sales were, on average, 8.9% higher during days with COVID‐19 market restrictions than during days without restrictions, which was likely driven by experienced farm vendors.",

Using data from the 2002 to 2014 Townsend Thai monthly panel survey, the dynamic Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model with cointegration was applied to analyze six food categories: rice, starches, and cereal products, fruits and vegetables, meats, eggs, and dairy, oils and sweets, ready‐to‐eat foods, and alcoholic beverages and tobacco. The findings reveal significant income‐based disparities in food consumption. Low‐income households demonstrate lower sensitivity to price changes, particularly for rice, while nonessential goods, such as ready‐to‐eat instant foods and alcoholic beverages, are more income‐elastic. Demographic factors, such as the age and education of household heads, also play critical roles in influencing preferences for essential versus discretionary items. These results underscore the need for targeted fiscal and educational interventions to moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages and tobacco and enhance food security among the rural Thai population. This study also calls for further investigation of the long‐term impacts of economic shocks and policy interventions on household food demand, providing a foundation for effective policymaking aimed at equitable and sustainable development.",

This is particularly problematic for the agri‐food industry that has significant impacts on the environment and consists mostly of unlisted companies. Thus, by constructing a unique data set of 514 unlisted agri‐food companies in Japan from 2018 to 2024, we investigate the patterns of ESG engagement and its association with economic performance across food supply‐chain sectors and companies' ownership types in the agri‐food industry. We find that ESG practices are more prevalent in the agricultural, food manufacturing, and wholesale sectors than in the retail sector, particularly among independent companies. However, these ESG practices have no influence on total sales in all cases and are negatively associated with net profits in the wholesale sector and among independent companies. These results suggest that ESG implementation may impose economic burdens on unlisted companies, underscoring the need for more effective public support and cross‐sector collaboration.",

In the United States, 10 states and most major retailers have implemented policies or voluntary pledges to transition to 100% cage‐free egg sales. We use best‐worst scaling and discrete choice experiments to evaluate U.S. consumer preferences for various FAW policies, calculate willingness to pay for cage‐free eggs, and simulate the effects of policy implementations on consumers. Our results suggest that consumers generally prefer implementing less restrictive FAW policies, such as farm subsidies and mandatory labeling programs, relative to more restrictive bans on housing practices. However, many consumers still support implementing more stringent policies like bans on cage egg sales when put to a dichotomous choice. In terms of market preferences, results indicate that consumers, on average, are willing to pay premiums for eggs from hens raised in less confined settings. Yet, cage‐free captures the lowest premium if not accompanied by other labels. Simulation of market choices reveals that banning conventional eggs could increase market opt‐out rates by as much as 20% points, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the conventional option to some consumers. These results have marketing and policy implications that can inform stakeholders as they navigate evolving FAW standards.",

However, it is conceivable that a producer markets a product by evoking symbols, images, words, and values typical of places other than where it was designed or produced, creating a “foreign sounding” effect. This study, which focuses on wines available for purchase online, examines whether and to what extent wines with actual or perceived associations with French and Italian production cultures enjoy a price premium. Through an empirical analysis using matched sampling in a multiple treatment framework, this study draws on an original database constructed using web‐scraping and text‐mining techniques. The database contains detailed information on over 17,000 bottles of wine offered online on three major English‐language websites. Controlling for a variety of factors affecting wine performance—at the bottle, winery, and brand level—and segmenting by price range—the analysis finds that Made in France bottles command a price premium. Conversely, Made in Italy, Italian‐sounding, and French‐sounding bottles experience price penalties, with Italian wines suffering greater price penalties than Italian‐sounding alternatives. These results have important implications. For example, wineries that rely on foreign‐sounding branding may face consumer skepticism, leading to price penalties, as observed for French‐sounding wines. Despite this, the better performance of Italian‐sounding labels over Made in Italy wines suggests that certain branding strategies—such as using culturally evocative names—can partially enhance consumer perception even when it is purported.",

These are still at an early stage of development, poorly explored, and the number of participating farmers is low. Our aim is to explain the heterogeneity of farmers' willingness to participate in humus programs by typologizing them according to different design preferences and socioeconomic backgrounds. To this end, we conducted a survey with German farmers including a discrete choice experiment and questions about environmental awareness, profit orientation and farm characteristics. We summarized farmers' attitudes towards for example, climate change with a factor analysis and included the results into the latent class model we used to analyze the discrete choice experiment. The farmers surveyed can be divided into four classes. The results show that the classes differ in the farmers' preferences for the characteristics of a humus program, for example, type of reference value and program duration, and according to the factors of the factor analysis, for example, advocacy of humus programs. The classes distinguish between disinterested and motivated farmers, farmers focusing on safe money and farmers focusing on quick money. With this study, we improve the understanding of farmers' acceptance of humus programs, which is essential before starting targeted (political) efforts.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study advances the literature on sustainable urban agriculture and alternative sustainable food production systems, which have gained momentum due to the need to strengthen regional food supply chains and meet the growing urban demand for fresh food. Indoor agriculture (IA) holds promise for year‐round cultivation of fresh produce even in regions with less favorable climate by using controlled environment technologies. The study evaluates the economic and environmental sustainability potential of IA, advocating for short food supply chains to enhance urban food security. A multiobjective optimization model (IA‐MOO), integrating a bioeconomic model for lettuce production and optimal farm size based on planting schedules and densities, captures IA system dynamics from seeding to sales. The revenue module introduces an endogenously determined price premium for the hyper‐local attribute of IA‐produced crops. Two objectives, expected to present competing solutions, are defined: profitability, measured by earnings before taxes (EBT), and energy use efficiency (EUE). A coefficient of economies of scale was adopted to encapsulate capital investment and operating costs across farm sizes. To capture the social benefits of reduced food miles, IA‐MOO optimizes farm location relative to urban centers. It evaluates tradeoffs between land cost, transportation cost, and a hyper‐local price premium for IA crops produced within urban areas. Results indicated that EBT and EUE are generally not conflicting objectives, except for a short production schedule frame. This study provides insights into optimizing IA systems contributing to the sustainable development of urban agriculture and advancing the goal of sustainable food production for urban populations.",

To address this gap, this study utilizes micro‐data from 1100 kiwifruit farmers in Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces, the primary producers of kiwifruit in China. Applying the bilateral stochastic frontier model, this study measures and analyzes the sales bargaining power of farmers within the kiwifruit trading market. Using a counterfactual framework based on the propensity score matching method, the study examines the impact of organizational participation on farmers' sales bargaining power and its underlying mechanisms. The findings reveal that the actual transaction price of kiwifruit is, on average, 2.11% lower than the benchmark price due to the bargaining power disparity between farmers and buyers. Moreover, the distribution of farmers' surplus, acquirers' surplus, and net surplus demonstrates significant heterogeneity across varying levels of education, cultivation sizes, and marketing channels. Organizational participation is found to enhance farmers' sales bargaining power by 0.017, with the results remaining robust after a series of validity tests. Furthermore, organizational participation can effectively mitigate information asymmetry among the hierarchical actors within the industry chain, reduce production costs, and broaden sales channels, thereby enhancing farmers' bargaining power in the marketplace.",

Drawing on a comprehensive survey of 99 small banana farmers associated with six cooperatives, the study employs Structural Equation Modeling (PLS‐SEM) to examine how SS criteria contribute to the economic dimension of sustainability, using banana agribusinesses in Magdalena (Colombia) as a case study. The findings reveal a strong and statistically significant correlation between SS criteria and the economic dimension of sustainability. Specifically, Market conditions were identified as the most influential factor shaping sustainability in this context. Meanwhile, Business partnerships exert moderate effects, whereas Local development shows no appreciable impact. SS have the potential to enhance market and financial access, and economic sustainability for small‐scale farmers; however, its success depends on targeted interventions and robust partnerships within agri‐food value chains. These findings provide policy recommendations for developing strategies to improve the sustainability performance of small‐scale producers and promote their sustainable growth. Future research should adopt longitudinal approaches and explore the interconnected economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability to gain a more comprehensive understanding of SS impacts on agriculture.",

However, during the transformation process, these emerging scale farms often face significant credit constraints and technical inefficiency, which could become major obstacles to the high‐quality development of Chinese agriculture. To assess the impact of credit constraints and technical inefficiency on scale farms' output, we use the indirect production function approach in the stochastic frontier framework and based on data from a survey of 667 scale farms engaged in wheat production. The empirical results show that actual farm expenditures are on average 20% below the desired level, and the average technical efficiency is 0.78, indicating that farm output decreased by 17% and 22%, respectively, due to expenditure constraints and technical inefficiency. Furthermore, farm output losses increased for both reasons during the sample period. In addition, the land area of scale farms has a significant positive correlation with the degree of expenditure constraints and appears to have a U ‐shaped relationship with technical inefficiency.",

As the first academic study, we ranked the OO attributes in Asia using a best‐worst scaling to determine the relative importance of COO and examined consumer heterogeneity using the latent class logit model. The study finds that COO is not the highest priority for Japanese consumers, similar to other minor OO‐producing countries. The characteristics of consumers who value quality and price are also similar in Japan and other countries. However, unlike other countries, the study identifies specific attributes consistently prioritized across three different consumer segments. Such uniform OO preference suggests that consumer diversity in Japan may be limited, where OO consumption is not typical. This point is also related to the global determinants of OO consumption, so research on BWS in other Asian countries, the demand of OO is sharply growing, is needed. The development of these attributes in the study also provides a framework for future research in the region.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Climate variability is affecting the productivity, profitability, and resilience of smallholder dairy producers in developing countries. The adoption of climate‐smart (CS) dairy practices has been promoted to mitigate these negative effects. However, while interest in dairy CS practices is growing, empirical evidence on their adoption patterns and impact on key farm performance indicators, particularly cost of production and gross margin, remains limited. Moreover, the influence of adoption drivers appears to be highly context‐specific, underscoring the need for more nuanced and rigorous analysis. This study evaluates the impact of adopting seventeen CS dairy practices, grouped into four dominant clusters, on milk yield, variable production costs and gross margin. The analysis is based on a cross‐sectional survey of 665 smallholder dairy farmers across three milksheds in Kenya. Latent class analysis is employed to group the practices into dominant clusters. The multinomial endogenous treatment effects model is used to estimate the effects of those clusters on milk yield, variable production costs and gross margin, while accounting for selection bias and endogeneity stemming from both observed and unobserved heterogeneity across households. The findings reveal that belonging to any of the four clusters is influenced by access to and frequency of extension services from various providers. There is significant variability in milk yield, production costs and gross margin across the clusters. These results underscore the need for targeted policy interventions to enhance smallholder dairy productivity, profitability, and resilience amid climate variability.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Mekong Delta (MKD), Vietnam has achieved high rice productivity through rapid intensification. However, this progress has led to environmental degradation and adverse economic and health effects. To mitigate these challenges, sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) have been promoted. While previous studies have examined SAPs' economic impacts on farmers, their labor implications remain underexplored. This study investigates how the adoption of SAPs affects labor requirements in rice production in Vietnam's MKD. Specifically, it examines the impact of adopting multiple SAPs (seed rate reduction, fertilizer reduction combined with organic fertilizer, pesticide reduction, and water reduction) on total labor demand, labor sources (family or hired), and gender participation. Using cross‐sectional survey data from 152 rice farmers and applying a multinomial endogenous treatment effect model, the analysis reveals that full adoption of all four SAPs significantly reduces labor demand by 29% compared to non‐adopters. Partial adoption yields smaller labor‐saving effects. The reduction is more pronounced for hired labor than for family labor, with minimal involvement of female family members in rice production. These findings suggest that promoting comprehensive SAPs adoption can lower labor requirements and improve rice yields, offering a pathway to more sustainable and economically viable rice farming in the MKD.",

The spiral of silence explains the formation of public perception wherein vocal individuals play a significant role. We use the spiral of silence theory to understand the perception of gene‐edited (GE) vis‐à‐vis genetically modified (GM) technologies. Herein, we compare the vocal individuals' knowledge and acceptance of GE vis‐a‐vis GM technologies within and across plant and animal products to those of nonvocal individuals. We find that vocal individuals have relatively lower knowledge about GE than GM than nonvocal individuals. We also observe that vocal individuals are less likely to accept GE products than GM products. This may be due to an anchoring effect of GM technology, which is spilling over to GE technologies, negatively impacting public perception of GE technologies. Finally, vocal individuals are less likely to accept animal products than plants in the context of both GM and GE compared to nonvocal individuals. Our study recommends that communication strategies address both the content and the audience of awareness campaigns. Specifically, efforts should focus on educating the public about GE technologies, particularly GE animal products and on targeting vocal individuals to improve overall acceptance.",

How these benefits influence consumer choice and perceived value of native versus introduced plants is not well understood. Additionally, the geographic location of the consumer may influence his/her preferences for native species. The present study used an online survey with a discrete choice experiment to elicit regional differences in 2011 U.S. consumers’ preferences for native and introduced woody ornamental plant species with fall colour, fruit, and flower characteristics. Results suggest preferences for native plants versus introduced plants rely heavily on the specific type of plant presented, likely due to differences in aesthetics and preferences. Generally, participants had stronger preferences for native plants than introduced species. However, some differences arose. In the fruit and flower aesthetic benefits, one of the native species was valued more than the introduced species, while in the fall colour aesthetic one of the native species was valued less than the introduced species. Regional differences were noted. Industry implications include clearly articulating when a native plant is presented in the retail centre to allow customers to make informed decisions based on their own values and to highlight plant benefits that align with regional needs.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Zinc rice has the potential to address zinc deficiency, which can lead to impaired growth, compromised immune function, and various other health issues, particularly among vulnerable populations like women of reproductive age and children. However, concerns exist regarding its nutrition retention, as processing and storage may reduce its zinc content, potentially limiting its effectiveness. Ensuring sufficient consumer acceptance and market adoption of zinc rice is crucial for maximizing its positive public health impact. This study investigates the effects of sequential information framing—whether positive information is provided first or negative information comes first—and recency bias on consumer valuations of zinc rice using a non‐hypothetical laboratory experiment involving 400 participants. Our findings indicate that the sequence of information presented significantly affects consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for zinc rice. Specifically, initial positive information results in higher valuations; however, the subsequent negative information neutralizes these positive effects. Interestingly, when consumers are first exposed to negative information followed by positive details, their valuations of zinc rice increase significantly. Notably, the recency bias plays an important role, as the last piece of information presented has a stronger effect on consumer valuation. The results suggest that marketing and informational campaign strategies should emphasize potential risks, followed by health benefits, to enhance consumer demand for zinc rice.",

A valid sample of 510 respondents (88.6% from coastal regions) was analyzed using structural equation modeling with bootstrap‐mediated path analysis. Key findings reveal: (1) Emotional attitude ( β = 1.495, p &lt; 0.001) exerted a significantly stronger direct effect on WTP than cognitive assessment ( β = 0.273, p &lt; 0.05), validating affective dominance in crisis contexts; (2) Sociocultural factors indirectly amplified WTP through emotional attitude ( β = 0.981, p &lt; 0.001), while market information influenced WTP via cognitive assessment; (3) Product awareness positively impacted emotional attitude ( β = 0.075, p &lt; 0.05). Theoretically, the research expands the S‐O‐R framework by integrating nuclear‐risk contexts and cultural schemas, demonstrating emotion‐behavioral primacy under crises. Practically, enhancing blockchain‐based traceability systems—particularly for coastal consumers—could significantly elevate WTP, advising regionally differentiated policies (e.g., real‐time radiation certifications for coastal zones, subsidized labels for inland markets). Notable limitations include regional sampling bias, reliance on self‐reported data, and a cross‐sectional design, warranting future longitudinal, cross‐regional, and mixed‐method studies.",

We develop a theoretical model to illustrate how farmers decide to adopt rooftop PV systems. The empirical analysis is based on a population‐based sample of livestock and poultry farms drawn from the 2020 agriculture census survey in Taiwan. We address potential endogeneity bias using several treatment effect models based on the selection‐on‐observable approach to identify the relationship between rooftop PV installation and farm revenue. We find that more educated farm operators and farms located in areas with higher density of electrical substations are more likely to adopt PV. Furthermore, PV adopters report higher farm product sales and greater labor use in farm activities. These findings imply that rooftop PV adoption could provide a mutually beneficial opportunity to enhance photovoltaic generation and improve farm revenue.",

Most of the malnourished and food‐insecure people live in poor rural communities, where farming is the main livelihood activity. Using robust data collected from a random cross‐sectional sample of 268 households, we investigate whether farmers' involvement in agricultural diversification contributes to dietary diversity and quality in poor rural Türkiye. We also examine whether market participation influences the association between agricultural diversification and dietary diversity and quality. The results illustrate a statistically significant influence of five agricultural diversification indicators on three dietary diversity and quality indices over a 24‐h recall period, with the livestock richness score more strongly correlated across different dietary diversity and quality indices than the crop richness score. Furthermore, we find that the heterogeneous associations between market participation and agricultural diversification significantly influence higher dietary diversity and quality indices over a 24‐h recall period. Own production of tubers and livestock (meat) increased dietary diversity and quality, while the own production of olive crops (oils) did not increase dietary diversity. Own production of tubers significantly increased own consumption of tubers, while own production of cereals, tubers, vegetables, meat, egg, milk and dairy, and oils food groups significantly increased own consumption of other food groups. The overall influence of agricultural diversification on households' dietary diversity and quality in poor rural Türkiye is modest, mainly due to the low levels of diversification.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In developing countries, there have been numerous challenges in ensuring food safety in food systems. Unsafe and poor‐quality foods lead to public health concerns of greater negative consequences. Particularly, the fruits and vegetables consumed raw as a salad are more susceptible to causing foodborne illnesses when contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. Ensuring safer food entails commitment from all involved in the food systems. However, little is known about how producers perceive the extra costs associated with implementing food safety measures at the farm and market levels in developing countries. Using a nationwide primary survey in Nepal, this study investigates how willing commercial vegetable producers are to invest in food safety. To elicit this information, we employed a bidding experiment among 1052 commercial vegetable growers across 10 districts of seven provinces in Nepal. We assessed growers' willingness to accept (WTA) additional costs for food safety using multiple dichotomous choice questions for bounds and interval regression method. Our model prediction shows a positive WTA of around 13% additional costs in adopting food safety. Results indicate that improving access to credit and financial support, enhancing educational and awareness programs on food safety, efforts on risk management, and appropriate market channels would be key considerations to enhance farmers' investment in food safety.",

On average, the WTP was highest for minced meat. The WTP for the plant‐based proteins was rarely statistically and economically different from the opt‐out option. We found significant preference heterogeneity, especially for the plant‐based options, which suggests that taking individual preferences into consideration could be important for achieving a more substantial shift towards plant‐based proteins. Policy scenarios are investigated by estimating market shares following the implementation of a meat tax. There is some potential for the meat tax to reduce meat consumption. However, the predicted market shares for plant‐based proteins do not substantially increase with the meat tax.",

This is a highly relevant case study because of the increasingly significant challenge that herbicide resistance poses worldwide as well as due to the increase in private and social costs associated with the market failure resulting from laissez faire. We find that the way the payoff from the decision is framed has a statistically significant impact on the probability that a randomly chosen individual coordinates, but such impact is not economically significant. However, we also find that the aggregation of responses disguises important underlying differences in how individuals responded to changes in the games' framing. We discovered that a large share of farmers exhibited a type of behavior that could be hypothesized to be induced by time pressure, which has been found to cause reversal of (prospect theory) preferences. When considering the responses that do not show such a reversal —to make the case more favorable for framing — we find that the impact on the probability that a randomly chosen individual coordinates and on the maximum coordination threshold tend to be larger but are still of rather little economic significance. This finding suggests that highlighting the potential benefits of coordination in terms of reducing losses is unlikely to have a major impact to incentivize collective action against herbicide‐resistant weeds.",

We find that consumers exhibit a stronger aversion to delivered meals from virtual restaurants. Furthermore, virtual restaurants and well‐known branded restaurants or live kitchens exhibit offsetting effects, leading to a lower combined consumer willingness to pay when these attributes coexist compared to each of them appearing separately. Conversely, virtual restaurants demonstrate complementary effects with positive or neutral consumer ratings. Simulation results indicate that combinations of single or multiple attributes contribute to alleviating potential consumer welfare losses associated with delivered meals from virtual restaurants, and mitigating their adverse impacts on market shares. Management strategies aimed at promoting restaurant diversity could focus on understanding these offsetting and complementary effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article addresses three issues related to Japanese dairy demand analysis. First, an econometric fluid milk demand model is estimated using store‐level daily scanner data to determine whether the own‐price elasticities are significantly different from previous estimates based on aggregate market‐level data. This is important because of the current debate among Japanese dairy industry leaders concerning whether fluid milk is price inelastic or elastic. Own‐price elasticity differences between fresh and reconstituted milk products are also examined. Second, milk product cross‐price elasticities are estimated to measure the degree, if any, of substitutability between fresh milk and reconstituted milk products. Because most previous studies have relied upon aggregate market‐level data, there are no previous estimates of cross‐price elasticities for fresh milk and reconstituted milk products. Finally, price–cost margin ratios are estimated for each commodity using a method that does not require cost data, but rather relies on assumptions regarding the degree of competition to derive the price–cost margin ratio [Econlit alphanumeric subject codes: Q110, Q130]. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

The US “registration” system, which allows limited distinctness, provides weaker protection than European “examination” systems. Some evidence indicates the US system provides inadequate protection while European systems may release too few varieties. The recent UPOV “initial variety” system should use high initial variety standards to discourage breeders from delaying introductions. UPOV 1991 makes seed saving a national option; preliminary results indicate seed saving does not unduly reduce breeders' profits, but may lead to growers unprofitably delaying replacing seed [Econ-Lit citations: Q130, K390]. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

New food products encompass both truly new branded or value‐added products and nontraditional food and agricultural products introduced from another region or culture. Bass's new‐product diffusion theory is integrated with economic demand models to develop simple diffusion–demand models to account, simultaneously, for the diffusion process and for the traditional effects of price and income. Models are tested using widely available aggregate trade data on nontraditional fruits consumed in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, France, and England. Dynamic diffusion–demand models outperform both the standard diffusion model and the static double‐log demand model—in and out of sample—and produced parameter estimates for price and income that differ from those obtained with models without a diffusion process.

We graphically decompose the economic rents accruing to each level participant in the marketing channel. Different strategies of several major sugar producing, processing, and refining entities with regard to sugar quota policy are explored. Firms that are integrated from sugar production through to sugar marketing are less impacted by freer trade than are those that concentrate solely on production. We contrast the sugarcane industry in Florida and Louisiana with sugar beet production and processing in the northern plains. The sugar industry in Florida, because of the high degree of vertical integration, is much more capable of dealing with expanded sugar imports than either sugarcane producers in Louisiana or sugar beet growers in the northern plains where integration is not as pronounced.

We also investigated the possibility of forecast encompassing among competing models. In general, the dynamic VECM model performed best, followed by the simple causal DGM model. Among three static systems, the AIDS model slightly leads the competition. Furthermore, this article provides the first evidence in literature on whether imposition of homogeneity restrictions on a cointegration space can improve the forecast accuracy of a VECM model: it does when it holds.

The collection of the check‐offs and the programs they are used to fund have implications for the welfare of consumers, other producers, and taxpayers in addition to their effects on those producers who are allowed to vote in the procedures for authorizing the programs. As well as simple fairness or equity considerations, such shifting of the incidence of benefits and costs to others can lead to a divergence between producer and national optimal choices, and hence efficiency losses. From a public policy perspective, then, the implications for others ought to be considered in the design of the enabling legislation, in the evaluation of the specific programs, and in the rules governing the behavior of the agricultural producer groups engaged in commodity check‐off programs.

None of these forms of synchronisation is supported empirically, however.

We highlight that these new organizations were chosen because of the lower degree of acceptance by the retailers of the asymmetry of information on quality, generally to their discredit, and in order to protect their reputation. Nevertheless, even in the case of products where the risk of acquiring a bad batch is particularly problematic for retailers, the latter do not seek to create bilateral governances systems directly with the producers, a situation that can lead to high tensions with the producers.

Historical decomposition of retail‐level price series aids in explaining the behavior of beef prices in a neighborhood (period‐by‐period time interval) of the three events. This is based on an application of directed acyclic graphs, constructing orthogonal innovations to determine causal patterns behind contemporaneous innovations. The results show that the beef safety and animal health events had different negative impacts on Japanese retail beef prices, suggesting that consumers understood and differentiated among the health risks. The results provide incentives for beef producers and retailers to inform consumers proactively about ongoing beef safety and animal health measures. Understanding consumer reaction to BSE, FMD, and E. coli helps the beef industry restore consumer confidence after future crises, and provides policy makers a basis for countermeasures and compensations.

    "abstract": "Abstract Much previous research has examined the role of concentration, level of service, and entry barriers on U.S. food retailing profits and prices. Despite the rapid advancement of food supercenters, public policy research evaluating their price impacts remains quite limited. The purpose this study is to examine the price impacts from supercenter entry, growing supercenter market share, and supermarket consolidation from 1993–2003. Findings were that both the market share of supercenter food sales and the marginal impact of supercenter entry did not have a significant impact on food prices in the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) analyzed. These are important findings in light of claims that supercenters entry causes a procompetitive effect. Futhermore, changes in market concentration was significantly and positively related to price changes. Therefore, it appears consolidation led to higher prices and any merger‐related cost gains during this period were not passed on to consumers.

Cluster analysis of the part‐worth utilities revealed three consumer segments: price conscious consumers; consumers focused on naturalness; and those focused on animal health. Segments do not appear to differ on the basis of socioeconomic and demographic profile of respondents. However, multiitem scales reflecting attitudes towards production systems vary significantly across segments. Price‐conscious respondents show agreement with use of medication and express concern over quality. Respondents in the naturalness segment express concern over quality, locality of production and impact of production methods on own health. Animal‐health‐conscious respondents show agreement with the use of medications, concern over quality, locality and impact of production methods on own health, but neutrality towards byproducts and traditional production methods.

    "abstract": "Abstract The authors examine the supply response of the Greek broiler market. A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) process is used to estimate expected price and price volatility; price and supply equations are estimated jointly. In addition to the standard GARCH model, several different symmetric, asymmetric, and nonlinear GARCH models are estimated. These models use different conditional variance specifications (linear or nonlinear) to grasp some additional empirical regularity of data like asymmetry. Asymmetric price volatility means that different volatility is recorded in the case of a fall in prices than an increase in prices by the same amount. The possible existence of asymmetry in the producer's price volatility gives useful information about market structure and possible market power. The empirical results indicate that among the estimated GARCH models the nonlinear asymmetric GARCH model (NAGARCH) seems to better describe producers' price volatility of the Greek broiler industry. Furthermore, the empirical findings show that price volatility is an important risk factor and broiler feed price is the most significant cost factor of the supply response function. Finally, the model provides forecasts for quantity supplied, producers' price, and price volatility. [EconLit. Classifications: Q110, C510, D200]. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This study employs also a comparison of dynamic with static inefficiency measures to address the importance of accounting for adjustment costs when measuring a firm's inefficiency. Dynamic and static cost inefficiencies and their decomposition into technical, allocative, and scale inefficiency are derived using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Results show that firms’ low levels of dynamic cost inefficiency are mainly due to dynamic allocative inefficiency rather than technical and scale inefficiency. The 2008 financial crisis appears to hamper firms’ dynamic technical performance, but has also a positive influence on the dynamic allocative and scale inefficiencies. We further show that the average static measures tend to underestimate all inefficiency components compared to dynamic counterparts. [EconLit citations: C61, D61, L66].",

    "abstract": "Understanding market competition and consumer preferences are important first steps in developing a business. In a competitive market, the effectiveness of the various elements of a firm's marketing mix depends not only on the absolute value of each element but also on the relative values of the elements with respect to the firm's position in the market. In this paper, we analyze the demand structure and market positions of a variety of seafood products in the French retail market. We used a labeled choice experiment to analyze 12 seafood species. The choice options were labeled by the names of the seafood, providing researchers the opportunity to analyze the competitive interactions among the species. Competitive clout and vulnerability measures were estimated for each species as summary measures of species competition. These measures were calculated from cross- and own-elasticities and reveal that salmon and cod have the strongest market position, while monkfish and pangasius have the weakest. In general, the demand for seafood is moderately sensitive to price (market elasticity of −1.31). Large size and low-income households, female consumers, people in the age range 35–44 years, and self-employed consumers are the most sensitive to price. Four segments were identified and described in terms of both consumer characteristics and preferences. Our results are meaningful for producers and retailers to develop marketing strategies and production plans. [EconLit citations: D12, M21, Q13].",

U.S. residents ( n = 818) were randomly assigned to see one of two best–worst presentations of the same six meat attributes (taste, convenience, safety, animal welfare, price, and nutrition). Significant differences were found in the estimated preference shares when respondents were shown two versus three attributes at a time. Both presentations ranked safety as the most important, taste as the second most important, and convenience as the least important meat purchasing attribute. However, the distributions of most of the preference share estimates were statistically different. Differences in preferences share estimates resulting from the presentation of questions has the potential to influence marketing, retailing, and other decisions. [EconLit citations: C83, M31, Q13]",

Each panelist responded to a sensory evaluation questionnaire, and then bid on the samples in an incentive compatible second price auction. We found that panelists’ bids increased with the amount of information given. Also, we found that for some attributes such as sweetness, panelists preferred levels closer to their ideal rather than objectively measured higher levels. When evaluating consumers’ preference and valuation for different fresh fruit varieties, a greater explanatory power is obtained when including an indicator variable for the variety along with the set of quality attributes. The indicator variable could improve the control of inherent factors related with the varieties but cannot be observed or inferred easily. Finally, our findings add to previous studies in that flavor, when expressed as a combination of sweetness and acidity in addition to textural attributes, are important determinants of consumers’ acceptance.

China's trade policies significantly impact U.S. farmers and agribusinesses and vice‐versa as seen from the recent U.S.–China trade dispute. In 2015, China began initiating a trade diversification strategy to increase trade with nations other than the United States. This research investigates the impacts of China's expanding global meat suppliers on its meat import demand, as well as on the relative competitiveness of U.S. meat exporters to China. Our meat import demand model is unique, in which it uses a restricted source‐differentiated almost ideal demand system that accounts for differentiation by source country and across meat products. Although the U.S. was the dominant source for China's meat imports previously, price and expenditure elasticities suggest that suppliers such as Australia, Brazil, the EU, Uruguay, and Argentina have the largest potential for China's meat market.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The recent announcement in the UK by the largest supermarket chain (Tesco) of a sustained reduction in prices across a range of own‐label products has once again focused attention on the issue of the nature of price competition between supermarkets. In this article, the authors inform the discussion on the issue of price competition through analysis of the interaction in the pricing behavior for fresh produce of two leading UK supermarkets, Tesco and Sainsbury's, over a 10‐year period with the purpose of improving understanding of how they compete and the possible policy implications. Of particular interest is whether the nature of the interaction in pricing behavior between the two retailers changed as they moved from a situation where they had relatively similar market shares to one where Tesco became the dominant force in retailing in the UK. Through the literature possible price‐leadership models are investigated and their empirical characteristics identified. The empirical analysis consisted of the investigation of price leadership using Granger causality tests on the series. In addition, due to the nature of the findings, interrelationships between the supermarket prices were modelled by means of vector autoregressive models for each product and the simulation of interactions between retailers using impulse‐response functions. Though no clear evidence of systematic price leadership from Tesco to Sainsbury's was found, the results point to a strengthening interrelationship between the pricing of the two supermarkets over the period for a number of the products examined, which may be a result of the increased use of price checking across supermarket chains as a competitive tool.

We find that the calorie content posting lead to the highest calorie reduction, but it was also the only treatment associated with a significant reduction in the fiber content of the meal. The complete nutrition‐facts panel treatment resulted in most sizable decreases in problematic nutrient content such as empty calories and calories from fat and added sugar. The health‐related claims treatment led to a reduction in carbohydrates and calories from fat. The nutrient density of selected meals remained mostly unchanged across all treatments, but the empty calories proportion of total calories was reduced in the nutrition‐facts and health‐related claims treatments, with the latter also leading to some reduction in added sugar density.

We use pre‐harvest forward contract bids from 1977 to 2013 in Illinois to estimate the cost of forward contracting corn and soybeans. Prior to 2007, it cost 1.55% of the October spot price or 3.74 cents/bushel on average to forward contract corn at the end of February. In 2007–2013, a period of high price volatility, the average cost increased to 3.31% or 16.40 cents/bushel. In the soybean market, before 2007 the average cost was 0.77% or 6.26 cents/bushel and thereafter increased to 1.46% or 15.62 cents/bushel. Default risk does not appear to be a determinant of forward contracting cost. However, evidence suggests that the higher cash flow risk associated with volatile market prices is likely to be the main driving cause of increasing forward contracting costs observed after 2007.

Growing too rapidly can sacrifice financial soundness, causing a business to effectively grow broke. The objective of this study is to examine whether or not U.S. grain marketing and farm supply cooperatives are able to manage their recent growth. To do so, we apply the sustainable growth rate (SGR) and sustainable growth challenge (SGC) metrics to a unique panel data set of United States cooperatives. Examining the SGRs for these cooperatives suggests that positive net profit margins are key to positive growth. When actual growth exceeds sustainable growth, most cooperatives are able to rapidly alleviate this difference through increasing leverage or operational efficiency. However, some cooperatives face more persistent growth challenges and are thus the most at risk of growing broke. Large cooperatives and cooperatives more dependent on farm supply sales rely heavily on leverage for managing growth.",

Therefore, tracking and forecasting market prices are important tasks in agrimanagement, by which the production schedule can be adjusted to increase profit. An agricultural internet platform was developed as an integrated cloud service for market tracking. To quantitatively forecast online pig trading, in this study, a short‐term forecasting model of the pig price index was developed; the model automatically retrieved historical data as a training data set and determined the price index forecast with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithm for a time‐series analysis. The mean square error (MSE) of the AR(1) model for predicting the pig price index in Henan Province was 159.010, and the MSE of the ARIMA(1,1) model for predicting pig price index in Fujian Province was 92.294. The results demonstrated that the error between the predicted calculation and verification test results was small, and the results efficiently improved the prediction accuracy (EconLit citations: C6, L86, Q1).",

The results also show that US exports are not negatively affected by the distance from the importer (higher differentiation), while the impact of distance on the Iranian pistachio trade is negative. The results reveal that stricter food safety requirements are positive for both producing countries, regardless of their level of economic development, resulting in a “win–win” scenario. However, the findings also confirm that other variables, such as distance, the role of producers' associations and quality perception, should be considered. [EconLit citations: F10, F63, I18, Q17].",

The group of the states with a high competitive position of their food industry included the Netherlands, France, Spain, and Denmark. In the case of the Netherlands and France, this fact was determined, above all, by their high share in the export world, and in the case of Spain and Denmark, their significant comparative advantage. A considerable market share was also characteristic of Germany, which was ultimately classified as a country with a medium competitive position due to a relatively small importance of the industry in the entire export of this country.

The applied model follows the principle of aggregating all the costs of producing, transporting, and processing food crops on the different levels of the supply chains and increasing the non‐GM price premium of the final product for each level. Results indicate that ensuring coexistence results in a price some 7.4% to 13.8% higher for non‐GM food products depending on assumed segregation strategies in the two agri‐food supply chains analyzed. Altogether this study substantiates the suggestion that costs of GMO‐related coexistence in the food sector can only be traced by a case‐by‐case analysis and are influenced by multiple, dynamically changing factors [EconLit Subject Descriptors: L660, Q180].",

Empirical results confirm strong and positive brand advertising spillover effects across brands belonging to the same company as well as negative spillover effects from advertising by competitors. Empirical results also indicate that the CES advertising production function outperforms the linear function, providing strong support for decreasing returns to scale in advertising and imperfect substitution between brand advertising and advertising of other brands in the same company. Finally, the CES function results in significantly higher estimates of the price elasticities of demand as well as lower estimated markups. [EconLit citations L13, L66, M37].",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Childhood obesity has emerged as a critical national policy issue in many countries. One challenge in combating childhood obesity via induced shifts toward a healthier diet is that the majority of food consumed by younger children is purchased or prepared by someone else, i.e., a parent. Hence, it is critical to design initiatives and marketing efforts aimed at affecting parents' purchases of healthy foods for their children. In this study, we focus on the potential of front‐of‐package health labels specifically designed to signal to parents those foods that are healthy for children. We report results of a choice experiment administered to 733 parents. In the experiments, branded and unbranded yogurts marketed to children are considered with different health labels. In our analysis, we control for the child's body mass index (BMI) to assess how labels affect parents' food choices in the context of varying BMI data for the children. We also include whether parents worried about their children's eating patterns react differently to the labeling. Results from two multinomial logit models indicate that parents prefer and are more likely to purchase yogurts with a label denoting the food is a healthy choice for children. Critically, we find parents with children who are overweight or obese, and hence already in the high‐risk category due to their body weight, are most affected by the labels. Overall, results indicate that health labels can be an effective signal and marketing effort to nudge parents of overweight or obese children toward healthier food purchase.

We find that 66% of farm households reduced their daily on‐farm family labor supply during the lockdown, by on average almost 40% compared with prelockdown levels. Changes in on‐farm family labor supply differed by key pre‐Covid‐19 household characteristics. Farm households that were engaged in crop marketing decreased their on‐farm family labor supply by an average of 3–4 h/day.

    "abstract": "Abstract Transformation of the previous centrally growth‐oriented economic systems to a sustainable bio‐economy is a global political trend, where public policy is a key factor in making this successful. Designing effective and efficient policies requires understanding the linkages between policy choices and outcomes. Most existing studies are missing a direct link to policy choices and ignore fundamental model uncertainty present in policy analysis. We empirically estimate a sector‐specific, nested two‐stage policy impact function to address these shortcomings. We apply a Bayesian estimation approach that combines existing statistical data with a priori information from political experts, thus reducing data and estimation problems. This is linked with a Computable General Equilibrium to model the entire link from policies to outcomes. We derive a theoretical framework that allows the definition of indicators for key sectors of an efficient Pro‐Poor‐Growth strategy. In our generalized framework, we show that indicators based only on growth‐poverty linkages might be misleading. To deal with model uncertainty inherent in the application, we derive a set of metamodels via simulations conducted under different model parameter settings and apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Applying Bayesian model selection allows drawing statistical inferences on competing models to generate relatively robust policy‐relevant messages even under model uncertainty. The approach is empirically applied to Ghana, Senegal, and Uganda, analyzing the allocation of public spending on agriculture under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme.

Based on a path analysis, we assess the relative strength of the indirect effects of sugar‐reduction claims mediated by health and taste perceptions, as well as the direct effects on purchase intention. The results indicate that sugar‐reduction claims decrease taste perceptions, increase health perceptions, and have only minor negative effects on product liking, but increase purchase intentions. Most participants show an implicit “unhealthy = tasty” intuition, which can be offset by moderate to high health consciousness. The implications for marketing and policymakers are twofold. First, our study shows that sugar‐reduction claims are effective in addressing the original target group of health‐conscious consumers. Second, our results suggest that the health–taste tradeoff is not prohibitively detrimental to purchase intentions among less health‐conscious consumers.

We collect data using a survey tool in Qualtrics designed to explore the impact of information dissemination through two distinct narrative styles: scientific and layman. The study uses a between‐subjects approach and apply the propensity score matching to address potential confounding factors across respondents' samples. We apply the generalized multinomial logit models in WTP space, taking into consideration respondent's certainty when answering to the choice experiment questions. Our findings reveal that respondents are willing to pay less for apples treated with irradiation compared to untreated ones but more than apples treated with chemicals. The WTP for irradiation increases when respondents receive information about this technology from both the scientific and layperson narrative styles. Similar to findings in previous studies, WTP for irradiated food is affected by gender, age, income, family size, and level of education. This study contributes to the literature by identifying the key factors that strongly influence consumers' decisions to opt for irradiation‐treated fresh fruits. These influential factors encompass information provision, social and demographic aspects, as well as the presence of country‐of‐origin labels. EconLit citations: C250, D820, Q160, Q180.",

Further, all states have implemented some form of local labeling program to increase local purchasing. As states expand the reach of these programs, the programs begin to compete as awareness and perception move across state lines. Using an online survey to study consumers in the Southeastern United States, we look to identify how state labeling programs are viewed in nearby states. Notably, we assess awareness, perception, and its impact on the local definition of these programs in their “home” state as well as nearby states. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of nine Southeastern state‐level branding programs. Our results indicate that consumers are more aware of their home state's local label, but awareness does exist for other states' labels. We also find that a home state label moves some consumers to a more state‐level local boundary, while seeing another state's label increases the boundary for what is perceived as local [EconLit Citation: Q13].",

Our estimated results suggest extreme heat is associated with a decrease in worker wages, and that these welfare losses could be attributed to the adverse impacts of extremely hot days on worker productivity. We also observe that, compared to male workers, female workers are more likely to bear wage losses when exposed to extremely hot weather. Furthermore, workers in private firms may experience more wage losses due to extremely hot days than those in other ownership types. Regarding the industry‐level heterogeneity analysis, we find that wage losses in the agri‐food manufacturing industry are more severe than those in the agri‐food processing industry, while no significant wage losses are observed in the beverages and alcohol industry. In the long term, wage losses induced by climate change are projected to rise by 10.93% under RCP8.5, if no extra adaptation actions are implemented. [EconLit Citations: O13, P46, Q54]",

For the analysis, the Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes model was applied for estimations using product‐level purchasing data. The main analysis results are as follows. First, consumers prefer brands with lower prices, higher protein, lower fat, lower carbohydrates, and foods for specified health uses (FOSHU). Second, from the value of own‐price elasticity of market shares, the higher the price of a brand, the more sensitively consumers respond to price. From the value of the cross‐price elasticity of market shares, strong competition exists among FOSHU brands, and the price of R‐1 drink types tends to significantly impact the market shares of brands other than FOSHU brands. Third, the market power of each brand tends to be higher for lower‐priced brands and lower for higher‐priced brands. In terms of market power by manufacturer, Meiji has the highest both the weighted average and median values. However, both the weighted average and median values of Danone Japan are relatively lower than those of other manufacturers. Fourth, in terms of each brand's market power, brands with low prices and FOSHU labeling have high market power. These findings suggest that the acquisition of FOSHU brands in the Japanese yogurt market does not lead to a decline in market power (increase in price) and has positive effects for manufacturers, such as an increased market share.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Indoor agriculture (IA) presents a pathway to producing leafy greens more sustainably by strictly controlling the growing environment, increasing the efficiency of water and land resources use, reducing pesticide application, and enhancing quality characteristics. However, the commercial success of adopting this production method depends on the technology's widespread consumer acceptance paired with a price premium for the improved quality it provides. This paper characterizes American consumer preferences for leafy greens, reports a positive WTP for leafy green attributes, and estimates how consumer attitudes toward IA affect their leafy green choices. The findings are drawn from an online survey of over 2000 US leafy green consumers conducted in 2021. The respondents faced a hypothetical discrete choice experiment (DCE) designed to simulate purchasing leafy green produce. The alternatives presented in the DCE varied over production systems (IA, field farming, or greenhouses) and quality levels (taste, freshness, nutrient level, and food safety). Estimates identify significant preference heterogeneity for leafy green attributes and facilitate classifying consumers into three preference‐based groups: “Quality Seekers,” “Price Conscious,” and “Focused Practicals.” Preference variation is significantly greater for production methods than quality characteristics, indicating nascent production method preferences. Results suggest most US consumers view IA positively; however, WTP estimates vary significantly between consumer segments [EconLit Citations: D12, D13].",

Buyers of ethanol desire greater budget certainty for future ethanol purchases. An approach to pricing that has found considerable use in the livestock, dairy, and milling industries is the use of component‐based formula pricing. This study constructs a Monte Carlo simulation model of a typical South Dakota ethanol plant that uses a formula contract to fix components of the ethanol price. The simulation results indicate that the contract has considerable margin risk management benefits for the ethanol producer. The buyer also achieves marginal risk management benefits but with greater budget certainty as the components are fixed. Additional observations of interest to the industry are drawn from the sensitivity results of the simulations. [EconLit Citations: Q13, G17].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although the governance of farm producer‐owned and ‐controlled organizations is shaped by the complex interaction of mixed member, director, and manager objectives, its conceptualization in the literature is limited to the assignment of control to members, board directors, and managers. Such a categorization is imperfect as there exist other governance characteristics such as member vote distribution, board director identity, manager identity, and CEO identity. Using 371 survey responses from US farmer cooperatives, we inform the adoption of nontraditional governance characteristics in terms of proportional vote distribution, nonmember board directors (i.e., outside directors), and nonmember managers and CEOs. Furthermore, we relate the adoption of nontraditional characteristics to the competitive scope, organizational function, organizational size, and capital structure of the survey respondents by means of various empirical techniques. Generally, nontraditional adaptation of the governance structure, which implies an advanced delegation of control to decision specialists who are non‐members, is positively associated with the competitive scope and organizational size. Also, such nontraditional adaptation is more common to marketing cooperatives as compared to supply cooperatives. Our study motivates a multi‐dimensional conceptualization of governance, which is necessary to better understand the internal coordination of member and manager objectives.

    "abstract": "Abstract Futures markets are critical to price discovery and often dominate spot markets. We analyze the linkages between daily corn futures and spot prices in the United States using dynamic time warping. This nonparametric pattern recognition technique has several advantages over traditional time series methods. First, it can detect multiple changes in the lead‐lag associations between the two prices within short intervals; the duration with which one series leads or lags another is not assumed to be fixed. Second, the method can be applied to time series without regard to their stationarity properties. This greatly expands the scope of this method to accommodate a wide range of time series. Third, it lends itself well to studying small samples, which econometricians encounter routinely. Fourth, the results are presented intelligibly using intuitive visualizations. Our results show that futures markets are critical to price discovery; nevertheless, spot markets dominate futures markets intermittently. We discuss the results in detail, setting them in the proper context. [EconLit Citations: C14, C32, Q02, Q11].",

This mixed methods study aims to identify the role packaging plays in consumer choice and what packaging material consumers prefer. We analyzed data from quantitative stated preference experiments with a quota sample of 485 consumers living in Germany. In addition to the experiments, we conducted a qualitative study and analyzed data from 13 consumers who participated in think aloud protocols and responded to open‐ended questions. We analyzed the data from the quantitative and qualitative studies separately and then systematically compared their key findings. Choice‐based conjoint analyses showed that packaging was less important than price and origin in consumers' decisions, but that consumers clearly preferred unpackaged to packaged produce. This is true for both apples, a relatively robust produce, and tomatoes, which are more susceptible to damage. The qualitative research indicated that consumers appreciate the ability to see and choose an unpackaged product, but also see some benefits of packaging, such as the protection of the produce. Overall, we found that by combining qualitative and quantitative insights, we were able to identify overlapping but also distinct facets of consumer preference for fresh produce packaging. Regarding the use of bio‐based plastics for fresh produce, our results indicate that German consumers were not currently inclined to choose this type of packaging, and evidence suggests that they have little knowledge and/or awareness about it. Our findings have implications for researchers, marketing practitioners, packaging manufacturers, and policy makers. [EconLit Citations: D12, Q50].",

This study used the propensity score matching–double difference (PSM–DID) method empirically testing the effect and mechanism of the mutual recognition of GIs between China and the EU on China's agricultural product export from 2000 to 2016 based on theoretical analysis of the effect mechanism of GI on agricultural product exports. The results show that: (1) The mutual recognition of GIs significantly increased the binary margin of China's agricultural exports, and the effect on the intensive margin was stronger than that on the extensive margin, and the effects on the three subvariables of the extensive margin are in the following order: old products exported to new markets &gt; new products exported to old markets &gt; new products exported to new markets; (2) The heterogeneity analysis shows that the mutual recognition of GIs contributes more to state‐owned enterprises, enterprises in the eastern region and to export destinations in EU countries; (3) The mechanism analysis shows that domestic demand–driven, quality upgrading and signal transmission are important mechanisms in the export effect of mutual recognition of GIs. This research shows that vigorously promoting the mutual recognition of GIs between China and the EU are important factors in promoting the growth of China's agricultural exports and achieving high‐quality agricultural development.

Empirical microlevel studies in agricultural economics usually address this question from a household or farmer perspective, neglecting the broader socio‐institutional and economic context against which varietal dissemination takes place. In the present study, we explore the relationship between wheat seed delivery networks and varietal turnover, using data from farmers' fields in eastern India. An extensive survey encompassing 7648 wheat farmers was conducted to capture wheat production practices across 31 districts of Bihar and 9 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Additional qualitative interviews led to the initial impression that farmers' selection of varieties often precedes their choice of seed source, challenging the prevailing assumptions about the causal direction of this relationship. To address the challenge of reverse causality between varietal selection and seed source preference, we employed an instrumental variable regression framework. Although new wheat varieties are available in the market, a substantial majority of farmers opt for old ones. Farmers' decisions regarding the selection of wheat varieties and seed sources are not straightforward, and their preference for wheat varieties significantly impacts their seed source selection, indicating a hitherto unexplored bidirectional relationship. Understanding this complex relationship has significant strategic implications for stakeholders in the seed supply system, offering policy recommendations for enhancing varietal turnover rates and encouraging the widespread adoption of new, improved varieties among smallholders. Such initiatives hold the promise of enhancing system resilience and food security in developing countries. [EconLit Citations: O3, Q1, Q16, Q18].",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study explores the rent price ratio in agricultural land markets, crucial for evaluating market efficiency, policy needs, and farmer decision‐making. Traditionally, the analyses faced challenges due to the absence of concurrent sale and rent data for the same land, potentially leading to biased results. This research avoids this problem by utilizing a unique dataset from Eastern Germany, encompassing auction data from 2016 to 2019. This dataset is distinctive, containing both the purchase and lease price offers by individual farmers for the same agricultural land at a single point. Thus, this study overcomes the conventional limitations of using aggregated or non‐contemporaneous data. Hence, the focal point is to unravel the intricate relationship between individual rent price ratios and a myriad of influencing factors, including land characteristics and local farming structures. The use of Generalized Additive Models for Location, Shape, and Scale provides a robust framework for this analysis, offering a nuanced understanding of the distributional properties of individual rent price ratios. The study provides robust empirical evidence that highlights the need for adaptive and region‐specific policies if policy makers insist on intervening in the agricultural land market. Furthermore, promising points of departure for future research are identified. [EconLit Citation: Q15].",

A stochastic frontier was estimated by a Generalized True Random Effects to assess the relationship between technical efficiency and the production systems adopted, decompose efficiency into Transient (short‐term) and Persistent (long‐term) components, and control for unobserved heterogeneity. We found that farms using confined systems are more efficient than those using semi‐confined systems. The decomposition of the Overall Technical Efficiency in its Persistent and Transient components suggests that farmers can be more efficient when dealing with short‐term shocks than when deciding which system to use. The use of more capital‐intensive technologies such as CPB may provide opportunities to improve dairy farm profitability and productivity growth in Brazil.",

While several studies have already highlighted the welfare benefits of contract farming, very few have investigated the effects on diet quality, despite poor quality diets being a serious challenge in most parts of the developing world. Moreover, such existing studies deal with contract farming in speciality crops, although contract farming in staple crops may have different effects on diet quality. Therefore, this study evaluates the role of staple crop contracts on diet quality, proxied by two measures of dietary diversity. Using cross‐sectional data from rice‐producing households in Senegal, we employ linear models through ordinary least squares to estimate the relationship between contract farming and diet quality. Our results show that participation in contract farming is positively associated with household dietary diversity and hence, diet quality. Our results further show that income is the main pathway through which contracts and diet quality are associated. With increasing calls for agriculture to be nutrition‐sensitive, our results suggest that the institution of contract farming can play an important role in this regard by improving diet quality.",

In this paper, we assess economic and climate change implications of dairy production with panel data of Irish dairy farms from 2013 to 2021. We calculate transient, persistent, and overall eco‐efficiency with respect to GHG emissions by way of stochastic frontier analysis. The innovative component of our analysis is the application of club convergence analysis to explore heterogeneity in transient eco‐efficiency development over time. This offers a nuanced understanding of farm‐level responses to climate challenges. We then explore correlations between convergence clubs and GHG mitigation technology usage. Despite high overall eco‐efficiency, our results uncover significant variability across farms, with some showing improvement and others decline in eco‐efficiency over time. We also find that changes in milk yield and specialization are positively related to better eco‐efficiency development, while GHG mitigation technologies do not play an important role. These insights suggest that the average high eco‐efficiency masks considerable underlying heterogeneity, presenting opportunities for tailored policy interventions. Our study contributes to the literature by highlighting the complex dynamics of eco‐efficiency in the dairy sector and underscoring the need for policy frameworks that account for farm‐level diversity.",

    "abstract": "Spain is currently experiencing changes that have influenced its food markets. These changes affect the selection and purchase of convenience goods in Spain. Spanish household expenditures for convenience meats are modeled in a two-stage process, explicitly accounting for the value of women's time. The empirical evidence shows that the value of women's time, income, and household demographic variables are all important determinants of both participation and expenditures on convenience meat goods. The article concludes that large, high-income families in which both the man and woman work are more likely to consume convenience meat goods and also to spend more than others. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

We examine the implied relation by invoking a set of perfect market assumptions that are not radically out of kilter with a semistrong form efficient market. We use a simple project as the focus of the analysis. We initially explore the way that the market value of the project evolves over time. We then effect a similar analysis on the project's economic profit. The latter is the theoretical construct underlying EVA. A comparison of these two time series argues that Turvey et al.'s (2000) result is not unexpected from a theoretical perspective. Notwithstanding, we offer brief suggestions as to why executives adopt EVA as a measure of financial performance. [EconLit citations: D81, G30, M41.] © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This EDM approach enables the benefits and costs of simulated small changes in the checkoffs and advertising on producer welfare to be measured. To calculate the associated precision for changes in producer welfare measures, Monte Carlo integration is used, in a Bayesian approach, imposing inequality restrictions from theory, to generate empirical posterior distributions of the changes in producer welfare measures. These empirical distributions can be used to place confidence intervals around the posterior means and to test whether estimates are statistically significantly different from zero. Alternatively, the probability that a welfare measure change is greater than zero can be calculated, which may serve to even be more informative.

The assessment of company strengths is based on responses from open‐ended interviews and a questionnaire.

The key conclusions of the research are (1) there was no single internal factor rated as the number one strength across all managers in any one company, or across all companies, and (2) the factors on which managers rated their companies highest were highly interrelated. Reputation, flexibility and customer service and a set of other management variables interact to produce successful strategies. Being responsive to customer needs requires fast product development in industry niches while close relationships with customers allow the in‐depth understanding of customer needs required for this pace of product development.

Misperceptions of the fat content are greatest for pork products, averaging 11.1 percentage points higher than the actual fat content. The perceived percentage fat content of beef products averaged 6.6 points higher than actual. Fat perceptions also vary significantly across respondents. There are significant differences in median fat perceptions based on educational attainment, household type, household size, quantity of meat consumed, presence of children, and region of residence. If consumers with inaccurately high fat perceptions are concerned with the level of dietary fat intake, they may unnecessarily reduce their total meat consumption and/or substitute to meats that have lower perceived levels of fat. For those products that have relatively large and inaccurately high fat perceptions, consumer education programs may help increase market share.

The influence of these factors on crop producers' MAS usage is not homogeneous across crop producers. The heterogeneity is played out in different MAS choices and appears to be driven by crop producers' risk attitudes.

Branding behavior is defined and relevant literature is reviewed. Based on hypotheses developed from this literature and supporting features of the Danish food marketing chain, six econometric models are specified. Specification accounts for dependent variables' characteristics (count and fractional data, and truncated samples). Missing values are replaced using Griliches' method (Griliches, 1986). Large firms are found to own and introduce the most brands, although few associations with the commodity sector are identified. Firms' use of retail brands is found to substitute for brand introduction in the long run and to increase with ownership by retail firms. Conclusions are drawn regarding the strategic stance of retailers in the Danish food system and its employment of retailers' own-label brands.

The new approach shows the importance of properly adjusting for quality variation in both prices and quantities in demand analysis. When quality adjustment is concerned only with price, the unit value-based elasticity tends to overstate the true price elasticity. However, when the quality adjustment is considered with both price and quantity, the direction of bias depends on the level of the true price elasticity. If the true price elasticity is unit elastic, there would be no bias. However, the price elasticity estimated with unit values would understate a true inelastic price elasticity while it would overstate a true elastic price elasticity.

In some cases, a commodity‐linked bond (CLB) can be structured to provide an incentive to investors by sharing in profit gains. If the goal is to hedge financial risks, CLBs can also be constructed that reduce the loan principle or coupons depending on price movements.

To that end, data from a survey of supermarket shoppers in New Zealand were analysed with a cluster analysis. A six‐cluster solution found three clusters with positive intentions to purchase GM apples and three clusters with negative intentions. Positive intentions appeared to result from either price sensitivity or a desire to obtain a premium product. Negative intentions were especially strong in one cluster but appeared to be partially counteracted in two other clusters by offering respondents a specific benefit from gene technology. These results suggest that GM food may benefit from appropriate marketing to specific consumer segments. [EconLit classification: D120, M310]. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract U.S. farm commodity support programs encompass nearly three quarters of a century and three quarters of a trillion taxpayer dollars. One dividend from that effort is to learn lessons. Farm commodity programs have steadfastly maintained a primary objective of supporting the incomes of a relatively few producers of a relatively few commodities. Nonetheless, farm programs have not been static but have adapted to changing economic and political parameters. Changes in agricultural policy tend to coincide with extremes in the food supply–demand balance. Farm program income transfers leak from their intended beneficiaries to other asset owners. Economic rents, once institutionalized, retain political momentum that sustains the rents. The rise of pressure from the World Trade Organization to provide only non‐market‐distorting payments may challenge the continued viability of these lessons; however, the lessons also caution against discounting the extant political influence of the farm lobby.

Moreover, younger South Korean consumers were more likely than older consumers to approve of the use of biotechnology to create both plant and animal based foods. Further, the study produced evidence of different levels of approval of biotechnology among consumers from different residential areas, income levels and political affiliation. Thus, those living in cities, those with incomes above 40 million Won, and those who described themselves as having a liberal political affiliation were found to have a higher approval level for animal biotechnology.

The model used regionally aggregated at‐home consumption data from 2000 to 2005. Estimated uncompensated own price elasticities for fresh potatoes were highly significant and ranged between −0.5 and −1.6. The study was designed to capture the effects of the aggregate organic market on the prices, expenditures, and demand for each potato category. Organic food market penetration elasticities suggest that specialty potatoes (organic and minor‐colored) are particularly well positioned if demands for organic products continue to rise, red potatoes are not well positioned and evidence of the early warning signs of slippage in market share for white and russet potatoes may exist. Producers and promoters of conventional potato products should account for the increasingly important role of organic products in making decisions. As an auxiliary exercise, we also statistically sourced the variance of the organic potato price premium relative to the other four fresh potato prices. At the present time, the variability of the organic potato premium is not much affected by production costs or other supply‐related factors: the premium variability was driven largely by demand, and demographic/seasonal factors. Producers should be cautious about shifting to organic potato production until lower cost practices emerge. [JEL Codes: D120, Q130, Q180]. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Second, the overall effectiveness of the programs is examined in terms of whether the benefits exceed the cost. Finally, the optimality of U.S. rice export promotion in terms of expenditure levels is investigated. A double logarithmic econometric export demand equation is estimated to compute the export promotion elasticity while controlling for other demand determinants such as own price, the export price of competing countries, incomes, and exchange rates. Average benefit–cost ratios are computed for U.S. rice export promotion based on a range of excess supply own‐price elasticities to compute the effectiveness of the programs. Finally, a marginal simulation analysis is conducted to explore the optimality of the investment in rice export promotion. [JEL Codes: Q17, Q18, Q13]. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Using a firm‐level data set for 2005, we characterize the probability that a firm participates in exporting by a set of firm characteristics, including foreign ownership and spillovers from foreign‐owned firms, and find that foreign ownership neither increases nor decreases the probability that a firm will be involved in exporting.

The authors document the accrual anomaly, introduced by Sloan (1996) for the complete U.S. market, in the food supply chain. A mimicked risk‐free trading strategy shorting high accrual agribusinesses and longing low accrual agribusinesses yield statistically significant annual abnormal returns of 5.9% during 1970–2004. Results for the food supply chain are different from results by Sloan and others. In particular, results for high accrual agribusiness are similar to results by Sloan for the complete U.S. market, but low accrual agribusinesses perform differently. The authors believe that this contrasting result is not industry specific, but rather a result supporting the idea that the fixation hypothesis by Sloan fails to explain the accrual anomaly problem. This is important because the fixation hypothesis is prevalent in the literature; a well‐articulated hypothesis on the accrual anomaly has not yet been offered. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Collusive behavior was found for all three data periods though the extent of collusion varied across semester‐long data periods. Results may have been influenced by market conditions imposed on the experimental market in two of the three semesters. One was a marketing agreement between the largest packer and two feedlots and the other involved limiting the amount and type of public market information available to participants.

Six statements related to marketing contracts were presented to subjects to measure their attitudes toward the dominant method used by packers to procure hogs. The results suggest that the profitability of the producer, marketing method employed by the producer and the number of packers to whom the producer sold hogs significantly influences attitudes towards marketing contracts. These results suggest that low‐cost producers who market hogs via individual or group marketing contracts are more positive, or in some cases less negative, in their attitudes towards marketing contracts. Although prior nonparametric analyses provide some insight into factors influencing producers' views of marketing contracts, this analyses allows inference of statistical significance.

    "abstract": "Abstract Teff ( Eragrostis tef ) is a major staple grain of Ethiopia, where the crop was domesticated from 4000 to 1000 BC. The high food‐value Teff flour is basically used for preparing injera —a spongy pancake, the major component of the Ethiopian national dish. Due to its gluten‐free quality and high mineral content, the popularity of TeffTeff has been increasing in the western world. Very little is known, about the households that produce and consume Teff in Ethiopia. Using information from more than 9000 households collected by the World Bank and the Central Statistical Agency‐Ethiopia in 2011–2012 and 2013–2014, and applying econometric estimation approaches, this study reveals that Teff is mainly produced by uneducated, male‐headed rural households which have access to relatively more land and more family labor. In contrast, a higher proportion of Teff is consumed by urban households and those headed by an older, educated head. Based on the findings, this study asserts that the productivity of Teff should be enhanced by developing and disseminating high‐yielding varieties as Teff consumption has been increasing in general and, secondly, the resource‐poor Teff cultivators should be linked with the global value chain which may bring extra benefits to them in Ethiopia; however, the loss of domestic consumers’ surplus should also be considered economically.

It is critical for the industry to understand and enhance consumer's demand to sustain the higher prices associated with decreased production and maintain demand for the point in time where production can recover. This study utilized both Nielsen scanner data and a unique consumer tracker database to explore the impact of key factors on OJ consumption to estimate the return on investment.

Moreover, this study implies that a larger positive impact can be obtained by focusing on the positive aspects over responding to negative news. Therefore, we suggest the industry enhance generic promotion and advertising awareness and develop marketing programs that emphasize the positive attributes and benefits of OJ.",

Data on expected prices for goats transacted were collected from 280 goat producers from Baghlan and Nangarhar provinces, along with information on factors anticipated to influence the price expectation from May 2008 to April 2009. A price expectation model was built and analyzed using a general linear model. Results indicated that goat producers adjusted expected prices for marketing day (Saturday and Thursday), location of sales (district and provincial markets), live weight, and goat producers’ market network. However, goat producers did not expect a premium for goat attributes like breed and age. The implications of the study are that goat producers can expect more when they plan their goat sales based on live weight, market day, marketing place and sex of goat.

Organic prices were found to behave like pure jump processes rather than diffusions. A simple specification for pure jump processes is introduced and used with Monte Carlo methods to compute appropriate critical values for unit‐root and cointegration tests. The findings indicate that no long‐run relationship exists between organic and conventional prices, implying that price determination for organic corn and soybean is independent from that of the conventional crops. This suggests that organic corn and soybean prices are driven by demand and supply forces idiosyncratic to the organic market. For each crop, cointegrating spatial relationships are found between prices at the main organic markets. However, such relationships are generally weaker than the ones for the corresponding conventional prices, implying that organic markets are more affected by idiosyncratic shocks than conventional markets.

A rank‐ordered logit model was used to assess the effects of price‐ and quantity‐based contract mechanisms, risk preferences, and farm characteristics on ranking of contract preferences. Our empirical results show that, under price‐based contract, farmers are likely to prefer contract that set fixed price when a contract was offered over short term, however, over the long term, farmers prefer a contract item that set formula with a floor price. Under quantity‐based design mechanism, our model results illustrate that contract items that limit biomass quantity delivery requirement become less preferable even if farmers are allowed to negotiate on delivery price. In addition, farmer's risk perception factors toward engaging in marketing organization and vertically coordinated supply chains play a significant role in ranking contract preferences.

We specify a latent class structure that allows us to jointly analyze responses to stated choice and assignment to latent classes, while avoiding measurement error problems. Our results reveal that consumers are willing to pay premium for both health and environmental gains achieved through organic production systems, although their quantitative valuation is higher for the health concerns. Furthermore, we note that individuals with stronger preferences for organic products tend to attach a global value to the certification program, whereas the valuation tends to be more restrictive among respondents that prioritize the status quo option (conventional alternative). We also observe that differences in respondents’ geographic location and level of awareness of organic food production characteristics (prior to the survey) have significant impact on consumers’ choices.[EconLit citations: D12, Q13, Q18, Q56]",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a growing productivity gap between leading and average grain farms in Australia, driven by a combination of constraints that limit the adoption of innovations. Such constraints may be overcome by the adoption of organizational innovations, including collaborative structures such as joint venture (JV) arrangements. Given the predominance of the owner‐operator family farm model in the Australian grains sector, organizational innovations have largely been overlooked by the research and extension community. This paper examines business alliance formation in agriculture and farmer perceptions of, interest in, and barriers to participation in JV structures. A telephone survey of 573 Australian grain growers revealed that 3% of farmers had adopted a JV structure and that such farms were significantly more likely to have a larger crop area and be less diversified compared to nonadopters. Another 21% of farmers expressed an interest in adopting a JV structure in the future, particularly to reduce costs and improve productivity. A multinomial logit model showed that such farmers were significantly different for a number of sociodemographic variables including age and education, when compared to farmers not interested in adopting JV structures. To build on this basis of interest and motivation for innovative farm business structures, further understanding of perceived trade‐offs and preferences is needed to identify the most attractive JV designs.

This study also examines the “cost‐push” and “demand‐pull” theories. The results indicate the presence of cointegration among the three price series for each of the eight food chains. The “demand‐pull” factors are found to have a stronger impact along the food supply chain than the “supply‐push” factors. The short‐run causality results show bidirectional causal relations among the three prices, whereas the long‐run causality findings support the assertion that consumer prices dominate the other two prices, implying an attempt by retailers to exert control over the pricing mechanisms along the Finnish food supply chain. The impulse response functions show that the agricultural product prices experience higher and more prolonged fluctuations around the long‐run equilibrium than the other two prices.

We estimate a kinked Almost Ideal Demand System for fluid milk products in 18 US metropolitan areas. By conducting an asymmetric price transmission test, we find that cities with less competitive food retailing tend to exhibit asymmetric price transmission. The degree of price asymmetry and associated welfare loss are decreasing in market competitiveness. Our welfare analysis suggests that the welfare loss due to asymmetric price transmission is large in terms of the percentage of milk expenditures. The potential is for substantially higher future welfare loss given the ongoing consolidation in the food retailing industry. [EconLit citations: L11, Q11]",

    "abstract": "Abstract Brazil is a key player in the global beef markets having generated 15% of global production, and approximately 20% of world exports in 2018. Productivity improvements will be indispensable if the Brazilian beef sector wants to maintain its position as a key player in both the domestic and international markets. In light of the aforementioned, this study makes two key contributions to the agricultural productivity literature on Brazil. First, it estimates the production technology used in the Brazilian beef cattle sector using stochastic production frontier methods that account for exogenous factors that impact the production environment. Second, using the estimated coefficients as weights, it decomposes a total factor productivity (TFP) index that tracks various sources of productivity growth including: technical efficiency, technological change, scale efficiency, and environmental efficiency. By utilizing farm‐level data this study generates deeper insights into the dynamics driving beef cattle production at the most disaggregated level. Results indicate that TFP growth averaged 1.73% per annum and was primarily driven by scale efficiency, which increased at 1.39%. Meanwhile, technical efficiency declined at a rate of −0.03% per annum. [EconLit Citations: D24, O13, Q15].",

They would benefit from understanding how market characteristics impact vendor sales, although the few studies that have explored this topic have found inconclusive results. We use a unique panel database of sales at 13 farmers markets to estimate how vendors' sales are influenced by the characteristics of their farmers market. We find that average sales at weekend farmers markets becomes increasingly large as farmers markets increase in size. At weekday markets, average sales increase as small markets add vendors but eventually decline as markets become larger. These results could occur if weekend markets attract shoppers from increasingly greater distances as they become larger, while average sales eventually decline as weekday markets increase in size due to vendor competition. Produce vendors experience higher average sales at weekend markets than weekday markets and experience a relatively small increase in sales as market size increases. Vendors of hot prepared foods experience higher sales at weekday markets [EconLit Citations: Q10, Q12, Q13].",

To accomplish the population‐wide sodium reduction, two main strategies regarding food supply have been widely discussed: one is to set mandatory standards for the sodium content of foods and the other is to call for efforts from the food industry to voluntarily reduce sodium. Using the Chinese instant noodles market as an example, we estimate a random‐coefficients logit demand model to quantify the degree of substitution between competing products and between sodium and fat. The demand estimates are then used to simulate three sodium reduction strategies: a unilateral reduction by one firm, and industry‐wide reductions by multiple firms with and without reformulation of fat content. We find that voluntarily sodium reduction by a single firm results in its sales loss to its competitors; an industry‐wide sodium reduction causes demand reduction to be more evenly distributed across participating firms; and an industry‐wide reduction accompanied by an increase in fat content largely negates the adverse effect of sodium reduction on sales but risks an increase in population fat intake.

We find strong evidence that, as expected, discounts increase the purchases of the featured products. However, we find that offering discounts may have cannibalistic effects – negative cross‐discount effects – on non‐featured products, and that these effects vary considerably among pork products. From the retailers’ perspective, as profit margins have become smaller, our results indicate the need to develop a promotion strategy that minimizes the cannibalistic effects from discounts.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Agribusinesses use credence claims reporting the sustainability of products and supply chains. One example, fair trade, relies on a diverse set of third party standards and certification organizations. Food marketing data are used to compare products launched between 1999 and 2013 in the coffee, tea, and chocolate categories. Out of 3,257 observations making a reference to fair trade, 2,745 were certified. The other items follow certain fair trade practices or support fair trade. Many products claim both fair trade and organic (congruent claim). Fairtrade Labeling Organizations – International (FLO‐I) certifiers dominate, but Fair Trade USA (breaking from FLO‐I in 2012) is important. A double hurdle hedonic regression model explores the relationship between claims and suggested retail price in the United States, Canada, and European Union over two periods (1999–2011 and 2012–2013). Two models are run, one aggregating non‐FLO‐I members and one accounting for each individual certifier. The models (first hurdle) are not able to identify factors explaining which products are certified. Results suggest (second hurdle) that after controlling for congruent claims, having a fair trade claim certified by certain third parties significantly raises the price (above an uncertified product). In particular FLO‐I certification leads to a higher price in all models in both periods. Conversely, there is a range of premia for non‐FLO‐I certifiers, not all statistically significant. Implications for stakeholders are advanced. [EconLit citations: D40, L15, L66].",

We empirically examine data from field surveys and subjective preference experiments involving 373 large‐scale grain farmers in four provinces in China. The results reveal that large‐scale farmers' ability to anticipate prices and their degree of risk aversion are important for their choices of sales methods because of the incomplete insurance, futures, and product markets in developing countries. Price expectations reflect farmers' judgments of future price trends. Therefore, large‐scale farmers who anticipate an increase in grain prices will choose to postpone grain sales to potentially maximize profits. The degree of risk aversion determines whether farmers will sell several times to avoid normalized price volatilities. Risk‐averse large‐scale farmers will choose a multiperiod sales method, while risk‐loving ones will choose a single‐period delayed sales method.",

The stochastic meta‐frontier approach is adopted because of its usefulness in comparing regional technical efficiencies. The findings suggest that policies aiming to promote labor and soil quality improvement in the East region, and that relate to discussion groups in the South region, in addition to management of herd size, would be useful for improving efficiency postquota. Moreover, some farms expanded beyond their optimal scale leading to a reduction in efficiency levels and this points to the need to tailor farm advice and promote caution and prudence in farm expansion decisions, especially in a region like South West.

    "abstract": "Abstract Dutch dairy farmers used different investment strategies in their production capacity in the periods around the abolishment of the European Union milk quota. Some farmers anticipated and expanded their production, others waited till expected policies were implemented or did not change their production. We develop a theoretical framework that integrates investment strategies—anticipating, waiting, or not investing—in the presence of policy uncertainty. We provide a numerical illustration of the framework to a typical Dutch dairy farm considering to expand the milk production. Results show that farmers would anticipate when they expect that the right system will be implemented with delay and will have low financial consequences. A low risk aversion reinforces the adoption of the anticipation strategy. The implications for policy and practice are discussed [EconLit Citatons: D22, Q00, Q18].",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we examine how foreign direct investment affects agricultural firms' exporting decisions. We investigate this by using a Tobit model of export intensity, estimated on the sample of 104 Serbian agricultural firms observed in the period 2014–2017. In particular, we considered both direct and indirect export effects of foreign direct investment. The results indicate that foreign ownership positively affects firms' export intensity. Furthermore, we find that the effect is conditional on the origin of foreign capital, the strongest effects being associated with capital coming from bordering countries. Finally, the results show that the indirect effects of foreign direct investment on export are mainly negative. The results imply that agricultural firms which are a part of the system of multinational enterprises have lower costs of exporting, due to their reliance on international distribution networks and the information on foreign markets provided by the parent companies. In contrast, the costs of production for the local firms could be increased due to the intensive competition by the foreign affiliates. This means that foreign direct investment has the potential to improve the export performances of host‐country agricultural firms. However, to realize their full potential, a sufficient absorptive capacity of the local firms is required. [EconLit Citations: F21, F23, Q17].",

The findings indicate that, between 2000 and 2017, the introduction of electronic markets reduced prices and short‐term variability in tea prices by nearly 2%. Moreover, electronic markets initially increased price dispersion between markets by 11%–14%; however, with further reduction in market friction over time, price dispersion reduced by 16%.

    "abstract": "Abstract Current milk prices do not account for the emissions, environmental externalities, and the excessive resource use that occur during milk production. Imposing a “carbon tax on food” can be a very effective climate change mitigation policy and the ultimate distributional effect depends heavily on the way the tax is implemented. To offset the regressive financial effect, redistribution measures need to be designed and the financial welfare loss can serve as a first orientation for designing these redistribution measures. Current literature mainly uses estimated elasticities from empirical demand systems to approximate the welfare change which can lead to a substantial bias if the tax rate is sufficiently large. In contrast, we calculate the welfare change by using the Exact Consumer Welfare of a carbon tax on milk for selected emerging economies. We show that on average, consumers in upper‐middle‐income economies would face a financial welfare loss of 19.4–176.9 USD (in the value of 2017) measured by the compensating variation (CV), depending on the tax scenario. Among a set of 16 emerging economies, consumers in Argentina (ARG) and Türkiye (TUR) face the highest financial welfare losses. We also find that discrepancies between the Exact Consumer Welfare and the consumer surplus are very small. [EconLit Citations: Q11, Q18].",

While an increasing number of studies have investigated the health consequences of school feeding programs, empirical evidence regarding their effects on children's health inequality remains limited. This study examines the impact of China's Nutrition Improvement Program (NIP)—A program that provides free meals for rural students at the compulsory education stage—on rural children's health status and urban–rural health status differentials. The analysis uses data from the 2004–2015 China Health and Nutrition Survey. Leveraging county‐by‐county rollouts of the program, we employ difference‐in‐differences approaches as our identification strategy. The results show that the NIP significantly improves children's height‐for‐age z ‐scores by 0.136 standard deviations. Moreover, we find that the NIP alleviates the inequality of opportunity in health between urban and rural children by 21.6% in pilot counties. These findings are robust to a series of validity checks. The effect is more pronounced among students who have a younger age, and live in low social status families. Our findings suggest that school feeding programs are effective in decreasing child malnutrition levels and reducing urban‐rural inequality in the long run. [EconLit citations: I10, I18, D63].",

However, plant‐based meat consumption remains low owing to the barriers to shifting consumers to this nonmeat diet. We evaluate consumers' intentions to consume plant‐based meat from the perspectives of exploratory behavior and the regulatory focus theory. We collect 642 valid responses and use structural equation modeling to explore the relationship between exploratory behavior, regulatory focus values, and plant‐based meat purchase intention. exploratory behaviors encompass risk‐taking, variety‐seeking, and curiosity, while regulatory‐focus values comprise promotion‐ and prevention‐focus values. The results show that exploratory behaviors affect plant‐based meat purchase intention. Promotion‐focus value has a greater impact on purchase intention than prevention‐focus value. Promotion‐focus value mediates the relationship between exploratory behaviors and purchase intention, whereas prevention‐focus value mediates the relationship between risk‐taking and purchase intention. Drawing on consumers' consumption values, we reveal distinct managerial implications, such as providing important information and adopting online selling to attract buyers [EconLit Citations: Q01, Q13, Q55, Q56].",

    "abstract": "Abstract For a significant global segment, the volatility in grain prices presents a substantial menace to food accessibility and security. In the global pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine conflict (RUW), numerous nations were caught off guard, exacerbating this predicament and leading to instances where citizens faced purchasing restrictions on sunflower oil. This study employs the VAR (1)‐Asymmetric BEKK‐Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) (1,1) model to assess the extent of risks stemming from the pandemic and RUW in critical Turkish agricultural commodity markets: namely, wheat, barley, corn, and sunflower oil. The analysis reveals that the conditional variances of their return series are positively influenced by short‐ and long‐term uncertainties. With the escalations in the global oil market, the enduring hazards within these selected markets in Türkiye have intensified concurrently. The COVID‐19 pandemic has induced a decrease in long‐term uncertainty within wheat and barley markets, wherein noteworthy spillover risks in the barley, corn, and sunflower oil markets have exacerbated risks in the corn market. Empirical findings imply that COVID‐19 and RUW disrupt the agricultural supply chain, leading to impediments in food provisioning and security. The outcomes provide valuable insights to fortify policies, guarantee consistent access to plant‐based protein, and address nutritional insecurity within the nation. These policy measures align with the initiatives undertaken by the United Nations and Türkiye, which actively engage in establishing a grain corridor to facilitate Ukraine's grain exports, thereby ensuring food security and safeguarding agricultural lands.

This article proposes a method for evaluating a commodity checkoff program as an alternative investment opportunity facing producers which allows a ranking of the program among investment alternatives facing producers. The procedure is demonstrated through an analysis of the soybean checkoff promotion program. The analysis clearly indicates that the soybean checkoff program has performed well as an investment alternative for soybean farmers and warrants consideration for continuation. In contrast, a benefit-cost analysis of the soybean checkoff program yields ambiguous results regarding both the magnitude of the producer benefit and whether the benefit is sufficiently large relative to cost to justify continuation of the program.

While price is the major economic factor influencing sales of individual products, other nonprice factors such as number of facings, shelf height, and season of the year, are also paramount to the sales of products. The significance of these factors varies with wine type. Price and number of facings were significant in the sales of table wines in all stores in the study, whereas shelf height was in in two of the stores. For sparkling and dessert wines, number of facings was significant in explaining variations in sales in all stores, whereas price, shelf height, and season of the year were significant in a limited number of stores. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The empirical results, based on weekly scanner data, indicate the original Bertrand model is inappropriate for our empirical analysis. The estimated model resulted in substantially more elastic own‐price elasticities than previous estimates in Japan based on aggregate market data, supporting the Japanese retailers' contention that fluid milk is a more price‐elastic product than what previous studies had found. Incorporating estimated price conjectures into the model resulted in considerable discrepancies between partial and perceived own‐price elasticities. The result shows that a firm's price conjecture can be an important factor in determining the firm's perceived own‐price elasticity. The estimated conjectural variations were tested to determine whether they represent consistent pricing behavior, and the results indicated that consistent pricing behavior could not be statistically supported.

This article attempts to deal with this gap by researching structures and procurement relationships in the Ukraine and Moldova. Enterprise level survey data on the food‐processing sector in Moldova and the Ukraine reveals a diverse set of actors. Cluster analysis is employed to better characterize these different groups of processors. A three‐cluster solution is adopted, and the main characteristics, supply patterns, and dynamics of each cluster are further analyzed. [EconLit citations: L660, L100]. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Engel curves for three food categories—total food (TF), food eaten at home (FAH), and food eaten away from home (FAFH)—were estimated using a semilogarithmic functional form. The models for TF and FAH were estimated by OLS, using heteroscedasticity consistent estimators. The equation for FAFH was estimated using a two‐part model, with the level equation estimated by least squares with corrections for heteroscedasticity, using only the observations for which a positive amount of expenditures on FAFH was reported. The estimated income elasticity of demand for food for Hispanic households were 0.29 for TF, 0.21 for FAH, and 0.49 for FAFH. Household size elasticities were 0.32, 0.40, and 0.07, respectively. Our analysis indicates that Hispanic households devoted a higher proportion of their budget to FAH, 25.8%, than the average American household, while the proportion spent on FAFH was only 3.6%.[EconLit citations: L610.] © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In particular, we find that a parallel shift in a linear demand function always alters the market demand elasticity unless supply is unitary elastic. However, the elasticity change in most cases will be negligible. We also find that curve rotation does not imply that the demand elasticity has changed, and vice versa. Lastly, if the price level affects advertising's ability to shift the market demand curve, it must also be true that advertising affects the demand elasticity. The converse is also true, i.e., if advertising affects the demand elasticity, the price level must affect advertising's ability to shift the demand curve.

Our results demonstrate wine MNEs entered in a new era in which strategies are driven by attempts to maximize shareholder value through financialization.

The results indicate that buyer characteristics and personal relationships affect the terms of trade in the land market, which is consistent with the social capital hypothesis. The impact of buyer characteristics and personal relationships on the implicit prices of land characteristics is, however, non‐uniform and highly nonlinear.

The MRL model identified heterogeneity among the preferences of survey respondents. Some respondents are willing to pay a large positive amount for a gift basket in a handmade container. Moreover, if a basket is labeled as containing Hawaii‐grown food products, an additional large positive value can be added to the basket. This methodology can be used to investigate heterogeneous preferences and identify the value of attributes to various market segments. [JEL Code: M310, D12]. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract As customers increasingly demand more specific products, firms are adopting new business approaches to satisfy customers and cope with competition. Efforts to satisfy ever more demanding markets appear to be associated with increased chain coordination, yet the relationship between these two factors is unclear. This research addresses the factors that affect chain coordination, focusing on the management of business processes to meet product specifications for customers. Five fresh meat New Zealand chains were the focus of multiple case study research. Results suggest that chains use different strategies and coordination mechanisms to deliver desired product specifications. More important, while product specifications are related to chain coordination as expected, the relationship is mediated by the coordination differential —the type and amount of effort that firms employ in their business processes to achieve the desired specifications. The nature and implication of the coordination differential concept are discussed. [L140, L150, L170]. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

(b) Have any returns to producers achieved been greater than the cost of the promotion? (c) What has been the effect of lamb promotion on the lamb import share? The first question is addressed through an econometric analysis of the U.S. retail demand for lamb, which takes into account the effects of lamb advertising and promotion expenditures. The results then are used to calculate a benefit‐cost ratio for lamb promotion in answer to the second question. An econometric analysis of the import share of U.S. lamb consumption provides the basis for addressing the third question. Lamb promotion is found to have increased the demand for lamb, and particularly American lamb, generating in the process a highly positive return to producers relative to the small cost of the program.

The findings reveal that almost 10% of the investigated products attract higher unit prices for larger package sizes, although the extent of price surcharges varied among product categories. Quantity price discounts were found to dominate in the firms' pricing strategies. The econometric results showed that the number of package sizes, the average package size, the packaging and storage forms, as well as the price image of a product are all significant determinants of the decision to impose both quantity price surcharges and quantity price discounts.

An empirical model is proposed to estimate a price transmission elasticity and a target inventory equation in the spirit of linear‐quadratic inventory models in the macroeconomics literature. A generalized method of moments estimator measures the impact of inventories on price transmission and accounts for the potential correlation between sales and wholesale prices. The price transmission elasticity is lower (higher) when inventories are above (below) the target level.",

Wineries in these emerging regions face different vertical coordination challenges than in well‐established regions, which may affect procurement choices. Results corroborate prior findings that quality considerations and the need to safeguard investments in specialized assets, respectively, increase usage of more formal coordination mechanisms like written contracts and vertical integration or ownership. Consistent with prior findings of studies of wineries in established wine regions, we find that perceived difficulty in measuring grape quality attributes leads to tighter coordination; a point previously undocumented for emerging regions.

This paper assesses several approaches for valuating cooperative equity and suggests that the rate of return on equity is an appropriate measure of the opportunity cost of equity because it determines the levels of cash patronage refunds, equity retirement, and growth a cooperative can maintain. Simulations are used to explore the relationship between various measures and the rate of growth and demonstrate that the rate of return on equity is the only measure invariant with respect to changes in the growth rate. Calculations for US cooperatives show that the rate of return on equity results in a higher cost of equity than estimates based on the opportunity cost of funds and confirm that equity is more expensive than borrowed capital. A numerical example illustrates the early redemption of member equities at a discount.",

Dynamic conditional correlation specifications with a bivariate GARCH model are employed, with data for Brazilian and U.S. markets in the period 2004–2017, during which several structural changes and extreme climate phenomena have occurred. We find the highest correlations between the corn and soybean spot markets, and evidence of spillovers in both products in the spot and futures markets. We also find that the financial crisis have significantly affected the relationship between the corn and soybean markets. We also find that in periods of increased conditional correlation between the soybean and corn markets, there is an increase in the optimal hedge ratio for risk management strategies involving corn futures contracts at B3 and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

    "abstract": "Abstract Farmers markets, an important direct‐to‐consumer market, have shown signs of declining sales since 2007. This trend has raised concern about their future viability, inciting stakeholders to consider new marketing and development approaches. Unfortunately, the literature on these approaches is largely qualitative, with little empirical or experimental evidence assessing impact or effectiveness. We present results from a randomized control trial measuring the efficacy of an informational nudge—a mailed coupon—in attracting new customers to a winter farmers market in Northern Colorado. Previous research identified perceived lack of product assortment at farmers markets as a major barrier to consumer attendance; accordingly, half of the coupons in our experiment emphasized the wide range of products sold at the market, while the control coupons presented general market information. We mailed 6000 physical coupons redeemable for $10 to randomly selected households in Fort Collins, Colorado, during the 2017–2018 market season. One hundred and eleven coupons were redeemed (1.85%), of which 58 were treatment and 53 control. While the coupon was somewhat effective at attracting new customers (36% had never attended the winter farmers market), there were no statistically significant differences in redemption rates between treatment and control. We thus find that the information nudge was not enough to influence the decision to attend the winter farmers market. EconLit citations: Q13, Q18.",

During the M&amp;A private phase, we model the likelihood of firms becoming bidders or targets as a function of firms' past financial performance. During the M&amp;A public phase, the likelihood of bidders becoming acquirers is modeled as a function of firms' past financial performance and M&amp;A transaction characteristics. The results for the subset of bidders in the M&amp;A private phase suggest that the likelihood of a firm becoming a bidder is positively correlated with the bidder's firm size 1 year before the M&amp;A announcement. In contrast, the likelihood of a firm becoming a bidder is negatively associated with bidder's leverage, cash level, and very low market valuations. For the subset of targeted firms, the likelihood of firms being targeted is positively associated with the firm's leverage and negatively related with its profitability. Our results for the M&amp;A public phase model show that firm experience in the M&amp;A market is positively associated with the likelihood of acquisition completion. In addition, relative to nonhorizontal transactions, horizontal mergers tend to be more difficult to complete. [EconLit Citations: G34, M2].",

This paper explores the forces determining U.S. veterinarian practice location and how location choices have evolved over the past two decades. We provide a theoretical model of veterinarian market supply and demand with particular emphasis on rurality, gender, and demand side change. We also estimate bivariate Tobit models of location choice for 1990, 2000, and 2010. Results suggest that female veterinarians are less responsive to the presence of food animals than their male counterparts. For both genders, veterinarians are more responsive to animals of higher value. Using animal caretakers as a proxy for companion animals, we find that female veterinarians have become more responsive to this indicator over the 20 years. All else equal, female and male veterinarians tend not to locate in rural areas. Aversion to rural areas has remained fixed over time among males but has strengthened among females.

The cost of post‐harvest forward contracting corn and soybeans averaged 2 cents and 6 cents respectively; this was much less than the cost of pre‐harvest forward contracting in recent years.

A dramatic increase in the volatility of milk prices received by dairy farmers has adversely affected dairy farm profitability. Furthermore, the effects that the private Exchange spot cheese market has on FMMOs milk pricing have raised concerns, mostly due to an imperfectly competitive nature of competition process in this market. This research analyzes the behavior of Class III milk price, which is the mover of the overall FMMOs pricing structure, during three milk pricing regimes: Minnesota–Wisconsin price series (1960s–1995), Basic Formula Price (1995–1999), and Multiple Component Pricing (2000–present). The empirical evidence presented in the article indicates that changes in the level of Class III milk price were rather minor in magnitude. However, changes in the milk price volatility were dramatic. There is empirical evidence indicating that the private Exchange spot cheese price is the main determinant of the Class III milk price, which is consistent with the design of Class III milk pricing during the analyzed FMMOs milk pricing regimes.

Econometric models used in this study consider potential nonlinearity and asymmetry in price transmissions using threshold autoregression and threshold error correction methods, and generalized impulse response functions. Overall, the surge of corn ethanol production after the EPA enactment appears to lead lower integration and slower price adjustment between markets, particularly between noncorn‐belt and corn‐belt markets. Our analysis also finds strong evidence of the existence of threshold effects and limited evidence of asymmetric price responses in the short and long run for both pre‐ and post‐EPA periods.

At the beginning of the survey, we induce a subset of participants to think about the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on either their personal life, finances, and health or on their local community and its members. Both primes increase participants’ levels of anxiety and slightly reduce their sense of community. Additionally, both primes significantly decrease the hypothetical price premium participants are willing to pay for local food, that is, both for fruits and vegetables and for meat products. The primes do not significantly affect the amount donated to charitable organizations, except when controlling for participants’ own experiences with COVID‐19. While priming increases donations for some participants, it decreases donations for those with a “strong” COVID‐19 experience, especially for the food relief program. [EconLit Citations: C90, Q19].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Food labels can convey reputations by containing quality cues, such as variety, region of origin, and producers. A multitier label structure consisting of two collective labels (a product‐specific collective label [e.g., Yantai Apple] and a general collective label [e.g., Shandong Agricultural Products]) and a private brand (an enterprise [e.g., Dole] or cooperative brand [e.g., Yantai Xinnong]) may be used as an effective tool to increase the competitiveness of certain food products. However, little is known about the effects of multitier labels on consumer preferences. We investigate consumer valuation for a single label (a collective label or a private brand), dual labels (two collective labels, or a collective label and a private brand), and multitier labels (two collective labels and a private brand), respectively. The results show that consumers are willing to pay premiums for different labels, particularly collective labels. Consumers' valuation of dual labels is higher than a single label. However, there are significant substitution effects between product‐specific collective labels, general collective labels, and private brands. Moreover, consumers' valuation for dual collective labels is higher than a dual collective label and private brand. The high degree of market recognition for collective labels and private brands aids policymakers and producers in developing appropriate labeling strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The US banking sector has consolidated through acquisitions in recent decades, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of lending institutions. Agricultural commercial banks have been preferred target of such acquisitions, representing 15%–40% of all acquisitions between 1994 and 2018. In this study, we examine the postacquisition performance of banks that acquire agricultural banks in terms of profitability, bankruptcy risk, and loan monitoring process between 1994 and 2018. We also test whether the shared knowledge between the acquiring bank and the target bank in terms of geography, product, and culture affect the postacquisition outcomes. While we document improved profitability from agricultural bank acquisitions, the improvement is rather short‐lived without long‐term benefits. Also, we do not find improvement in other performance measures. Also, we find a negative effect of cultural knowledge, highlighting the complex implications of acquisitions.

The Uppsala internationalization process model has been revisited in light of the knowledge that these networks can contribute to promoting the presence of SMEs abroad. The study uses a sample of companies in the Spanish wine industry and characterizes 76 domestic clustered business networks (Protected Designations of Origin). The value and originality of the paper reside in its contribution in terms of measuring the degree of internationalization of domestic clustered networks to which SMEs belong. It also assesses the effect of these networks on the internationalization process of the agri‐food industry, considering that domestic clustered networks with a strong international commitment generate greater internationalization opportunities.

Relying on a Kalman filter algorithm, the unobservable learning process is parameterized in a dynamic programming problem, and parameters are estimated using a minimum‐distance estimator. Estimates show that farmers are risk‐averse and that both individual and social learning affect GM technology adoption with more importance on individual learning than social learning, whose statistical significances are confirmed by hypothesis testing. Sensitivity analysis results show that social learning contributes to lower GM adoption rates, reflecting a strategic delay in the presence of information externalities in the early and middle diffusion stages.

Evidence in anticyclical sectors such as the food industry is scarce. Using European firm‐level data on the 2008–2009 crisis, we explore (i) whether the internal demand or market synchronism (external demand) prevailed when assessing their relation with the crisis and (ii) the role innovation strategies played in mitigating this in weathering the drop in demand. Results indicate that the more internationalized firms are, the more they suffer from economic crises, with exporters the most affected, but that innovation can have a mitigating role.

At present there are many perceptions of what it is and with what it deals. This confusion has been extended by individual authors who have sought to clarify what agribusiness management is by putting forth what it means to them. But if agribusiness management is to be a discipline, it must have disciples united under a common set of beliefs. This article identifies four issues found in the literature that must be addressed if the disciplinary roots for agribusiness management are to be established. Results of a survey showing the commonality of beliefs regarding them are reported. Although many beliefs are shared, there are also considerable differences. These results suggest the need for further discussion of the issues identified if agribusiness management is to be established as a discipline in its own right. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

For this study of supermarkets in 34 local markets in six southwestern states, market share and concentration are not significantly related to any service factors. However, concentration has a significant positive relationship with price in the full sample, and share also is significantly related to price in subsamples of large, leading firms. Thus, the Demsetz quality critique is rejected. Also coordinated rather than unilateral effects seem predominant. When examining store size, superstores enjoy economics up to 50,000 square feet, but most of the cost savings are offset by pricing power related to increased services levels. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Important factors affecting changes in consumption of these three products were identified. Major positive factors affecting changes in fluid milk consumption included health and taste preferences by consumers. Interestingly, both health and taste concerns were also major negative factors impacting decreases in milk consumption as well. The most important positive factors affecting changes in domestic cheese consumption were price, taste, and health reasons, while health and taste concerns were also important negative factors. The single most important factor impacting changes in imported cheese consumption was taste, which means that the Japanese have acquired a new taste for imported cheese. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Analyzing contract farming and the intensity (quality) of contracts is as important as the extent of the contractual arrangements. Current publications do not sufficiently distinguish between contracts, which have a far-reaching and long-term influence on farm-firms and those based on spot-market transactions. A model has been developed to distinguish between different forms and features of agricultural contracts. Agricultural contracts are analyzed on the extent of authority, the duration of the contract, and the extent of investment with regard to the contract. The model provides insights into both the extent and the intensity of contract farming. Results of an empirical analysis of agricultural contracts in Germany clearly show that the majority of the contracts can be characterized as short-term agreements with few binding penalties. Hence, contracts between farmers and up- or downstream industries rarely influence the organizational structure and business development of German farms [JEL codes: Q130]. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

This model is used to simulate possible Class I premiums, which could be negotiated by U.S. dairy cooperatives in the absence of FMMOs, under alternative assumed market structures. These premiums are then compared with the newly adopted Class I differentials to determine what degree of market competitiveness is equivalent to the new Class I differential structure. The results suggest the new FMMO Class I differentials are equivalent to a small degree of imperfect competition. In addition, because Class I differentials virtually disappear in the perfect competition case, our findings indicate it is difficult to justify the existence of Class I differentials solely on the basis of transportation costs from surplus to deficit areas [EconLit citations: Q11, Q13, Q18]. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Potato processors allocate an additional $46 million annually to advertise branded potato products.

Results show that both brand and generic advertising are effective in stimulating demand for all processed potato products.

A two‐equation, fixed‐effects, panel‐data model accounts for the bidirectional causality between brand prices and discount levels. The empirical model is fitted with data on household purchases of ready‐to‐eat (RTE) breakfast cereals and captures the industry's 1996 price cuts and discount reductions. Higher brand prices cause coupon values to rise, supporting the price discrimination hypothesis. Coupon values fall with in‐store displays and more intense advertising but rise when couponed products are featured in store flyers. Discount levels are positively related to brand market share and the size of discounts redeemed for rival cereals. Coupon values fall with increasing brand loyalty among RTE cereal purchasers. Cereal prices are positively affected by coupon values, advertising expenditures, input costs, and the prices of competing brands. Inventory levels are negatively correlated with brand price.

The research is motivated by the increased popularity of EVA in corporate finance and by the claims that high EVA causes incremental gains in share price values. Using1996 annual reports to compute EVA, and daily stock prices for 1994 through 1998, we attempt to correlate EVA with a variety of measures including accounting return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), share price, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) returns and risk, and others. Results find little support for the conjecture that high-EVA firms lead to higher shareholder value, however, because the management logic that has popularized EVA is so logical and fundamental to common practices in corporate finance that we resist dismissing EVA as a valued paradigm. Rather, we suggest that market volatility and other factors mask the short-run increments to shareholder wealth from EVA-implemented strategies.

The model is given empirical content using data on the Dutch cucumber chain and assuming Cournot competition among retailers who have market power on either the consumer/retail or growers/retail market or both. The results show that in case of a cucumber supply shock and market power, consumer prices change more than growers' prices.

Applying a two-stage procedure on original panel data on French cheese manufacturers, the paper first estimates firm-specific productive efficiency and scale economies using data envelopment analysis. The paper then uses the findings of the first stage to evaluate a random effects logit model of the determinants of takeover in the French cheese industry for the period 1985–2000. The paper finds that technical efficiency is not a significant determinant of takeovers, whereas the nature of scale economies is. Firms with decreasing returns to scale (i.e., an oversized production capacity) face a higher risk of takeover. This suggests that cheese manufacturers have been seeking to expand their milk processing capacities by acquiring large firms. This proves to be an indirect consequence of the non-transferable milk quota regime affecting the scarce milk input commodity. [EconLit citations: D24, L25, Q13]. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Results from a questionnaire‐based survey of companies from Germany and Australia engaging in exporting and/or importing of food products suggest that staff education/training and logistics are the most important factors affecting success in international markets. Implications of this study are that agribusinesses must give special attention to staff recruitment and training and to the mastering of food product logistics if they want to compete successfully internationally.

However, rising concerns over consumer acceptance late in 1999 created a climate of uncertainty over national markets and put continuing adoption in question. This study models Delaware farmers' adoption patterns and decisions, and examines accompanying changes in their operations at the start of the 2000 season. Model results show adoption to have continued upward in terms of farmers and acreage, with age, soybean income, computer use, and labeling opinion identifying major adopters. Adopters were expanding operations and utilizing accompanying new techniques at a high rate. With much of the state farmers' market assured by the local broiler industry, farmers appeared unconcerned over national market uncertainties. The research thus demonstrates the need to consider local conditions and potential for variations in adoption patterns and adopter characteristics.

The Morishima substitution elasticities and scale elasticities are computed for different provinces. Inference is carried out using asymptotic theory as well as bootstrap methods. The evidence suggests that there are significant substitution possibilities between the agricultural input and other production factors in the meat and bakery sectors. Scale elasticities suggest that increasing returns to scale are present in the bakery and meat industries. To account for supply management in the dairy sector, separability between raw milk and other inputs was introduced. There exists evidence of increasing returns to scale at the industry level in the small producing provinces, but decreasing returns to scale in the two largest dairy provinces (Ontario and Quebec).

Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine the importance of product form in demand (product form aggregation). Likelihood ratio tests were also used to determine if fresh products were separable from frozen products (product form separability). Product form aggregation was rejected at a probability of 0.999, suggesting that fresh and frozen catfish products are not homogenous. The hypothesis, no product form separability, failed to be rejected at the 0.05 significance level, but was rejected at the 0.01 significance level. Test results suggest that it is more acceptable to focus on a single product group (e.g., frozen products) than to assume that catfish products are perfectly aggregatable across product forms.

    "abstract": "Corn markets are important for many industries, including the seed, fertilizer, meat production/processing, and agricultural machinery sectors, all of which are highly concentrated. Oligopoly theory suggests that corn input and field equipment suppliers likely benefit from policies that support corn markets, such as U.S. biofuels policy, whereas meat companies likely lose. This study investigates the impact of biofuels policy on U.S. agribusiness stock prices. Corn futures prices are found to have had a structural change in November 2006, consistent with the expansion of U.S. biofuels policy support. A linear two-factor (S&P 500 and corn prices) equilibrium asset pricing model is estimated on two subsamples, one before and one after the estimated change point. Conditional heteroskedasticity in stock returns is accounted for using a GARCH(1,1) model. In the more recent period, corn price increases are found to have positive effects on excess stock returns for seed, fertilizer, and machinery companies, while the impact on meat companies is negative. The results may be interpreted as evidence that crop input suppliers gain from U.S. biofuels policies while meat processors lose. [EconLit citations: D43; L13; Q14]. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Because PMP is not straightforward if farmers are assumed to maximize expected utility (as a risk parameter also needs to be calibrated), we consider possible ways to address this issue but settle on a traditional approach used in the EU's Farm System Simulator. We calibrate farm management models for six different Alberta regions and use it to determine how changes in the AgriStability's payment trigger affect production incentives. Results indicate that, although the initial introduction of the AgriStability program in 2008 might have tilted farmers’ planting decisions toward crops with higher returns and greater risk, changes to this program reduce indemnities and farmers’ expected profits, but do not further alter land‐use decisions. Rather, it is increases in farmers’ aversion to risk that lead to the greatest changes in crop allocation. [EconLit citations: Q14, Q18, C61].",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We analyze recent and intended transactions of used farm equipment and find the quality of buyers' relationships with local equipment dealers influences whether their most recent purchase came from an Internet source and whether they will consider future purchases from Internet sources. We find local dealers who provide excellent parts and repair service face a double‐edged sword: customers are less likely to have purchased from Internet sources during their last transaction but express stronger absolute interest in future Internet purchases. Also, customers who view their dealer as having treated them fairly during past price negotiations are less likely to express interest in transacting on the Internet in the future. Finally, buyers sort across channels based on several personal characteristics, including risk tolerance, trust attitudes, and negotiation style, but seller sorting is primarily based on risk tolerance. Specifically, buyers and sellers with greater risk tolerance sort to online markets. [JEL Descriptors: L81, Q12].",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we estimate market power for supermarket chains by computing their price-cost margins for selling fluid milk. However, unlike most previous studies that assume Bertrand-Nash pricing conduct, we solve for pricing conduct, assuming a leader follower (Stackelberg) framework, and joint-profit maximization (monopoly) conduct, in addition to the widely used Bertrand-Nash pricing conduct. Price-cost margins are computed using estimates from a random coefficients multinomial logit demand model. Our results indicate that demand for milk at the supermarket chain level is elastic. Consumers, moreover, are more price sensitive to whole milk than to skim milk. In terms of pricing conduct, our results indicate that the Stacke1berg game, where, for instance, the Albertsons supermarket chain leads and Safeway follows, best fits the data at hand. This model implies that, on average, 23% of retail prices are appropriated by supermarket chains when selling fluid milk. Moreover, in the case of Albertsons whole milk, 76% of the marketing margin is explained by the cost of processing and distribution of fluid milk, and 24% is explained by the exercise of market power. Approximately 52% of the marketing margin is due to the exercise of market power in the case of skim milk sold by Safeway, while 48% is due to the cost of processing and distribution.

We estimate, using 1,290 panel observations from 722 households and stochastic frontier analysis, the technical efficiency of cocoa production and disaggregate productivity growth. Our results indicate that the average efficiency of the cocoa farmers is 50%. Farmers' educational attainment and their experience in cocoa farming are significant factors increasing efficiency. We also find that the productivity of Indonesian cocoa farms increased by 75% between 2001 and 2013. Technical efficiency growth and the increased chemicals use supported by government subsidies were responsible for the majority of this gain. Furthermore, large distortions in input allocation were found. Hence, policies that encourage the efficient use of farm inputs would be highly beneficial. Weather‐ and pests‐induced volatility in cocoa production could be decreased by promoting agricultural research on drought‐ and disease‐resistant cocoa varieties (EconLit citations: D24, O13, Q12).",

Our full bilateral imperfect competition model allows potential market power exertion from all adjacent upstream and downstream markets of processors and retailers. Empirical results show the presence of market power from processors and retailers in both output and input procurement markets of the U.S. beef industry. Estimates of conjectural elasticities and market power indices suggest that processors’ market power exertion is greater than the exertion of retailers’ market power in the U.S. beef industry. Results of the goodness‐of‐fit statistics indicate that flexible frameworks work better than restrictive models in representing the bilateral market structure. Estimates of market power parameters and market power indices are sensitive to the choice of market structure model as well as functional forms of production function. These findings indicate that any erroneous assumptions on market structure and functional form of production function may result in misleading estimates of market power.

However, there is limited knowledge of what factors drive US. DDGS exports and how those factors could impact future US DDGS exports. This study aimed to identify the determinants of US DDGS exports and estimate the growth of DDGS exports to major international buyers. A commodity‐specific gravity model was estimated using the pseudo‐Poisson maximum likelihood method for US DDGS exports to 29 countries over 2000–2013. Results suggest that the importing country’s meat production, technical barriers to trade, tariffs, and US ethanol production influence US DDGS exports. A baseline outlook for US DDGS exports to the six major importing countries through 2020 generated from the estimated gravity model shows China’s commodity and trade policy could have a vital impact on US DDGS exports. Variations in DDGS exports under the scenarios of high and low meat production in those importing countries were also derived.",

Understanding entrepreneur's motivation to enter the industry is crucial to understand winery behaviors and industry dynamics. Some entrepreneurs enter the industry motived by passion for wine whereas others are motived by profits. Differences in motivation may contribute to the high variability in quality and quality‐adjusted prices of wines in emerging wine regions. We used ordinary least square and Tobit regression models to investigate the influence of motivation on winery pricing and quality decisions using data on 700 wines from 102 wineries in emerging US wine regions. We find that passion‐oriented owners produce higher quality wines and set higher quality‐adjusted prices relative to profit‐oriented owners. Recognizing differences in owner motivation is critical to establish appropriate policies to support the development of the wine industry in emerging regions. [EconLit citations: Q13; L83; O25].",

Characteristics of special interests were product brands, bottle sizes, and households’ brand loyalty. A random parameter logit model is estimated to account explicitly for consumer heterogeneity. The results clearly show that The Coca‐Cola Company is still the market leader on the German market, but private label brands from Aldi and Lidl also have a strong influence. The results further indicate that 63% of households are brand loyal regarding their preferred soft drink brand and prefer small bottle sizes (≤1,500 ml) over large bottle sizes (&gt;1,500 ml).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The nexus of innovation and trade is commonly analyzed in terms of technological gaps and market‐share gains for innovating countries. However, this relationship may not hold under certain circumstances – as in the case of genetically modified organisms. Based on a firm heterogeneity model, this study investigates the role of technological gaps and demand lags in the case of international trade in goods after the emergence of a ‘highly‐scrutinized’ or ‘distrusted’ technology. The demand lag may be understood as the difference between techniques employed by producers in exporting countries and levels of acceptance or compatibility in destination markets. Likewise, a technological gap is the difference between techniques employed by late‐movers and those used by leading countries. By means of a gravity equation, we empirically estimate these effects based on the bilateral trade of soybeans between 1995 and 2012. Results indicate that both technological gaps and demand lags reduce trade by similar magnitudes. Thus, producing countries should carefully weigh the negative effects of falling behind and of approving varieties not approved for importation in destination markets.

However, the technology raises new ethical concerns which relate to the sensitivity of the embryo, as well as how the screened out eggs will be used afterward and the accuracy of gender determination. To comprehensively investigate consumer attitudes towards this new technology, a questionnaire including a choice experiment was distributed to a representative sample of 482 German consumers between December 2018 and March 2019. The data was analyzed by an explorative factor analysis and a latent class analysis. Results indicate that the sample can be divided into four segments, which differ in preferences for production attributes, attitudes, and price sensitivity. Attitudinal differences are found regarding respondents' approval of the technical advances in agricultural production, confidence in legal regulations, and the endorsement of enhanced livestock production conditions. Both a meaningful usage of by‐products and a high rate of accuracy are crucial factors for the acceptance of in ovo gender determination for a majority of respondents. However, the response behavior of one segment, representing 11% of the sample, indicates the disapproval of both chick culling and in ovo screening.[EconLit Citations: Q160, Q510].",

We propose two different analyses to disentangle distinctive groups of brands. First, using the information on scanner purchases of sparkling wines recorded by a consumer panel over a 2‐year period, and appropriate specifications of the latent class model, we cluster homogeneous groups of winery brands for the product attributes they propose to the market. Then, we analyze consumers' brand preferences from a dynamic perspective by employing a hidden Markov model to identify segments of brands perceived as similar.

Results show that inclusion of supply‐related information improved goodness of fit statistics in all models relative to base models that only include prices, providing evidence that such information is important for explaining United States chickpea price changes. The models with the highest goodness of fit statistics were those that accounted for (1) deteriorating growing conditions in the Mediterranean region coinciding with declining area planted in Canada and (2) concurrently deteriorating growing conditions and declining area planted in the Indian subcontinent.

Our results indicate a significant downward trend for the premium during the marketing season, with the trend's magnitude depending on the average quality of harvested wheat. If farmers separately store both bread and feed wheat, they should tend to sell bread wheat before they sell feed wheat, particularly in years of low average wheat qualities. Further, the volatility of the price premium significantly decreases over the season, indicating higher risks at the beginning and lower risks towards the end. The volatility of the premium may present opportunities that require a reevaluation of the recommended temporal sequence of selling bread and feed wheat.",

The exit behavior meant establishing a marketing or processing operation in parallel to cooperative deliveries or the planning such an action. Scale development to measure cooperative attributes resulted in six latent variables: A need to restructure the farm business, the membership role in the cooperative, opportunity, fear of negative evaluation, self‐efficacy, and cooperative (dis)loyalty. The latent variables identified were tested against behavioral intentions in two logistic regressions where the dairy farmers’ plans for remaining or exiting the cooperative and their plans for postfarm gate entrepreneurial activities were the dependent variables. Two latent variables emerged as significant predictors: restructuring the farm business and the membership role. These predictors were push factors in the model, suggesting that dissatisfaction with delivery to existing dairy cooperatives, rather than job or life satisfaction from setting up their own business, acted as farmers’ motive to exit. These results can be used in developing communication and strategies for more viable dairy cooperatives and in understanding the incentives behind the ongoing restructuring of the dairy market from a supply perspective.

Even if market loss does not occur, segmenting the market benefits producers not able to effectively use bST, and may even benefit bST users if the use of bST significantly shifts the supply curve for milk. Non-bST-consuming consumers benefit from the availability of non-bST milk, and consumers who are indifferent to the use of bST pay about the same price in a segmented market.",

With the conclusion of the Marrakesh Accords, the new Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and a more potent Dispute Settlements procedure, mean that SPS measures are now more tightly regulated. This paper examines the Agreement, its modus operandi, and its dependence upon the activities of the international standards setting bodies such as Codex Alimentarius. It outlines some of the problems that have been identified by the WTO signatories, and considers the likely outcome of the current review.

While retailer brands have developed powerfully in some products and countries, in others manufacturer brands have been stronger and more dominant. Certain global brands however (e.g., Coca-Cola) have been preeminent in their markets, seemingly inviolate to any retailer brand challenge. The restructuring and re-organization of The Cott Corporation since 1989, emphasizing retailer brand soft drinks and relationship/partnership building has challenged this inalienable brand position in soft drinks. Cott's extensive (although recent) operations, developing proprietary retailer brand drinks has caused a reassessment of retailer branding status both specifically in the product sector and more generally.

Using a data set on purchases of a variety of meat types in Israel, the analysis shows that much of the variation in food consumption patterns are explained by life style differences and socioeconomic factors. In particular, we find that variables such as the cook's attitude towards cooking, family feedback, time constraints, and religious observance, in addition to income, provide an understanding of the purchase of various meat products and the choice between ready‐to‐eat versus unprepared foods. A strong preference for consuming a variety of meats is observed, and family preference for particular meat products is an important determinant of consumption. These results provide information for a market segmentation strategy [EconLit Subject code: L660]. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Analysis show increasing tolls would reduce exports via U.S. Gulf ports, increase exports via U.S. Pacific Northwest ports, reduce quantities transiting the Canal, and increase maritime movements to East Asia via Africa's Cape of Good Hope. The U.S. role in Asia's corn and soybean markets would decline; however, total U.S. exports would be reduced no more than 2%. Results suggest a revenue-maximizing Canal operator could substantially increase revenues by adjusting tolls up by $2/ton on corn-laden vessels and $1/ton on soybean-laden vessels. This would lower U.S. corn and soybean revenues by about $160 million. If the Canal were to be closed, it is projected that revenues of U.S. corn and soybean producers would decline $303 million per year. [EconLit citations: L910, L920] © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

A demand matrix was established and the effect of changing tastes on each subgroup was measured in an annual rate of shift in demand. Policy implications of the results are discussed in some detail to obtain the long-term prospects for the supply of food commodities in particular.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A spatial, multiproduct equilibrium model featuring United States–Mexico long‐grain rice trade is developed to determine the effect of removing Mexico's rice tariffs in 2003 on U.S. rough and milled rice exports to that country. Analysis considers rice milling costs and yields in the United States and Mexico, transportation costs associated with U.S. rice exports to Mexico, mill by‐product prices in Mexico and the United States and the changing tariff levels. Results show Mexico's graduated decline in rice tariffs over the 1997 to 2003 period to increase U.S. rice exports to Mexico about 1% per year or a total of 7% over the 6‐year period. United States' long‐grain rice price and production is modestly affected by the increased exports, while the impact on Mexico's rice production and price is comparatively large. Further, results show the historic incentive to export rough rice to Mexico will be replaced by an incentive to export milled rice, thus opportunities for the U.S. rice milling industry to form alliances with Mexican packers and increase direct relationships with large retailers in Mexico.

The estimated error–correction coefficients and price responses indicate, first, imperfect price transmission among agricultural input, output, and retail food prices, and second, that agricultural output prices are more flexible than agricultural input and retail food prices.

Based on this model, we are able to derive a parameter that nests various types of firm conduct, ranging from price taking through Nash-Cournot behavior to collusion. In addition, we estimate market conduct and associated price distortions in a sub-game perfect, dynamic-feedback model, and compare the results with those derived from an open-loop model. The results indicate that the behavior of potato-processing firms is much closer to price taking than to collusion. Moreover, we find that price distortions due to oligopsony in the purchase of potatoes are smaller than oligopoly price distortions in either the potato chips or the frozen French fries sectors.

It draws an important distinction between before and after analysis and counterfactual impact analysis and highlights constraining assumptions in models. Over time, the Compact increased raw milk price 2–3 cents per gallon, but if the Compact had not been in place during the first three years of its operation, raw milk prices would have been approximately 10 cents lower. Over time, retail prices went up by much more than 2–3 cents because other costs increased and channel firms increased tacit collusion and net profits. Studies give different counterfactual estimates for retail prices without the Compact. They range from a drop of 5.7 cents per gallon to 20.7 cents per gallon and are very sensitive to modeling approach. Comparative analysis, as done in this article, should contribute to policy formulation rather than appearing ex post. [EconLit citations: L66 L11 L13]. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Retailers who sell relatively more U.S. fresh fruits over total values of fruit sales favor the characteristics of U.S. fresh fruits. Consumers do not value the relative importance of characteristics of U.S. fresh fruits as much as retailers do. Strategic marketing plans need to be designed for both retailers and consumers to strengthen the acceptance of U.S. fresh fruits. A well‐balanced promotion strategy emphasizing the overall superiority of profit‐driven characteristics of U.S. fruits may encourage retailers to sell more U.S. fresh fruits. Highlighting information related to price and freshness of U.S. fruits may stimulate consumers to purchase more U.S. fresh fruits. [EconLit citations: M310, Q130.] © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the first, data envelopment analysis (DEA) evaluated technical and scale efficiency of the Dutch vegetable sector relative to the type of final distribution (mixed marketing channels versus traditional auctions). In the second stage, a truncated regression model (TRM) was applied to explain grower efficiency from a managerial point of view. The results of the first stage showed that growers who sell their products through auctions are less efficient. The second stage revealed that variables such as firm size, age, ownership structure, and distribution channel strategy significantly contribute to the explanation of technical efficiency of the growers, while the variables firm location, firm size, and firm age affect their scale.

We assume reductions of 36% similar to the 1995 World Trade Organization agreement. The price substitutability between U.S. and EU dairy products is estimated using a Rotterdam‐type production model. Past analyses have suggested that EU export subsidy reductions will increase U.S. dairy exports because the removal of EU subsidies will raise EU export dairy prices, rendering U.S. dairy products more competitive on world markets. This is partially true for nonfat dry milk, where our projections indicate an increase of 4.6% in U.S. exports. U.S. cheese, butter, and whey exports, on the other hand, rise by only 0.2, 0.1, and 0.2%, respectively. The main reason for the relatively modest gains is that the U.S. and EU dairy products are independent, not substitutes, for one another in a majority of the countries studied.

    "abstract": "Abstract The package downsizing strategy allows a manufacturer to raise unit prices while maintaining package prices in a range acceptable to consumers. The success of the strategy depends on the retailers' ability to transmit the cost of downsized products into consumer prices at higher rates compared to transmitting equivalent increases in the cost of nondownsized products. In this article, we test this hypothesis by empirically analyzing the retailers' pass‐through behavior in response to downsizing. Using data on ice cream purchases, our main finding is that downsizing is significantly associated with the price pass‐through. On average, downsized products' pass‐through rate is 8.4 percentage points higher than the rate for nondownsized products. An important implication of this result is that in competitive environments in which manufacturers prefer to avoid substantial increases in package prices, downsizing could be a win–win strategy for manufacturers and retailers in response to increasing production costs.

This is highly unlikely given that the responsiveness of trade to exchange rate fluctuations could depend on the biological, marketing, and economic factors specific to a commodity. Consequently, we focused solely on broilers for this analysis, which is a leading sector in global meat trade. Using a gravity model, we assessed how two measures of exchange rate volatility (short‐ and long‐run) affect cross‐partner broiler trade. Our results indicated that long‐run exchange rate volatility has a negative and significant effect on broiler trade, albeit small when compared to the effects of population, regionalization, and sharing a common border; the short‐run effect of exchange rate volatility was insignificant. Overall, results suggest that exchange rate volatility has little or no effect on bilateral broiler trade. [EconLit citations: C32, F14, Q17].",

Business micro‐data were obtained from the Survey on Innovation in the Food Processing Industry in 2004 ( n = 809). A higher Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar was judged to be the most severe of the 10 impediments to the ability of Canadian food processors to compete. Two broader categories of the 10 impediments emerged from a principal component analysis. One category of the impediments relates to private and public standards, while the other relates to vertical and horizontal market power issues. The severity of these impediments is not significantly different among the different size classes of food processors. Subsequent clustering procedures based on these impediments found that the food processors in one cluster were more constrained by all these impediments than their counterparts in the other cluster. Establishment characteristics, such as food subsector classification, and firm strategies, such as export orientation and engagement in R&amp;D activities, were systematically associated with a firm's likelihood of being in the cluster that perceived the impediments to be more severe. Exporting firms are more likely than other firms to perceive each one of the impediments as a constraint. [EconLit Subject Matter Areas: D220; L200; L660].",

The relationship between corn and oil prices tends to be stronger when oil prices are highly volatile and when agricultural policies create less distortion. The ethanol boom strengthened the relation between corn and oil prices, which are cointegrated only in the fourth and last regime.

We apply this method to a sample of about 200 breweries in Germany, because beer is a differentiated product and at the same time the sector has repeatedly been suspected to show collusive behavior. Our empirical results show that a significant part of the estimated markup is due to product differentiation. This is especially true for beers produced in Bavaria. However, there are other important sources of imperfect competition. Markups are higher for large firms and increase over time. In addition, we observe increasing returns to scale and average costs above marginal costs. Hence, in the German brewing sector a high markup does not necessarily translate into a high profit margin.

The analysis was based on a spatial equilibrium model of major importing and exporting regions that incorporates key features of China's SSD. The model solutions suggest that implementation of the SSD system improved market access for imports of cotton in China, which benefitted cotton processors, and adversely affected China's cotton producers. The Chinese market price of cotton decreased, imports increased, and domestic production declined. Furthermore, subsequent adjustments of the SSD system increased market access for cotton, which benefitted China cotton processors. These changes in China's cotton trade policy altered conditions in the world. [EconLit Citations: C600; F130; Q170].",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Euro changeover distorted previously well‐formed nominal price patterns. Food retailers may have reacted by adjusting prices to reintroduce psychological prices as before the Euro changeover. We employ a detailed data set of German food retail prices before and after the Euro changeover to test three different benchmarks indicating potential adjustments of prices. However, none of these benchmarks do adequately reflect the actual distribution of prices. We find that prices of signpost items follow best a conversion at the official rate. Also, signpost items show a slower price adjustment. Occasional goods’ prices indicate a reestablishment of psychological price patterns, in particular for the ending digits; price distributions are adjusted faster. Further, price inflation is about zero for both goods, but prices in particular for signpost items have been significantly raised just before the Euro changeover. These different pricing patterns may be explained by consumer behavior. Consumers react more sensitive to price changes of frequently purchased goods (signpost items), and thus, retailers convert prices at the official rate and postpone price adjustments for these items after the Euro changeover.

Forward pricing is often extended to end‐users by soybean oil processors where the forward price quote is a function of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) futures price and the cash‐futures basis. Upon entering a forward pricing agreement, the processor (seller) assumes the risk associated with basis fluctuations. This research examines if soybean oil processors extract a market premium for assuming this risk. Using forward basis quotes and subsequent realized basis values for soybean oil, it is found that soybean oil processors do not charge an embedded cost for their forward pricing services. Furthermore, the results suggest that the absence of a statistically significant embedded cost may be due to the lack of predictability in the basis or the inability of soybean oil processors to adequately forecast soybean oil basis levels.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recent developments in trade literature suggest that in the presence of strategic pricing in some markets and an incomplete exchange rate pass‐through resulting from it, the standard gravity model has to be augmented with an exchange rate variable. As symmetry of pass‐through has been questioned in new pricing‐to‐market (PTM) studies, we argue that this asymmetric impact of the exchange rate on trade should be explicitly modeled within the gravity framework. This consideration of asymmetric effects of exchange rate appreciations and depreciations on export values and quantities might provide insights into the driving forces of PTM in a particular market (or group of markets) given that the existing literature emphasizes two main hypotheses that explain the occurrence of an asymmetric PTM (market share hypothesis and marketing bottleneck hypothesis). In this paper, we propose a way to integrate individual (asymmetric) long‐run effects of currency appreciations and depreciations on trade flows into the gravity model and empirically investigate which of the driving forces is relevant for the case of German beer exports. PTM studies often argue that the market share protection is a reason for local currency price stabilization mechanisms applied in the most important markets. Yet, the results of our analysis reveal that this might no longer be the case when all trading partners are considered. [EconLit citations: C33; F14; L66].",

Considering the limited existing information on the contributions of various factors to timely deal completion or delays in FABI, our findings are useful in predicting M&amp;A deal duration, costs, and potential for success.

In the context of product origin, we contribute to the literature with an incentivized experiment to estimate preferences for payoff distributions among Missouri beef consumers, Missouri beef producers, and non‐Missouri beef producers on the basis of inequality aversion and consumer ethnocentrism. According to the results, Missouri beef consumers not only have self‐regarding preferences but also other‐regarding preferences in case of payoff distributions, in particular toward Missouri beef producers. We explain such preferences from the perspective of consumer ethnocentrism. Specifically, Missouri beef consumers who have a higher degree of state‐level ethnocentrism also have a higher degree of aversion to inequalities among themselves and Missouri beef producers. Although few food consumers appear to be highly ethnocentric, there may exist potential to segment on the basis of state‐level ethnocentrism.

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper measures pairwise multiscale extreme risk interdependence between the five major agricultural futures. This topic has economic importance for agricultural market participants because potentially high losses might occur due to the cross‐market extreme risk transmissions. Downside risk is observed via time‐varying Value‐at‐Risk time‐series, while the multiscale analysis is conducted using several wavelet approaches. Results of wavelet coherence show an absence of high interdependence in the short‐term horizons, while at higher wavelet scales, we find stronger connection only in some cases—corn–wheat, corn–soybean, wheat–soybean and somewhat corn–rice. High coherence islands are detected around the global financial crisis, but only in a few cases, which means that commodity financialization could play an important role when it comes to extreme risk. Wavelet correlations and wavelet‐based quantile regression support the wavelet coherence findings in great deal, adding to the robustness of the overall results. Phase difference indicates that bigger markets, such as corn, wheat, and soybean, mostly lead two smaller markets—rice and oats in the midterm and long‐term horizons, but a consistent and long‐lasting pattern is evident only between corn and soybean. An absence of a clear‐cut downside interdependence means that agricultural agents do not need to worry too much about the damaging extreme risk spillover effects from other neighboring agricultural markets.

    "abstract": "Abstract In 2019, the US ornamental horticulture industry had a farm gate crop value of roughly $17 billion, contributed $348 billion in total output to the nation's economy, and created 2.32 million employment opportunities. However, as the industry matures and reaches a slow‐growing stage, interfirm rivalry may appear among grower firms for marketing channels and sales opportunities. Independent garden centers and retailers report facing increased competition from mass merchandisers. Market channel choices, as part of the competitive strategy, are alternative ways for ornamental production to reach consumers. However, marketing practices of this industry have not received adequate attention from researchers despite the economic significance of the industry. Combining four waves of the National Green Industry Survey from 2004 to 2019, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing firms' market participation and market channel choices. Over the survey period, traditional wholesale market channels such as landscape services companies, rewholesalers, and single‐location garden centers have remained mainstream channels. The direct‐to‐consumer (DTC) channel showed the potential to gain significant market share. Thirty percent of the firms participated in DTC channel in 2018, and their sales represent about 22% of total sales by all survey firms. Our empirical results show firms' wholesale market participation and choices of market channels are largely influenced by plant types and firm perceptions (variables potentially affecting firms' assessment of the “size” of their market) and variables approximating the market size such as regional dummies and housing price index, confirming the impact of market size on entry decision.

The results from the specification accounting for the response heterogeneity show that the substantial fall in corn prices had a significant negative impact on the incomes of the large and medium farms that chose to reduce corn acreage and of the large farms that chose to abandon corn planting. In contrast, the results from the specification ignoring the response heterogeneity indicate that the corn price shocks had a significant negative impact on the incomes of all large corn‐producing farms. The results confirm our proposition that the supply response state and the initial operation scale are responsible for whether a corn producer is hurt by a fall in corn prices. The findings suggest that it matters to take the response heterogeneity into account in correctly determining the differential effects of a price shock on farmers' incomes.

    "abstract": "Abstract The worsening volatility in the domestic and global hog and pork markets is a cause of concern for China's producers and government, as well as the global market. Cyclical price fluctuations have been caused by domestic small‐ and medium‐scale farmers' frequent exits and re‐entries into the hog market, which may have been partly driven by information asymmetry and risk resistance. This study examines the impact of a farmer field school (FFS) program aiming to deliver information and services that may facilitate hog farmers' decision‐making. Using survey data collected from 226 hog farms in Beijing, we employ probit models to examine the exit decisions of hog farmers based on their FFS participation and its effect on hog farm size. We find evidence that FFS participation significantly reduces hog farmers' exit rates, and that this effect increases as farm scale decreases. The findings suggest that such a program may be an effective policy tool to support and improve the resilience of small‐ and medium‐scale hog farms, thereby alleviating the volatility in China's hog industry and those of other developing countries where small‐ and medium‐scale hog farms play an important role.

A meta‐regression analysis conducted on beef valuation studies shows the extent of the impact of product quantity. When beef product quantity increases by 100 g, the percentage price premium declines by 2−4 percentage points, which differs across model specifications and samples.

Estimation is undertaken using a directional distance function that accounts for the presence of adjustment costs associated with investments in quasi‐fixed factors of production. A bootstrap regression is then used to determine the factors affecting dynamic productivity change and its components. Results show that the sample cooperatives experienced a modest decline in productivity over the study period, on average. The analysis of productivity change decompositions suggests that productivity decline is mainly due to the negative contribution of technical inefficiency change. Results further reveal that ignoring adjustment costs when modeling cooperatives' performance leads to distortions in estimates of productivity and its components. The regression analysis results show that years of operation and a higher share of energy products in supply turnover are positively related to productivity change, technical inefficiency change, and scale inefficiency change.

We find that tree nut shipments were 457 million pounds or $943 million below the counterfactual between May 2021 and July 2022. Almonds experienced the brunt of those trade losses, while pistachio and walnut exports recorded smaller losses and recovered faster. Our estimates imply that maritime shipping disruptions are a primary driver of surging tree nut inventories. Without the trade destruction caused by maritime shipping disruptions, the almond inventory could have been 38.7% lower and close to the long‐run average in the 2021/22 marketing year.

    "abstract": "Abstract Food production and trade have become inseparable from requirements about product quality and safety, as well as social and environmental aspects of production processes. To demonstrate compliance with these requirements, firms adopt voluntary private certifiable management standards (CMS). How these affect trade, organizational performance, and employee outcomes has become an area of active research in the last decade. This paper analyses how standards affect labor productivity and wages using a 3‐year panel of small and medium firms from the food sector in Vietnam covering the period 2010–2014. Even though the prevalence of CMS in the sample is low, the results show that standards improve both labor productivity and wages. However, the difference in the size of the productivity and wage premiums attributable to standards is not significant. This implies that CMS can be a useful management practice for improving firm productivity when combined with a fair compensation of human resources. The findings are important for lower‐income countries facing low rates of adoption of private CMS and the evolving consumer preferences increasingly attuned to the issues of product quality, food safety, and environmental risks. The results are robust to several specification changes and estimation methods, including firm fixed effects, control function, and instrumental variable approach, which take endogeneity of certification into account.

    "abstract": "Abstract Pet‐food industry growth and demand for specialized product offerings have generated new opportunities for companies to enhance their competitiveness and profitability through effective product differentiation. Recent rise in e‐commerce and technological advancements for capturing and analyzing online customer review data provide new opportunities for large‐scale assessment of customer perceptions of product attributes. This paper presents an integrated qualitative and quantitative approach for utilizing online customer review data to generate insights for informing pet‐food industry product and marketing decisions. The results from the analysis of 5632 online reviews of two pet‐food products highlight (i) product attributes that effectively differentiate (or put on par) two competing pet‐food products, (ii) identify product attributes that are most important for customer postpurchase experience, and (iii) estimate the effect of specific attributes on customers' positive (or negative) postpurchase experience. Specific pet‐food attributes examined include packaging, health/benefit, ingredient, taste, smell, appearance/form, natural/organic, processing, sourcing, small/large breed, price , and service . The advantages of this approach include its ability to leverage large amounts of easily accessible data and its generalizability to the analysis of other consumer goods that have significant online sales and customer review data [EconLit Citations: Q13, M31].",

    "abstract": "Abstract The rapidly growing animal protein demand of Chinese residents has caused multiple pressures, including on food security, health, and the environment. It is critical to study the reasons for the changes in Chinese residents' protein intake structure and make a reasonable judgment about its future trend. This paper uses the Nationwide Urban Household Survey Date from 1992 to 2009 to construct a pseudo panel and conduct research based on the habit formation theory. We find that there is a significant habit formation effect in the consumption of the main protein source foods of Chinese urban residents, especially animal foods. It weakens with the passage of time, which may be the reason for the continuous increase in urbanites' animal protein intake. There are differences in the protein intake structure and changing trend of urban residents in China's different regions. We suggest that government should pay more attention to the development of animal husbandry and the supply security of feed grains; strengthen nutritional intervention efforts to guide residents toward balanced and healthy dietary patterns, with moderate intake of animal protein; and formulate more detailed nutritional standards by region and population to cope with the impact of the growing animal protein demand among China's residents.

    "abstract": "Abstract China's per capita dairy consumption has been far below the intake level recommended by the World Health Organization. Since the dairy industry is a significant contributor to carbon emissions, the recently launched “Double‐Carbon” goals in China may also suppress the supply of dairy products, further reducing Chinese residents' dairy intake. While the notion of sustainable (i.e., nutritious and environmentally friendly) food consumption has recently gained popularity in the policy arena, whether Chinese milk consumers are ready to embrace this notion and what specific measures can effectively promote sustainable milk consumption in China remain unclear. On the basis of a discrete choice experiment, this paper examines how information nudges (i.e., randomly provided messages with different contents and details) may steer Chinese consumers into choosing liquid milk products with attributes that are more nutritious and environmentally friendly. Our analysis, involving 839 consumers randomly selected from Beijing, China, shows that consumers value carbon labels the most, followed by nutrition claims, sustainable production claims, and energy conservation certificates. Meanwhile, nutrition information induces consumers to place higher values on nutrition claims; in contrast, environmental information raises consumers' willingness to choose environmental sustainability‐related attributes. Finally, the concreteness of the information provided strengthens these effects [EconLit Citations: D12, Q01, Q13, Q18].",

Much has changed in recent years, with plummeting demand during the coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic, biodiesel plants struggling to break‐even in 2020, and then incurring losses in 2021 as soybean oil prices skyrocketed with the rise of renewable diesel—a relatively new biomass‐based diesel fuel in high demand largely due to green policies in California. This study revisits the appropriate strategies for hedging biodiesel production risk and finds that soybean oil has become a less important hedging vehicle.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines the impact of farm households' decision to adopt crop insurance and its effect on food security. Using the National Sample Survey Office's 77th round of data (2019–2020) from Indian farming households, the endogenous switching regression results confirm that insuring crops against production risks increases food security (as measured by higher consumption expenditures and net farm income). Specifically, findings show that farming households would decrease consumption expenditures by 15% and net farm income by 26% if they had not adopted crop insurance. Similarly, the noninsured families would have 23% higher consumption expenditures and 31% higher net farm income if they had insured crops. However, we find heterogeneity in welfare impacts because large farmers reap more benefits than smallholders. Policy implications from this study call for increased awareness of insurance programs, educating farmers about crop insurance schemes, and an effective institutional framework to reduce heterogeneity in insurance benefits.

On the basis of the stimulus–organism–response theory and the embedding theories, microsurvey data of 302 farmers regarding the winter jujube production area of the Dali facility in the Shaanxi Province were used to empirically test the impact of neighborhood effect (NE) and virtual social networks on farmers' participation in social e‐commerce, and the interaction effect of the two aspects. Additionally, we analyzed its mechanism under the framework of “social networks‐farmers' cognition‐social e‐commerce participation behavior (SEPB).” The research results are as follows. First, neighborhood participation, social software friends, and information release have a significant positive impact on farmers' SEPB, whereas information reception has a negative impact. Second, the empirical results considering the comprehensive effects of various variables show that NE, network communication, and network participation (NP) can all promote farmers' participation in social e‐commerce, and NP is complementary to NE. Third, mechanism analysis shows that NE and NP produce partial mediating effect and complete mediating effect, respectively, through self‐competence recognition (SR), which in turn positively impacts the SEPB. In the heterogeneity analysis, for farmers with a plantation area of less than or equal to 0.447 ha, SR has a partial mediating effect on the process of NE affecting SEPB, whereas the motivating factor is NP. In terms of labor force structure, only the percentage of nonagricultural workers exceeds 0.253, NE and NP affect SEPB through SR. This study can provide a reference for farmers to rationally use their social networks, and guide the formulation of social e‐commerce support policies at the national level.",

After a description of important structural features in the milk production, milk processing and food retailing sectors in European countries and the discussion of different approaches to measure international competitiveness, the analysis is carried out at the meso-economic level by using “Revealed Comparative Advantage Indicators” to determine the competitive position of the German dairy industry. In comparison with other EU countries, the German dairy sector seems to have international competitive advantages in fresh, dried, and evaporated milk products.

The results of estimation of the WTP function support the hypothesis that respondents follow an adaptive learning process, in which they establish their posterior risk belief in a rational manner by adapting their prior risk belief as they are supplied with new risk information. We find that the weight of the prior risk belief is slightly smaller than that of new risk information in forming the posterior risk belief for three out of four estimation models. Knowledge of how consumers form their risk beliefs and who evaluates egg safety enables us to clearly specify targets for effective campaigns to enhance public awareness at a household level about health and food safety issues.

In this article we analyze this crisis situation to find the causative factors and to propose recommendations for the development and sustainability of the industry. The main factors contributing to the crisis are unfavorable trade policies, trade barriers, human resource problems, poor trade behavior, export barriers, poor product marketing strategy, the high cost of production, poor industry regulation, and threats from the global marketing environment. Recommendations for the development of the industry include policy changes, improved working conditions, trade strategies, product diversification, mechanization, quality assurance, market development, strengthening of market position, and regional cooperation. We present a comprehensive long‐term strategy for the future development of the coir fiber industry of Sri Lanka. [EconLit citations: O530, Q130, Q170.] © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We provide empirical measures of the sensitivity of demand to changes in total imports, own‐price, and cross‐prices among exporting countries for four market segments of the cheese category. Derived demands for U.S. fresh, grated, and processed cheese products are perfectly inelastic, and it is thus suggested that competition in these segments be based upon differences in product characteristics. However, the derived demand for “other” cheese is elastic, and competition can be price driven. Hence, an advantage of this paper's approach is that disaggregating import data for a product category helps identify specific marketing strategies for market segments within the category.

Results from the adoption model show that factors associated with competition, merchandising philosophy, and structure in the food retailing industry play a strong role in the decision. Among other results, it was found that variables relating to a competitor's adoption status and proximity can increase the likelihood of a store's adoption.

We present a theoretical model that determines fresh grapefruit prices Free on Board (FOB) at the packinghouse. The first order conditions show that the FOB packinghouse prices are equal for products with the same product characteristics. The theoretical conditions show a difference in FOB prices when the product characteristics are different. The product characteristics that are varied include packing costs and pack‐out rates. The results from a nonlinear programming optimization routine demonstrates the importance of using data that accurately represents homogeneous products for LOP studies. Different packing costs and pack‐out percentages are shown to cause different FOB packinghouse prices for fresh grapefruit destined for domestic and export markets.

Commodity and variety monthly base price data for the period of 1998 to 2006 are used. Empirical results decisively suggest the existence of price convergence across markets as well as onion varieties. A two‐sample period analysis shows an increase in the speed of price convergence over time, suggesting deeper market integration as NAFTA was fully implemented. Further analysis based on a two‐country‐market basis found that U.S.–Canadian markets have experienced deeper market integration compared with U.S.–Mexican markets as well as Canadian–Mexican markets.

    "abstract": "Abstract The sugarcane industry in Brazil, one of the world's leading producers of ethanol and sugar, is undergoing significant changes driven by geographic expansion and technological innovations. These changes are forcing sugarcane producers and processors, to re‐evaluate their vertical coordination and growth strategies. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the relationship between the vertical coordination strategies at the production‐processing interface of the Brazilian ethanol supply chain and the technical efficiency of the mills. It utilizes data envelopment analysis and a Tobit censored model in combination with unique data on 204 mills that account for around half of Brazil's sugar and ethanol production. Results indicate that vertical integration and the location of the mill have a statistically significant impact on efficiency. The findings show that the technical efficiency is not the main driver of vertical integration implying that such decisions are primarily motivated by strategic considerations. The mills are likely to forgo gains in technical efficiency in exchange for improving their strategic position through vertical integration. These findings shed light on the underlying motivation for the observed level of vertical integration that accompanies the expansion of the Brazilian sugarcane industry.

Using electroencephalography along with an incentive compatible willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) elicitation mechanism, our study provides neural based evidence that the Shuanghui–Smithfield acquisition lowered consumers' preference for the Smithfield brand, but increased it for the Chinese brand. Consumers' neural preference for American brands increased after learning about the acquisition, implying a positive spillover effect to US brands in the US market. We also find that, after learning that an item is a product of the United States, consumers' neural preference decreased although their willingness‐to‐pay increased, consistent with some empirical reports that many US consumers prefer to purchase cheaper products made abroad rather than products of the United States with higher prices.",

However, measurement of technical bias has only been carried out in a static framework, ignoring the confounding effects of technical bias due to adjustment costs. This paper integrates two streams of literature, that is one measuring dynamic inefficiency and the other measuring technical bias, thereby offering non‐parametric measures of technical bias for dynamic production technology. The dynamic framework explains the changes in the extent of output foregone to enable investments. The proposed framework is applied to a panel of data of Lithuanian cereal farms over the period 2004–2014. The results show technical change was, on average, more biased toward increasing output rather than investment. Technical change has been more focused on labor‐usage, relative to land and intermediate consumption in the same period.",

This study incorporates information about other consumers' behavior in a choice experiment to evaluate if it affects choice probabilities. Market share is used as a proxy to signal that a product is chosen by many of the individual's peers. Although the effect is associated with diversity, there is a segment of individuals that perceive high market shares to carry relevant information for their food purchasing decision. Respondents who expect to hold similar or more positive preferences towards an unfamiliar food attribute relative to their peers are positively affected by a high market share. Taking information signals from peers' behavior into account may improve understanding of consumer behavior and improve our ability to predict the reception of new food aspects.",

To answer this question, we carry out a hedonic analysis of the retail eggs prices in Croatia. Scientific evidence clearly supports the notion that birds' wellbeing is higher in cage‐free systems than in a typical cage system. Therefore, there is a clear link between production systems and animal welfare. We use the retail level monthly data for 2017 on sales quantities and unit values of all fresh egg stock keeping units from all stores belonging to one of the largest retail chains in the country. The estimation results of the equilibrium hedonic price equation model shows that holding other attributes constant, the clean price premium for cage‐free eggs is 15 cents per 10‐egg carton or 7.8% of the retail price. Although the implicit price premium for cage‐free eggs is relatively modest, there are not that many people actually willing to buy them. Because only 2.2% of all eggs sold by the retail chain were actually cage‐free, the average per‐person willingness to pay for cage‐free eggs is only 0.3 cents for a 10‐egg carton [EconLit Citations: D12, L66, M31].",

Since 2007, chapter 12 filers have seen noticeable increases in their debt levels whereas alternative business bankruptcies have either stagnated or declined in their debt. Using survival analysis methods to correct for the censored nature of open cases, we find that the average time to completion has consistently been longer for chapter 12 than the comparable chapters (7, 11, and 13) of business bankruptcies. Although chapter 12 completion times have not been increasing over time, we find that chapter 7 and 11 completion times have been declining over time for comparable businesses and that debt levels are a significant factor in increased completion times. Our results are consistent with claims that farmers have had rising debt levels in comparison to similar businesses filing for bankruptcy and provide evidence that farmers with increasing debt have had a more difficult time restructuring through chapter 12.

Advertising, having an estimated elasticity (of demand) of 0.038 using panel data, is found to be about five times as effective as nonadvertising; therefore, it remains the more powerful marketing tool. Such results have policy implications in benefit‐cost analysis and optimal allocation of fluid‐milk check‐off funds.

Although most analyses treat consumers’ attitudes and willingness to pay as separate issues, we introduce the idea of prior purchase intention to analyze these two issues as a whole. To achieve this purpose, a modeling technique invoking the multinomial logistic model and the accelerated failure time model is presented. Based on the data collected from an essential double‐bounded design, our empirical results suggest that Taiwanese consumers are willing to pay a premium of about 11 NT dollars (7% of the given average market price of 150 NT dollars for the non‐ GM salmon) to avoid GM ‐soybean‐fed salmon. In addition, the results of this study provide evidence that our stated‐preference double‐bounded design has a better‐off statistical efficiency than the single‐bounded one.",

To identify these effects, a probit model is specified and estimated, which allows the calculation of the probability that the private label product is chosen conditional on a set of explanatory variables. Attention is centered on American processed cheese transactions. The source of the data is ACNielsen Homescan Panel of U.S. households for calendar years 2005 and 2006. Retail promotion using store coupons had a significant negative effect on the decision to purchase private label products. In our sample, store coupons were used to purchase both private label products and national brands. A strong negative relationship was found between national brand manufacturer couponing activity and the decision to purchase private label products. Therefore, national brand couponing appears to be an effective strategy for manufacturers to deter private label growth, at least in the processed cheese market. This analysis also shows that the decision of purchasing a private label cheese product is influenced by several sociodemographic characteristics of the household, namely household income and size, age and education of the household head, race, ethnicity, and location.",

We investigate the case in which either upstream production practices or downstream distribution may cause product contamination resulting in noncompliance with the authorized thresholds of residues (maximum residue limit [MRL]). We provide a comparative analysis of the retailers’ liability rule‐based accountability and the liability rule “polluter pays,” which penalizes an operator who is directly responsible for a noncompliant product. We show that choosing the optimal liability rule is a complex problem, as the choice depends on the effectiveness of food safety controls and on the magnitude of the fine associated with rejecting noncompliant products. Moreover, the choice of the liability rule can change the negotiating power of both operators and, according to the rule chosen, the retailer will have to pay a higher or lower input price.

However, most markets do not function in a manner consistent with a single static benchmark. Methods to overcome this problem have largely been rejected by the research community (i.e., conjectural variations). The primary objective of our research is to introduce a new methodology for measuring imperfect competition under product differentiation in consumer goods. We develop the empirical procedures for estimating a competitive toughness model as proposed by d'Aspremont, Dos Santos Ferreira, and Gérard‐Varet. This approach presents a theoretically grounded procedure that measures market power in an empirically tractable framework. We estimate the proposed model on the retail market for ground coffee. Our results suggest that market power is understated in a model that imposes the restriction of Bertrand pricing. The results suggest that this could be a promising approach for use in many applications. [EconLit citations: D43, L13, K21]",

Our conceptual model represents a price‐setting monopsonist competing with multiple monopsonists, and the corresponding empirical model includes a time‐varying parameter framework so that it can trace the change in packers’ imperfect competition behavior in the cattle procurement market over time. The empirical model is applied to three cattle procurement markets in the United States: national, Nebraska, and Texas/Oklahoma/New Mexico. Empirical results show the existence of oligopsony market power in the U.S. cattle procurement market. The oligopsony market power is considerably influenced by cattle cycle and seasonality, which indicates that packers tend to increase their margin during the excessive cattle supply period while maintaining lower margin during the short cattle supply period.

In terms of accuracy (MSE and MAPE), a simple autoregressive model outperforms the naive expectations benchmark in some samples, as does a very simple VAR-type model in which lagged piglet prices are added to the lagged hog prices as RHS variables. Forecasting performance is, however, quite sensitive to the chosen lag structure, and there is reason to doubt whether the simple autoregressive model from an economic point of view yields significantly better results than those of the naive model. Focusing on directional forecasts, on the other hand, the simple VAR-models perform clearly better.

The gap between branded and private label prices also declined. This was due to unexpected increases in private label prices during the jawboning campaign as well as decreases in branded prices. As predicted by the Dorfman Steiner theorem, branded advertising declined when the price cuts reduced brand price cost margins.

The cointegrating vectors, speeds of adjustment, and impulse response function analysis provide unique insights into the direction, magnitude, and speed of price response in these value‐added, agricultural product markets.

Using standard theory, long‐run price relationships between the stages in the channel are derived. Next, these static price relationships are imposed on a dynamic model to be tested for cointegration and long‐run noncausality, embedding the hypotheses on vertical price leadership. To derive the testable implications of these hypotheses, we show that the common stochastic trend and long‐run equilibrium error must explicitly be assigned to variables in the channel model. The model is particularly relevant for industries characterized by a low degree of product differentiation. An empirical application to two Dutch marketing channels for food products gives comprehensible results. [EconLit citations: C32, L12, Q11] © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Based upon current financial accounting standards, prospective payments for these costs are not always reported as liabilities on financial statements. Agribusiness lenders require complete information on the environmental status of agribusiness borrowers in order to assess the potential effects of environmental liability. In addition, agribusiness lenders have been held responsible by the judicial system for the environmental problems of their borrowers. Publicly available, financial and environmental data was used to develop models to quantify the effects of environmental status regardless of whether environmental liabilities are included in the financial statements. The results indicate that environmental status is dependent upon source of environmental hazard and company size, adjusted for industry affiliation. Affiliation with particular 4‐digit SIC codes reduces the probability of the borrower being considered a significant environmental liability risk.

It measures the actual gains of a systemic approach to fisheries conservation where market, fishing technology, and fish population information are integrated in the regulatory process. In particular, we investigate the potential for increased rent extraction from the U.S. North Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery. We investigate how much the Japanese sashimi market would reward the U.S. fishery for improvements in quality, and whether the expected rise in revenues would be cost‐effective. The optimal results indicate moving away from gears such as purse‐seines and long‐lines in favor of harpoons and rod‐and‐reels, and concentrating the catch towards the end of the season. The analyses further indicate that it is more profitable to harvest fewer tuna but of greater size and quality than to focus on a great number of fish captures.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines a cash forward contract (CFC) that a growers' cooperative or association may offer producers to lock in a fixed price for their output. To cover the forward contract's risks, the cooperative would set up a stabilization fund, and as an option, may hedge with futures contracts. The authors evaluate both strategies' costs, which would be charged to the growers signing in the CFC in the form of a fee. By comparing this fee with farmers' willingness to pay, it is determined whether growers' would be interested in the forward contract. The scheme is tested on a selection of Spanish and French potato varieties, with reference to the “April” futures contracts traded on the Amsterdam exchange. The authors conclude that hedging with futures may help to reduce the cooperative's exposure to financial risk, but, on average, the stabilization fund alone is more effective without hedging. Risk‐averse growers may be interested in CFCs to reduce their revenue instability. [JEL Classifications: Q13, Q14, G13] © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Agribusiness 23: 245–261, 2007.",

In recent decades this sector, which exports mainly to European Union (E.U.) food distribution centers, has witnessed a greater correlation between production and marketing due to the influence of cooperatives. This has led to an increase in the availability and use of information for forecasting the different variables. This analysis proposes the combination of rational expectation models and lagged price expectation models. It also compares the proposed model with other traditional expectation models. The results suggest that current market information (rational expectation viewpoint) is being used complementary to lagged prices and show the suitability of a rational composite expectation model.

We use the non‐linear 3SLS estimator to address endogenous prices and serial correlation, and conduct bootstrapping to generate empirical distributions of elasticity estimates. Results suggest that cross‐market effects are economically and statistically important. Thus, econometric dairy demand models that ignore cross‐advertising and cross‐price effects are mis‐specified.

Bidding behavior often deviates from theoretical predictions in traditional Vickrey and Becker–DeGroot–Marschak (BDM) auction mechanisms. We propose and explore the bidding behavior and demand revealing properties of a hybrid first price‐Vickrey auction and a hybrid first price‐BDM mechanism. Results from a between‐sample, induced value experiment reveal that, relative to traditional mechanisms, the hybrid first price‐Vickrey auction and hybrid first price‐BDM mechanism significantly reduce participants’ likelihood of overbidding, and on average yield bids closer to true valuations. We discuss potential limitations to these hybrid mechanisms as well as implications for their use in eliciting homegrown values that are important for agribusiness and food marketing research.

Unlike previous research, this study estimates a global model using pooled data of producers and processors. In addition, it compares producers’ willingness to accept contracts’ attributes to processors willingness to pay for the same attributes. Data were collected in Benin from 300 producers and 140 processors of rice selected randomly. An estimation of the conditional logit model indicates that producers prefer contracts specifying cash payment, prefinancing, and quality agreement. Processors, on the other hand, prefer contracts specifying technical assistance for both harvest and all the production activities, and quality agreements. The latent class logit model shows that there is heterogeneity among the preferences of both producers and processors across the classes. However, producers prefer cash payment and processors assistance for harvesting across all the classes. This suggests that cash payment and assistance for harvesting are pivotal for contract selection by producers and processors, respectively. Producers are willing to accept a lower price for their paddy (reduction of 25.86 and 6.64 FCFA/kg) in exchange for specifying a cash payment mechanism and prefinancing in the contract. Processors are willing to pay an additional amount of 5.58 CFA/kg of paddy to secure good quality rice.",

In our sample, we did not find evidence that large producers obtain higher returns from insurance participation than their smaller counterparts. In fact, we found evidence of the opposite that larger producers in Iowa and Nebraska receive less than their smaller counterparts. Our farm size results suggest that any legislation limiting crop insurance participation from large producers would negatively influence the insurance pool, driving up premiums and consequently administrative and operational subsidies and per‐acre premium subsidy dollars. We did find evidence that cash insured types get more back in insurance than landlords in both Montana and Oklahoma, suggesting the possibility of moral hazard in input usage. Our results also highlight spatial differences in crop insurance outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Craft soda has become increasingly popular among consumers. Local manufacturers have opportunities to use a variety of strategies to differentiate their products from nationally recognized brands, including the use of real or natural ingredients, premium ingredients, and locally sourced ingredients, handmade and small batches, and creative taste. Loyal consumers of craft sodas often live within the proximity of the production location, and the manufacturers are normally small with a limited distribution area. From the local manufacturer's standpoint, it is important to segment the market based on the closeness to their distribution territory when studying the market demand, or at least to recognize if such locational preferences exist with a view toward identifying market expansion strategies. In this paper, we focus on the case for a Kentucky local craft soda producer, Ale‐8‐One. We examine the demand for craft and noncraft soft drinks using Nielsen scanner data to test whether consumer behavior is different in the core markets. The results show that, in this case, craft soda consumers are less price responsive and more brand loyal in the core market, compared with the outside market. [EconLit Citations: C55, D12, Q13].",

In Ghana, the rate of reduction in poverty continues to decline as the gap in poverty between urban and rural areas increases. However, the impact of such an economic inequality on body weights has not yet been studied. Using the Ghana Living Standard Survey 2017 (GLSS7) data from the Ghana Statistical Service, I study the link between poverty and body weights in Ghana. The GLSS7 collects detailed information from households, including their socioeconomic characteristics, health, access to financial services, and asset ownership. Due to the endogeneity between poverty status (proxy for income) and obesity, a recursive bivariate probit model is used to estimate the impact of poverty on participants' body weight measured by body mass index. The results suggest a strong negative relationship between poverty and overweight/obesity ( p &lt; .00) in the univariate probit model. Marital status, ethnicity, urbanization, and employment types are found to be factors that significantly influence weight status and poverty status. Obesity is also found to be a condition among household heads of higher socioeconomic status in Ghana. [EconLit Citations: C3, D12, D91, I1].",

For most of the food products, the empirical results reject the proposition that income elasticities are the same across the development spectrum. The assumption of homothetic preferences (expenditure elasticities equal to one) was most consistently rejected for middle‐income countries, but rarely rejected for lower‐ and high‐income countries.

Results showed that the full consideration of retailer-processor bilateral market power lowered the optimal values of assessment rates, advertising expenditures, and advertising intensity for the checkoff board whereas consideration of importers increases the optimal values.

We use the RCL superelasticities that are obtained via simulated generalized method of moments (GMM) to examine retail market power potential in regards to the marketing of national and store‐brand milk in the U.S. Our findings show that elasticity of demand rises in price for both brands, with elasticity for store brand milk lagging behind that for national brand in magnitude. Similarly, elasticities for national brands tend to decrease faster when prices are on the decline. Such a condition suggests that retailers can identify a pricing position, possibly in relation to national brand prices, at which there is a low incentive to increase or reduce store brand prices.

In this article, the relationship between firm output and food safety depends on firm-specific efficiency factors and how output and food safety interact in the cost function. The model shows that conditional on the distribution of firm output and food safety, new food safety regulations may increase the number of firms, with or without an exemption for small firms. Food safety regulations affect the composition of firms and may even create entry by less efficient firms. The article discusses implications of the Food Safety Modernization Act which includes exemption for small firms.",

In addition, some policies targeted at improving agricultural production have weakened the production and consumption of different commodities, especially yam. This study analyzed the effects of policy changes on yam production and consumption in Nigeria. A multi‐stage sampling technique was used to select 700 respondents for the study. Primary data was collected using pre‐tested structured questionnaire while interview guide was used to collect information in a Focus Group Discussion. Data were analyzed using Multi‐Market Model. The results showed that that policy changes on yam substitutes, particularly rice, sometimes have negative effects on yam production, prices, land share and real income among yam farming households in Nigeria depending on the nature of the policy.",

Several of their key findings pertain directly to an influential study by Hosken and Reiffen (2004) on retail price variation. However, the authors’ estimate of price rigidity is lower than Hosken and Reiffen's while their estimate of sale frequency is higher. Moreover, the earlier study's key findings apply only to national brand products and not private labels. The authors also highlight the issue of sale duration, indicating that sales frequently run considerably longer than 1 or 2 weeks, to the point at which they argue they can no longer be considered temporary price reductions. Comparisons with alternative definitions of sale reveal that the empirical definition of a sale impacts the results significantly.",

This paper develops a framework that integrates CSR in a dynamic by‐production technology which captures the transformation of multiple inputs into marketed outputs, socially responsible and undesirable outputs, while accounting for adjustment costs in quasi‐fixed inputs. The paper illustrates the method using a sample of European food and beverage manufacturing firms. The results of the empirical application show that there is a decline in dynamic Luenberger productivity indicators mainly due to technical inefficiency change. Hence, firms should devise strategies to enhance utilization of resources and reduce technical inefficiency. The regression of productivity change indicators on firm‐specific factors showed that more indebted firms experienced a lower growth of the productivity of undesirable output, whereas more profitable firms have a lower productivity growth of variable inputs and a higher growth of the productivity of investments.

In this perspective, this paper examines if smallholder farmers' collectives can potentially strengthen their market position vis‐à‐vis other individual players and enable them to explore strategic options in a greater way. On the basis of the structure–conduct–performance theory and field experiences from two selected villages of West Bengal (India), the paper finds that the collectivization of smallholder farmers helps in exploring a larger set of strategic options for better outcomes. Further, the choice of the strategy set varies across the collectives depending on their composition, functioning, and resource endowments. Nevertheless, there is a possibility of strategic failures because of intra‐ as well as intercollective conflicts and competition from other players. The success in this regard would, therefore, depend on how the collectives democratically resolve such conflicts and develop capacity and capabilities to enhance their competitiveness for greater strategic success. Besides, addressing market imperfections through policy and institutional interventions would also be crucial.",

We pay particular attention to the period that covers the Great Recession, which disrupted market structure across a number of industries. Using a county‐level panel dataset, we use a seminal entry model to infer the local competitive effects of entry in the food retail sector. We estimate entry thresholds over time, which we then use to describe the rate of decline in profit margins following subsequent entry via entry threshold ratios. We find that food retail firms required a smaller market size to break even during the Great Recession, perhaps pointing to higher profits, as consumers shifted purchases to food‐at‐home. This effect is short‐lived for all but a single firm. The market threshold required to support a single food retail firm remains low throughout the post‐recession recovery period. We also find that the second firm may not decrease profit margins, but that competition increases meaningfully with the third and fourth entrants. The increased competition during the Great Recession also appears to have persisted into the recovery period. [EconLit Citations: L18; Q18].",

Sustainability standards (SS) are essential tools for transnational trade governance because they increase the possibility of recognizing products from sustainable sources. However, there is currently a proliferation of SS in almost every industry. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to establish how standard interactions such as competition, cooperation, and overlap shape the impact of multiplicity on trade costs. We apply the framework to the palm oil industry by using the information on three aspects of SS schemes: the requirements, the institutional design, and the cooperation strategies. Our results indicate that the North–South multiplicity in the palm oil market is characterized by high overlap, but there exists a balanced co‐opetition in the standard market. As the cooperation strategies between the SS schemes are very shallow, there might be potential trade costs associated with the SS multiplicity in the palm oil industry.

The empirical results show that: (1) the AD‐TIE relationship follows a U‐shaped pattern, that is, at low levels of AD, the AD‐TIE relationship is negative; at high levels of AD, the AD‐TIE relationship is positive. (2) government subsidies (GS) negatively moderate the U‐shaped relationship between AD and TIE, such that GS flattens the U‐shaped curve.

Farmstead dairy brands (FDB) are thus competing against private labels and manufacturer brands, whose milk often comes from different areas and which are sold nationwide. Even though FDB cannot benefit from industrial economies of scale, they represent a small but successful and growing segment where demand has been rising for years, even though the demand for milk in general has been rather stagnant. Based on data from a German household panel it is evident that marketing of FDB milk through retail stores meets the trend for regional products and some consumers are increasingly willing to pay for local and regionally produced food. The results of a zero‐inflated negative binomial model revealed that middle‐aged, high income, and organic buying behaviors significantly influenced the purchase frequency of FDB milk in food retail.

We exploit the variation in the corporate income tax rate to estimate its relationship with the farm debt share of the FCS and the potential spillover effect on the estimated cost of borrowing for agricultural loans. Results suggest that a 10% rise in the state (federal) tax rate is associated with an increase in FCS's total farm debt market share by 1.76% (3.76%). A 10% rise in the FCS total farm debt market share tends to increase the cost of borrowing on agricultural loans by 0.06%. Overall, the findings imply that favorable tax treatment could increase FCS' competitiveness in the agricultural lending market. Also, an increase in the interest rate on farm debt is correlated with the increasing market share of FCS in the agricultural credit market. [EconLit Citations: Q14, N22, H2, H7, G21].",

This study further examines whether changes in sugar, sodium, saturated fat, or calorie intake occurred. The results provide evidence of some improvements in dietary intake. In particular, sugar intake decreased primarily due to food modifications—that emerged as a supply response to regulations. This improvement in dietary intake was only found among those households who mainly buy FAH or shop mostly at grocery stores. Considering that across all households, nearly 10% of total FAH calories come from products with added sugars, the results suggest that there are missing opportunities that policy could leverage to improve food choices, especially among those less likely to be influenced by existing regulations—those who mainly spend on food away from home or those who primarily shop at alternative FAH outlets.

First, unlike previous studies, it considers both input and output tariffs simultaneously in a theoretical model. Second, it empirically tests the effects of a combination of specific and ad‐valorem tariffs on quality improvement. The theoretical analysis suggests that when firms face reduced output and input tariffs, they tend to improve their export quality and increase export prices. Using export data from 33 OECD countries, the empirical analysis demonstrates that output tariff reduction increases export quality but decreases prices. However, the effects of input tariff reduction on price and quality depend on product differentiation. The results also indicate that the presence of specific tariffs increase product quality while amplifying the positive effects of the reduction of ad‐valorem tariffs on quality. This implies that to improve export quality, reducing ad‐valorem tariffs is more efficient than a specific tariff. [EconLit Citations: F12, F14, Q17].",

Using a nationally representative dataset of rural hospitality enterprises in Japan, we employ the difference‐in‐differences method to assess the causal effects of the policy on the sales value, number of business days, and labor productivity of hospitality enterprises and restaurants in rural areas. We find that this reform resulted in a 15.6% increase and a 5.1% decrease in the sales value of nonfarm‐owned and farm‐owned homestay enterprises, respectively. Moreover, changes in the number of business days and labor productivity can be associated with the policy effect. We also find a significant policy effect on nonfarm‐owned restaurants.

There are substantial risks, such as the ordering and placement of rail cars. The other risk is having sufficient grain stocks to load rail cars. Alternatives for managing these risks include holding grain inventories and the strategic use of shipping options. The purpose of this study is to develop a model for determining an optimal grain inventory strategy for shippers. The real option methodology is used to value uncertainty in rail car velocity and determine optimal purchases and inventories. The results show the importance of integrating trading and logistics decisions and illustrate that inventories can be interpreted and valued as real options that are affected by uncertainties. Taken together, the real options indicate how much extra inventory shippers should maintain to mitigate risks and maximize profits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To guide consumers, wineries need credible attributes about the quality of their wines and its origin. In Spain, protected designations of origin (PDO) guarantee that the wine has been produced in a certain wine region in accordance with specific and officially regulated quality criteria thus providing elements of guarantee to the consumer. The objective of this work is to determine whether the belonging of a winery to a PDO is positively or negatively related to profitability. This analysis is important because based on its results, managers will have more knowledge to decide whether a winery is interested in joining the regional PDO or not. We performed an empirical study using a random‐effects generalized least squares regression analysis, with a sample of 1182 Spanish wineries, in which we determine the relation between belonging to eight of the major Spanish PDOs and winery profitability. The results show that wineries registered in these PDOs tend to have higher levels of profitability than wineries that have opted to remain outside, with these differences being significant in five of the eight PDOs analyzed. Additionally, the regression model reveals a positive relationship between PDO membership and winery profitability in six of the eight PDOs. Furthermore, the findings suggest that in some of these PDOs small wineries benefit the most from being part of a PDO due to their difficulties in having a recognized brand in the market, while belonging to a PDO seems to be less useful for large wineries that have greater resources to build their own quality brand. On the basis of these findings, the wineries now have more information to decide whether to stay in the PDO, join it, or focus exclusively on developing their own brands [EconLit Citations: L15, L66, Q13].",

However, the persistent cooperative conundrum poses challenges to the integration of agribusiness and farmer interests. Utilizing goal planning analysis, this study delves into the profit‐driven behavioral logic of agribusiness and farmers to elucidate the conditions that influence their reciprocal symbiosis across various investment sectors. Through the crisp‐set qualitative comparative analysis method, this investigation parses data from 109 instances of agribusiness initiatives in rural areas, identifying four pivotal conditions conducive to reciprocal symbiosis: the farmers' information abundance (in production/processing and sales), incentive policies (in production), agribusiness's professional capabilities (in productive services), and the scale of demand (in productive services). Additionally, five principal sufficient conditions emerge: “Investment in production * information abundance of farmers * ~natural risk”, “Investment in production * natural risk * professional ability of farmers * profit sharing”, “Investment in processing and sales * information abundance of farmers * ~market risk * ~bidirectional specificity”, “Investment in processing and sales * bidirectional specificity * market risk * ~profit sharing”, and “Investment in productive services * professional ability of agribusiness * demand scale”. These findings illuminate the multifaceted interactions that underpin successful agribusiness‐farmer synergies [EconLit Citations: L23].",

    "abstract": "Abstract The exponential expansion of the global cider market positions it as a viable alternative to traditional choices such as wine and beer. Nevertheless, there exists a paucity of research examining the various factors influencing consumer interest in cider. This article undertakes an analysis of the cider consumption experience, with a specific focus on consumer preferences related to distinct quality attributes, encompassing factors like brand, organic certification, and protected designations of origin (PDO). This analysis also takes into consideration the socio‐demographic profile, frequency of consumption, and willingness to pay (WTP). Our study concentrates on the Canary Islands in Spain, an area where no formal certification system yet exists to differentiate locally produced cider in the market. Our data collection methodology encompassed face‐to‐face surveys administered to a probabilistic sample of 1000 respondents in the Canary Islands. The results demonstrate that consumers who place emphasis on quality attributes such as commercial brands, organic certification, and PDOs, tend to assign value to various cognitive aspects of the product. Conversely, those who do not prioritize these quality attributes tend to emphasize the affective dimension of the product and the specific consumption occasions. Additionally, consumers who accord the highest importance to PDOs exhibit a WTP a premium price. The findings of this study hold valuable implications for policymakers and cider manufacturers, aiding them in identifying opportunities for the promotion of Canary Islands cider, both within the local market and on a global scale.

    "abstract": "Abstract Biofuel production is one of the key topics in today's world, which inevitably raises the question of the relationship between ethanol and agricultural commodities. The nexus between corn and ethanol is well known in the literature, but the link involving other biofuel feedstocks is relatively poorly explored. Therefore, this paper research the dynamic nexus between ethanol and five agricultural commodities using the cDCC‐FIAPARCH model, while two additional analyses complement the main results. Dynamic conditional correlation between ethanol and corn is the highest and reaches an average of 50%, while wheat and soybean follow with 31%. A rolling regression analysis reveals the relationship between conditional volatilities and conditional correlations, where the assets with lower conditional volatility have a more significant impact on conditional correlation. The findings may have several practical implications for agents working with ethanol and agricultural commodities, such as food security assessment, efficiency of supply chains and portfolio construction.

In this study, we examine the impact of participation in outgrower scheme on technology adoption and farm productivity, using data from 634 smallholder maize farmers in Northern Ghana. We use the linear regression with endogenous treatment effects model to account for both observable and unobservable selection bias. The results reveal positive and significant marginal effects of outgrower scheme participation on technology adoption and maize yields. Outgrower scheme participants applied 6% and 82% more inorganic fertilizer and weedicides, respectively, than nonparticipants. Maize yield increased by about 3% for the participants more than nonparticipants. The findings also show that factors such as distance to market, distance to nucleus farmers' satellite office, nucleus outgrower scheme awareness, input price, and farmer‐based organization significantly influence outgrower scheme participation decisions, as well as technology adoption and maize yields.",

This study examined Chinese consumers' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for credence attributes of beef from the domestic market and other large exporting countries. Three beef cuts were considered: steak, brisket, and tongue. Data were collected from an online survey incorporating choice experiments (CEs) of 2016 consumers from China in 2021. Each respondent was presented with three beef alternatives that differed in price, country of origin, food safety, and production certifications, and also included a “no purchase” option. Chinese consumers' beef selections in the CEs were analyzed using a mixed logit model in WTP space. Results indicate that the type of cut does not influence Chinese consumers' evaluation of country of origin and credence attributes. Moreover, results show that Chinese consumers strongly prefer and are willing to pay more for domestic beef than imported beef. Beef from New Zealand had the highest WTP value among all the exporting countries, followed by Argentina, Australia, Canada, Uruguay, Brazil, and the United States. Also, enhanced food safety, Organic, and Green Food certifications had positive WTP values. The findings of this study offer evidence that Chinese consumers prefer safe and quality‐assured beef products. This information can be used by beef producers targeting the Chinese market to design production and marketing strategies.",

In Ghana, two main categories dominate the market: live/fresh whole chickens and imported frozen chicken parts. This study leverages data from 13,201 households to explore Ghanaian demand dynamics for these products using the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System. Findings reveal stark differences between the two. Live/fresh whole chickens, considered luxury goods, display a complex interplay with other non‐chicken meat products, cultural festivities, and various sociodemographic factors. Meanwhile, frozen chicken parts, seen as necessities, exhibit different demand shifters and peak consumption periods. Importantly, these two categories emerge as distinct products, signaling to policymakers the need for differentiated strategies. Simulated policy scenarios further emphasize that reducing prices of live/fresh chickens significantly boosts domestic chicken demand more than policies raising prices of frozen parts. However, the broader implications on alternative protein sources differ between the two policy types. We urge policymakers to adopt an integrated approach, considering these nuances, to strengthen Ghana's domestic poultry sector without unintended market disruptions.

The study data covered 1912 rural households in Burkina Faso for the 2016–2017 agricultural season. We used an endogenous frontier model and a matching method to address sample selection for both observables and unobservables. The results show that the adoption of pesticide‐free SAPs reduces technical inefficiency compared with the practice of adopting SAPs with pesticides and nonadoption of SAPs. However, our findings show that compared with the nonadoption of SAPs, adoption of SAPs with chemical pesticides did not have a significant effect on technical efficiency. For more efficient and sustainable agriculture, policies should further promote SAPs while advancing biological pest management techniques, as opposed to the use of chemical pesticides.

It particularly investigates how Corporate Social Legitimacy (CSL) and Green Innovation (GI) may act as intermediary factors in this relationship. Additionally, the research considers the age of the winery, its size, and whether it is part of a protected designation of origin as control variables to enhance the accuracy of the identified cause‐and‐effect relationships. This research introduces a theoretical framework, grounded in prior literature, and examines it through structural equation modeling. The analysis is based on data gathered from 196 wineries in Spain, collected over the period from September 2022 to January 2023. The results of this study highlight a notable and positive correlation between the advancement of WT and the SP of wineries in Spain. Additionally, the study uncovers that CSL and GI play a partially mediating role in this connection. The uniqueness and significance of this study can be attributed to several crucial factors. First, it enhances the understanding and knowledge regarding the advantages associated with WT development. Second, no prior research has conducted a comprehensive study on the WT development as a catalyst for economic, social, and environmental outcomes within the context of Spanish wineries. Third, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous study has simultaneously analyzed the mediating role of CSL and GI as mediators in the relationship between WT development and the SP of wineries.",

Like many other sectors, vending is responding to the challenge of sustainable development by taking various actions, such as offering increasingly ecologically sound coffee while maintaining/improving its quality. These are factors that consumers care greatly about. Although the scientific literature on coffee is vast, few studies have focused on the vending sector. The aim of the present study was to fill this gap by performing a choice experiment in Italy to understand which attributes (sustainable or nonsustainable) Italian consumers prioritized when purchasing coffee via vending machines. The results showed that the physical quality of coffee was paramount, while sustainability (although important) played a secondary role. The circularity of cups was the least considered aspect. The data obtained for this study contribute to academic knowledge of consumer behavior regarding the purchase of sustainable coffee at vending machines and can be used as a starting point for the development of strategies in line with sustainability principles [EconLit Citations: C9, Q01].",

To understand this phenomenon, we propose a conceptual framework that considers two possibilities: first, animal welfare might not be valued in the market, as suggested by classical externality analysis, and second, it could be valued due to altruistic motivations. To illustrate the framework, we uncover the motives driving consumers’ demand for animal welfare products jointly utilizing the results of a discrete choice experiment and respondents’ perception data obtained in China. Our findings align with the predictions made by classical externality analysis, indicating that the public good aspect of animal welfare is not valued in this market and thereby challenging the existence of altruistic behavior. Moreover, our analysis of consumer heterogeneity reveals that as consumers’ knowledge increases, they exhibit a decreased inclination to prioritize the animal welfare attribute for fulfilling their private needs, and may raise concerns about the safety of animal welfare‐friendly products.",

Consequently, Brazil temporarily permitted the import of one million 60‐kg bags of Robusta coffee in the spring 2017. An import ban was imposed shortly afterward due to lobbying by domestic Robusta farmers. We examine the welfare and trade impacts of the drought and subsequent import ban on stakeholders in the Robusta bean and soluble coffee markets. The import ban improved the welfare of Brazilian Robusta producers by $174.85–$280.26 million, nearly offsetting the drought's effects. However, it increased unit cost for Brazilian soluble processors by 10% and reduced consumer surplus in Brazil by $108.35–$174.44 million. Deadweight losses remained minimal due to the markets' price inelasticity. Major Robusta exporters faced reduced exports to Brazil and up to 9% lower prices, losing 0.3363–0.7564 million 60‐kg bags. Additionally, foreign consumers of Brazilian soluble coffee lost $62–$107 million in welfare from higher prices. without the import ban, global stakeholders would have seen a $12.61/bag higher world bean price. The drought benefitted Robusta sellers outside Brazil but harmed net importers, even with the ban in place.",

For Swiss cheese imports and exports, we analyze whether GIs are associated with higher trade prices. We find that price premiums can be obtained for both exports and imports. However, this is only the case for cheeses with single name GIs where the whole name is protected (e.g., Gruyère, Roquefort). There is no price premium for cheeses with compound names, consisting of a generic part and a geographical part (e.g., Gouda Holland, Raclette du Valais). As the generic part of the name (here Gouda, Raclette) can be used by competitors from other regions, such GI products may have difficulties in differentiating themselves. We conclude that higher prices in international cheese trade are not a matter of having a GI label or not. Rather, having a compound name seems to offset the benefit of the GI protection.",

Despite its critical importance, the relationship between coordination mechanisms and sustainability performance remains underexplored. This study examines the interrelations between transactional characteristics, relational and formal coordination, and sustainability performance in agri‐food supply chains. By surveying 204 farmers and 135 downstream players across diverse supply chain arrangements, this research employs structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis to analyze data suitability and test hypotheses. The empirical findings reveal nuanced relationships: relational governance has a significantly positive connection to economic and social sustainability within supply chains. There is also a positive, indirect relation between relational governance and ecological performance through the promotion of resource efficiency. Formal coordination practices facilitate strategic relationships and efficient resource allocation and as such connect to social and economic viability of supply chains. Transaction costs play a role as mediator between formal and relational coordination, and sustainability outcomes. Effective management of transaction costs can mitigate inefficiencies and foster collaborative efforts. By understanding these dynamics, policymakers and stakeholders can develop strategies to promote resilience and sustainability in global food systems.",

Their transition to sustainable agricultural production is critical in the face of the environmental challenges posed by conventional farming practices and is a key pathway to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. This study examines the effects of Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAP) adoption on coffee production and technical efficiency (TE) among smallholders in Peru, focusing on both observable and unobservable factors. Using a multistage framework, we employ propensity score matching to control for observable factors, estimate a Stochastic Production Frontier model with sample selection bias correction to control for unobservable factors, and assess technological differences using a metafrontier approach. Our analysis of pooled cross‐sectional data from 2017 to 2019 indicates that age, farm accessibility, and having Quechua as a first language are factors that make farmers more likely to adopt SAP. Although SAP adopters initially show higher production levels, the difference is not statistically significant after accounting for unobserved factors. However, SAP adopters utilize better technology and exhibit higher TE compared to non‐adopters, highlighting the potential benefits of promoting sustainable practices in smallholder agriculture.",

Under this system, the Brazilian farmer can produce soybeans, corn, and graze for cattle on the same land during one crop year. This technology can substantially increase agricultural production in the country. We contrasted the stochastic net present value of traditional farming with the integrated system under four different scenarios. To rank the scenarios, we use stochastic dominance methods. The results suggest more significant economic gains for crop‐livestock integration scenarios.",

We argue that competition across production systems limits the exercise of such market power by suppliers. In order to examine the demand for these innovations, we evaluate the producer's returns to planting patented seed innovations, using a calibrated optimization model of a south‐central Iowa corn producer's adoption decision. Overall, our results suggest that patented seed innovations do not increase the market power of biotechnology firms in the relevant market for production systems.

    "abstract": "Abstract If generic advertising is effective at increasing the demand for the advertised product, then there will not only be direct effects on the sponsors of the advertising, but also indirect effects on other market participants. This article addresses two such distributional issues using the U.S. dairy industry as a case study. First, how are fluid milk and cheese processors impacted by cheese and milk advertising conducted by farmers? We find that the welfare of both processor classes is improved due to the dairy farmer advertising program for fluid milk and cheese products. Second, how are fluid milk (or cheese) processors impacted by the other product's farmer‐funded advertising? As expected, own‐product advertising increased equilibrium output levels, while cross‐advertising impacts slightly reduced supply levels. Generic advertising, regardless of product, positively affected fluid milk processor gross margins, while increases in cheese advertising reduced the price margin for cheese processors. In general, own‐product advertising had larger price margin impacts for fluid milk processors, while cheese processors benefited more from larger supply gains. These larger supply effects translated further into larger increases in raw milk costs tightening cheese price margins. Because changes in cheese supplies affect both Class I and Class III prices, input prices to processors are affected relatively more by increases in cheese advertising, as opposed to fluid milk advertising. The relatively larger gains in output prices, combined with lower relative increases in input class prices contributed to higher producer welfare impacts for fluid milk processors than cheese processors when confronted with equivalent increases in their own‐product advertising.

Consistent with other studies, we find productivity growth rates to have declined in the past several decades. Nevertheless, growth has consistently been positive and has responded only modestly to the business cycle and to capital prices. Productivity‐induced downshifts in unit cost curves have boosted cost elasticities, enhancing incentives for firm and plant‐size growth. Rising capital shadow prices suggest the quality of capital has grown relative to that of labor and materials. Technical change appears to be capital‐using and material‐saving, counteracting the generally capital‐saving and material‐using effects of output expansion.

Using an equilibrium displacement model, the relative importance of market power is evaluated for a “typical” food‐processing industry, and the empirical analysis focuses on how much profits from advertising, off‐farm research, and farm research are affected by a one dollar increase in check‐off funds, assuming equal efficiency in funds spent at each level of the marketing channel. The empirical analysis systematically considers alternative values of the underlying structural parameters of the model using Monte Carlo simulations to generate confidence intervals of marginal returns from each alternative use of the funds. Important findings are that the results with market power are indistinguishable from those obtained under pure competition and the results are most affected by input substitutability.

We carried out a rapid appraisal by means of extensive usage of secondary information, key informant semistructured interviews and direct observation all around the country. We found that beef has been losing competitiveness to other meats in part because of price disadvantage and in part because of marketing inefficiencies. The critical points are: the intermittent quality, unhealthy image and high price of beef, the low level of income of most consumers, inept enforcement of safety regulations, and failing vertical coordination. An important outcome of this study is that most of the problems faced by retailers do not depend only on them. However, retailers need to play a dominant role in dealing with these issues because they represent the most organized segment of the Brazilian beef system.

Moreover, several specific strategic planning tools, specifically, the use of a mission statement, long-term goals, and ongoing evaluation, were also more heavily emphasized by high-performing firms. These results suggest that strategic planning does pay off in terms of improved financial performance and that some planning tools may have a significant impact.

Food ingredient suppliers were the most important external provider of knowledge to these technical staff. The main technical information provided included ingredient specifications, food recipes, consultancy, and product testing. New products that were radically innovative required greater input from external technical knowledge sources than products that were incrementally innovative.

The two‐equation estimation procedure, based on purchase and unit value equations, allows us to handle heavily censored panel data for salmon purchases by Norwegian households and the quality effects simultaneously. Unit values of the aggregated salmon commodity calculated from the observed expenditures and quantities are hypothesized to represent the average quality of the purchased commodity. Advertising effects on both purchases and unit values are investigated. The model also allows us to separate the effects of conditional purchases and purchase probabilities. Results indicate that most (76%) of the advertising effect is through the change of nonpurchase occasions to purchase occasions, and that generic salmon advertising induces Norwegian households to spend more money on salmon. However, advertising causes households to select more expensive products rather than increasing their purchased quantities. [EconLit citations: D12, C24]. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Moreover, consumers exhibit strong brand loyalty if they prefer specific features, such as the organic claim of a brand.

Our results show that the hypothetical elimination of private label brands would result in the packaged salad market becoming less competitive, implying total welfare increased and consumers fared much better after the introduction of private label packaged salads.

A multinomial regression model is employed to analyze the association between the type of product launch and the positioning claims adopted by firms. The results provide evidence that claims of credence attributes play an important role in the product launch strategy of firms. Food companies tend to choose the most cost‐effective strategies to launch products with credence attributes. Hence, claims that are seen as most important for consumers are more likely to be engendered for the more costly launch approach. For example, the attribute of food safety is highly important in China and its use is related to launching brand new products which generally is the most costly launch strategy. In contrast, other credence attributes, such as “environmentally sustainable,” are linked to relatively simpler and cheaper strategies, such as new packaging. Given most studies on credence attributes have focused on the consumer side, results of this study fill in the gap of understanding how food suppliers respond to consumer demand for food products with credence attributes.",

Tighter vertical coordination through use of alternative marketing arrangements and more precise price signaling through use of different cattle valuation methods may help improve beef quality because these mechanisms facilitate information exchange enabling producers to respond better to consumer demand. For the congressionally mandated Livestock and Meat Marketing Study, we modeled differences in levels and variances of cattle quality associated with particular marketing arrangements and valuation methods using fed cattle purchase data from 29 large U.S. beef packing plants for October 2002 through March 2005. Results indicate fed cattle procured through marketing agreements and packer ownership had higher and more consistent quality compared to other types of arrangements. Auction market cattle quality was the most inconsistent. Fed cattle valued using carcass weight with a grid were associated with higher and more consistent quality.

Our study is the first to confirm this fact. In addition, we elucidate consumers’ characteristics that push up additional willingness to pay, thereby drawing useful implications for promoting safer chicken.

Empirical models consisted of prices coupled with promotions and prices decoupled from promotions to determine the effect of trade promotions on retail prices. The results showed that the demand for OJ was imperfectly price reversible when we used prices coupled with promotion, and asymmetric price responses were found in not from concentrated OJ demand. Prices coupled with promotions were more elastic than prices decoupled from promotions. The demand for OJ was influenced by both current and previous information. Dynamic adjustments toward price and promotions may result in irreversibility. Competitions with price reduction increase sales in the short run, but frequent promotions may lead to lower reference prices that eventually weaken consumer willingness to purchase at regular prices without promotions.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study proposes a generalized demand system accommodating structural changes endogenously and examines how increasing imports affect blueberry prices and shipment values in the US market. Specifically, we integrate a smooth transformation function into the nested synthetic inverse demand system model (SIDS). We show that the proposed approach performs better than the standard SIDS in the context of structural changes in imports in the US blueberry market. As the largest blueberry producer in the world, the United States has supplied half of the world's blueberries over the past decade. Imported blueberries from South American countries do not have large impacts on the US blueberry industry due to the difference in production seasons. But the fast‐growing imports from Mexico have had great impacts on the US market. Our simulation shows that a 100% increase in Mexican blueberry shipments will result in a loss of $20 million in US domestic production. [EconLit Citations: Q11, Q17].",

    "abstract": "Abstract The outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) had an enormous economic and social impact on Chinese hog producers. Using a face‐to‐face survey with hog farmers from two regions of China, Chongqing, and Hebei, this research investigated how social influence affects producers’ behavior under disease outbreak using social network analysis. It was analyzed how information flows during an epidemic, such as ASF. Results indicate that hog producers used phone and text more frequently to communicate during the epidemic than before. Face‐to‐face meetings with other hog producers and sales agents decreased during the ASF epidemic—potentially leading to isolation. Moreover, the frequency of face‐to‐face meetings with veterinarians decreased for farmers living in a village in Hebei but remained the same for hog producers in Chongqing. This suggests that the desire to have less face‐to‐face meetings was being replaced with the demand for more help regarding hog health from veterinarians when hog producers lived farther away from each other compared to those living closer together. Employing a random effect ordered probit model, these results were further validated, showing that hog producers dramatically reduced their communication frequency with others after the outbreak of ASF. Findings provide insights into how information flows and how actors communicate during a situation of crisis. [EconLit Citations: D71, D85, Q12, Q18].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Motivated by real‐world practices in China, we consider a three‐level agri‐food supply chain consisting of a seed enterprise, a grower, and a buyer–processor, where the seed enterprise is fully vertically integrated in the seed industry and acts as the leader to coordinate the grower and buyer–processor of the agri‐food supply chain. We call this seed company‐led agri‐food contract farming. First, we develop analytical models to derive optimal solutions under penalty contracts, revenue‐sharing contracts and cost‐sharing contracts. Then, we analytically compare the optimal strategies of the three contracts using data from China's fresh maize industry as the numerical example. Finally, we do the sensitivity analysis of contract parameters. Results demonstrate that: (1) The seed company‐led agri‐food contract farming obtains quality advantages and improves profits by responding quickly to external demand changes and effectively coordinating internal technical capabilities. (2) The penalty contract performs poorly in both quality and profit. (3) The profit of the whole supply chain increases with the increase of the revenue‐sharing proportion from downstream supply chain participants to upstream participants; but the relationship between the proportion of cost‐sharing and the profit of the whole supply chain is nonmonotonic.

Therefore, consumers who are unfamiliar with specific products typically use search characteristics as a proxy for product quality. As search characteristics are pivotal in consumers' decisions, we expect them to be reflected in the resulting product prices in the beer market. Besides traditional search characteristics such as beer color or fermentation type, new search characteristics such as online consumer ratings are emerging in beer markets all over the world. Thus, we use a hedonic price estimation to learn about the relative importance of traditional versus new search characteristics in the Belgian beer market. Specifically, the beer prices for 1517 different beer products of two large beer retailers are investigated to compare the role of traditional beer characteristics—color, fermentation type, beer style, origin, brewery type, and alcohol percentage—with the role of online beer ratings from the platform RateBeer.com . We find that while traditional characteristics still play a key role in the beer market, the role of online ratings seems dependent on the retail context [EconLit Citations: C36 Instrumental Variables Estimation, D83 Search—Communication, Q11 Agriculture—Prices, Q18 Food Policy].",

    "abstract": "Abstract The agricultural subsidy is an important policy instrument that aims to maintain food security and promote agricultural development in several countries. China introduced its first nationwide agricultural subsidy (i.e., the direct grain subsidy) for farmers in 2004. This study examines the impacts of direct grain subsidies on rural residents' food consumption patterns and nutritional intake on an individual basis. Based on a nationally representative sample of rural households from the National Rural Fixed Observation Points Survey data collected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China between 2003 and 2015, high‐dimensional fixed‐effects estimates show that the direct grain subsidy has boosted rural residents' grain consumption but reduced aquatic products, eggs, and dairy consumption in China. Specifically, an increase of 100 Chinese Yuan in per capita subsidies is associated with a rise of 14.94 g in daily grain consumption but a decrease of 0.57, 0.46, and 0.90 g in aquatic products, eggs, and dairy consumption, respectively. Furthermore, direct grain subsidies intensified rural residents' dietary imbalance and declined their dietary diversity. Observed dietary imbalance can be primarily attributed to the subsidy encouraging households' self‐sufficient grain consumption, leading to excessive cereal consumption and relatively lower consumption of meat, eggs, and milk. Our findings suggest that direct grain subsidies emphasizing the production of staple grains may inadvertently skew farmers' food consumption and nutritional intake, which may require consideration when evaluating the overall costs and benefits of agricultural subsidy policies.

Therefore, this paper empirically investigates the impact of the B&amp;R initiative on food consumption levels and dietary diversity in B&amp;R countries and its inherent channels through the difference‐in‐differences model with the propensity score matching method (PSM‐DID). The results indicate that the B&amp;R initiative has a significant positive effect on improving food consumption levels and dietary diversity in B&amp;R countries, and the promotion‐effect is stronger for the Maritime Silk Road countries. Further, the B&amp;R initiative has led to a dietary shift in B&amp;R countries, with a decrease in the calorie share of cereals and an increase in the calorie share of fruits and vegetables, oils and fats, and meat, eggs and milk. The mechanism analysis reveals that income and prices may be important channels for the impact of the initiative on food consumption in B&amp;R countries, and that the B&amp;R initiative may have led to changes in tastes in B&amp;R countries.

This study investigates consumer trends and preferences for lamb and goat meat in Florida and sheds light on regional preferences for these products, providing groundwork for further studies. An online survey was conducted using 924 primary shoppers in Florida. Respondents were asked questions regarding demographic characteristics, behavioral qualities, and attributes associated with meat‐buying consumers. A contingent valuation method was used to derive willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) estimates by having participants report the maximum price they would pay for one pound of shoulder cut from lamb or goat. This study focuses on WTP for lamb/goat meat and uses Tobit regression analyses to test relationships between WTP and the consumer attributes described. Various regression specifications were estimated in the analyses to examine the robustness of significant correlations. Results surrounding the consumer WTP were similar for lamb and goat meat, showing that: (1) adventurousness when tasting food is positively correlated with WTP, (2) younger generations (Millennials and Gen Z) tend to have a higher WTP than older generations (Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation), (3) having tasted/liked lamb/goat meat previously both seem to positively influence WTP, (4) importance of access to culturally significant food products is positively correlated with WTP for lamb meat only, and (5) identifying as Hispanic had a negative correlation with WTP for goat meat only.",

    "abstract": "This report examines the conduct of the cereal industry since the advent of our public campaign for lower cereal prices one year ago, on March 5, 1995. Announced cereal price increases slowed for the first time in a decade. But the fact that the major cereal companies sold 145 million fewer boxes of cereal in 1995 indicates that consumers still believe prices continue to be too high. It remains to be seen whether or not the leading companies will move prices more in line with the costs of production due to competition from private label and consumer dissatisfaction.

In this article the changing competitiveness in world soybean markets is evaluated relative to government policy and natural resources. The landed cost of soybeans at Rotterdam and Japan favors Argentina and Brazil over the US. For soybeans and soybean products combined, the US has steadily lost export market share from about 95% in the early 1970s to 45% in 1990. The Brazilian share has grown to 30% and the Argentine share to 16% in this same period. A fundamental shift from the export of soybeans to more soybean product exports has occurred largely because of policies favoring product exports from Argentina and Brazil.",

Accuracy of these reports is critical, as they have marked impacts on current and expected fed cattle market prices and influence resource allocation decisions. This study investigates whether COF report revisions are unbiased, random, and anticipated by beef industry analysts. Initial COF reports are biased, but the bias is economically small. Thus, there is no evidence that users of these reports should be concerned about bias. Revisions to COF estimates are not random and exhibit persistence, suggesting when revisions are made subsequent similar types of revisions tend to follow. However, on average, market analysts do not correctly anticipate revisions. Thus, if analysts' prerelease estimates are different from the initial COF report, this does not signal any useful information about future probable COF revisions.

Market characteristics combined with government policy make it plausible that manufacturers exert monopsony market power in procuring tobacco. We investigate this possibility in the U.S. and international tobacco markets by extending nonparametric tests to include simultaneously potential monopoly market power with potential monopsony market power in multiple input markets, allowing both Hicks‐neutral and biased technical change. We use annual data from the cigarette manufacturing industry from 1977 to 1993. Results indicate substantial departures from competitive pricing in the procurement of domestic tobacco, supporting the postulate that cigarette manufacturers appropriate monopsony rents despite, and perhaps at times through, U.S. tobacco farm policy. Results are less clear with respect to monopsony market power exertion in imported leaf tobacco procurement by cigarette manufacturers. Finally, results indicate that monopoly market power exertion is relatively small and that, when the possibility of monopsony market power exertion is admitted, monopoly market power exertion is no longer problematic.[EconLit citations: L100, L660]. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Treating zip codes as markets, we find that increased market concentration is associated with decreased produce expenditures. This impact is larger in rural markets than in urban areas. In addition, the presence of most nontraditional store formats such as convenience stores and dollar stores is associated with decreased produce purchases.

Additionally, commodity prices, imports, exports, production inputs, and macroeconomic variables were also examined in relation to the financial performance of the agricultural community. Linear, logistic, and panel regressions, as well as Granger causality tests and impulse response simulations were all used to increase the robustness of the findings. It was found that farm financials were more likely to improve with an improving economy, strengthening dollar, and/or rising commodity prices. Also, as production increased, farm financials would be more likely to have weaker financial ratios. It was found that the US and world economies impacted the dollar, the dollar impacted prices, and prices impacted both production and exports. The findings are pertinent to not just farmers, forecasters, and commodity traders, but also financial institutions (i.e., Farm Credit Service Organizations) that now must build their own forecasting models under the new Financial Accounting Standards Board's current expected credit loss requirements.

The paper also documents that the proportion of exposed firms doubles during periods in which the local central bank intervenes more in the currency regime, lending support to the moral hazard hypothesis: when the exchange rate is less flexible, local companies tend to adopt unhedged positions in response to implicit government guarantees. Finally, firms with more debt, better asset management, lower inventory levels, and higher product differentiation tend to be less exposed to currency swings [EconLit Citations: F31, G15, G23].",

While modern food retail has shown rapid growth, the traditional food retail segment is still dominant in both regions. The observed food retail patterns may be attributed to economic factors (income levels), sociodemographic (female labor force participation, urbanization, and religion), and institutional factors (control of corruption, ease of starting a business, time to enforce a contract, and World Trade Organization membership). However, while economic and sociodemographic variables exhibit similar effects in both regions, results are mixed regarding the institutional factors; potential explanations are suggested [EconLit citations: O100, L100].",

This sector is typically diverse, ranging from small backyard farms to commercial farms of varying sizes. As the subsector expands, little is known about the performance or viability of different sizes of operation. Is there a minimum investment required to establish a viable commercial farm? Focusing on Nigeria, Africa's largest economy and most populous country, this study uses nonparametric statistics, transition matrices, and parametric estimations to identify the equilibrium poultry farm size. We find consistent evidence of multiple equilibria, particularly a high‐ and low‐stable equilibrium separated by a threshold between small and large farms. Farms are highly likely to remain in the size category in which they begin; small poultry farms are unlikely to cross the threshold and transition to large ones. We also find that larger farms are better able to withstand a price shock than smaller farms, which are more likely to cease operations in the event of a shock. These underlying dynamics should be given due consideration by governments, donors and private sector as they enter the industry or encourage others to engage in it [EconLit citations: O12‐Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development, L11‐Production, Pricing, and Market Structure • Size Distribution of Firms, Q12‐Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets].",

    "abstract": "Organic agriculture uses contracts and networks to overcome its asset‐specificity problems and to ensure compliance with its standards and norms, including environmental conservation. This study analyzed the effects of certified‐organic production on supplier failures and the potential income effects of these failures on vegetable and macadamia producers in Kenya. Using survey data and propensity score matching, the study found that organic macadamia production reduces delivery failures because its asset specificity necessitates a dedicated transport system. It also found that organic vegetable production reduces quality failures because organic consumers are often less concerned about the physical quality of organic produce. However, despite these advantages, cases of supplier failures are still rampant among both organic and nonorganic producers of macadamia and vegetables. The potential income effects of these supplier failures, especially quantity and delivery failures in macadamia, raise concerns. These problems necessitate policy interventions, especially with respect to establishing and strengthening producer organizations, which are often very instrumental in overcoming quality, quantity, and delivery failures.",

We found that high‐income individuals are more concerned about health and nutrition, and that younger and lower‐income consumers are more price‐sensitive. The results suggest that consumer surplus would decrease with a merger between the two smaller firms in the market, and would increase if the market turned into a single‐product firms industry. The influence of these counterfactual changes would be greater for wealthier and older individuals. This article contributes to the analysis of a food market that is rapidly growing in developing countries and is starting to play a more relevant role in consumers’ diet.

The aim of this paper is to study achieving efficiency and equity in sugar factories and sugar‐cropping patterns in Upper and Middle Egypt by focusing on the Strategic Water Shortage Preparedness Plan, introduction methodologies, and specific action to fight drought within the general water‐planning framework. The Linear Programming Model was applied to calculate the sugar crops, sugar cane and sugar beet acreage, production, and income of both Upper and Middle Egypt. As a result of an optimal cropping pattern, the cultivation season would lose acreage by 7.260%, farm income increase by 1.774%, water uses decrease by 18.511%, and CO 2 emission and energy reduced by 14.96%. Overall, as a result of an optimal sugar‐cropping pattern, Egyptian sugar exports would decrease by $130.086 million US. [EconLit classification: Q130 and Q000].",

Based on a RollAMA dataset containing information on consumption in 12 different retail chains in Austria, we first analyze demand patterns for a scenario in which consumers only frequent either discounters or supermarkets, followed by an investigation of potential cross‐format effects when both types of stores are visited. Our empirical findings suggest that for the three categories of milk products under examination, price elasticities in discount stores are generally higher. Beyond that, demand reactions in supermarkets with respect to price changes in discounters differ from the reverse case, i.e., from demand reactions in discounters when supermarket prices are changed. This is especially true for the case of drinking milk, which confirms the strategic potential of drinking milk as a loss leader product.",

    "abstract": "This article concerns aspects of internationalization and market servicing modes in the Greek food industry. During the late 1980s, foreign direct investment into the Greek food industry increased to around US $80 million per year from below US $10 million in the early 1980s and sales arising from accumulated FDI inflows (called here subsidiary sales, i.e., sales by subsidiaries of multinational enterprises) became an important mode for servicing sales in Greece by foreign companies. Sales arising from licensing grew but were relatively less important except in the oils and fats sector of the food industry, whereas the contribution of imports declined. The present study examines the determinants of the shares of subsidiary sales and licensed sales in total production separately for eight three-digit food subsectors of the Greek food industry for 6 years, using the Tobit model with fixed effects to account for the limited nature of the dependent variable. Ownership advantages, proxied by variables to represent marketing and technological intensity, and internalization conditions, proxied by a variable to represent transactions costs, are shown to be important determinants of the subsidiary sales share. The licensing sales share is high in subsectors where technological competition is advanced but transactions costs are low. Â© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a concept some marketers have employed to better understand the long-term profit potential of specific customers or groups of customers. CLV is the net present value of the cash flow stream a customer is expected to generate for a firm over time. In this study, the CLV concept was employed to better understand the profitability of customers in the rural petroleum market. Findings suggest that customers in this market vary dramatically in the level of profits they generate for a firm. In addition, customer retention is important in this market with small reductions in customer retention rates leading to large reductions in CLV. A framework and modeling approach is also developed that marketers in other agribusiness industries may find useful as they attempt to measure and use customer lifetime value. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

From a policy-making standpoint, it is best to view agribusiness as an interdependent global food system.

The result of uncoordinated policy making has been increased price volatility and greater risk for agribusiness firms. To counteract, new trading entities have formed and the role of trade facilitators such as the World Bank has taken on greater importance. There are needs for international coordinating and conflict resolving mechanisms for the trade of traditional agricultural commodities and high valued products. There is also a need to reconcile the rapidly evolving global agribusiness system with noncommercial agriculture and with persistent hunger problems.",

An explanatory motive is that grocery chains could achieve greater scale economies and operating efficiencies, and increase their bargaining power with packaged food manufacturer‐suppliers. This article begins to examine whether the largest retailers are realizing the promised financial rewards associated with this growth trend. We examine the performance of the three largest U.S. food retailers, Albertson's, Inc., The Kroger Company, and Safeway Inc., over 7 fiscal years beginning in calendar year 1993 and ending in fiscal year 1999, a period that covers the recent increase in acquisition activity. Overall, we find only modest evidence that the financial returns to the rapid growth strategies of the three largest food retailers have begun to be realized through fiscal year 1999.

The real shares of R&amp;D costs are estimated through the incidence of the levies and compared with the nominal shares. Grape‐growers, winemakers and overseas consumers are shown to receive bigger proportions of gains than their proportions of costs, while the Australian government and other domestic parties as a group bear a much higher proportion of costs than returns.

This article analyzes the impacts of policy instruments when the pork industry is assumed to be imperfectly competitive. The arguments are made that policy instruments can be categorized into those with impacts independent of market conduct and those with impacts dependent on market conduct. If the policy objective is to raise swine grower welfare, markets need to remain open to trade, the use of quantitative policy instruments should be avoided, and domestic subsidies to packers must be effective.

Manufacturers view the allowance as anti‐competitive. Retailers view it as compensation for the risks associated with stocking new products. The largely theoretical literature on the subject is consistent with both views. This article proposes an empirical model to test the effect of slotting allowances on performance, and discusses if and how the model can be tied to the qualitative predictions of existing theoretical literature.

For example, a VaR of 1 million dollars at the 95% level of confidence implies that overall portfolio losses should not exceed 1 million dollars more than 5% of the time over a given holding period. This research examines the effectiveness of VaR measures, developed using alternative estimation techniques, in predicting large losses in the cattle-feeding margin. Results show that several estimation techniques, both parametric and nonparametric, provide well-calibrated estimates of VaR such that violations (losses exceeding the VaR estimate) are commensurate with the desired level of confidence. In particular, estimates developed using the RiskMetricsTM method appear robust for instruments that have linear payoff structures such as cash commodity prices. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The data are much more useful for studying output markets and fail to provide much guidance regarding oligopsony issues, which are perceived to be widespread in food processing. In output markets, evidence suggests that a market's use of media advertising contributed to advanced market concentration prior to 1977, but subsequently concentration has been rising in all industries.

To derive input demand and output supply elasticities, the normalized quadratic profit function and demand equations were estimated jointly with the seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) estimation technique using farm level panel data. The data confirm the theoretical framework. The derived price elasticities of input demand, output supply, and marketed surplus have been simulated to examine alternative price policies for securing different levels of marketed surplus. At the observed price structure, the marketed surplus of wheat will increase almost equal to population growth, but in case of paddy it will grow at a very low rate. The study further reveals that besides price adjustment, technological improvement and non‐price factors are also of critical importance for increasing output supply and, hence, marketed surplus.

    "abstract": "Abstract Expanding livestock production is widely promoted as a way of improving livelihoods of smallholder farmers. However the rudimentary, insular and relatively small size of markets in which many smallholders operate means that rapid livestock industry expansion can have an adverse impact on prices and livelihoods. The link between market integration, livestock industry development and smallholder livelihoods is examined in the case of ruminant livestock industry expansion in Tibet. The analysis finds some transmission between Chinese and Tibetan sheepmeat prices and that this integration with the broader Chinese market and its favourable medium term outlook is crucial to any livestock industry expansion given the current low margins for sheep for Tibetan farmers. While Tibet milk prices exceed eastern China prices, and evidence of transmission is less pronounced, the outcome for smallholder Tibetan dairy farmers in doubling their cow numbers is better in an integrated market than in an insular market. Thus the analysis highlights the importance for ruminant livestock industry expansion in Tibet of integration with broader Chinese markets while also highlighting the need to consider market integration when assessing livestock industry development strategies for smallholder farmers.

However, empirical evidence suggests the negative effect of geographic distance persists in both international and domestic trade. This study uses data from a national survey of nursery and greenhouse growers in the United States to investigate the effect of geographic distance on trade. We model trades as a two‐step process in which selling firms and buyers were matched first, and then a positive trade flow occurs conditional on the match. This process leads to a simple zero‐inflated estimation strategy and provides a meaningful interpretation of the zero‐trades. We demonstrate that this approach predicts the overall trade flow better than the Poisson or Gamma Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PML) approach, due to its ability to predict zero trade flows more accurately. The empirical results indicate the effect of distance on trade volume is large and statistically significant. In addition, firms trade almost exclusively with partners in the home state or in states with branch offices. We find that social media and website advertising is much less effective in increasing the trade flow than traditional advertising channels. [EconLit Citations: Q17, Q13].",

It might be due to the high price elasticity of demand, inefficient sales channels, and entry barriers of imported fluid milk. In terms of policy implications, the government needs to create a more competitive market for the whole dairy industry.

Their results suggest that although economies of scale would still be important, the ban would potentially limit or reduce economies of scale in the swine industry.

We analyze the interaction between the microeconomic characteristics of firms and those of their environment because this interaction determines a multinational firm's decision to internalize trade. The empirical work is based on the ‘industrial globalization’ survey conducted by the French statistics institutes in 1993 and 1999. With regard to the French agri‐food trade, there has been an increase in intra‐firm (IFT) trade within the EU‐15 borders and the European multinational networks. The main determinants of intra‐firm trade are the firms' need to generate economies of scale and to protect and exploit their ‘firm‐specific advantages’ related to the technology and nature of the product. The model sheds light on the role and the development of intra‐regional networks of subsidiaries. [JEL classifications: F10, F14, F23]. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In agriculture, production plans can have a horizon of a few months to several years. However, it is not always the case that managers follow through on their plans once established. The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors that contribute to changes between managers’ planned decisions and eventual actions. A unique dataset consisting of farm financial data, consultant generated production plans, and a follow‐up producer survey was constructed with participants in the Texas FARM‐Assistance program. We evaluate the effects of managers’ behavioral attributes, farm financial indicators, and production characteristics on the decision to follow through on business plans. Our findings provide new insights into the decision‐making and planning processes of managers under risky market conditions, and the interactions of same with behavioral characteristics.

Results show the improved speed of price adjustment after the MPR in the supply chain of the beef industry, whereas a limited evidence of the increased price asymmetry is detected. The increased asymmetry is observed mostly through the long‐run regime switching coefficients of threshold autoregressive and error correction models. The price asymmetry mostly disappears in both pre‐ and post‐MPR periods when only short‐ and long‐run price adjustment coefficients are considered. The results also suggest the existence of the threshold cointegration in the vertical price relationship of the beef industry, which supports the use of the nonlinear threshold model in this study.[JEL codes: C22, Q11]",

A growing literature finds that agricultural producers in the United States are facing a shrinking labor supply, while only a few studies examine how agricultural producers are adjusting to having less labor. This study examines how a shrinking labor force affects agricultural production decisions, specifically in terms of labor‐intensive and capital‐intensive crops. With less labor it is more challenging for agricultural producers to produce labor‐intensive crops when there is no available technology to substitute for labor. We use E‐Verify enforcement laws as a quasi‐natural negative labor shock and data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey to examine this issue. We find a decline in the production of labor‐intensive crops and an increase in the production of capital‐intensive crops in the states that have enforced “strong” E‐Verify laws. Based on our results, the opposite is true for “weak” E‐Verify states. [EconLit Citations: Q12, Q18, J6, K37].",

One of the major challenges is to assess farm value in the context of an opaque market for farms. We contribute to the scarce literature on farm valuation by empirically applying three valuation methods to the Farm Accountancy Data Network database for France in 2017 and 2018 and for five types of farming. The three methods—the fundamental method, the patrimonial method, and the financial method—are well known for the valuation of companies, but have yet to be implemented widely for farms in the empirical literature. The results show that wine‐growing farms have the highest values on average. Pig and beef farms have high average patrimonial values, reflecting their high capital intensity, but beef farms have the lowest average values calculated with methods based on cash flows, revealing unfavorable market conditions for these farms. The results further reveal that total farm output drives the value upward, but that high farm labor, indebtedness, and age contribute to reducing value. Our findings also highlight that, in practice, the differences in values across methods may be substantial.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study used 39 coffee producing countries (CPC) in African and non‐African countries as the research object to evaluate the coffee production efficiency and coffee productivity of CPC from 2013 to 2017. Empirical results show that during the study period, among 14 countries with coffee production efficiency greater than 1, Lao (1.7265), Viet Nam (1.4282), and Indonesia (1.3113) are located in Asia, and Ghana (1.3741) and Ethiopia (1.1357) are African countries, the rest of the countries are distributed in Central and South America. The three countries with the worst coffee production efficiency are Côte d'Ivoire (0.2482), Sierra Leone (0.2137), and Togo (0.1774), all located in Africa. In terms of coffee productivity, the average is 1.1318. Eleven countries are above the average and 28 countries are below the average. Among them, Guyana (0.9103), Yemen (0.8278), and Malawi (0.6275) have the worst coffee productivity. The study found that although coffee originated in Africa, the average coffee production efficiency of African countries (0.6167) lags behind non‐African countries (1.1563). However, the average coffee productivity of African countries (1.1766) is better than that of non‐African countries (1.1007). At present, coffee production efficiency in coffee‐producing countries in Africa is low, and technological improvements are being used to improve efficiency, making coffee productivity present an upward trend. This study chose to use the non‐oriented Super Directional Distance Model and Malmquist total factor productivity to evaluate the changes in coffee production efficiency and coffee productivity in African and non‐African countries.

    "abstract": "Abstract We calibrate the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development International Agricultural Commodity Market model using 2019/20 marketing year crop data and 2020 calendar year livestock and biofuel data to project China's agricultural imports under six plausible policy scenarios focusing on ethanol, corn, and pork from 2021 to 2030. Our baseline projection reflects China's current policy of relaxing the tariff rate quota (TRQ) for corn and imposing ethanol tariff without any ethanol/gasoline blend mandate. Baseline projections show China's ethanol imports grow from 100 million liters in 2020 to 1.21 billion liters in 2030; however, they also show that China's corn and pork imports remain at high levels and peak in the 2022/23 marketing year. Compared with the baseline, adopting the ethanol mandate increases China's corn and pork imports, and resuming the corn TRQ increases China's ethanol and pork imports. Both the ethanol mandate and corn import restrictions shift US and global exports from corn to ethanol and pork products. These projections can serve as benchmark estimates of China's imports of major agricultural commodities in the next decade. [EconLit citations: Q17, Q18, Q11].",

One aspect of this change is food stockpiling detected in several countries. Using a univariate probit model, this paper relies on the COVID‐19 Impact Survey (2020) for American households to assess the likelihood of consumers stockpiling food in response to the stringent lockdown measures imposed by the government's pandemic regulations. Our findings reveal a set of significant correlations between marital status, age, race, occupation, household structure, and the propensity of stockpiling food during the pandemic. Furthermore, the results show that residents in urban areas are more likely to engage in food stockpiling compared with residents in rural and suburban areas. The paper also examines the nexus between residence areas, lockdown measures, and the probability of stockpiling food. This research reveals a significant association between psychological factors and the likelihood of stockpiling food in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic [EconLit Citations: D12, H12, I18, P25].",

Theoretically, GRPs and appropriately deflated advertising expenditures should provide identical representations of exposure. This hypothesis was tested using Canadian butter advertising data for the period 1984–1989. Our statistical analysis suggested the level of dollar outlays for television advertising and the associated estimated GRPs are positively related; this, however, was not the case in several instances for period-to-period changes in the level of expenditures. Because the problems of measurement errors, quality variation, and aggregation over media are shared by both data series, our tentative conclusion is that in practice GRPs are not necessarily superior to expenditures. © 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

As with the US study, respondents to the survey were asked to score 74 personal and professional attributes in six major categories, required for successful careers in agribusiness. The survey data enabled the authors to rank order the attributes and draw conclusions about the importance of categories of attributes as perceived by different sectors of agribusiness in Australia. The rank order was very similar to that found in the US study. Interpersonal and communication skills were rated very highly by future employers.",

We develop three constrained models to eliminate perverse signs: a price conduct constraint in the linear model that links private label and Garelick pricing, a generalized Mills address model, and the logit model. Statistical tests indicate that each of the three constrained models produces acceptable substitution patterns and that none is preferred to the other two. On nonstatistical grounds, however, the Mills and price‐constrained models perform best. This is the first empirical study of the Mills address model of private‐label pricing. Finally, we demonstrate that estimated price‐reaction functions and the corresponding total elasticities, which capture only strategic non‐collusive interaction in these Nash Bertrand models, provide interesting insight into competition among brands.

This study examines informal trade barriers in terms of the attitudes of Japanese distributors toward U.S. products. The study focuses on a product‐market for which Japan is the leading single‐country importer for the U.S.: fruit.

    "abstract": "Abstract This article considers the reasons for high grocery prices in a small isolated market. The starting point of our study is the knowledge that the price of food in the Åland Islands—a small archipelago between Finland and Sweden—is significantly higher than in continental Finland. We also know that store‐level economies of scale in grocery retailing mean that the structure of a small market is, even in the best case, either inefficient or uncompetitive. The article compares the price level of stores in Åland and Finland. Our aim is to decompose the price differences and allocate them between their various causes. The empirical results of the study are in accordance with the theory: high prices in Åland arise from a small average store size, high concentration in both the retailing and the food processing sector, border taxes, and transportation costs. An additional source of high prices is the strong regional spirit of the Ålanders: they are prepared to pay higher prices for products that are made in Åland.

Among other results, we find that households with children are less price sensitive to cereals with whole grain as the first ingredient and to cereals that contain a higher number of fortified vitamins. In addition, we find that households tend to switch between products with similar fiber content and whole grain content profiles.",

By panel cointegration techniques, we estimate cost pass‐through elasticities and speed of adjustment during periods of peak demand. We find that cost pass‐through elasticities slightly increase; the speed of adjustment in periods of peak demand remains the same, but retail–wholesale margins decrease. Thus, peak demand leads to an increase in retail–wholesale competition similarly observed by Chevalier et al. (2003, Am Econ Rev , 93 , 15–37).",

The BSE outbreak affected imported frozen beef demands more than imported chilled beef demands.

This paper uses farm‐level data to identify the drivers of Irish farmers’ participation in Bord Bia's Beef and Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme (BLQAS) in 2012, and assesses the impact of participation on farm gross margins. After controlling for potential self‐selection bias, we cannot find reliable evidence that the gross margins of participants in beef quality assurance schemes have been affected by their decision to participate. Consequently, lack of financial incentives can be a barrier to farmer participation in beef quality assurance schemes [EconLit citations: L25, M21, Q12].",

From this demand, the author shows how to estimate the ex ante price of the new product along with the ex ante level of advertising selected by one firm for informing consumers. The socially optimal level of advertising maximizing the welfare is also determined. The previous methodology is applied to two experiments with food. For a same‐advertising formula regarding information diffusion to consumers, the estimated levels of advertising highly differ between these two experiments because of different WTP variations linked to the new product.",

We explore the case of wine‐grape farmers in Chile where we observe a bifurcation of farmer types.“Quasi‐subsistence” farmers produce traditional wine‐grape varieties and complement their subsistence income with cash coming from wine‐grape sale. On the other hand, we observe “entrepreneurial” farmers who produce classic varieties that have the potential to produce high‐quality wines. We study this bifurcation empirically using primary data collected during the 2011–2012 growing season. We find that wealth and cultivation ability provide economically and statistically significant explanatory power, but that buyer characteristics also matter. Our results suggest that a farmer's entry into the supply chain for high‐quality production is not an individual's choice. Rather it is a joint decision that cannot be fully understood without considering the objectives, incentives, and information of supplier and buyer. [EconLit citations: O14; Q140; L26].",

LBOs existed before the 1980s but their number and dollar value increased in the 1980s. Value of LBOs in food industries peaked at US$65 billion in 1989. In dollar value, the RJR Nabisco and Beatrice Foods LBOs are the two largest leveraged buyouts in US history. A sample of target firms, taken privately in an LBO in the 1980s, was analyzed to reach the objective. Multiples of purchase price to book value at takeover announcement date were studied. Debt repayments and divestitures were analyzed. Results show that the structure of deals has changed since the 1980s. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Because of this legislation there are now potential legal and monetary implications associated with these evaluations. Consequently, for all parties concerned two questions naturally arise: what is the scientific status of promotion evaluations? How can promotion evaluations be improved?This article attempts to answer these questions by exploring the scientific and artistic aspects of the central activity involved in all promotion evaluations: modeling. Attention centers on the scientific assumption choice set that is available to modelers, the tradeoffs involved in making certain assumption choices, and how assumption choices may be improved in general. These ideas are discussed in the context of a sample of promotion evaluation studies. [Econ-Lit citations: B4, D6, Q13] Â© 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

In the scaling model, advertising has a tendency to be more effective when demand is price elastic (inelastic) given a quantity augmenting (diminishing) type scaling impact.

The majority of New Zealand's primary producers appear to believe that the safe management and use of agrichemicals in an important health issue in the primary sector. However, there is evidence that a considerable segment of New Zealand primary producers are not using adequate protective equipment. This article analyzes New Zealand primary producers' decision or desire to participate in agrichemical training and identifies factors, including attiudinal, behavioural, informational and current farming practices, that appear to influence the decision or desire to participate in agrichemical training. A qualitative choice model is developed to evaluate the influencing factors on problem recognition. Empirical results suggest that employee involvement and safe use and export factors are positively associated with problem recognition and factors representing experience, health ambivalence, and overconfidence are significantly negatively associated with problem recognition. The results also present a number of challenges for providers of agrichemical training programs and primary sector policy analysts. Â© 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

In particular, the focus of this review is on research using scanner data conducted at the disaggregate (e.g., store, chain or local market) level, including empirical studies of vertical (i.e., within-channel) conduct. Studies addressing the competitive interaction on price, as well as non-price variables (e.g., in-store display and feature advertising) are considered. The author first describes the methodologies available for measuring the competitive interaction between firms and then briefly summarizes recent empirical developments. Given the complexity of the interactions that take place in practice, it is argued that much of the richness of actual competitive behavior is lost in aggregate analysis. Competitive interaction is the result of a complex set of variables and influences—demand side factors, market and industry structure, firm “personality,” and category characteristics all interact in a complex fashion to determine strategic behavior of retailers and manufacturers.

In this article, the economics of media allocation are addressed using catfish as a case study. The hypothesis that demand responds equally to all media was rejected. Further analysis indicated that the media with relatively modest expenditures (newspapers and television) had no reliable effect on demand, which suggests that scale is important. Losses sustained from the apparently ineffectual media were more than offset by gains from the effective media (magazines and radio), so that returns overall, net of opportunity cost, were positive. The historical media allocation, however, was inefficient in the sense that a different media mix would have resulted in greater industry profits. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Data were collected from two FCMS workshops with large agribusiness firms. Experimental mergers involved the two smaller packers in the market in one case and the two larger packers in another. During the merger period, market prices were significantly higher than prior to the merger in both cases. Following the dissolution, results were mixed. Management of the merged firms appeared to significantly affect how effectively merged packers operated, thus affecting both behavior and performance. For both mergers, profits of the merged firm were higher relative to profits of rival firms. Merged firms appeared to have achieved some synergies in procurement or economies of scope (i.e., multi‐plant economies). An increased Herfindahl index was associated with lower fed cattle prices in one case and higher prices in the other. [EconLit citations: L130, L290, L660]. © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

This study extends the analytical work on geographic diversification strategy in a firm‐level application that considers how longer marketing seasons might affect early‐season premium prices. The method draws on market integration tests from the industrial organization literature. The extent of market integration is examined using a probabilistic measure. Then, a simulation of profit incorporates the probability that markets are integrated. Tests on the market for table grapes indicate high probability that markets for domestic grapes and imports from Chile are not integrated (0.81 and 0.91). Long distances and the lack of overlap in production seasons play key roles in this finding. The simulation that makes operational the findings of limited integration suggests that geographic diversification is more profitable and of lower risk than production in California alone.

Consumers, however, may reject pale cuts of veal labeled as “grain-fed.” This article uses questionnaire data from six groceries in the province of Quebec, Canada, to investigate frequency of veal purchases and perceived importance of price, color, and production type as determinants of veal purchases. Consumers do not appear to have clear preferences for milk-fed veal characteristics. Frequency of consumption and importance of veal meat attributes were influenced more by variables of habit formation than by price, income, or education. The veal industry might be advised to encourage consumption of veal as a means to diversify consumers' meat menu. [Econ-Lit citations: D120, Q130] © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

This article tests whether a large portfolio of products is beneficial to producers by observing UK consumer response to price promotions. The article shows that discounts induce mainly segment switching (74% of the total impact), with a limited effect on stockpiling (26%) and no impact on purchase incidence. Consequently, consumers prefer to “follow the discount” rather than purchase multiple units of the same wine. This result seems to explain the current structure of the market, and suggests that discounts may conflict with segment loyalty, a situation that disfavors producers, particularly in very populated segments. Results also casts doubts on the economic sustainability of competition based on an intense product differentiation in the wine sector. [EconLit Citations: C010, D120, M310].",

    "abstract": "Professional analysts' estimates of earnings per share (EPS) provide a rare source of forward-looking information regarding the financial performance of publicly traded firms. Although numerous studies in the economics, finance, and accounting literatures have examined the properties of these forecasts and provided general insight into their performance, no known research explicitly examines the performance of analysts' EPS estimates for publicly traded food companies. This issue is particularly relevant given the influence that publicly traded agribusiness companies maintain in the agro-food supply chain (Vickner, 2002). Focusing on quarterly consensus estimates of EPS for 11 of the largest publicly traded food companies based on capitalization, the authors examine the point accuracy of these estimates through the introduction of the mean absolute scaled error measure, their performance over time, as well as their optimal forecast properties of bias, efficiency, and forecast encompassing. Results suggest that professional analysts, on average, produce EPS estimates that are more accurate than time series alternatives, yet the differences are often not statistically significant. For many of the firms examined, analysts' EPS estimates are found to be biased, inefficient, and do not encompass information in simple time series alternatives. For many firms in the sample, forecast accuracy has decreased over time. However, it is difficult to determine if this decline in forecast accuracy is due to turnover of analysts in the wake of increased financial market regulation (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley), decline in forecasting skill, or structural changes in the food industry, which make it more difficult to forecast earnings over time.

The conceptual basis of this approach is that firms differ due to differences in possessing endowments of fixed factors, and net returns to firms can be viewed as rents accruing to these factors. Therefore, the marginal return from an increase in demand due to a successful generic promotion programs may not be the same across firms because firms do not have the same level of fixed factors. The result of our analysis indicates that producers may not equally benefit from the collectively funded programs. Our marginal profit analysis indicates that a producer‐financed promotion program may have greater benefits for producers with more endowed fixed factors than those with less endowed fixed factors.[EconLit citations: M370 and Q130]. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract Turkey is an important food commodity whose total value of U.S. production amounted to $2.72 billion in 2003. Empirical evidence suggests that among broilers, eggs, turkeys, and chickens, Salmonella contamination of ground turkey is highest at 49.9% prior to hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) implementation and 26.6% after HACCP implementation. Salmonella and other microbial outbreaks have greatly contributed to the large number of food recalls in the meat and poultry industry; therefore, processed turkey constitutes a prime commodity for HACCP intervention analysis. Value‐at‐risk provides a framework for assisting firm management to assess food safety risks in monetary terms, and to evaluate the economic incentives of control measures like HACCP. Results show that food safety losses as measured by downside risk significantly declined following HACCP implementation. Medium‐ and large‐scale turkey processors are more likely to derive more benefit from implementing an augmented HACCP plan than a generic HACCP plan.

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding producers' risk perceptions of foreign animal diseases and their willingness to participate in prevention efforts is crucial for effective policymaking and communication strategies, yet there is limited empirical evidence to support initiatives. Using results from a 2017 survey of U.S. swine producers, we test whether producers' subjective risk perceptions affect their willingness to pay for interventions that could reduce potential foreign animal disease losses. Then, controlling for subjective risk perceptions, we determine the relative and total impacts of different representations of ambiguity on willingness to pay. Our results indicate that producers have a mean willingness to pay of $0.581 per pig per year. We find no difference in willingness to pay under alternative representations of ambiguity characterized by probability of occurrence, damage, and damage duration. Rather, a producer with a higher subjective belief in the probability of a foreign animal disease outbreak in the U.S. swine industry, a higher level of formal education, operating as a contractor or integrator, and owning a truck‐wash has a higher willingness to pay. Also, the number of market hogs sold annually is an important determinant of willingness to pay for foreign animal disease risk mitigation. [EconLit citations: D81, Q11, Q18]",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is an extensive literature on the Monday effect with stock indices. It is regularly reported that the return on Monday is correlated with the return on the prior Friday. The bad Monday effect occurs when the return on the preceding Friday is negative. Cotton is an economically important commodity in the United States and around the world. This investigation into the daily price seasonality in the U.S. cotton market is based on spot prices from Memphis and futures prices from the New York Cotton Exchange. The regression methodologies employ adjustments to control for undesirable properties in the error terms. There are three main conclusions. First, the close‐to‐close changes in the futures price and in the spot price exhibit a negative Monday effect. Second, a negative bad Monday effect is observed on Mondays using close‐to‐close prices. The effect is present during the weekend nontrading period and continues into trading on Mondays. Third, the negative bad Monday effect does not appear to weaken in close‐to‐close prices and during the weekend over the period examined (1987–2003). However, there is weak evidence of a temporal decline during trading on Mondays. [EconLit Citations: G12, G14, Q14]. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

As higher quality goods are removed, the value of the seller's remaining stock falls, lowering the price and profits. Bundling and other marketing mechanisms can discourage sorting and prevent the depreciation of the seller's stock. With comparative statics and simulations, the author shows that sellers can increase expected quality and profits by committing to discard a proportion of their resale stock after sorting occurs. In this manner, sorting acts similarly to agricultural grading. [EconLit Classification: Q1, Q11, Q13, L0, L1, D8, D82]. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Furthermore, we simulate trade expansions under plausible negotiation outcomes. We find that a TTIP agreement promotes cross‐Atlantic trade in plant products, in both directions, by nearly 60% if tariffs are removed and MRLs are mutually recognized or harmonized to the Codex levels.

Chinese demand and biofuel production account for the entire net increase in world per‐capita grain and oilseed consumption since 1980. If biofuel expansion and Chinese consumption growth slow, a key question is whether a new engine of demand growth will emerge.

While recognising that many factors influence industry structure, if new technologies reduce the costs of large firms more than small firms, they provide an incentive for firms to grow and for industries to become more highly concentrated. If they reduce the costs of small firms more, they can help such small firms compete on more equal terms with their larger competitors. The evidence here suggests that most new dairy technologies slightly favour larger firms, though firms in the 250–1000 employee category are not disadvantaged relative to those with more than 1000 employees. However, information technologies for greater process control are substantially scale-increasing and give more benefits to very large firms. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

As multinational agribusiness firms (MNFs) gain importance as sources of foreign direct investment in developing countries and as players in international agricultural markets, the need for understanding the motives for and consequences of MNF practices also grows. The first part of this reviewidentifies the practices and issues associated with MNF transfer pricing. The second section reviews survey results on the objectives and influences affecting MNF transfer pricing decisions. The final section then summarizes the theoretical development of transfer pricing analysis in the economics literature.",

Statistically significant evidence suggests that the dynamic manner in which corn price increases elicit broiler price changes has changed since the 1950s. Corn price increases are now more likely to be passed on to broiler consumers, and more immediately. Evidence further suggests that since the early period, significant change has occurred at the retail level, and that corn price has become a more important broiler price determinant.",

The suspensions also decreased quantities processed which increased prices for processing navels. Because demand is more price inelastic in the higher-priced, fresh-use market than for processing, growers' revenue fell during the suspensions. The suspensions boosted total marketers' and consumers' economic well-being as measured by economic surplus. The size of the suspension effects depends largely on the volumes of navels shipped during the suspension and crop size.",

With the raspberry industry as an example, we show that credible demonstration of import harm requires an econometric model distinguishing domestic from foreign impacts on U.S. prices.

A typical explanation for such price increases would be an inadequate supply of livestock. Yet, although measures were taken to raise the supply of red meat, they were not sufficient to reverse or stop this upward trend in prices. We specifically search for the dynamics behind the price spikes by exploring whether they were driven by speculation. We investigated the presence of rational speculative bubbles in the red meat market in Turkey by employing a recent methodology developed by Phillips et al. (2015). We found evidence for explosive periods and detected the periods of speculative bubbles in the red meat market in Turkey. [EconLit citations: C4, D4, O13].",

Using a difference‐in‐differences approach, we find that these rules together reduced meat‐related Lm illnesses by about 60 per year, which we attribute to reductions in both the number and average size of meat‐related Lm outbreaks. We then monetize this illness reduction using an underreporting and underdiagnosis multiplier of 2.3 and an estimate of the mean cost of a Lm illness of $1.5 million and find that these rules generated about $208 million per year in cost savings, which compares favorably to the rules’ estimated annual cost of roughly $22 million.

The base case results indicated that the optimal buffer stocks should be 20% more than expected demand in the base case, and vary in a logical way with changes in demand, market carry, and stockout penalties. Implications from these results illustrate that stockholding is an important element of agricultural processing. This approach indicates that managers should strategically manage inventory positions and purchases that result in buffer stocks. [EconLit citations: C6, L1, L7, L9, Q12, Q14]",

This matters as these products are heterogeneous not only across product categories but also within the same plant genus, changing the baseline cognitive load for consumer decision‐making. This study uses eye‐tracking technology to explore how increases in the number of options presented in potted plant retail displays affects visual attention and consumer choice by expanding cognitive load. In a within‐subjects design, participants completed six choice tasks, indicating their likelihood to buy their most preferred alternative. As display size increased, participants ignored a larger percentage of the display, engaged in common choice patterns, and spent a lower percentage of their gaze sequence fixated on their selected alternative.

    "abstract": "Abstract Food waste, or loss, at the wholesale and retail levels accounts for some 40% of the total amount of supply‐chain waste. While zero waste is never optimal, there are managerial variables that contribute to the level of loss. In this paper, we use data from a large beverage distributor to estimate the most important causes of loss, and investigate which can be controlled in an economically‐viable way. Controlling for a range of important environmental (uncontrollable) variables, we find that competitive pricing, case sets, assortment size, package size, and inefficiency are the most important determinants of loss. However, our most important finding highlights the importance of “discretion over rules” in inventory management as salesforce discretion in delivering less‐than‐ordered amounts is statistically important and one of the only ways management can directly influence supply‐chain loss. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on food and beverage supply‐chain sustainability, food loss and waste, and inventory management. As such, our findings are likely to be of interest to both managers in the food and beverage supply chain (manufacturers, distributors, and retailers) and policy makers interested in reducing food and beverage loss and improving food system sustainability.

Although investing in startups can produce significant returns, the risk of failure is high, and the commercial strategies are largely unknown. Traditional valuation methodologies, such as discounted cash flow (DCF) and multiples, are not well suited for startups. Real options provide a methodology to quantify the value of growth opportunities and managerial flexibility, two critical features of startups. This study develops a model that integrates decision trees and a stochastic binomial lattice to quantify the value of growth opportunities and managerial flexibility in a prerevenue AgTech startup. Utilizing a binomial lattice and decision trees allows for the quantification of private and market risk.

We use a large dataset on grocery price quotes from Amazon's main platform and its subsidiary Amazon Fresh in Berlin, Germany, to test whether those (both pure online) channels apply deviating pricing strategies.

Using a dynamic panel model to address endogeneity, our results reveal that nonfarm entrepreneurship has a positive impact on the value of crop output and household welfare. Our findings suggest that income from nonfarm entrepreneurship may enhance crop output through crop production technology and credit access, and household welfare through an increase in consumption expenditure and food expenditure as potential transmission mechanisms. Policies that enhance nonfarm entrepreneurship may also reinforce crop production and the welfare of farm households and are thus imperative. We suggest that policies that boost nonfarm sector growth such as agro‐processing and agribusiness enterprise development might achieve the twin objectives simultaneously: enhancing crop production and household welfare [EconLit Citations: C33, D24, Q12, 012].",

We employ propensity score matching and W. Greene's selection bias‐corrected stochastic production frontier methods to correct for observable and unobservable selection bias issues, respectively. We further use a metafrontier model to derive technology gap ratios (TGRs) and meta‐TE for agrifood system participants and nonparticipants. The results reveal that agrifood system participants are about 50% more productive than nonparticipants. In addition, participants have higher meta‐TE (58% vs. 55%) and TGR (98% vs. 94%) than nonparticipants. Variables such as farmer group membership, extension visits, mobile phone ownership, irrigation and road access are the notable correlates of smallholder farmers' participation in agrifood systems. The total value of vegetable production is significantly influenced by fertilizer, agrochemicals, seeds, irrigation, soil fertility, and location‐fixed effects. [EconLit Citations: D24, Q12, Q18]",

    "abstract": "Abstract Federal and state legislators recently enacted policies to fund new and renovated small and local meat processors expansion with the aim of increasing the meat‐processing sector's resiliency. Wages must be competitive to attract employees for these new and renovated plants to be competitive. No previous studies have examined what has happened to employee labor costs at United States (US) meat‐processing plants since the early 2000s. This study estimates how meat‐processing firm size affects employee wages in the US. We use average employee wages for beef and pork processing plants from 2007 to 2019. We find larger plants pay higher wages than smaller ones, which is likely attributable to lower fixed costs resulting from economies of scale. Findings suggest that facilities with more than 500+ employees will most likely offer wage that are high enough to recruit workers in for this industry. Small plants will need to increase real wages that are higher than historical averages. Thus, if smaller facilities increase the sector's resiliency, then it will likely come at a cost in terms of higher wage bills. [EconLit Citations: Q12, Q18].",

Our findings indicate that cost‐efficiency effects decreased sharply from 74.642 in 2017 to ‐145.860 in 2021, while market power effects remained stable during the study period. We found that the decrease in cost‐efficiency effects has begun to counteract the market power effects, which can largely be attributed to profix‐maximizing behavior of broiler packers in response to the bird flu outbreak. Moreover, we highlighted that non‐material price changes were a significant source of the reduction in cost‐efficiency effects, which underscores the necessity of policy efforts to manage factor market situations in order to mitigate the negative consequences of market concentration.

In this regard, our findings suggest that agricultural R&amp;D spending has been profitable in recent decades and that a higher allocation of R&amp;D resources is justifiable.

The pandemic highlighted worker safety inadequacies as well as system vulnerabilities to supply chain disruptions. One result has been political and media scrutinization of beef processing concentration as a culprit for these disruptions. Breaking plants up into smaller, more geographically dispersed processing could help mitigate risk from large plant closures but would likely result in higher retail prices because of lost scale economies. Additionally, improving worker safety likely means slower processing even in larger plants, again likely raising retail prices. We use a choice‐based conjoint analysis to examine to whether and to what extent consumers would be willing to pay higher prices to support smaller plant sizes and improved worker safety, among other beef characteristics. Findings of the study suggest that consumers do not care, at least directly, about plant size but are willing to pay to reduce food miles for processed beef (indirectly implying more geographic dispersion). Consumers are also WTP to improve worker safety. Results also show positive willingness to pay for characteristics such as “grass‐fed” which is consistent with other studies.

Third, the sequence of risk transmission between overseas and domestic energy markets changes, and domestic energy markets become more resilient.

Basis reflects the crop transportation network costs, and we use basis data to estimate the sensitivity of this network to precipitation. The estimates show that corn and soybean basis differ in terms of the immediate effect of weekly local precipitation. The growing‐season precipitation exhibits a U‐shaped relationship for both crops, reflecting the role of growing‐season precipitation on yields and the sensitivity of transportation system stress to crop volumes. We also find that the basis is affected by river transportation disruptions proxied by regional precipitation, which indicates when water levels might be too high or too low for normal barge traffic. Given the climate projections, there are concerns regarding precipitation's influence on the infrastructure that links Missouri crops to export facilities, crop growing conditions, and collection point disruptions. Hence, this research speaks to both the state of this part of the food system now and the potential impacts of changing weather patterns on the US crop distribution network.

    "abstract": "Abstract Extensive studies have discussed the economic and welfare effects of social pensions worldwide, while scant attention has been paid to their nutritional effects, especially in emerging economies. Using multitopic longitudinal survey data of households and individuals in Kyrgyzstan covering four waves of 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2019, this study aims to examine the impact of an old‐age pension on the nutritional outcomes of the elderly and shed light on their underlying mechanisms. Our empirical identification rests on a propensity score matching with difference‐in‐differences estimation design to address the endogeneity problem of receiving an old‐age pension. Overall, the results indicate that receiving an old‐age pension has a significant and negative impact on body mass index and the probability of being overweight for males, while no significant impact of the old‐age pension has been observed for females. Receiving an old‐age pension has no significant effect on expenditure of food consumption, calorie intake, and macronutrient intake, while it significantly reduces the ratio of protein intake to total calorie intake. We also observe significant heterogeneity in the nutritional effect of an old‐age pension across various education levels and income levels; the negative nutritional effect is more salient for elderly individuals who are relatively poor or who have lower education. Our findings provide profound implications for policies targeting improving the nutritional status of rural residents in emerging economies through the implementation of the old‐age pension [EconLit Citations: H55, I15, I38].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Zinc acts as an important cofactor in the body and is essential for normal functions. Several zinc interventions have been implemented worldwide to improve the public's zinc status, but limited studies have assessed their cost‐effectiveness. To help inform decision‐making on zinc interventions to maximize benefits within a fixed budget, we took China as an example and evaluated the cost‐effectiveness of three interventions, that is, supplementation, food fortification, and biofortification. As an essential group at high risk of zinc deficiency, children aged 5–14 years, who account for 10% of the Chinese population, were selected as the target group in this study. We constructed a decision‐analytic Markov model to determine the cost‐effectiveness of interventions in China under different scenarios. In our model, biofortification through conventional breeding was shown to be the most cost‐effective approach in most scenarios. Compared with other interventions, zinc supplementation gained fewer quality‐adjusted life years at a higher net cost, suggesting that this common approach may not be optimal for large‐scale, long‐term implementation at the national level. While the robustness of the results was further confirmed by the sensitivity analysis, more research is needed to assess the cost‐effectiveness of addressing zinc deficiency with other interventions. Further clinical trials are also expected to evaluate the effectiveness of zinc interventions in reducing pneumonia cases [EconLit Citations: I18, Q16, Q18].",

    "abstract": "Abstract To fill an important gap in the literature on acquirer prediction, this paper investigates which factors contribute to the likelihood that a firm will choose to acquire a target company from the United States (US) food and agribusiness industry (FABI). It relies on existing literature and a conceptual model in identifying the determinants of the choice to be an acquirer. Rejecting the pooled ordinary least squares and random‐effects models, the paper estimates a fixed‐effects logistic regression model based on panel data on acquirers and nonacquirers of US FABI (USFABI) target companies. Contrary to the study's various hypotheses, the results suggest that (1) efficiency, profitability, and liquidity do not affect the likelihood of being an acquirer, but that (2) less‐solvent, less‐leveraged, and less‐attractive firms are more likely to become acquirers (possibly to improve their solvency, profitability, and attractiveness). These contradictory results are attributed to the uniqueness of the USFABI sector. The mergers and acquisitions process may therefore be a way for acquirers of USFABI firms to strengthen themselves, not necessarily an expression of their financial strength. This analysis is useful to target companies, acquirers, transaction advisers, investors, regulators, and other merger and acquisition stakeholders. [EconLit Citations: D22, G24, G34, L66, Q14].",

In addition, this research introduces a new proxy for the food wastage rate, gauged by the ratio of edible‐to‐inedible food scraps. The results of time‐series cointegration analysis show that per capita edible food scraps and socioeconomic factors are bound together over the long run. Specifically, per capita edible food waste displays a positive co‐movement with food price, the working‐age share, and household size, while exhibiting a negative co‐movement with the old‐age share. This insight empowers policymakers with the ability to foresee and tackle the food waste problem by acting on the municipality's demographic and economic structural change. Our analysis complements the existing studies that depend on cross‐sectional individual‐level data by adopting a long‐run municipal‐level time series perspective.

    "abstract": "Abstract The food industry is one of the most important industries in developed economies. The progressive professionalization of its workforce and the persistent demand for low‐skilled employment in this sector may be leading to educational mismatch with its concomitant effects on wages and productivity. Yet the economic literature has not addressed wage structures, gender differences, and the composition of the labor force together in this food industry. We analyzed the effects of educational mismatch on wages in the Spanish food industry from a gender perspective. To this end, we used data from the 2018 Wage Structure Survey collected by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics. We applied the overeducated, required educated, undereducated specification to these data. The main results show that educational mismatch leads to gender wage differentials in this sector. The analysis also shows that the Spanish food industry places more value on men with adequate education and women with some level of overeducation. The results on occupational segregation show that the food industry penalizes access to female‐dominated occupations, and that this wage disadvantage is greater for female workers. We also observed wage differences in the remuneration of certain personal and professional factors that could be worsening the gender differentials in the Spanish food industry [EconLit Citations: I26, J16, J21, J24, J31].",

Total foodgrain production has increased by 236% with an annual growth rate of 2.74% during the period 1950/51–1989/90. Average production increased by 72% between periods 1950/51–1965/66 (pregreen revolution) and 1966/67–1989/90 (green revolution). These increases have been accompanied by higher instability and risk in production of certain crops. This study applies variance decomposition procedures to time series data on foodgrains to analyse the sources of instability. Statistical identities have been used to provide an exact decomposition of the components of change in mean and variance of production.

This article examines an important innovation within the industry known as efficient consumer response (ECR). The conceptual model employed has been used for over 50 years to analyze the adoption and diffusion of innovations. The findings are based on 40 in-depth interviews conducted with top industry leaders representing manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. General awareness of and interest in ECR was quite high among industry leaders. However, many respondents perceived ECR to be a very complex system that would have a wide range of impacts. Different industry segments expressed varying perceptions about ECR.

If there are inefficiencies in the Canadian grain marketing system, many are not attributable to the CWB. For example, elevation charges are set by grain companies, and not by the CWB. Furthermore, when the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and other factors are taken into account, barley prices are not lower of Lethbridge, Alberta (a major cattle feeding region in Canada) than they are in comparable areas in the United States. In addition, with the removal of the Crow transportation subsidy there has been a dramatic change in the export and domestic pricing relationship for barley. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Biotechnology is redefining the nature of agricultural research and intellectual property. In response, public agricultural research institutions are increasingly protecting their intellectual property and commercializing research results. This raises the question: Is agricultural research still a public good? This paper is a critical first step in understanding how increasingly private ownership of intellectual property affects the agribusiness environment and the evolving role of public agricultural research institutions. The innovative step is the development of a neo-Schumpeterian model which examines whether commercialization of public research maximizes social welfare. The model contains two types of research firms: large firms such as the major life-science companies; and small university-related firms (SMURFs). Results show that both large firms and SMURFs underinvest in research relative to the social optimum, that research investment can exhibit cyclical behavior, and that there is a continued, albeit diminished, role for public agricultural research as the life-science revolution progresses.

In this research, the level of competition in the Japanese potato market was evaluated using conjectural variations technique on the time series data from 1989 to 1995. Four wholesale markets with eight production sources were analyzed. From the empirical analysis, it can be concluded that, despite the high level of concentration in production, all producing regions including the dominant producer, Hokkaido, seem to have behaved competitively. However, the degree of competition is found to vary depending on the season. Hokkaido, the leading producer, may be setting prices close to marginal costs under pressure of competition from foreign suppliers. {Econ‐Lit citations: L100, L130] © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

First, it examines how futures markets should be used to hedge cottonseed crushing. The soybean crushing spread is applied in a cross-hedging context with a portfolio-risk minimization objective to develop the desired hedge ratios for a variety of cross-hedging portfolios and for several hedge horizons. The hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness statistics resulting from this analysis are reported. Second, based on follow-up discussions, this article reports on whether the recommended hedging strategies were adopted, how they were applied, the difficulties in implementing these strategies, and differences between managerial and academic perceptions of hedging strategies. This will lead to the conclusion that the economics of hedge management are as important as the underlying risk aversion in determining hedging behavior. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The authors examine how plant-level dynamics contribute to aggregate productivity growth in the Turkish meat-processing industry. An aggregate productivity decomposition approach that utilizes plant-level longitudinal data is used to achieve this goal. Their results are consistent with the empirical literature in the sense that productivity enhancement within existing plants is the main source of aggregate productivity growth in this sector. However, their analysis generally suggests that plants that exit the meat-processing industry tend to be more productive than entering plants, especially in the posteconomic crisis period studied. Even though the latter insight is not consistent with the existing empirical literature, they show that these results tend to support R. Caballero and M. Hammour's (2000) contention that institutional factors such as industry structure (i.e., mature vs. infant industry) and economic crisis conditions (i.e., pre- vs. postcrisis periods) affect the nature of plant dynamics' contributions to aggregate productivity growth. Overall, the study's results reveal that industry-specific institutional factors must be taken into consideration when shaping policies aimed to improve and sustain aggregate productivity growth.

The authors' results show that reducing aggregate consumption by 6% to meet public health objectives with no increase in overall physical activity could reduce production of agricultural commodities and reduce net returns to producers by $3.5 billion. However, if consumption is reduced by 2% concomitantly with a marginal increase in physical activity, similar health outcomes could be achieved at much less cost ($1.3 billion). Conversely, continuing obesity trends may enhance returns to agricultural production by $1.3 billion annually. Changes in agricultural activities would likely be variable across the landscape. Results indicate that the largest potential changes in agricultural producer net returns (positive or negative) would occur in the Corn Belt and the Lake States. There, crop acreage could fall by as much as 650,000 hectares. [EconLit citations: Q130, Q180] © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Agribusiness 22: 491–503, 2006.",

On a global scale, increased output per unit of land is needed to meet growing world food demand. On a regional scale, investments in yield‐enhancing basic research need to result in improved yields for producers. In this research we set forth to quantify the impact of technology, precipitation, and temperature on soybean yields. Specifically, a disaggregated approach is used to model Illinois soybean yields across the nine state crop reporting districts. The results show that weather impacts are similar across the crop reporting districts; however, technology benefits accrue at statistically different rates across regions. The results provide no evidence that soybean yields in Illinois are plateauing [JEL Classifications: Q130, Q160, Q190].",

More precisely, the questions to be answered are, “What kind of vertical relationship exists between the manufacturers and the retailers?” “Does this relationship support the high price‐cost margins in the RTEC industry?” The results indicate that the RTEC manufacturers have the pricing decisions and that the retailers do not intervene in setting the retail prices for breakfast cereal brands. This is consistent with the vertical restraints theory that helps the manufacturers eliminate the externality created by the double marginalization scenario and an excessive demand contraction. “Vertical Relationships in the Ready‐to‐Eat Breakfast Cereal Industry in Boston” appeared in Volume 28, Number 3 (Summer 2012).",

Whole-farm, Monte Carlo simulations for Texas part-owner and tenant rice-soybean operations were completed over the period 1984 through 1988. Results indicate that extending additional credit to part-owner and tenant operators in a high debt position (over 50%) will allow continued operation, but continued operation significantly increases the likelihood of a loss of farm equity and loan losses to agricultural lenders. Deterioration in land values increases the need for a higher equity base.",

The primary objective of this study is to determine likely success/failure rates for Texas gin plants that would result from introducing air pollution controls. Simulation analysis is carried out with firm financial models. The analysis projects many of the small and mid-size gin plant firms that operate at relatively low volume levels to be financially unsuccessful ex ante investment in air pollution controls. As expected, the introduction of air pollution control lowers the likelihood of firm success, but, the unfavorable effect of these required investments is less pronounced among larger gin plant firms and plants that operate at high capacity levels. Results suggest the introduction of air pollution controls will accelerate the trend toward fewer and larger gin plant firms, and in order to survive, many Texas firms will find it necessary to merge/consolidate. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

This article analyzes the changes in international beef trade and, especially, in beef prices that are expected. We use a simulation model that captures the effects of market segmentation due to the FMD status and of the trade policies of exporting and importing countries. The ongoing realignment of trade flows has potential to significantly affect prices in both the FMD-free and the FMD-endemic segments of the world beef market. We demonstrate how growing beef exports from South America to FMD-free markets interact with other on-going changes in international beef markets. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Abstract This report analyzes the implications for exporters of the policy of gradual liberalization of beef importation that preceded the phasing out of state trader importation in the South Korean beef market. The process of beef trade liberalization involved successive increases in import quota, and the allocation of this, through a simultaneous buy‐sell system (SBS), to increasing numbers of licensed Korean importing firms, for several years prior to January 1, 2001. At that time, state trading was entirely replaced by private sector importation. During the period of policy adjustment of beef importation, licensed importing firms, known as “supergroups” (i.e., SBS firms), acted as designated SBS import beef traders for groups of end‐use businesses. The importation of beef is analyzed based on a model of the import behavior of the SBS firms for the period 1995 through 2000. The econometric model focuses on the source preferences of importers; the results suggest the importance of alliances of importers with various beef exporters. Model simulations suggest that with further import growth, the United States is likely to remain a major player in the Korean import beef market and that Australia may also gain from growth in this market.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines how domestic price discrimination between fluid and manufacturing milk influences dairy trade. Two types of dairy models are used for the study. The first one is a stylized mathematical model which is used to explore the relative trade effects of domestic price discrimination accompanied with revenue pooling mechanism versus border measures in dairy product markets. The second one is a partial equilibrium, multiple‐region model of dairy policy and trade, which is used to see the empirical implication of domestic price discrimination for six major dairy producers. The analytical results identify the trading status as the key to determine the relative trade effects. While domestic price discrimination is always less trade distorting than border measures in a net‐importer case, the relative trade distortiveness depends on the export volume in a net exporter case. The theoretical possibility that domestic price discrimination is more trade distorting than border measures is found when the ratio of dairy export to domestic manufacturing milk consumption is very high. The results also indicate that while the both support measures increase dairy export, domestic price discrimination may place greater economic burden on fluid milk consumers and less economic burden on tax payers than border measures. In addition, the results imply that domestic price discrimination schemes can be effective trade protective measures for Canada, Japan and the United States, where the schemes are currently being implemented. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study measures transaction costs of obtaining credit from Islamic banks. Data were collected from rural households in Iran. The factors affecting transaction costs and the probability of accessing Islamic financial markets are investigated. Similar to conventional financial institutions found in other developing countries, Iranian banks impose high transaction costs that limit poor rural household access to credit. The results reveal that the transaction costs of gaining credit are on average equivalent to an additional 13.8% annual interest cost. The contractual form, the size of credit, the borrower distance from a financial center, and the experience and education level of the borrower are important determinants of the transactions costs.

    "abstract": "Abstract A regime switching error correction model is applied to weekly shipping point and terminal market spinach prices in order to assess the spatial price transmission impact of the 2006 E. coli outbreak on the U.S. fresh spinach market. A food safety index (FSI) related to the outbreak is calculated and used as the regime switching mechanism for 11 alternative farm‐to‐wholesale spatially separated market pairs. Results suggest not all markets responded uniformly to the FSI. The majority of the markets with alternative sources of spinach exhibited nonlinearities, whereas those which were primarily supplied by California producers did not. In general, shorter adjustment speeds were seen in terminal markets that were closer in proximity to the California shipping point. Southern market pairs exhibiting threshold behavior saw increased efficiency after the outbreak (potentially due to increased self‐regulation), whereas the remaining pairs saw a loss in efficiency.

Because the crucial product x situation interaction effect is found to be significant, the study proceeds by using a regression procedure to characterize 18 competitive snack products (including six fruits) with respect to three situational factors that affect snack food choice. The results show that fruits tend to occupy the morning end of the morning/afternoon snacking continuum, the snacking alone end of the alone/with others continuum, and snacking at home end of the home/away from home continuum. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Thus, to establish how freight rates and other logistical costs of using ocean liner services are now determined, this study examines emerging methods of organization and contracting among exporters of food and forest products. We find that, although many shippers negotiate private contracts with carriers, many others utilize a third‐party agent to negotiate a rate with a carrier on their behalf. This article also identifies differences between two key types of third‐party agents. Finally, given that a shipper in this trade does not contract directly with a carrier, this article explains the shipper's conditional choice about which type of agent to use.

For example, unfavorable weather conditions deteriorate pasture quality and reduce pasture growth, forcing livestock producers to use high‐cost alternative feedstuffs, which consequently increases production costs. Extreme weather may also reduce overall animal performance, including decreased feed gain efficiency, and breeding performance. By exploiting seasonal weather changes and using 67 years of state‐level beef cow inventories, we estimate the impact of weather on cow‐calf production throughout 25 states in the United States. Results suggest that the U.S. cow‐calf industry is sensitive to changes in seasonal temperature. Results of an out‐of‐sample prediction using rolling window assessments prove that adding seasonal weather information to the forecasting model improves the prediction accuracy of state‐level beef cow inventories. Investigating the effects of seasonal temperature and precipitation on cow‐calf production will enhance the management and future production planning. [EconLit Citations: Q11].",

The experimental setting allows for a comparison of these three methods. The mixed logit models in WTP space for the choice data and the random‐effects Tobit model for the BDM data are used for the analyses. The results show that the individuals' WTP varies across elicitation methods. More specifically, the WTP of the RCE is lower than the WTP of the BDM experiment, and mixed results have been found while comparing the WTP of the RCE‐BDM experiment and WTP of the BDM experiment. Lastly, individuals are willing to pay a premium for health, environment‐friendly, and animal welfare attributes for all three elicitation methods: the health attribute's premium having the highest value followed by those of animal welfare and environment‐ friendliness. The results have not changed with information treatment indicating robustness of the findings. [EconLit Citations: C91, C35, D12].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Generic advertising is commonly used to market agricultural products by groups of producers to increase the overall demand. With the popularity of social media, a cheaper and convenient alternative platform has been created for generic advertising. Despite social media advertising gaining success in some areas, little is known about whether this success can be duplicated to agricultural products. Questions also remain about potential benefits to producers when multiple organizations conduct generic advertising for the same or similar products. This study investigates the own and spillover effect of duo‐regional generic advertising of two grower organizations' (Florida and California) social media on consumer preference for fresh produce with different origins. Overall, a significant increase in willingness‐to‐pay is found for the products being promoted by social media, indicating a strong own effect of duo‐regional generic advertising. A substantial spillover effect of generic advertising is also found for social media conducted by California and Florida on domestic and imported products, correspondingly. Mexico receives a free‐rider benefit from the generic advertising provided by Florida social media. The results shed light on the industries that try to promote food products using social media and inform policy decisions on how to utilize generic advertising better to expand the market.

The authors estimate the impact of three inputs in a food processing plant on the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes contaminated finished cold smoked salmon. These three inputs were noncontamination of the raw fish fillets, noncontamination of the plant environment, and rate of glove changes on workers. We then estimate the minimum cost levels of these inputs to reach various levels of noncontamination of the finished product, tracing out a cost curve. Marginal cost is then equated to potential marginal benefits from reductions in L. monocytogenes contamination. Results show how socially suboptimal use of inputs may result because the costs of these inputs are borne by the food processing plant, which may not be able to secure a high enough product price.

Globalization of agribusiness is “leveling the agricultural playing field”. Global demand shifts favor Australian agribusiness. Current improvement in Australia's position comes from urbanization of Asia and the restructuring of the Soviet food system. The challenges for Australia's agribusiness are great, but most can be converted into opportunities.",

Low-quality alfalfa may provide an effective substitute. The purpose of this research is to identify the characteristics consumers want in a horticultural organic material, to determine the cost competitiveness of an alfalfa-based substitute, and to determine the product's market potential. Results suggest that most consumers would accept alfalfa as a substitute. Production cost estimates range from $111.10 to $162.71 per short ton, depending on the quality of the raw material used. Due to lower transportation costs, the wholesale and retail prices of this new product are estimated to be about 30% lower than sphagnum peat.",

The amount of information and perceived risk varies between marketing channels and an agent's attitude to this risk influences their choice of marketing channel. For risk-averse sellers, expected price and the associated price risk (dispersion) are relevant to their choice of marketing route. This paper examines how the choice of marketing channel by farmers selling finished cattle is influenced by their perceptions of expected market price and price variation. The study uses a unique dataset of \"matched\" animals, sold first in liveweight auction markets in Northern Ireland and subsequently to a meat packer. The findings indicate that price skewness also influences channel choice. The positive skewness exhibited by auction market prices combined with the negative skewness exhibited by meat packer prices may mean that some risk-averse individuals, faced with incomplete information about product quality, prefer the liveweight auction market to selling directly to meat packers [JEL Codes: Q110]. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

In particular, a formula commonly used to measure returns to export promotion does not reflect price enhancement and therefore is problematic. An additional problem is that marginal returns, the usual measure provided in the literature, are often confused with average returns. This article discusses these issues in some detail using as an example salmon promotion in France and Germany. Study results suggest that promotion elasticity-based measures of returns can be misleading, especially in instances where producers or consumers are sensitive to price.

The model links individual consumer characteristics (e.g., income, knowledge about nutrition, nutrition label use) to underlying product characteristics (e.g., price, nutritional attributes) and allows us to obtain preference parameters for each consumer as well as demand elasticities with regard to product characteristics for each product considered. We find that prices, advertising, price reductions, and consumer preferences for taste have a significant effect on the demand for prepared frozen meals whereas concerns and knowledge about nutrition and health do not. Using the estimated demand parameters we then evaluate price competition in the industry and the impact of the new mandatory labeling policy. The results show that collusive pricing behavior by manufacturers is not supported by our data and that the 30% margins in the industry are due to the exercise of unilateral market power and differentiation strategies. The results also show that consumer preferences and purchasing patterns within prepared frozen meals category did not change significantly after the implementation of mandatory nutrition labeling.

    "abstract": "Abstract As demand for food away from home increases, outbreaks at restaurants become an important source of food‐related illness. In the United States, over 60% of foodborne illness outbreaks occur at restaurants and 97% of outbreaks are limited to a single state. Despite this, we currently know little about restaurant outbreaks and in particular, single‐state outbreaks are not well understood. We use Chipotle Mexican Grill's eight outbreaks (2015–2018) to evaluate the media and stock market responses to both single and multistate outbreaks. Using news and stock market data, we provide evidence that multistate outbreaks brought swift stock price declines and single‐state outbreaks' impact depended on their timing, rather than their severity. Before Chipotle's more well‐known, multistate outbreaks, the firm's single‐state outbreaks brought little reporting and no financial losses, whereas after the multistate food safety events, single‐state events resulted in national media coverage and large financial impacts. Our findings are consistent with the literature on food scares that can result in chronic low‐level anxiety, which can bring about a large resurgence of concern for smaller outbreaks. The lessons learned from Chipotle's case underscore the importance of investment in outbreak prevention. [G14 (Information and Market Efficiency, Event Studies, Insider Trading)].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Encouraging the food industry to reformulate their products is a possible public intervention to improve diet quality. In this paper, we assess the impact of food reformulation on per capita salt and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) intake, in France, for four product categories, namely, potato chips, fresh pizzas, frozen pizzas, and frozen meals, taking into account the changes in products' nutritional quality and consumer choices. Nutrient intake is calculated by matching data on food purchases and nutritional data, collected at the same date. An algorithm is run to disentangle the specific effect of food reformulation. We find that food reformulation, which is based on voluntary individual firm choices or voluntary industry‐wide agreement in our case studies, contributes to decrease SFAs and salt intake in seven out of eight cases. However, the magnitude of the impact is moderate, except in the case of potato chips for which a much stronger impact is observed. Product renewal has an ambiguous effect, depending on the nutrient considered. By contrast, changes in consumer behavior increase the intake of SFAs and salt in all cases. Finally, food reformulation generally benefits all consumers equally, regardless of income or age. For food categories with consumption disparities, product reformulation can reduce heterogeneity in nutrient intake across socioeconomic groups, provided that recipes are greatly and widely improved [EconLit Citations: D12, D22, I1].",

    "abstract": "Abstract We derive price premiums for patented or trademarked apple varieties, also known as “club apples,” compared to open‐variety apples. We use an expansive retail scanner dataset, along with unique data on apple taste characteristics, to estimate monthly club apple premiums for 2008–2018. We find that club apple premiums are around 29% and have consistently decreased from 35% in 2008 to 22% in 2018. Positive club apple premiums relate to consumers' preferences for juicier, more acidic, and sweeter apples. We do not find evidence that consumers place value on the exclusivity of purchasing more expensive and limited varieties. Hence club premiums exist in the market by meeting the demand of consumer segments for apples with distinct taste attributes rather than replacing the demand of traditional consumers who prefer open varieties. We use a vector error correction framework to find short‐run and long‐run determinants of club apple premiums. In the short run, the sales of club varieties may positively associate with the sales of open varieties, given the premium and cost factors. However, in the long run, there is a negative cointegrated relationship between club apple sales, open apple sales, and club apple premiums; and an increase in club apple sales is adversely related to the open apple sales and club premiums. The high initial premiums of protected club varieties have provided incentives for the development of uniquely differentiated apple varieties, while in the long term as production expands, premiums decrease making club varieties less expensive for consumers [EconLit Citations: L66, Q11].",

This study investigates the factors influencing the catering service providers (CSPs) procurement of domestically produced or imported food materials. The empirical results showed that the procurement cost, quality, safety, and availability of ingredients were the major considerations for CSPs to purchase ingredients. Different types of CSPs had different cognitions, attitudes, and purchasing behaviors toward domestically produced and imported ingredients. Bento establishments, self‐service cafeterias, and noodle shops adopted higher proportions of domestically produced ingredients (DPIs), and they also had more confidence in these ingredients. On the contrary, table service restaurants, all‐you‐can‐eat restaurants, breakfast eateries, coffee shops, and fast food restaurants adopted higher proportions of imported ingredients. The results may be related to the food items purchased and catering services provided by different CSPs. Therefore, CSPs should be included in the scope and promotion of food and agriculture education so as to increase their emphasis on ingredients for health, increase their tendency to purchase DPIs, promote the disclosure of information on food producers and ingredients, and enhance the communications among food producers, buyers, CSPs, and dining‐out consumers.",

In this study, we propose and estimate a count data model. The number of times an adult consumes 100% orange or 100% grapefruit juice over a 2‐day period is modeled as a function of income, product prices, and some characteristics of the consumer such as level of education, being on a diet, and taking nutrient supplements that proxy for health concerns and nutrition knowledge. Data used in the study were collected between January 2005 and March 2020 on over 30,000 adult consumers. Tests for overdispersion favor a negative binomial model instead of the more restrictive Poison regression model. Estimation results confirm that rising juice product prices and concern over product healthfulness have been contributing to long run trends in orange and grapefruit juice consumption. Prices for these citrus juices have increased in recent years due in part to the citrus greening disease and hazardous weather in Florida. Trends in orange and grapefruit juice consumption can impact consumer diet quality, fruit growers, and agribusiness firms responsible for transforming raw fruit into juice and juice products.

    "abstract": "Abstract Eco‐labels inform consumers about the sustainable attributes of a product, but consumer face challenges to differentiate and select for specific attributes. Certification programs are similarly challenged to incentivize adoption of sustainable practices in product supply chains when consumer ability to differentiate sustainable attributes is low. This study investigates consumers' Willingness to Pay (WTP) for different environmental attributes of coffee production, and whether attributes that conserve biodiversity and limit agrochemical usage are substitutes or complements. We designed and implemented a hypothetical coffee choice experiment combining coffee farm vegetation management attributes that impact biodiversity (conventional monoculture, shade‐grown, or “Bird Friendly” systems that conserve wildlife habitat) and chemical input (conventional, pesticide‐free, or organic) attributes. We found that consumers think of biodiversity and agrochemical management attributes as sustainability substitutes and have the highest WTP for pesticide‐free and organic attributes. Consumer groups with strong concern about the future of the environment had high WTP for all environmental attributes, but still considered the attributes to be substitutes. Our results suggest that eco‐label programs with biodiversity and agrochemical attributes, such as the Smithsonian Bird Friendly® coffee certification, could increase market participation by simplifying environmental sustainability messaging, simplifying farm‐level certification requirements, and targeting environmentally concerned consumers.

Using the Farm Accountancy Data Network panel data for Italian dairy farms in the period 2008–2018, the present study investigates the relationship between foreign workforce and farm– technical efficiency, considering the workers' country of origin. We rely on different peer‐network theories, and using a stochastic frontier analysis accounting for the endogeneity of immigrant labor force. Results point to the general positive contribution of immigrants on Italian farms' efficiency, while unpaid family labor exerts a null‐to‐negative influence. We detected an important effect of peer‐working, namely complementary task specialization and conformity behavior, with diverse groups of workers associated to different efficiency levels. The evidence of the positive correlation between immigrants and the efficiency of the agricultural sector has significant implications for the design of immigration policies and the access to domestic agri‐food markets, especially for those sectors in higher labor demand, as well as speeding up the process of economic and social integration of the labor force.

Spain is the second rice producer in the European Union (EU), geographically located in four autonomous communities contributing to the local economy. This study aims at assessing the productive efficiency of rice farms in this country. To our knowledge, no previous work has dealt with the performance of rice framers in the EU in general and in Spain in particular. We used the Generalized True Ramdom‐effects model to estimate the persistent and transient efficiency levels of farms and identifying the production risk factors using a sample of 158 rice farms over the period 2014–2017. Empirical findings reveal an overall efficiency level of 0.81 on average, mainly explained by the long‐term efficiency component. Moreover, results show an important room for efficiency improvement at the short‐term to enhance productive management skills of farmers. Finally, labor, fertilizer, water and insurance spending are likely to be risk‐decreasing factors. [EconLit Citations: C13, D22, Q12].",

Applying difference‐in‐differences to panel data of ground coffee products from Amazon's marketplace in the United States and Canada, we find that Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees were reduced by $0.27–$0.29 per product in the United States due to the FTC's monopolist allegation. We also find that the allegation led to price reductions of $0.79–$0.92 per product in the country. Since 42% of the 7.5 billion products sold on Amazon United States in 2023 were by FBA sellers, we estimate that the allegation led to an annual savings of $0.85 billion to $0.91 billion for the FBA sellers and $5.92 billion to $6.85 billion for Amazon's customers on average. These results suggest that the FTC's allegation had sizeable and positive welfare impacts on Amazon's third‐party sellers and customers, making it a significant win for the regulatory agency. Moreover, our study provides insights into the implications of the FTC allegation for agribusiness stakeholders and the future of grocery shopping.",

Sudden price changes can disrupt income predictions, making it difficult to plan and access financing. This affects not only the farming community but also rural economies and livelihood of people involved in agriculture. The present study focused on important aspect of agricultural economic stability, that is, modeling and prediction of food price volatility. Volatility models, namely, the Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) model, Glosten, Jagannatan, Runkle‐GARCH (GJR‐GARCH) model, exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) model and multiplicative error model (MEM), have been explored. In recent time, as the data becomes more complex and varied, it is difficult to fully understand price fluctuations with just one model. To tackle this, a novel approach called the Particle swarm optimization‐based weighted ensemble volatility model (P‐WEV) has been developed by combining predictions from four different models. To investigate the supremacy of the proposed model, data from 19 agricultural commodities, including cereals, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, and spices, from various markets of India have been used. Interestingly, it has been found that the proposed model outperformed the other benchmark models. Moreover, an R package “PWEV” has also been developed for the implementation of the proposed model.",

We compared farmers' technical efficiency (TE) and production performance across different contract farming arrangements: individual contracts, cooperative contracts, and growers without a contract. Using a random sample of 186 farmers in Davao del Norte, Philippines, we used meta‐frontier Data Envelopment Analysis to calculate TE scores and then use a truncated regression with bootstrapping to model the efficiency sources. We applied propensity score matching to minimize observable bias resulting from self‐selection among farmers participating in contract farming. The results across returns‐to‐scale assumptions and matching methods reveal that cooperative contract farmers have significantly higher TE and revenue performance than individual and noncontract farmers, primarily due to high export‐quality production and associated premium prices. Individual contract farmers were also more technically efficient and had higher returns than noncontract farmers. Smallholder farmers tend to participate more in cooperative contract farming. Thus, cooperative contracts should include smallholder farmers in export value chains to improve smallholder farmer income. This strategy will lead to the formation of inclusive agrifood value chains in Mindanao, Philippines.",

This paper analyzes Indian honey export under different indices, including the revealed comparative advantage (RCA), revealed symmetric comparative advantage (RSCA), comparative export performance (CEP), trade balance index (TBI), and Grubel–Lloyd index (GLI). A detailed analysis reveals significant export growth, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.72% over the past decade, driven primarily by the US market, which accounted for 80% of India's honey exports in 2022. However, high export instability was noted in the US market, while GCC and SAARC countries exhibited more stable demand. The research also assesses market loyalty using Markov chain analysis, highlighting the US as the most stable export destination. Structural changes in India's honey export markets were identified, with the Gulf countries and Africa emerging as key markets following the European Union's 2010 ban on Indian honey. Despite competitive pressure from major honey‐exporting nations like New Zealand and Argentina, India's strong comparative advantage and specialized export focus position it favorably in the global market. The paper tries to highlight the need for strategic diversification of export markets and expansion of honey production to sustain India's growth in the honey export sector.",

The methodological framework is based on the estimation of a two‐regime threshold vector autoregressive model (TVAR) of price levels in which the Private Label price has been considered as the threshold variable. The results suggest that the price responses of manufacturer brands to private label price reductions are much larger than the inverse responses. The price of the private label reacts only weakly to price reductions in manufacturer brands. These responses decrease in strength as the market share of the Private Label increases within the retailer.",

Influential factors included age of the business, size (as measured by gross sales), location, market channel use, ownership structure, and perspective on competitive situation. Using a tobit estimation procedure, profiles of nursery firms more likely to use a particular transaction method were developed. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Malting barley prices respond to restore equilibrium relationships with corresponding feed barley prices in the long run, but not vice versa.

A Brill linear programming model was used to calculate least‐cost feed rations for broilers, layers, tom turkeys, 8–13 pound pigs and finisher hogs. This analysis indicates that likely price reductions in traditional feed ingredients will drive most of the current genetic modifications of corn out of the feed markets. Alternative methods of making genetically modified corns more competitive in the marketplace include stacking modifications to increase the gross value per bushel and lowering the costs of modified corn by reducing yield drag and seed costs.

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper uses a choice experiment with 661 respondents in two large cities in Zambia to evaluate urban consumers’ preferences for nutrient‐fortified wheat cookies. Our results indicate that both nutrient fortification and marketing messaging tied to taste, health and energy are important attributes for discretionary food selection among urban consumers in Zambia. Using a latent class model, we identify two types of consumers: price sensitive consumers strongly interested in nutrient fortification, who respond to different types of marketing messages and are unlikely to select the opt out option; and a smaller (24%) proportion of consumers who would rather not buy cookies at all, but exhibit strong demand for nutrient fortification, and are to some extent influenced by marketing messages that highlight the taste characteristics of the product. This suggests that while demand for fortified discretionary items is high among a significant proportion of the population promoting such foods on their health or energy characteristics might be counterproductive to some consumers, potentially due to health fortification stigma previously identified in the field. Taste messaging is identified as the most effective marketing appeal across our participants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The South Korean government's reversal of a ban on American beef imports in 2008 caused enormous political and social upheaval in the country. The government's acquiescence to the United States' request to resume imports of boned beef and beef from cattle slaughtered over the age of 30 months led to overwhelming negative publicity, as mass media described the decision as yielding to U.S. pressure at the expense of public health. Koreans gathered to demonstrate against the agreement; the resulting “candlelight protest” quickly intensified, spreading across the country from May 2008 through August 2008. Given the different opinions regarding the main causes of the event, this study revisits the issue by empirically testing for switches in meat demand for different types of meat among South Korean consumers. The results indicate that there was no structural change in meat demand around the candlelight protest period, which suggests that variations in meat demand during that period can be explained by changes in relative prices between different types of meat. This implies that unlike the findings of previous studies, the negative consumer reaction was not associated with risk‐averse behavior concerning the consumption of U.S. beef.

This study examines US consumer choice for labeled and unlabeled products across meat animal species in which differing regulations exist by species regarding hormone use in production and where consumer perception of hormone use by species varies.

However, this required information is often obscured on retail labels. Results from expected utility models indicate that after consumers receive information regarding regulations and actual hormone use across species, the difference in utility and in willingness to pay for products labeled “produced with no added hormones” versus unlabeled product is lower for products where hormone use is restricted by federal regulations [EconLit Citations: Q13, D12, Q18].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agrifood traceability of farms is extremely difficult owing to the small scale and dispersibility of farms. Fortunately, wholesale markets play an irreplaceable role in agrifood systems and in upstream traceability in many developing countries. This study first explores the mechanism of food safety liabilities related to the adoption of upstream traceability to farms. Then, the effects of public regulation by the government and private regulation by the market platform on wholesale vendors' adoption of traceability are investigated empirically. A unique panel dataset comprising 9287 food safety tests for 396 vendors from a wholesale market is used in the empirical analysis. The results show that vendors behave opportunistically by lowering their level of traceability when they expect a smaller possibility of being sampled. Given the same strength of regulation intensity, the effect of government regulation is larger than that of the market. The experience of failure in recent sampling tests motivates vendors to adopt higher levels of traceability. Recommendations regarding the frequency of food safety sampling tests conducted by the government and wholesale markets are proposed [EconLit Citations: Q18, L53].",

First, do consumers make the omni‐channel purchase decision of infant milk powder via social network? Second, which social network do consumers prefer about the different buying channel? To solve these problems, employing the Berry–Levinson–Pakes and distance‐metric models, we explore the impact of social network modes on the consumers' OPBs based on the home‐scan consumption data. These analyses provide compelling evidence for the positive impact of social network on consumers' OPBs. In particular, recommendation from friends accounts for 90.57% of the contribution to the increase in the online consumers' utility, whereas the voice from relative explains about 50% of the contribution to the offline consumers' utility, which is positively associated with consumer income. The regression results also demonstrate that (i) consumer trust has a significant moderating role in the consumers' OPBs and (ii) consumer trust has a larger moderating role in the consumers' OPBs relative to single‐channel purchasing behavior. We expect that this paper can contribute to the existing literature and provide marketers with important practical suggestions [EconLit Citations: Q11, Q13].",

We focus on the beverage market in the United States as a case study because of the emerging health demand for “better‐for‐you” beverage options. We formulate a random coefficient discrete choice model to evaluate consumer preference for reformulated products in the nonalcoholic beverages market. We find that new ingredients that provide functionality such as energy ingredients, carbonation, or no artificial flavors have a significant positive impact on consumer choices. Further, the use of health claims can significantly increase consumer demand for beverages. Results from simulations suggest that the use of “no/low sugar,” “no/low sodium,” and “no artificial sweetener” health claims will increase the net sugar and sodium intakes from sugar‐sweetened beverages, leading to an increase in body mass index and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes. The nutrient reformulation by cutting sugar and sodium content by 10%, on the other hand, will result in a decrease in sugar and sodium consumption, and further lower the incidence of CHD and stroke. However, the policy aimed at lowering the intake of one single nutrient may have an unintended spillover effect on other nutrient intakes, and policymakers should take a comprehensive approach and consider the broader nutrient impact of any policy aimed at reducing a specific nutrient.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Countries rich in natural resources are typically major exporters of commodities worldwide. Specialization in such goods may create incentives for certain groups to hinder a country's institutional development. Therefore, in this article, we investigate the causal relationship between commodity exports and the institutional quality of 49 countries from 1997 to 2022. Given that commodity exports can both influence and be influenced by institutional quality, it is crucial to search for exogenous natural variations in commodity exports in combination with econometric modeling strategies. To address the endogeneity problem, we use a natural experiment—China's accession to the World Trade Organization—to establish a causal link between agricultural exports and institutional quality free from bias. Our results highlight that increased reliance on commodity exports is linked to detrimental effects on a country's institutions. It diminishes citizen participation, increases the risk of political violence, lowers public service quality, hampers private sector development, erodes trust in societal rules, and amplifies corruption. The findings confirm the negative relationship between commodity exports and institutional development. They also contribute to the resource‐curse debate by showing that agricultural exporters with abundant natural resources negatively impact institutions. Additionally, a causal relationship is established, demonstrating that focusing on commodity exports reduces institutional effectiveness, with the study's quality enhanced by using various commodity product bundles and alternating institutional quality measures.

    "abstract": "Abstract Starting in the early 2000s, a boom in demand for agricultural commodities displaced cattle ranching out of the most productive areas of the Pampas' prairie. The crossbreeds between Angus and Hereford with Brahman, that is, Brangus and Braford, have been successfully adopted across Argentina. However, little is known about the specific bulls' traits that drive the demand for genetic selection of cattle outside the Pampas. Obtaining the economic value of traits would help to identify the demand for adapting livestock production to different ecosystems while preserving the meat quality of Angus and Hereford cattle. We estimated hedonic price models using Brangus bull sales data from two cattle breeding ranches in the north of Cordoba province. We find that cattle ranchers prefer observed traits such as weight, coat color, and age, while genetic indicators such as Expected Progeny Differences (EPDs) have secondary importance. We argue that stronger preferences for red‐coated bulls, as opposed to black‐coated bulls, could be associated with the demand for reducing heat stress. In addition, the relatively weak association between EPDs and prices may be related to unobservable variables such as ranchers' characteristics, and that the value of genetics is implicit in the studs' reputation.

    "abstract": "Abstract Globally, livestock grazing is a major land occupier and is often criticized for its environmental impact. To address these concerns, enhancing livestock productivity is crucial to mitigate these impacts, boost farm competitiveness, and increase food production. The understanding of production variability is key to this endeavor. This paper assesses the technical efficiency of cow‐calf beef production units in Uruguay, excluding dairy and feedlot operations. Using data from the 2016 National Livestock Survey and Wang's frontier model, we estimate a translog stochastic production frontier, incorporating bovine livestock units, land area, and equivalent working units as key inputs. This model also controls soil productivity, improved grazing areas, productive orientation (beef‐cattle systems or beef cattle‐ovine mixed systems), beef production system (cow‐calf, full cycle, and fattening operation), access to electric power, and agroecological regions. Furthermore, it explores factors affecting technical inefficiency, such as ownership (individual, corporate without contract, and corporate with contract) and land tenure types (owner, tenant, or other types), besides the presence of third‐party owned cattle, technical assistance (including veterinarian and agronomic), and specific beef cattle technologies (such as continuous bull presence, artificial insemination, ovarian activity diagnosis, pregnancy diagnosis, use of scales for classifying females, temporary and early weaning, and cows and heifers grazing together). Findings indicate an average technical efficiency of 71.3%. Notably, factors such as agronomic and veterinary assistance, artificial insemination, weaning practices, third‐party‐owned cattle presence, pregnancy diagnosis, land tenure, and ownership type significantly impact technical efficiency. Our findings suggest that within the specific segment of cow‐calf operations in Uruguay, there is a potential to enhance beef production by 40.2% through improvements in farm management.

More importantly, it emphasizes that the effects of alliance portfolio diversity (APD) on radical innovation performance can be achieved not only directly, but also via moderating roles, that is, the firm's social capital and the level of competitiveness of the country. Using three waves of the European Community Innovation Survey, our results show that the optimal level of APD varied depending on the industry in which the company operates (food manufacturing industry vs. the rest of manufacturing industries). Furthermore, social capital seems to be a crucial factor to mitigate the difficulties of leveraging very diverse knowledge from partners, especially in the food manufacturing industry. Moreover, the external environmental context where the firm is operating, measured as the growth competitive index that reflects the competitive level of the country, was shown to have an influence on the firms' innovative efforts.[EconLit Citations: M10, 013, 036].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Interest in the use of behavioral policy approaches, such as nudges, has strongly increased over the past years, including in the domains of food, agricultural and environmental policies. While the approval of nudges among the general public has been studied extensively, we know little about the attitude of farmers toward nudging. Farmers may (perceive to) be affected directly by food and agriculture nudges, which may result in different approval as compared to citizens. Moreover, given the increased interest in the use of nudges targeting farm behavior, it is relevant to know their attitude toward these policies. In an online survey, 342 Swedish farmers indicated their approval or disapproval of the same nudging policies that have been investigated in earlier studies with citizens. We find that, overall and over all areas covered, farmers have remarkably lower approval rates of nudging policies than the general public. While this may be partially explained by their socioeconomic profiles, also the connection of some nudges with farming activities may explain their different opinion. We find that farmers with a “green” orientation are generally more favorable, especially so for “green” nudges. [EconLit Citations: Q18, D03].",

    "abstract": "Abstract Milk is one of the few agricultural products in which Brazil is not competitive. The domestic market is served by domestic production and imports from Argentina and Uruguay. The Mercosur–European Union Biregional Association Agreement provides for the elimination of tariffs and the harmonization of nontariff measures between the parties. Because the EU is one of the most competitive regions in the world market for powdered milk, this study analyzes the effects of the agreement on the links in this production chain in the Brazilian market. A constant, nested, multisectoral, and vertically integrated elasticity of substitution model is structured incorporating uncertainty in the estimates of Armington elasticities through Monte Carlo simulations, as in Hallren and Opanasets. The model allows projecting the price effect (Armington) and the preference effect in the market shares of Brazil, Mercosur, and the EU on the domestic market. The results, in the most ambitious scenario of the agreement and in the most conservative estimate, show that Brazil would lose 71.7 percentage points in the domestic market. This means reducing Brazilian production by 475 thousand tons of powdered milk. The national agricultural link in this scenario would lose 15% of the current dairy demand. This loss benefits the EU, which would participate in the domestic market with a market share of 58.75%. Mercosur would add 13.41 percentage points to its current share of the Brazilian market [EconLit Citations: F13, F14].",

This study explores the relationship between U.S. corn and soybean prices and Federal Reserve monetary policy interventions, in the short and long run. We use a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model to capture three key features of agricultural commodity price responses to changes in interest rates. First, we observe that corn and soybean prices initially overreact to changes in interest rates, overshooting their long‐run equilibrium before gradually reverting. Second, in the short run, the relationship between soybean prices and interest rates is asymmetric; the initial price change is more pronounced for an interest rate increase than for a decrease of the same magnitude. Lastly, both corn and soybean prices display symmetry in the long run. These results help to understand how changes in interest rates affect commodity prices. Assessing the relationship between agricultural commodity prices and interest rates can assist farmers and processors in planning investments and loans based on interest rate forecasts.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Unhealthy diets have become a leading contributor to death and disability globally. The current Chinese diet falls short of a healthy diet, including too much meat, oil, salt, and sugar while having insufficient levels of whole grains, fruits, nuts, and milk. Transforming Chinese dietary patterns has become urgent. This paper compares the effectiveness of information framing effects on enhancing Chinese consumers' healthy diet choices, varied by information content, source, and presentation. The survey is conducted across six Chinese cities, with a sample of 3150 urban consumers. Chinese consumers' healthy diet choices are measured using an online discrete choice experiment. Four different diet patterns were used to label each of the product alternatives in the experiment, which varied in taste and cost. Results reveal that compared to positive information; negatively framed healthy information is more effective in increasing Chinese consumers' valuations for healthy diets. Consumer valuation of a healthy whole diet is significantly enhanced when the information is from social celebrities, compared to information from a scientific source. Moreover, when health information is disclosed via social media, its effectiveness in promoting healthy diet choices is significantly reduced. Our findings have implications for designing and implementing nutrition policies and programs in China and other developing countries.",

Based on China's unique food culture and food system, this study describes the Chinese food value system and designs a best−worst scaling survey with 2165 Chinese respondents to explore Chinese consumers' food value structure. Results show that Chinese consumers have similar preferences for food values with Western consumers, who all rank safety, nutrition, and taste as the important food values and rank origin and appearance as the least important. Interestingly, Chinese consumers consider price to be a less important value but place more value on food safety and nutrition. They also have a relatively high share of preference for medicine diet and antipoverty food value, implying a unique food system. This study also shows a significant heterogeneity in Chinese consumers' preferences for food values. Food values are significantly related to some particular food consumption, indicating that the distribution and changing of food values in the population can help identify the transformation of food systems.",

    "abstract": "Adapting to change is critical to surviving in agribusiness. Adaptive strategic plan development depends on the use of meaningful information from the external business environment. We propose the ratio of livestock (including poultry) to crop farm receipts (L/C) as an environmental scanning indicator. The spatial patterns of this ratio within three states, Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania over the last 50 years illustrate the directions and magnitudes of change in this indicator. The L/C for Iowa decreased from 2.1 to 1.2 but increased in both North Carolina and Pennsylvania from 0.2 to 1.6 and 3.6 to 8.4, respectively. Change was not uniformly distributed in any of the three states as some areas changed more than others. Because changes in production emphasis are often associated with changes in ecological or community issues, policies emerge to address these new circumstances. Agribusiness should be aware of the trajectory of change and associated policy actions in their immediate area, their state and nationally, because these dynamics can have significant implications for their strategic management opportunities. Progressive businesses, commodity groups, or other interest groups could scan changes in L/C and use the information as an environmental indicator for effective strategic management or distribute it for use in managing change. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The conclusion is drawn that user surveys can provide reasonable projections, but the following factors require consideration. The sigmoid curve fits the data well, but the standard experiential learning justification needs reconsideration. Attitudinal variables can enhance the discrimination among users and nonusers, but useful attitudinal questions are not well developed at this point. Rents are a major determinant of use, but projecting rents and shares a priori is a difficult task. Management requirements are a significant factor in use, so that proxies for management quality need improvement. And finally, anti-biotech attitudes can be most effective if products are labeled so that labeling becomes a key element in forecasting use.

    "abstract": "Abstract High oil corn (HOC) is a genetically enhanced variety of corn that is gaining popularity as a commercial feed ingredient. HOC has an enlarged germ and contains higher levels of crude oil, protein, and amino acids than conventional corn. To capture the increased feed benefits of HOC, it must remain identity preserved. In addition to identity preservation costs, HOC typically has lower yields and higher seed costs. The purpose of this study is to examine the added value of two types of HOC in commercial poultry and swine rations in Taiwan. A linear programming model is used to estimate the value of the two HOC in least cost feed rations. Additional handling, transport, yield drag, and seed costs are subtracted from the estimated added values of HOC in the rations to estimate the profitability of importing HOC corn into Taiwan. The results suggest some alternatives for increasing U.S. exports of HOC. [Econ‐Lit citations: Q17]. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Finding more efficient ways of achieving environmental goals has been a long-standing subject for environmental economists. Emissions trading systems (ETS) have moved from the textbook to become an important tool in the box of policy instruments for addressing a number of environmental problems. In this book, Henriquez makes a case that ETS have the flexibility to address a complex environmental problem and to facilitate agreement among key political stakeholders, more so than traditional regulatory policy approaches. The book reviews, in commendable detail, air emissions trading policy diffusion across different institutional environments, and uses the lessons to outline how a global trading program could be established to address man-made climate change. This is first and foremost an environmental policy history book. The chapters describe the historical evolution of ETS for managing air quality issues such as acid rain, ozone and greenhouse gases. In the emissions trading literature, applying ETS to air quality issues is often portrayed as “easy” because of simpler pollutant pathways. The author demonstrates that this is not necessarily true, but not because of economic or physical factors. Henriquez clearly presents the challenges of applying a text-book ETS program to the real world once the realities of gaining political support, bureaucratic factors, the media, and technological issues set in. The Introduction lays out the thesis of the book; that a transition to a low-carbon economy is essential for making the globe inhabitable for future generations. A hypothesis of the book is that policy makers can design more effective policies by learning the lessons of past ETS policies, including the impacts of design features, interactions of social and institutional factors, and transferability from one context to another. The second chapter presents a review of theoretical principles behind the emissions trading model. Part of the chapter presents the standard economic case for emissions trading. The most important part of the chapter, however, is the initial discussion of the institutional perspectives for emissions permit trading systems. The chapter also introduces the comparative criteria that will be used throughout the rest of the book, including market transaction efficiency, administrative efficiency, equity, political feasibility, and certainty of satisficing. One of the important points of the book is that effective trading programs require strong market infrastructure development and clearly defined commodities. The third chapter presents a template for developing the key institutional features for a successful emissions trading program. The author ties the development of trading to the development of efficient commodity markets. The four “essential” stages covered include defining the commodity, establishing an organized spot market, establishing a futures market, and establishing an options market. The first stage is commonly addressed in articles about trading, but the other three are rarely mentioned as being important in an emissions trading system. The fourth chapter provides a detailed examination of the initial, abortive attempt to develop market-based systems for air pollution control in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s. The chapter does an excellent job of tracing the history of these efforts, linking failure to the violation of basic market development conditions, and the role that non-market factors such as politics played. The fifth chapter analyzes the development and implementation of the successful Acid Rain Program. This is the program that is most often held up as the best example of a successful ETS. The author presents a very detailed history of the program, including concessions made to get the program through Congress, legal challenges, and how the program adapted to a changing legal, political, and technological landscape. The importance of advances in technology and information management systems is also highlighted. The sixth and seventh chapters move from the national scale to more local policies and analyze the development and implementation of intra-state (California's RECLAIM program for NOx) and inter-state (control of ozone in the Northeast) programs. In particular, the ozone example highlights the interplay of different political jurisdictions that have different goals and face different economic and environmental impacts. The lessons from this example have particular importance for a cap-and-trade program that spans the globe. The eighth chapter examines the challenges of extrapolating environmental trading mechanisms to a global scale to specifically address greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions. The premise for the book is that some type of international policy is needed to address the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and the lessons from the previous chapters, as well as experiences of international GHG efforts such as the Montreal Protocols, Kyoto Protocols, and EU ETS, and the interstate Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative of the U.S. are used to outline how this could happen. An important point made over and over again is that trading policies do not take place in a vacuum, and that policies need to be able to adjust to changing political environments. This requires astute management as well as a solid economic foundation. Several final observations are worth mentioning. It is curious that the author does not mention the voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) in the U.S. The CCX contained some design features, such as verification, a registry, and a role for integrators that are consistent with the lessons of the book. The CCX also responded predictably to market forces. The author also does not mention any of the attempts to apply ETS to water quality. The air related examples are sufficient to make the author's points, but the difficulties in making water quality trading programs work, often arising because of design mistakes, lend support to the applicability of the author's arguments to emissions trading systems more broadly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The beer industry in the United States is in a period of dramatic transformation. Major breweries are acquiring much smaller craft breweries in an attempt to purchase growth, but it is not clear whether these acquisitions are economically viable. In this paper, we study the impact of craft brewery acquisitions on retail beer prices, and firm profitability in a dynamic, Markov‐perfect equilibrium pricing framework. We find that the estimated impact of mergers, or buyouts, is critically dependent upon estimates of the extent of state‐dependence in demand and is, in fact, negatively correlated with the initial shock to demand. That is, if the demand shock is positive, the effect of a buyout will be under‐estimated by not accounting for state‐dependence in demand, while it is over‐estimated if the demand shock is negative. This finding is intuitive as the static model will not properly account for the long‐term positive effects of a demand shock that is initially positive, or the long‐term negative effects that are initially negative. Ultimately, we show that not all the craft‐beer buyouts in 2015 made economic sense from the acquirer's perspective. [EconLit Citations: D43, L13, M31].",

This article investigates the effect of the gendered composition of the agricultural wage labor force on horticultural farms. We draw on an original data set collected in 2010, comprising 240 agricultural holdings located in the region of Souss Massa. The results suggest that local labor shortages do not play a major role in explaining the ratio of female hired wage laborers. Instead, it seems that quality requirements are encouraging farm holdings to hire a female labor force. [EconLit citations: Q12, O13, J43]",

This paper provides the first evidence distinguishing between the association between food outlet accessibility and market competition among commercial food outlets on household food expenditures. Using administrative profiles on convenience stores and nationally representative repeated cross‐sectional household surveys from 2003 to 2016, we find that inter‐brand competition between convenience store chain brands is associated with total food, food at home, and food away from home expenditures in Taiwan. In contrast, food outlet accessibility has no significant correlation with household food expenditures after controlling for inter‐brand competition. [EconLit citations: Q13, L22].",

The study utilizes quarterly panel data for six regions for the period January 2002 through June 2011. The objective of the study was to evaluate and determine the cigarette consumption responsiveness of these household groups to expenditure changes, tax reforms, and other factors. Taking into account the short‐term adjustment processes and long‐term equilibrium, the authors adopt an error correction model as the analytic framework, where they estimate long‐ and short‐term expenditure elasticities, tax effects, regional effects, and demographic effects. The estimation results show cigarette demand to be highly inelastic to expenditure changes in both household groups, both in the long‐ and short‐term, confirming the findings of previous research. Cigarette tax increases were found to have no significant effect in reducing consumption in single households both in the long and short term, a result different from that of family households in Japan.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, a market segmentation approach is developed and applied to analyze U.S. households' cheese purchases. The segmentation is based on household interpurchase time, or the hazard rate of purchases. In this study, four segments have been discovered in the U.S. market for household cheese purchases. Two of the segments jointly represent about 40% of all cheese‐purchasing households and are characterized as frequent buyers with an average interpurchase time of 2 weeks. These frequent‐purchase households are larger in size, have greater incomes, have a smaller proportion of African Americans, and are insensitive to coupons. They are often described in the marketing literature as loyal customers. In contrast, the other two segments, which jointly represent about 60% of the households, are characterized by infrequent buyers with an average interpurchase time of 6 weeks. These infrequent‐purchase households are smaller in size, have less income, have a higher proportion of African Americans, and are sensitive to coupons. Marketing promotions typically target the infrequent‐purchase households. [EconLit citations: D12, C51, C41]. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT As the pressure to liberalize agricultural trade both regionally and globally increases, the regulation and control of nontariff trade barriers becomes of paramount concern. The legislation regulating federal marketing orders in the United States allows these producer organizations to propose minimum quality standards (MQS) on domestic production, as well as imports, raising the possibility of using MQS as a nontariff trade barrier (NTB). Industry proposals, however, are subject to approval by the federal government. This paper presents an analytical model that examines domestic producers’ incentives and opportunities to use MQS as a NTB and government's incentives to approve or reject such regulations. In the first empirical investigation of the hypothesis that MQS act as NTB, a modified gravity equation model is used to examine the impacts of MQS on imports into the U.S. Results provide little support for the claims that MQS are acting as NTB.

More precisely, the questions to be answered are, “What kind of vertical relationship exists between the manufacturers and the retailers?” “Does this relationship support the high price‐cost margins in the RTEC industry?” The results indicate that the RTEC manufacturers have the pricing decisions and that the retailers do not intervene in setting the retail prices for breakfast cereal brands. This is consistent with the vertical restraints theory that helps the manufacturers eliminate the externality created by the double marginalization scenario and an excessive demand contraction.

While recognising that many factors influence industry structure, if new technologies reduce the costs of large firms more than small firms, they provide an incentive for firms to grow and for industries to become more highly concentrated. If they reduce the costs of small firms more, they can help such small firms compete on more equal terms with their larger competitors. The evidence here suggests that most new dairy technologies slightly favour larger firms, though firms in the 250–1000 employee category are not disadvantaged relative to those with more than 1000 employees. However, information technologies for greater process control are substantially scale-increasing and give more benefits to very large firms. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Continued population growth and high incomes will lead to a sustained increase in consumption of animal products, while scarce land and water resources will limit expansion in grain production, leading to growing pressure for increasing grain imports. This article analyses feed grain and animal product markets and policy options in China. The major conclusion is that the requirement for feed grains will be determined by the quantity of animal products produced, the methods used, the price of feed sources, the price of animal products, and government policy. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The program consists of education materials provided to teachers to assist in teaching about nutritional topics. We make use of food records from before and after the program, along with records from a control group, to estimate the effects on consumption patterns of learning about nutrition. DCC's activities are funded through a per-unit assessment on California milk, making the returns to producers an interesting topic in light of recent controversy over marketing orders. This article compares the benefits to the dairy industry to the cost of the program to the dairy industry. Under a number of reasonable assumptions, the benefits to dairy producers from increased milk consumption outweigh the costs of the program.

    "abstract": "Adapting to change is critical to surviving in agribusiness. Adaptive strategic plan development depends on the use of meaningful information from the external business environment. We propose the ratio of livestock (including poultry) to crop farm receipts (L/C) as an environmental scanning indicator. The spatial patterns of this ratio within three states, Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania over the last 50 years illustrate the directions and magnitudes of change in this indicator. The L/C for Iowa decreased from 2.1 to 1.2 but increased in both North Carolina and Pennsylvania from 0.2 to 1.6 and 3.6 to 8.4, respectively. Change was not uniformly distributed in any of the three states as some areas changed more than others. Because changes in production emphasis are often associated with changes in ecological or community issues, policies emerge to address these new circumstances. Agribusiness should be aware of the trajectory of change and associated policy actions in their immediate area, their state and nationally, because these dynamics can have significant implications for their strategic management opportunities. Progressive businesses, commodity groups, or other interest groups could scan changes in L/C and use the information as an environmental indicator for effective strategic management or distribute it for use in managing change. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The concept of agricultural franchising as presented here can be seen as a proposal for restructuring the vertical organization of the agricultural sector in transition economies. Since agricultural franchising would be a contract innovation if adopted, that concept will be compared with Hungarian production systems, which are closest in design to agricultural franchising. Based on this comparison some tentative conclusions about the potential feasibility of agricultural franchising for transition economies will be drawn. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Many researchers have used Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) data to estimate price and expenditure elasticities for various food groups. Results reported by these researchers have shown own-price elasticities to be negative, inelastic, and statistically significant; cross-price and expenditure elasticities have been shown to be positive and statistically significant. Further, some researchers have used NFCS data to try and estimate differential price responses of lower and higher income groups, and these authors have found no statistically significant differences in the magnitude of own-price elasticities. This study, using supermarket scanner data for several carbohydrates, finds significant differences in the price sensitivity of lower and higher income groups. These differences, however, are reflected more in purchase selections than in the magnitude of own-price elasticities. Also, regardless of income status, most expenditure and own-price elasticities are found to be elastic and statistically significant, and most cross-price elasticities are found to be positive and statistically insignificant. An important conclusion of this study is that the elasticities reported here provide a more accurate measure of consumer behavior than those reported in studies using NFCS data. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Retail brand acceptance by consumers has been a function of the (spatially and temporally variable) power and trust relationships amongst manufacturers, retailers and consumers. While retailer brands have developed powerfully in some products and countries, in others manufacturer brands have been stronger and more dominant. Certain global brands however (e.g., Coca-Cola) have been preeminent in their markets, seemingly inviolate to any retailer brand challenge. The restructuring and re-organization of The Cott Corporation since 1989, emphasizing retailer brand soft drinks and relationship/partnership building has challenged this inalienable brand position in soft drinks. Cott's extensive (although recent) operations, developing proprietary retailer brand drinks has caused a reassessment of retailer branding status both specifically in the product sector and more generally. This paper reviews the Cott Corporation's operations, placing these within a framework of retail restructuring and retailer-manufacturer brand and power relationships. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The survey results show that the new 1994 crop insurance program has been effective in increasing the insured pool of farmers, though it has not yet gained wide acceptance among the farming communities in Nebraska. Risks associated with price uncertainties turned out to be very important in the opinion of farmers. Knowledge of farmers about the futures market influenced the selection of appropriate marketing tools and aid in managing price risks. The new crop insurance program has been effective in communicating to the farming community that future ad hoc disaster payments are unlikely. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The measure is appropriate for firms operating under atomistic competition with imperfect information. The proposed measure displays two important features: (a) it uses the alternative of a spot price‐based counterfactual to distinguish marketing from allocative efficiency, and (b) it allows for the fact that firms operate in different spot markets and have access to diverse sets of prices. We illustrate this approach with a unique dataset from ethanol plants in the U.S. Corn Belt. [EconLit citations: C61, D2, L2].",

Although the deleterious effects of heavy alcohol consumption on health have been demonstrated, research found that moderate drinking may have positive effect on various dimensions of human capital. Our contribution to this debate is original. We provide new cross‐country evidence on the relation between alcohol consumption and well‐being controlling for a whole set of confounders. While binge drinking has an overall negative impact on well‐being, we also found a negative impact of complete abstinence. For drinkers, consumption of beer and wine have opposite effects: beer have a small but significant negative effect on well‐being but only in combination with binge drinking. The positive effect of the consumption of wine on subjective well‐being may be minimized or even ruled out by a higher frequency of binge drinking. [EconLit Citations: D12, I31, L66]",

We find that the profitability of firms improves during the first and second years following the most recent overinvestment. However, from the third year onward, profitability declines, and the restraining effect increases year by year. In addition, we find that regional differences and differences in financing constraints can explain the heterogeneity of the overinvestment age affecting firm profitability.

We study nontariff measures from both an extensive (experience of nontariff measures) and an intensive (cost of nontariff measures) perspective using a sample of 455 cereal farmers in Ghana. We employ the seemingly (un)related regression (SURE) and the inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment (IPWRA) to estimate the effect of nontariff measures on production allocation decisions. The result shows that nontariff measures are associated with lower cereal production and intensity of cereal commercialization but positively associated with the consumption of cereals. The results are robust after controlling for potential endogeneity using the Lewbel 2SLS. In addition, we find that our results are not likely to be driven by unobserved heterogeneity. We find evidence of consistent and robust estimates of nontariff measures when the IPWRA model is applied and compared to the SURE estimates. Overall, our study shows that nontariff measures can be a depressive pathway to cereal sustainable production and commercialization with associated policy implications for economic development [EconLit Citations: F1, F13, E23, Q13].",

Survival functions are used to investigate the timing of repeated recalls and double hurdle regression models explore factors influencing the probability of repeated recalls and the number of repeated recalls in the US meat and poultry industry between 2003 and 2019. Findings suggest that 25% of recalls are repeated and the average period between recalls is 1340 days (3.67 years). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis results suggest that the number of repeats and similar reasons for recalls significantly impact survival functions but no statistically significant differences were seen across plant sizes. Regression results suggest that product type (processed vs. fresh products) had no significant impact on the probability of a repeated recall but a significant positive impact on the number of repeats. Extraneous material contamination positively influenced the probability of a repeated recall but negatively influenced the number of repeats. The scope of marketing (depth and breadth) had a significant positive impact on the probability of a repeated recall but had no significant impact on the number of repeats. Large plants are more likely to experience a repeated recall and a greater number of repeats. Considering market failures in the provision of safe food, government detection is an important way to discover food safety problems. The results show that government detection of problems is effective in reducing the probability of a repeated recall and the number of repeats. Based on these findings, we draw policy and management implications for the government and plants to avoid repeated recalls. [EconLit Citations: M11, Q13].",

We conduct optimality tests of the WASDE forecasts for corn, soybeans, and wheat published during 1988–2019. Our results suggest that USDA forecasters generally realize optimality during the data‐generating process. Our findings are consistent with previous studies when narrowing down the more general unknown loss function to the symmetric or asymmetric loss function which assumes a specific shape for the loss function. This study provides implications based on the unknown loss function that the USDA forecasters can boost their information set as an alternative way to improve the WASDE forecasts.

Exploiting community (district in urban area and village unit in rural area) level KFC or McDonald density within 10 km by using the geocoding information, we find that the exposure to KFC or McDonald adversely affects people obesity. Our results are robust in a number of additional checks and placebo tests. The pro‐obesity effects are more pronounced for the lower educated than the higher educated.

    "abstract": "Abstract We examined whether folate‐fortified maize (FFM) improves the health of rural women of childbearing age and whether the health intervention is associated with the consumer willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) for FFM. First, a randomized single‐blind FFM intervention trial was conducted in rural childbearing‐aged women. Participants ( n = 55) consumed one stalk of either FFM (treatment group) or ordinary maize (control group) daily. This dietary intervention lasted for 2 months, during which we assessed the participants' serum folate levels at baseline, mid stage (after 1 month), and final stage (after 2 months) to evaluate the health effect of FFM. We found that the serum folate level in the treatment group (13.31 ng/mL) was 3.40 ng/mL higher than that in the control group (9.91 ng/mL) in the final stage of the study. These findings suggest that regular dietary FFM intake significantly increased serum folate levels in rural Chinese women. Second, we further expanded our study by involving 181 local rural women with similar demographic characteristics to participate in a Becker–DeGroot–Marschak (BDM) bidding experiment to measure their WTPs for FFM. Results showed that local consumers were willing to pay 2.82 Chinese Yuan (CNY) per stalk of FFM, approximately 1.21 CNY higher than the price of ordinary maize. And women who participated in and completed the intervention trial had a higher preference for FFM during the evaluation. We provide evidence on the health improvement effect of biofortified foods and shed light on the associated consumer valuation and policy implementation.",

For example, compared to the case when a low‐image NB manufacturer is disclosed as the supplier of a standard PL, which is our reference, we propose a decrease in the quality and brand image differentials when: (1) the high‐image NB supplies a standard PL, or (2) a low‐image NB manufacturer is disclosed as the supplier of a premium PL. Whereas we will not expect any change when a high‐image NB manufacturer is disclosed as the supplier of a premium PL. Our results partially support our expectations.

The empirical analysis is based on a disaggregated firm-level panel dataset of 25,032 observations of Vietnamese food processing firms during the period 2011–2016. The food processing industry is an essential part of the country's thriving manufacturing sector, with enormous potential for exports. The random-effects Probit estimation results suggest that the presence of foreign MNEs significantly raises the likelihood that private local firms become exporters and thereby start integrating into global value chains. Further regressions reveal that foreign presence is also linked to higher export intensity among domestic firms, and that the magnitude of the estimated spillover effects is conditional on the specific measures of foreign MNE presence, the ownership structure in local industry, and the size of local firms. The findings highlight the considerable potential for foreign MNEs to influence local firms’ export prospects and validate the policy efforts to attract foreign direct investment inflows to the examined industry.",

This paper first establishes the theoretical relationship between per capita income and import price, then uses a panel data fixed effect model and an instrumental variable estimation based on highly disaggregated firm‐level import data from the General Administration of Customs to analyze food import prices. This paper studies the impact of China's per capita income on the food import price and the key role of imported food quality in price formation for imported food in China. The study finds that the increase in per capita income has a significant, positive influence on the price of imported food in China, but this positive impact on the price is due to quality upgrading. The results suggest that while the increase of per capita income in China has generally pushed up import food prices, it has been mainly due to imports of higher‐quality food. There is no evidence that Chinese consumers are being fleeced by foreign exporting country or are seeking expensive products to flaunt their wealth. Chinese consumers are upgrading their diet with higher‐quality food imports. [EconLit Citations: F13, F14, Q17, Q18].",

    "abstract": "Abstract The supply chain risk management literature highlights the importance of ex‐ante identification and assessment of risks to ensure continuity of firms, in particular, and the high performance of supply chains in which they operate, in general. Supply chain disruptions are harmful and costly for firms. The risk of such disruptions can be particularly consequential for firms in emerging industries that lack resources and for which dominant organizational and supply chain designs do not yet exist. Within local and regional food supply chains, food hubs are nascent enterprises coordinating these supply chains. Building off the existing supply chain risk management literature, this study identifies and assesses the perceived supply chain risks faced by U.S. food hubs. The study employs an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design and the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis methodology for this purpose. The results show risks related to imbalances in food supply and demand, logistical delays, human resources, and infrastructure capacity limitations were perceived to be the highest priority supply chain risks for the U.S. food hubs before the COVID‐19 pandemic. The study further provides insights on association between food hub characteristics and risk, as well as association between risk preferences and risk perceptions of food hub managers [EconLit Citations: L29 Other (Firm Supply Chain Risk Management)].",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents liquidity measures in high resolution and investigates the impact of trading volume on market liquidity and prices in China's soybean complex markets. We document a U‐shaped distribution of volume and spreads over the course of a trading day. Quantile regression results show that trading volume tends to tighten bid‐ask spreads but widen spreads in the lower tail. We further find that the impact of trading volume on prices is significantly more pronounced during the opening hours, possibly indicating a higher prevalence of informed trading. Additionally, smaller‐sized transactions have a disproportionately larger impact on prices compared to large‐sized orders, a possible indication that stealth trading, that is, shaving large orders into smaller slices to conceal private information, presents in China's soybean complex.",

This has caused fundamental shifts in rice production and marketing in the region. Since the late 1980s Brazil has moved from self-sufficiency to consistently being one of the world's largest rice importers. In supplying the meteoric increase in Brazilian import demand, Argentina and Uruguay have more than doubled their production levels since 1990. Industry personnel in Argentina and Uruguay are interested in diversifying their exports away from the Brazilian import market that they now dominate.

Impacts on agriculture resulting from these policies encompass changed export demand for agricultural products, increased instability of agricultural income, and higher interest rate costs in a capital-intensive industry. Also reviewed are linkages between agriculture and the rest of the economy and credit linkages to agricultural production.",

Heuristic algorithms account for about 80% of the mileage reductions identified by GLM algorithms. GLM algorithms are computationally feasible for ordering farm stops while collecting milk loads.

The perception of an independent study program being a lower quality than an in-residence program is stronger among academics than among students; the perceived quality difference would not affect most students' decision to enroll. An independent study Master of Agriculture in Agribusiness Management (ISMAgr) program is proposed that would make extensive use of electronic communication systems (e.g., electronic mail, fax machines, telephones) to maintain regular student/teacher interaction. A one-week residency at the beginning of each semester would facilitate student interaction. The ISMAgr is expected to complement existing in-residence programs.

The lack of financing is devastating many projects that otherwise may make economic and business sense. The prospects are daunting agribusiness and agricultural enterprises. It compounds the diffculties of agribusiness and agricultural production, the development of a system of private land ownership, the building of a necessary storage and transportation infrastructure, and the growth in international trade. All these issues are interrelated. This article focuses on agribusiness and agricultural finance as it is developing in the milieu. Furthermore, each Central European country is coping with its own troubles springing from its conversion from communism toward a market economy. The collapse and lack of agricultural and agribusiness imports and exports reflect these challenges. Even with these constraints, progress is being made as the agricultural and agribusiness finance restructuring progress is continuing in each country. This article will overview the progress agribusiness and financial concepts have made in the past 3 years in the region, giving special attention to Bulgaria. The review also highlights some important financial issues for private sector and cooperative foreign investors, joint venture partners, marketing agreement participants and others interested in exploring agribusiness opportunities in Central Europe and Bulgaria.",

A dynamic econometric model was constructed to depict the world salmon market and was used to simulate the impacts of a countervailing duty levied on Norwegian farmed salmon. Four different combinations of countervailing tariffs levied in the United States and the European Economic Community are examined. Future profitability of US salmon farming is found to depend on the joint determination of the dumping litigations against Norway in the United States and the European Economic Community. The Pacific salmon capture fishery is likely to be adversely affected if the European Economic Community imposes a larger countervailing tariff than the United States.",

Moreover, since 1960, the price of machinery has risen relative to prices for other production inputs. Econometric analysis suggests that higher relative machinery prices encourage input substitution. Thus, relative price trends should be a major concern to the machinery industry. The analysis also suggests that demand for machinery is elastic, meaning that lower prices could produce higher gross sales. Last, annual machinery purchases by farmers will likely remain variable because factors influencing purchases are variable. Therefore, reducing factory and dealer inventories could produce lost sales.",

    "abstract": "Harsh and inaccurately forecasted economic conditions placed stresses on the Farm Credit System (FCS) and caused the organization to incur losses beginning in the mid-1980s. In recent years, the FCS has been neither more nor less able to avoid problem farm loans than commercial banks. But, because of the composition of the FCS portfolio, the problems of the FCS are more severe than those of banks. Federal legislation designed to bolster the FCS achieved certain short-term objectives in 1985 and 1986. However, even with additional federal assistance, the longer-term prospects for the FCS are uncertain since problems which created difficulties for the FCS in the mid-1980s remain unsolved.",

This study examines market development using the novel approach of measuring market development by using the number of personal contacts in export markets as the measure of market development activity. Contacts are divided into those who receive training (technical assistance) versus those who were contacted to facilitate trade (trade servicing). As a method of comparison, this study evaluates import demand in two ways: using market development expenditures as well as the numbers of technical assistance or trade service contacts. The study is applied to the grass seed industry, using cross-section time series data. Among the cross-sectional units are years and countries in which no promotion was undertaken, to improve the statistical significance levels for market development activities.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines food consumption patterns for households in Siberian Russia. The study is based on a survey conducted by the American Business Center in Vladivostok in February/March 1996. When incomes grow, households tend to include greater proportions of livestock products in their diets. That leads to a corresponding increase in indirect cereal consumption. Alternative measures of food consumption employed in the analysis are expenditures and calories. The results show that the expenditure income elasticity of cereal products is positive whereas income elasticities of cereal products are zero for calorie measures, implying demand for service from non‐agricultural sectors. The elasticities of total food and animal product consumption are positive for both measures. Stabilization of transition economies might lead to a substantial increase in indirect cereal consumption, which, in turn, would lead to a dramatic increase in demand for agricultural imports.

    "abstract": "The Japanese potato market is characterized by regional domination of production and marketing by strong cooperatives exhibiting a high degree of concentration with potential oligopolistic market power. In this research, the level of competition in the Japanese potato market was evaluated using conjectural variations technique on the time series data from 1989 to 1995. Four wholesale markets with eight production sources were analyzed. From the empirical analysis, it can be concluded that, despite the high level of concentration in production, all producing regions including the dominant producer, Hokkaido, seem to have behaved competitively. However, the degree of competition is found to vary depending on the season. Hokkaido, the leading producer, may be setting prices close to marginal costs under pressure of competition from foreign suppliers. {Econ-Lit citations: L100, L130] © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

We have data for 54 regions in the U.S. for 1989 and 1990. This is advantageous. A December 1989 freeze resulted in major increases in prices of all forms of orange juice in 1990. Results suggest that the three national brands were using some pricing strategies, but we find no indication that it has been to the detriment of smaller competitors. Indeed, private label and regional brands improved their market positions during the period. [Econlit Classifications: D130, D400]. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Data on FDI inflows from three investor home country clusters is related to characteristics of 12 food industry branches. The results indicate that firm size, privatization speed, value-added, and import share are important determinants of food industry FDI. The findings confirm the importance of a swift reduction of state control over agro-industrial enterprises, while pointing to the need for effective competition policies in transition countries to contain potentially emerging market power of foreign multinationals in oligopolistic food industry branches.

A Delphi survey was conducted in 1999 with a highly qualified panel of experts from the olive oil sector who, over two rounds of mailings, contributed their judgments about export prospects for the Spanish olive oil sector. Issues discussed include expected trends in world olive oil supply and demand, the likely implications of the major impending changes in the macroeconomic and regulatory setting, the characteristics of potential markets, the strengths and weaknesses of the Spanish olive oil export industry, and the key international marketing variables for the future.

    "abstract": "Economic arguments came into play in the recent U.S. Commerce Department inquiry into the allegation of unfair Canadian government subsidies provided to Canadian cattlemen. The central claim was that the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB), through its control over feed barley exports, was restraining exports, thereby increasing the domestic Canadian supply and decreasing the price of that commodity. Dr. Colin Carter provided economic argument on behalf of the U.S. petitioner, to which Dr. Andrew Schmitz and Dr. Richard Gray responded on behalf of the Government of Canada. Dr. Carter asserted that the CWB has indirectly discouraged the export of feed barley through high grain marketing and handling costs and inefficiencies in transmitting pricing information to farmers. He argued that claimed inefficiencies stemmed from the CWB's status as a single desk seller and its price pooling system. Drs. Schmitz and Gray responded in part that none of these claims could be substantiated. The Commerce Department largely sidestepped these economic arguments, instead finding no significant differential in U.S. and Canadian feed barley pricing in the investigation period. On that basis it concluded that the CWB provided no benefit or unlawful subsidy to live cattle producers. Â© 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Using a sample from the food processing industry, we examined both short-run and long-run wealth effects associated with swap usage. A significant long-run wealth effect of swap usage on swap users was not found. However, there was a significant negative wealth effect during a short period before firms first disclosed swap usage to the SEC. This finding is consistent with the argument that derivative usage may not be in the best interest of shareholders. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The Fed Cattle Market Simulator (FCMS), an experimental market, was used to estimate impacts from two meatpacking firm mergers. Data were collected from two FCMS workshops with large agribusiness firms. Experimental mergers involved the two smaller packers in the market in one case and the two larger packers in another. During the merger period, market prices were significantly higher than prior to the merger in both cases. Following the dissolution, results were mixed. Management of the merged firms appeared to significantly affect how effectively merged packers operated, thus affecting both behavior and performance. For both mergers, profits of the merged firm were higher relative to profits of rival firms. Merged firms appeared to have achieved some synergies in procurement or economies of scope (i.e., multi-plant economies). An increased Herfindahl index was associated with lower fed cattle prices in one case and higher prices in the other. [EconLit citations: L130, L290, L660]. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

This paper uses a binomial probit model to assess the motivations for opportunities and participation in mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances in agricultural cooperatives. A Poisson model is also used to investigate the frequency of participation in these activities. Results show that competition, patronage refunds, research and development, and market diversification all affect opportunities and participation. Firm size, placement in the market channel, and research and development activities appear to influence the frequency of participation.

There is ample basis for dissatisfaction with the performance of the industry—especially with its comparative absence of everyday price competition, except where private brands bulk large. There is no reason to believe, however, that the merger at issue would weaken price competition or that if Nabisco were sold to some other entity it would be any more willing to dilute the value of its Shredded Wheat brand by selling product for private labeling. On the other hand, the merger would probably make the combined entity more effective in the ways in which the industry typically competes—including heavy distribution of coupons and specials, which are undeniably a form of price competition.

    "abstract": "A survey of Iowa farmers who quit raising hogs between 1991–1997 quantified the demographics of the enterprises and operators, motivations for leaving, and prospects for re-entering hog production. The median enterprise size was 500 head marketed a year, yet hogs accounted for 40% of farm income. While 30% increased another enterprise or off-farm employment, 45% reported simply working less. Economic forces were cited for quitting hogs, but over 80% of the farmers did not know their cost of production. Higher operating margins and restrictions on competition were needed before these farmers would produce hogs again. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

It also introduces the main issues on the vigor of competition and pricing that are analyzed in subsequent papers. Jawboning as a public policy strategy is assessed and found useful in certain circumstances such as those in the breakfast cereal industry in the mid-1990s. The jawboning campaign was effective in advancing price competition in an industry that successfully resisted repeated antitrust efforts to promote competition. The RTE cereal industry is now undergoing major structural changes that are on balance pro-competitive. [EconLit cites: L100, L410, L660] © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent empirical literature pays increasing attention to farmer‐retail power relations in agricultural supply chains, yet seems to neglect potential differences between prices that primary producers receive for their products. Via both a Markov chain analysis and a hybrid panel data model, we empirically test whether primary producers receive prices in a consistent way and what explains any price differences. Using a unique data set containing individual farm‐specific output prices in various horticultural markets, we show substantial price dispersion across farms and reveal relations between farm characteristics and observed output prices. The Markov analysis shows that the same farms are constantly found in the higher and lower quartiles of the price distribution, implying prices are not distributed randomly. The results of the hybrid panel data model show that characteristics as farm size and production orientation are strongly associated with differences in the obtained output prices as well as the price/cost ratio between farms.

The SPS Agreement aims to facilitate discussion under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTP). It provides an enquiry and dispute settlement procedure; it also offers certain concessions and aid to developing and least developed countries. The article presents data on participation and several objective measures of the way the Agreement works for developing countries. Participation in the Agreement by developing countries is relatively low, despite the fact that several current issues (for example aflatoxins, salmonella) impact directly on such countries. The article suggests ways that developing countries can benefit further from the operation of the SPS Agreement, and explores how the standards operated by certain countries might act as a trade barrier to exports from developing countries.

Announced cereal price increases slowed for the first time in a decade. But the fact that the major cereal companies sold 145 million fewer boxes of cereal in 1995 indicates that consumers still believe prices continue to be too high. It remains to be seen whether or not the leading companies will move prices more in line with the costs of production due to competition from private label and consumer dissatisfaction.

Estimated own-price elasticities of demand are highly inelastic, but over time become price sensitive. The estimated cross-price elasticities indicate that machinery price has the highest impact on alfalfa seed demand.

Until 1995 the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had little impact on SPS measures, despite an Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade negotiated during the Tokyo Round. With the conclusion of the Marrakesh Accords, the new Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and a more potent Dispute Settlements procedure, mean that SPS measures are now more tightly regulated. This paper examines the Agreement, its modus operandi, and its dependence upon the activities of the international standards setting bodies such as Codex Alimentarius. It outlines some of the problems that have been identified by the WTO signatories, and considers the likely outcome of the current review.

    "abstract": "This article examines the wholesaler–retailer relationship within the red meat marketing channel in Western Australia. In particular, it identifies five factors which contribute to high levels of satisfaction being experienced by retailers in their dealings with their major supplier. These factors include aspects of the physical distribution service provided by the wholesalers, the quality of service provided by their staff in interchanges with the retailers, the absence of past conflict in the relationship, and the extent to which retailers are free to substitute a new supply source at times of high prices. The article concludes with recommendations that wholesalers take a long-term view and work towards harmonious channel relationships. To this end, they will need to develop systems to enhance the reliability of their physical distribution processes and train staff to deliver high quality service. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The majority of New Zealand's primary producers appear to believe that the safe management and use of agrichemicals in an important health issue in the primary sector. However, there is evidence that a considerable segment of New Zealand primary producers are not using adequate protective equipment. This article analyzes New Zealand primary producers' decision or desire to participate in agrichemical training and identifies factors, including attiudinal, behavioural, informational and current farming practices, that appear to influence the decision or desire to participate in agrichemical training. A qualitative choice model is developed to evaluate the influencing factors on problem recognition. Empirical results suggest that employee involvement and safe use and export factors are positively associated with problem recognition and factors representing experience, health ambivalence, and overconfidence are significantly negatively associated with problem recognition. The results also present a number of challenges for providers of agrichemical training programs and primary sector policy analysts. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

However, technical trade-offs of yield and quality attributes make it difficult to determine which modifications offer the highest potential pay-off and warrant the greatest emphasis in research, development, and, ultimately, market development. In this study, attention is focused on soybeans with modified protein and amino acid compositions where the primary end-use is livestock feed. A generalized dynamic simulation model combining a linear programming model and an econometric model allows for market interactions between soybean and soy-product industries, the livestock industry, and other closely related crop sectors.

Results indicate that fertilizer retailers act as variable cost minimizers, but not as revenue and profit maximizers. Additional tests isolate whether inefficiency in cost minimization is due to a perception of variable input fixity.

In rural America, there is no longer a “farm problem”but rural communities with specific problems. In an era of technological change, it is time to create an innovative social and economic contract to implement new food and farm policies with well funded local and state development and credit programs augmented by federal appropriations leading to free market pricing of agricultural products.",

    "abstract": "On February 14, 1994, the Floral Trade Council of Haslett, MI, filed an antidumping petition with the International Trade Commission (ITC) alleging that Colombian and Ecuadorian producers were dumping fresh cut roses on the US market. Three criteria—volume of imports, price effects, and health of the domestic industry—were the basis of the petitioner's injury allegation. Preliminary findings indicated a loss of market share for US rose producers, declining production, employment, and underselling in the US market. While the Department of Commerce's final determination concluded that Colombian roses were sold at less than fair value, the ITC ruled that the US rose industry was not materially injured by imports of roses from Colombia and Ecuador and the case was terminated. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

There is evidence suggesting that US agricultural policy objectives are incompatible with foreign policy to liberalize trade with Canada, and has contributed to the relative decline. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The results would tend to indicate that where the relative size of market has changed the concentration has usually changed in the opposite direction.

Excluding the latter, which stayed constant, proportion provided increased as farm size increased. Also, proportion of farm operators who provided these services for others increased as farm size increased.

The models were tested over five different time periods. The study found that no particular model consistently outperformed the others. This was true over different time periods, across commodities, and across specifications and estimation techniques. A X2 goodness of fit test could not reject the hypothesis that outcomes were uniformly distributed by classes. There was little statistical difference between the top five model types.

This article reviews the evolution of the plantation system in the Malaysian context and presents cost components for a sample of 75 rubber estates to illustrate the distinctive features in the plantation system. Results from a previous study to show the role of management, both its short-run and long-run aspects are presented.

China dairy import is predicted to grow significantly toward the year 2000, even though it could be restricted by its available foreign currency and lower priority of dairy products in the government importing list. The share of this market to be taken by the United States however will depend on the United States' competitiveness in world markets as well as its own export promotion efforts. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Estimates were obtained of the cost to upgrade each of the model plants to comply with Indiana's regulations on the handling and storage of fertilizers and pesticides. Results suggest that there are significant scale economies associated with the regulations and that smaller plants will have a more difficult time rationalizing the investment in containment facilities. The implications of these regulations for the retail fertilizer industry are explored using Porter's five-forces model. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Compared with current values, farm profits could decline $10-$15 billion, farm asset values could decline 20–30%, and farm debt could decline 40–50%. These suggest the farm crisis is not over.

    "abstract": "Aquacultural producers were surveyed to ascertain the tax accounting methods utilized for federal income tax reporting purposes. Approximately 99% of the producers surveyed use the cash method of reporting and also deduct currently the cost of fingerlings purchased for ultimate resale. Because cash-method farmers generally must capitalize the cost of purchased inventory until the period of sale, aquacultural producers may not be in compliance with current tax rules. Further, producers have classified aquacultural pond construction costs as (a) a soil and water conservation expense, (b) a single purpose agricultural structure, and (c) a land improvement although only the latter treatment appears safe from attack by the IRS. The theoretical propriety of these and other tax policies is examined.",

    "abstract": "The economic and political climate of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is changing rapidly. Because of these dramatic changes, it is difficult to provide an analysis of development in agriculture. Average annual agricultural production for the 1986–1990 period increased somewhat in volume when compared to the 1980–1985 average. However, the trend of increasing production did not continue in 1991, when agricultural output fell below the 1990 level. The primary causes of this downturn are crisis in the financial sector, disintegration of the material and equipment supply system to farm enterprises, price differences between industrial and agricultural commodities, the rigid purchasing system for agricultural outputs, weakening of central authorities, and state monopoly. Financial recovery and political stability are necessary for future growth of the agricultural sector. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The percent of postharvest losses following the ban is varied to determine the sensitivity of the cost of the ban to the grapefruit industry and society as a whole. ©1994 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Direct response was limited to establishing a small government stock of soybeans and initiating modest overseas production development following the 1973 soybean embargo. Neither action had any significant impact on Japanese agricultural imports from the US. Japanese farm policy does not appear to have changed in response to US embargoes. The embargoes, on the other hand, have provided farm groups with an additional argument to delay changes in a costly farm policy that has been fundamentally shaped by domestic forces.",

The results indicate that government tax and social programs in Australia provide that country's farmers with a competitive advantage in trade, particularly for the small and medium-sized farms. However, the lack of government farm programs in Australia generally offsets the tax and social program advantage. Canadian tax laws and social programs likewise provide its farmers with a competitive advantage over their US counterparts, but not to the same extent as Australia. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The abolition of commodity boards and of state farms in 1986 signaled a break with past approaches to agricultural development, but the ineffectiveness of these institutions raises doubt about whether their loss will bring much change. The strongest incentives for increased investment in agriculture will come from currency devaluation and from severe limitations on food imports, raising domestic prices. The eventual response of agricultural production depends on how vigorously the government pursues this new direction in policy, but there are indications in the policies already selected that the benefits of private investment will not be widely shared.",
