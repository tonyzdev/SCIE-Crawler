    "abstract": "The role of microglia in neurodegeneration, toxicology and immunity is an expanding area of biomedical research requiring large numbers of animals. Use of a microglia-like cell line would accelerate many research programmes and reduce the necessity of continuous cell preparations and animal experimentation, provided that the cell line reproduces the in vivo situation or primary microglia (PM) with high fidelity. The immortalised murine microglial cell line BV-2 has been used frequently as a substitute for PM, but recently doubts were raised as to their suitability. Here, we re-evaluated strengths and potential shortcomings of BV-2 cells. Their response to lipopolysaccharide was compared with the response of microglia in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome (480 genes) and proteome analyses after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide indicated a reaction pattern of BV-2 with many similarities to that of PM, although the average upregulation of genes was less pronounced. The cells showed a normal regulation of NO production and a functional response to IFN-γ, important parameters for appropriate interaction with T cells and neurons. BV-2 were also able to stimulate other glial cells. They triggered the translocation of NF-κB, and a subsequent production of IL-6 in astrocytes. Thus, BV-2 cells appear to be a valid substitute for PM in many experimental settings, including complex cell-cell interaction studies.",

    "abstract": "Serum is commonly used as a supplement to cell culture media. It provides a broad spectrum of macromolecules, carrier proteins for lipoid substances and trace elements, attachment and spreading factors, low molecular weight nutrients, and hormones and growth factors. The most widely used animal serum supplement is fetal bovine serum, FBS. Since serum in general is an ill-defined component in cell culture media, a number of chemically defined serum-free media formulations have been developed in the last two decades. Besides modern cell biological advances in cell and tissue culture and efforts towards a standardisation of cell culture protocols in Good Cell Culture Practice, in addition, considerable ethical concerns were raised recently about the harvest and collection of fetal bovine serum. Thus, in order to decrease the annual need for bovine fetuses in terms of the 3Rs through any reduction in the use or partial replacement of serum, as well as in terms of an improvement of cell and tissue culture methodology, serum-free cell culture represents a modern, valuable and scientifically well accepted alternative to the use of FBS in cell and tissue culture.",

    "abstract": "The supplementation of culture medium with fetal bovine serum (FBS, also referred to as \"fetal calf serum\") is still common practice in cell culture applications. Due to a number of disadvantages in terms of quality and reproducibility of in vitro data, animal welfare concerns, and in light of recent cases of fraudulent marketing, the search for alternatives and the development of serum-free medium formulations has gained global attention. Here, we report on the 3rd Workshop on FBS, Serum Alternatives and Serum-free Media, where regulatory aspects, the serum dilemma, alternatives to FBS, case-studies of serum-free in vitro applications, and the establishment of serum-free databases were discussed. The whole process of obtaining blood from a living calf fetus to using the FBS produced from it for scientific purposes is de facto not yet legally regulated despite the existing EU-Directive 2010/63/EU on the use of animals for scientific purposes. Together with the above-mentioned challenges, several strategies have been developed to reduce or replace FBS in cell culture media in terms of the 3Rs (Refinement, Reduction, Replacement). Most recently, releasates of activated human donor thrombocytes (human platelet lysates) have been shown to be one of the most promising serum alternatives when chemically-defined media are not yet an option. Additionally, new developments in cell-based assay techniques, advanced organ-on-chip and microphysiological systems are covered in this report. Chemically-defined serum-free media are shown to be the ultimate goal for the majority of culture systems, and examples are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is a ubiquitously used essential supplement in cell culture media. However, there are serious scientific and ethical concerns about the use of FBS regarding its harvest and production. During the last three decades, FBS could be substituted by other supplements or by the use of defined chemical components in serum-free cell culture. A number of serum-free medium formulations have been described for mammalian and insect cell lines as well as for primary cultures. However, the switch to serum-free media still demands a time-consuming literature survey and a manufacturer search for appropriate medium formulations, respectively. Here we present the second collection of commercially available serum-free media in an updated, freely accessible interactive online database. Searches for serum-free media and continuous cell lines already adapted to serum-free culture can be performed according to various criteria. These include the degree of chemical definition, e.g. serum-free (SF), animal-derived component free (ADCF) or chemically defined (CD), and the type of medium, e.g. basal media, medium supplements, or full replacement media. In order to specify the cell lines that are adapted to serum-free media, search terms like species, organ, tissue, cell type and disease can be used. All commercially available serum-free media and adapted cell lines currently available from major distributors (e.g. ATCC, ECACC and DMSZ) are included in the database. Despite an extensive search for serum-free media and adapted cell lines, detailed information from certain companies and suppliers is still lacking and is specifically highlighted. It is intended to create a platform for the interactive exchange of information and experience by experts in the field in order to continuously improve and extend the serum-free online database.

    "abstract": "During the past 30 years great effort has been put into establishing an insulin-secreting beta cell line that retains normal regulation of insulin secretion, but only few of these attempts have been successful. To overcome the limited availability of primary beta cells and to include the principles of the 3Rs into the field of diabetes mellitus research, numerous investigators used X-rays or viruses to induce insulinomas, in vitro transformation, derivation of cells from transgenic mice or even non-islet cells to produce immortalised beta cell lines. The most widely used insulin-secreting cell lines are RIN, HIT, MIN, INS-1 and TC cells. These cells produce insulin and small amounts of glucagon and somatostatin. Some of them are only poorly responsive to glucose, others respond to glucose well, but their concentration-dependence curve is markedly shifted to higher sensitivity. Despite problems associated with beta cell cultures, these cell lines have provided some valuable information about physiological processes. However, an urgent need to establish a \"normal\" beta cell line of human or pig origin remains.",

    "abstract": "The recent advent of microphysiological systems - microfluidic biomimetic devices that aspire to emulate the biology of human tissues, organs and circulation in vitro - is envisaged to enable a global paradigm shift in drug development. An extraordinary US governmental initiative and various dedicated research programs in Europe and Asia have led recently to the first cutting-edge achievements of human single-organ and multi-organ engineering based on microphysiological systems. The expectation is that test systems established on this basis would model various disease stages, and predict toxicity, immunogenicity, ADME profiles and treatment efficacy prior to clinical testing. Consequently, this technology could significantly affect the way drug substances are developed in the future. Furthermore, microphysiological system-based assays may revolutionize our current global programs of prioritization of hazard characterization for any new substances to be used, for example, in agriculture, food, ecosystems or cosmetics, thus, replacing laboratory animal models used currently. Thirty-six experts from academia, industry and regulatory bodies present here the results of an intensive workshop (held in June 2015, Berlin, Germany). They review the status quo of microphysiological systems available today against industry needs, and assess the broad variety of approaches with fit-for-purpose potential in the drug development cycle. Feasible technical solutions to reach the next levels of human biology in vitro are proposed. Furthermore, key organ-on-a-chip case studies, as well as various national and international programs are highlighted. Finally, a roadmap into the future is outlined, to allow for more predictive and regulatory-accepted substance testing on a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Human in vitro models of brain neurophysiology are needed to investigate molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with neurological disorders and neurotoxicity. We have developed a reproducible iPSC-derived human 3D brain microphysiological system (BMPS), comprised of differentiated mature neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) that reproduce neuronal-glial interactions and connectivity. BMPS mature over eight weeks and show the critical elements of neuronal function: synaptogenesis and neuron-to-neuron (e.g., spontaneous electric field potentials) and neuronal-glial interactions (e.g., myelination), which mimic the microenvironment of the central nervous system, rarely seen in vitro before. The BMPS shows 40% overall myelination after 8 weeks of differentiation. Myelin was observed by immunohistochemistry and confirmed by confocal microscopy 3D reconstruction and electron microscopy. These findings are of particular relevance since myelin is crucial for proper neuronal function and development. The ability to assess oligodendroglial function and mechanisms associated with myelination in this BMPS model provide an excellent tool for future studies of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases. The BMPS provides a suitable and reliable model to investigate neuron-neuroglia function as well as pathogenic mechanisms in neurotoxicology.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of metabolites in a biological system, provides detailed information about the biochemical/physiological status of a biological system, and about the changes caused by chemicals. Metabolomics analysis is used in many fields, ranging from the analysis of the physiological status of genetically modified organisms in safety science to the evaluation of human health conditions. In toxicology, metabolomics is the -omics discipline that is most closely related to classical knowledge of disturbed biochemical pathways. It allows rapid identification of the potential targets of a hazardous compound. It can give information on target organs and often can help to improve our understanding regarding the mode-of-action of a given compound. Such insights aid the discovery of biomarkers that either indicate pathophysiological conditions or help the monitoring of the efficacy of drug therapies. The first toxicological applications of metabolomics were for mechanistic research, but different ways to use the technology in a regulatory context are being explored. Ideally, further progress in that direction will position the metabolomics approach to address the challenges of toxicology of the 21st century. To address these issues, scientists from academia, industry, and regulatory bodies came together in a workshop to discuss the current status of applied metabolomics and its potential in the safety assessment of compounds. We report here on the conclusions of three working groups addressing questions regarding 1) metabolomics for in vitro studies 2) the appropriate use of metabolomics in systems toxicology, and 3) use of metabolomics in a regulatory context.",

    "abstract": "Integrated approaches using different in vitro methods in combination with bioinformatics can (i) increase the success rate and speed of drug development; (ii) improve the accuracy of toxicological risk assessment; and (iii) increase our understanding of disease. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models are important building blocks of this strategy which has emerged during the last years. The majority of these models are organotypic, i.e., they aim to reproduce major functions of an organ or organ system. This implies in many cases that more than one cell type forms the 3D structure, and often matrix elements play an important role. This review summarizes the state of the art concerning commonalities of the different models. For instance, the theory of mass transport/metabolite exchange in 3D systems and the special analytical requirements for test endpoints in organotypic cultures are discussed in detail. In the next part, 3D model systems for selected organs – liver, lung, skin, brain – are presented and characterized in dedicated chapters. Also, 3D approaches to the modeling of tumors are presented and discussed. All chapters give a historical background, illustrate the large variety of approaches, and highlight up- and downsides as well as specific requirements. Moreover, they refer to the application in disease modeling, drug discovery and safety assessment. Finally, consensus recommendations indicate a roadmap for the successful implementation of 3D models in routine screening. It is expected that the use of such models will accelerate progress by reducing error rates and wrong predictions from compound testing.",

Categories/analogue groups are typically developed based on structural similarity and, increasingly often, also on mechanistic (biological) similarity.

Despite a potentially broad user community, expertise is still concentrated across a handful of organizations and indi­viduals. In order to facilitate the effective use of read-across, this document presents the state of the art, summarizes insights learned from reviewing ECHA published decisions regarding the relative successes/pitfalls surrounding read-across under REACH, and compiles the relevant activities and guidance documents. Special emphasis is given to the available existing tools and approaches, an analysis of ECHA’s published final decisions associated with all levels of compliance checks and testing proposals, the consideration and expression of uncertainty, the use of biological support data, and the impact of the ECHA Read-Across Assessment Framework (RAAF) published in 2015.",

To more broadly address the challenges in toxicology, Tox21 has developed a new strategic and operational plan that expands the focus of its research activities. The new focus areas include developing an expanded portfolio of alternative test systems, addressing technical limitations of in vitrotest systems, curating legacy in vivo toxicity testing data, establishing scientific confidence in the in vitrotest systems, and refining alternative methods for characterizing pharmacokinetics and in vitro assay disposition.The new Tox21 strategic and operational plan addresses key challenges to advance toxicology testing and will benefit both the organizations involved and the toxicology community.",

Currently, the field generates more than a thousand scientific publications per year. Despite the MPS hype in academia and by platform providers, which say this technology is about to reshape the entire in vitro culture landscape in basic and applied research, MPS approaches neither have been widely adopted by the pharmaceutical industry yet nor have they reached regulated drug authorization processes. Here, 46 leading international experts from all stakeholder groups – academia, MPS supplier industry, pharmaceutical and consumer products industries, and leading regulatory agencies – analyzed challenges and hurdles along the MPSbased assay life cycle in the second workshop of its kind in June 2019. The main findings were that the level of qualification of MPS-based assays for a given context of use and communication gaps between stakeholders are the major challenges slowing industrial adoption by end users, which in turn is causing a regulatory acceptance dilemma. This report elaborates on these findings and proposes solutions by providing recommendations and a roadmap towards regulatory acceptance of MPS-based models, which will benefit patients and further reduce laboratory animal use in drug development. Finally, the potential of MPS-based human disease models to feed back into laboratory animal replacement in basic life science research is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Multiple non-animal-based test methods have never been formally validated. In order to use such new approach methods (NAMs) in a regulatory context, criteria to define their readiness are necessary. The field of developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing is used to exemplify the application of readiness criteria. The costs and number of untested chemicals are overwhelming for in vivo DNT testing. Thus, there is a need for inexpensive, high-throughput NAMs, to obtain initial information on potential hazards, and to allow prioritization for further testing. A background on the regulatory and scientific status of DNT testing is provided showing different types of test readiness levels, depending on the intended use of data from NAMs. Readiness criteria, compiled during a stakeholder workshop, uniting scientists from academia, industry and regulatory authorities are presented. An important step beyond the listing of criteria, was the suggestion for a preliminary scoring scheme. On this basis a (semi)-quantitative analysis process was assembled on test readiness of 17 NAMs with respect to various uses (e.g. prioritization/screening, risk assessment). The scoring results suggest that several assays are currently at high readiness levels. Therefore, suggestions are made on how DNT NAMs may be assembled into an integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA). In parallel, the testing state in these assays was compiled for more than 1000 compounds. Finally, a vision is presented on how further NAM development may be guided by knowledge of signaling pathways necessary for brain development, DNT pathophysiology, and relevant adverse outcome pathways (AOP).",

    "abstract": "The regular workshops held by the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) on biology-inspired microphysiological systems (MPS) taking place every four years, have become a reliable measure to assess fundamental scientific, industrial and regulatory trends for translational science in the MPS-field from a bird's eye view. The 2023 workshop participants at that time concluded that the technology as used within academia has matured significantly, underlined by the broad use of MPS and the steadily increasing number of high quality research publications - yet, broad industry adoption of MPS has been slow, despite strong interest. Academic research using MPS primarily aims to accurately recapitulate human biology in MPS-based organ models in areas where traditional models have been lacking key elements of human physiology, thereby enabling breakthrough discoveries for life sciences. Examples of these developments are summarized in the report presented here. In addition, we focus on key challenges identified during the previous workshop around progress made in bridging gaps between stakeholders between academia, regulatory agencies and industry on one hand, as well as overcoming hurdles to gain confidence in, and acceptance of MPS-derived data - the latter being of particular importance in a regulatory environment. The status of implementation of the recommendations detailed in the 2019 report have been reviewed. We conclude that communication between stakeholders has improved significantly, while recommendations related to regulatory acceptance still need to be implemented. Participants noted that the remaining challenges for increased translation of these technologies to industrial use and regulatory decision-making will not be fully solvable by basic academic research alone. Rather, more efforts into well-defined context-of-use qualifications are needed, together with increased standardization making MPS data more reliable and ultimately these novel tools economically more sustainable. The long-term roadmap from the 2015 workshop has been critically reviewed and updated. Recommendations for the next period and an outlook conclude the report.",

A reanalysis of cost and animal use estimates was carried out based on the final legislation, test guidance for industry published by the European Chemical Agency, and the preregistration completed in December 2008. The new estimates for the number of substances falling under REACH range from 68 to 101,000 chemicals, substantially exceeding the earlier estimates of 29,000 substances. The latter estimates were, however, based on data before 1994 and both expansion of the EU and growth of the chemical industry since have contributed to higher numbers today.The lower estimate of 68,000 chemicals was carried through current testing requirements with due regard to emerging alternative approaches, using in all cases the most optimistic assumptions (minimal animal numbers per test and neglecting most triggering of additional tests and confirmatory (re-)tests as well as tests requested but not yet defined for endocrine disruption, respiratory irritation, respiratory sensitization and developmental neurotoxicity). The most demanding studies are in the area of reproductive toxicity testing with about 90% of all animal use and 70% of the required costs for registration. The overall result suggests a demand of 54 million vertebrate animals and testing costs of 9.5 billion euro. This clearly challenges the feasibility of the program without a major investment into high-throughput methodologies.",

    "abstract": "The search for alternatives to the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in cell and tissue culture media has become a major goal in terms of the 3R principles in order to reduce or to avoid harvesting of FBS from bovine fetuses, and, in terms of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), to ensure safe and animal product-free conditions for biomedical tissue engineering and (adult) stem cell therapy, respectively. In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of using platelet lysates (PL) as a substitute for FBS, based on the fact that most of the potent mitogenic factors present in serum are derived from activated thrombocytes. Platelet lysates were obtained from outdated human donor platelet concentrates. Methods were established to activate human donor platelets in order to achieve a maximum yield of platelet α-granule growth factors. Platelet lysates were successfully introduced to grow and maintain anchorage-dependent and -independent human and animal cell lines. For cell culture experiments, cells were either grown in culture media supplemented with 10% FBS, 5% PL, or under serum-free conditions. Growth experiments, viability assays, and platelet lysate-induced activation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase revealed platelet lysates as a valuable alternative to FBS in cell culture media.",

    "abstract": "Systemic toxicity testing forms the cornerstone for the safety evaluation of substances. Pressures to move from traditional animal models to novel technologies arise from various concerns, including: the need to evaluate large numbers of previously untested chemicals and new products (such as nanoparticles or cell therapies), the limited predictivity of traditional tests for human health effects, duration and costs of current approaches, and animal welfare considerations. The latter holds especially true in the context of the scheduled 2013 marketing ban on cosmetic ingredients tested for systemic toxicity. Based on a major analysis of the status of alternative methods (Adler et al., 2011) and its independent review (Hartung et al., 2011), the present report proposes a roadmap for how to overcome the acknowledged scientific gaps for the full replacement of systemic toxicity testing using animals. Five whitepapers were commissioned addressing toxicokinetics, skin sensitization, repeated-dose toxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity testing. An expert workshop of 35 participants from Europe and the US discussed and refined these whitepapers, which were subsequently compiled to form the present report. By prioritizing the many options to move the field forward, the expert group hopes to advance regulatory science.",

Whenever we take a closer look at the outcome of clinical trials in a field such as, most recently, stroke or septic shock, we see how limited the value of our preclinical models was. For all indications, 95% of drugs that enter clinical trials do not make it to the market, despite all promise of the (animal) models used to develop them. Drug development has started already to decrease its reliance on animal models: In Europe, for example, despite increasing R&amp;D expenditure, animal use by pharmaceutical companies dropped by more than 25% from 2005 to 2008. In vitro studies are likewise limited: questionable cell authenticity, over-passaging, mycoplasma infections, and lack of differentiation as well as non-homeostatic and non-physiologic culture conditions endanger the relevance of these models. The standards of statistics and reporting often are poor, further impairing reliability. Alarming studies from industry show miserable reproducibility of landmark studies. This paper discusses factors contributing to the lack of reproducibility and relevance of pre-clinical research. The conclusion: Publish less but of better quality and do not rely on the face value of animal studies.",

    "abstract": "Since March 2013, animal use for cosmetics testing for the European market has been banned. This requires a renewed view on risk assessment in this field. However, in other fields as well, traditional animal experimentation does not always satisfy require­ments in safety testing, as the need for human-relevant information is ever increasing. A general strategy for animal-free test approaches was outlined by the US National Research Council's vision document for Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century in 2007. It is now possible to provide a more defined roadmap on how to implement this vision for the four principal areas of systemic toxicity evaluation: repeat dose organ toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity and allergy induction (skin sensitization), as well as for the evaluation of toxicant metabolism (toxicokinetics) (Fig. 1). CAAT-Europe assembled experts from Europe, America and Asia to design a scientific roadmap for future risk assessment approaches and the outcome was then further discussed and refined in two consensus meetings with over 200 stakeholders. The key recommendations include: focusing on improving existing methods rather than favoring de novo design; combining hazard testing with toxicokinetics predictions; developing integrated test strategies; incorporating new high content endpoints to classical assays; evolving test validation procedures; promoting collaboration and data-sharing of different industrial sectors; integrating new disciplines, such as systems biology and high throughput screening; and involving regulators early on in the test development process. A focus on data quality, combined with increased attention to the scientific background of a test method, will be important drivers. Information from each test system should be mapped along adverse outcome pathways. Finally, quantitative information on all factors and key events will be fed into systems biology models that allow a probabilistic risk assessment with flexible adaptation to exposure scenarios and individual risk factors.",

    "abstract": "For a long time, the discussion about animal testing vs its alternatives centered on animal welfare. This was a static warfare, or at least a gridlock, where life scientists had to take a position and make their value choices and hardly anyone changed sides. Technical advances have changed the frontline somewhat, with in vitro and in silico methods gaining more ground. Only more recently has the economic view begun to have an impact: Many animal tests are simply too costly, take too long, and give misleading results. As an extension and update to previous articles in this series written a decade ago, we reanalyze the economic landscape of especially regulatory use of animal testing and this time also consider respective alternative tests. Despite some ambiguity and data gaps, which we have filled with crude estimates, a picture emerges of globally regulated industries that are subject to stark geographic and sectorial differences in regulation, which determine their corresponding animal use. Both animal testing and its alternatives are industries in their own right, offering remarkable business opportunities for biotech and IT companies as well as contract research organizations. In light of recent revelations as to the reproducibility and relevance issues of many animal tests, the economic consequences of incorrect results and the reasons for still maintaining often outdated animal test approaches are discussed.",

The discussions that took place during this workshop, which brought together a group of experts coming from different related areas, illustrate the current state of the art of ITS, as well as promising developments and identifiable challenges. The case of skin sensitization was taken as an example to understand how possible ITS can be constructed, optimized and validated.

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that toxicology uses many stand-alone tests, a systematic combination of several information sources very often is required: Examples include: when not all possible outcomes of interest (e.g., modes of action), classes of test substances (applicability domains), or severity classes of effect are covered in a single test; when the positive test result is rare (low prevalence leading to excessive falsepositive results); when the gold standard test is too costly or uses too many animals, creating a need for prioritization by screening. Similarly, tests are combined when the human predictivity of a single test is not satisfactory or when existing data and evidence from various tests will be integrated. Increasingly, kinetic information also will be integrated to make an in vivo extrapolation from in vitro data.Integrated Testing Strategies (ITS) offer the solution to these problems. ITS have been discussed for more than a decade, and some attempts have been made in test guidance for regulations. Despite their obvious potential for revamping regulatory toxicology, however, we still have little guidance on the composition, validation, and adaptation of ITS for different purposes. Similarly, Weight of Evidence and Evidence-based Toxicology approaches require different pieces of evidence and test data to be weighed and combined. ITS also represent the logical way of combining pathway-based tests, as suggested in Toxicology for the 21st Century. This paper describes the state of the art of ITS and makes suggestions as to the definition, systematic combination, and quality assurance of ITS.",

    "abstract": "There is a paucity of information concerning the developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) hazard posed by industrial and environ­mental chemicals. New testing approaches will most likely be based on batteries of alternative and complementary (non-animal) tests. As DNT is assumed to result from the modulation of fundamental neurodevelopmental processes (such as neuronal differen­tiation, precursor cell migration or neuronal network formation) by chemicals, the first generation of alternative DNT tests target these processes. The advantage of such types of assays is that they capture toxicants with multiple targets and modes-of-action. Moreover, the processes modelled by the assays can be linked to toxicity endophenotypes, i.e., alterations in neural connectivity that form the basis for neurofunctional deficits in man. The authors of this review convened in a workshop to define criteria for the selection of positive/negative controls, to prepare recommendations on their use, and to initiate the setup of a directory of reference chemicals. For initial technical optimization of tests, a set of > 50 endpoint-specific control compounds was identified. For further test development, an additional \"test\" set of 33 chemicals considered to act directly as bona fide DNT toxicants is proposed, and each chemical is annotated to the extent it fulfills these criteria. A tabular compilation of the original literature used to select the test set chemicals provides information on statistical procedures, and toxic/non-toxic doses (both for pups and dams). Suggestions are provided on how to use the > 100 compounds (including negative controls) compiled here to address specificity, adversity and use of alternative test systems.",

    "abstract": "In vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) assays are seeing increasing use in toxicity testing. HTS assays can simultaneously test many chemicals but have seen limited use in the regulatory arena, in part because of the need to undergo rigorous, time-consuming formal validation. Here we discuss streamlining the validation process, specifically for prioritization applications. By prioritization, we mean a process in which less complex, less expensive, and faster assays are used to prioritize which chemicals are subjected first to more complex, expensive, and slower guideline assays. Data from the HTS prioritization assays is intended to provide a priori evidence that certain chemicals have the potential to lead to the types of adverse effects that the guideline tests are assessing. The need for such prioritization approaches is driven by the fact that there are tens of thousands of chemicals to which people are exposed, but the yearly throughput of most guideline assays is small in comparison. The streamlined validation process would continue to ensure the reliability and relevance of assays for this application. We discuss the following practical guidelines: (1) follow current validation practice to the extent possible and practical; (2) make increased use of reference compounds to better demonstrate assay reliability and relevance; (3) de-emphasize the need for cross-laboratory testing; and (4) implement a web-based, transparent, and expedited peer review process.",

When environmental chemicals contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) becomes an enormous concern. But how can it be tackled? Current animal test-based guidelines are prohibitively expensive, at $1.4 million per substance, while their predictivity for human health effects may be limited, and mechanistic data that would help species extrapolation are not available. A broader screening for substances of concern requires a reliable testing strategy, applicable to larger numbers of substances, and sufficiently predictive to warrant further testing.

This is well established for other coronaviruses. In order to understand why some patients develop such symptoms and others do not, we address herein the infectability of the central nervous system (CNS). Reports that the ACE2 receptor – critical for virus entry into lung cells – is found in different neurons support this expectation. We employed a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)- derived BrainSphere model, which we used earlier for Zika, Dengue, HIV and John Cunningham virus infection studies. We detected the expression of the ACE2 receptor, but not TMPRSS2, in the model. Incubating the BrainSpheres for 6 hours with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 led to infection of a fraction of neural cells with replication of the virus evident at 72 hpi. Virus particles were found in the neuronal cell body extending into apparent neurite structures. PCR measurements corroborated the replication of the virus, suggesting at least a tenfold increase in virus copies per total RNA. Leveraging state-of-the-art 3D organotypic cell culture, which has been shown to allow both virus infection and modeling of (developmental) neurotoxicity but is at the same time simple enough to be transferred and used in a BSL-3 environment, we demonstrate, for the first time, the potential critically important neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2.",

The key change is basing the assessments on mechanisms and toxicant modes of action. Identifying pathways of toxicity (PoT), especially on a larger scale, evidently requires omics technologies. When the PoT is known, a test battery allowing higher throughput than the current approach can be constructed. Here, we propose an extension of this concept to mapping the entirety of PoT in humans: the human toxome. Mapping the human toxome will allow us, for the first time, to conclusively identify substances as nontoxic or to identify nontoxic concentrations of substances (i.e., concentrations at which no relevant PoT are triggered). The concept is explained, and opportunities and obstacles are discussed, aiming to promote an initiative which will form the core of a Human Toxicology Project to implement Toxicology for the 21st Century.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a new human alveolar epithelial cell line (hAELVi - human Alveolar Epithelial Lentivirus immortalized) with type I-like characteristics and functional tight junctions, suitable to model the air-blood barrier of the peripheral lung. Primary human alveolar epithelial cells were immortalized by a novel regimen, grown as monolayers on permeable filter supports and characterized morphologically, biochemically and biophysically. hAELVi cells maintain the capacity to form tight intercellular junctions, with high trans-epithelial electrical resistance (> 1000 Ω*cm²). The cells could be kept in culture over several days, up to passage 75, under liquid-liquid as well as air-liquid conditions. Ultrastructural analysis and real time PCR revealed type I-like cell properties, such as the presence of caveolae, expression of caveolin-1, and absence of surfactant protein C. Accounting for the barrier properties, inter-digitations sealed with tight junctions and desmosomes were also observed. Low permeability of the hydrophilic marker sodium fluorescein confirmed the suitability of hAELVi cells for in vitro transport studies across the alveolar epithelium. These results suggest that hAELVi cells reflect the essential features of the air-blood barrier, as needed for an alternative to animal testing to study absorption and toxicity of inhaled drugs, chemicals and nanomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Animal welfare is a key issue for industries that use or impact upon animals. The accurate identification of welfare states is particularly relevant to the field of bioscience, where the 3Rs framework encourages refinement of experimental procedures involving animal models. The assessment and improvement of welfare states in animals depends on reliable and valid measurement tools. Behavioral measures (activity, attention, posture and vocalization) are frequently used because they are immediate and non-invasive, however no single indicator can yield a complete picture of the internal state of an animal. Facial expressions are extensively studied in humans as a measure of psychological and emotional experiences but are infrequently used in animal studies, with the exception of emerging research on pain behavior. In this review, we discuss current evidence for facial representations of underlying affective states, and how communicative or functional expressions can be useful within welfare assessments. Validated tools for measuring facial movement are outlined, and the potential of expressions as honest signals is discussed, alongside other challenges and limitations to facial expression measurement within the context of animal welfare. We conclude that facial expression determination in animals is a useful but underutilized measure that complements existing tools in the assessment of welfare.",

    "abstract": "A major reason for the current reproducibility crisis in the life sciences is the poor implementation of quality control measures and reporting standards. Improvement is needed, especially regarding increasingly complex in vitro methods. Good Cell Culture Practice (GCCP) was an effort from 1996 to 2005 to develop such minimum quality standards also applicable in academia. This paper summarizes recent key developments in in vitro cell culture and addresses the issues resulting for GCCP, e.g., the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and gene-edited cells. It further deals with human stem-cell-derived models and bioengineering of organotypic cell cultures, including organoids, organ-on-chip and human-on-chip approaches. Commercial vendors and cell banks have made human primary cells more widely available over the last decade, increasing their use but also requiring specific guidance as to GCCP. The characterization of cell culture systems including high-content imaging and high-throughput measurement technologies increasingly combined with more complex cell and tissue cultures represent a further challenge for GCCP. The increasing use of gene editing techniques to generate and modify in vitro culture models also requires discussion of its impact on GCCP. International (often varying) legislations and market forces originating from the commercialization of cell and tissue products and technologies are further impacting on the need for the use of GCCP. This report summarizes the recommendations of the second of two workshops, held in Germany in December 2015, aiming to map the challenge and organize the process or developing a revised GCCP 2.0.",

    "abstract": "The role that in vitro systems can play in toxicological risk assessment is determined by the appropriateness of the chosen methods, with respect to the way in which in vitro data can be extrapolated to the in vivo situation. This report presents the results of a workshop aimed at better defining the use of in vitro-derived biomarkers of toxicity (BoT) and determining the place these data can have in human risk assessment. As a result, a conceptual framework is presented for the incorporation of in vitro-derived toxicity data into the risk assessment process. The selection of BoT takes into account that they need to distinguish adverse and adaptive changes in cells. The framework defines the place of in vitro systems in the context of data on exposure, structural and physico-chemical properties, and toxicodynamic and biokinetic modeling. It outlines the determination of a proper point-of-departure (PoD) for in vitro-in vivo extrapolation, allowing implementation in risk assessment procedures. A BoT will need to take into account both the dynamics and the kinetics of the compound in the in vitro systems. For the implementation of the proposed framework it will be necessary to collect and collate data from existing literature and new in vitro test systems, as well as to categorize biomarkers of toxicity and their relation to pathways-of-toxicity. Moreover, data selection and integration need to be driven by their usefulness in a quantitative in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (QIVIVE).",

    "abstract": "ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) has rapidly evolved over the past two decades, creating a unique interdisciplinary interface between medicinal chemists, biologists, formulators, toxicologists, clinicians, and regulators across industries, but has advanced most rapidly in the pharmaceutical industry. The implementation of ADME profiling of drug candidates, in conjunction with biological efficacy and safety optimization, has dramatically reduced pharmacokinetic drug failures in clinical trials and has become a lingua franca between disciplines that are involved in drug development. This article briefly reviews the basics and current state-of-the-art of ADME and the major lessons from the pharmaceutical industry on its efficient use, points out the importance of defining ADME properties leading to toxicity across industries for safety and toxicity prediction of chemicals, and raises the issues of quality, reliability, and reproducibility of tests and inclusion of ADME under the umbrella of evidence-based toxicology. Increasingly, in vitro results are used to inform ADME assessments and computer modeling. The aspects of kinetics of substances in cellular models themselves, however, are still too often neglected. ADME information will play a critical role in establishing quantitative in vitro to in vivo extrapolations (QIVIVE), integrated testing strategies, and systems toxicology approaches.",

Eye irritation hazard, for which the rabbit Draize eye test still represents the reference method, was analyzed. Dossiers contained 9,782 Draize eye studies on 3,420 unique substances, indicating frequent retesting of substances. This allowed assessment of the test's reproducibility test based on all substances tested more than once. There was a 10% chance of a non-irritant evaluation given after a prior severe-irritant result as given by UN GHS classification criteria. The most reproducible outcomes were the results negative (94% reproducible) and severe eye irritant (73% reproducible). To evaluate whether other GHS categorizations predict eye irritation we built a dataset of 5,629 substances (1,931 'irritant' and 3,698 'non-irritant'). The two best decision trees with up to three other GHS classifications resulted in balanced accuracies of 68% and 73%, i.e., in the rank order of the Draize rabbit eye test itself, but both use inhalation toxicity data (\"May cause respiratory irritation\"), which is not typically available. Next, a dataset of 929 substances with at least one Draize study was mapped to PubChem to compute chemical similarity using 2D conformational fingerprints and Tanimoto similarity. Using a minimum similarity of 0.7 and simple classification by the closest chemical neighbor resulted in balanced accuracy from 73% over 737 substances to 100% at a threshold of 0.975 over 41 substances. This represents a strong support of read-across and (Q)SAR approaches in this area.",

    "abstract": "Integrated approaches using different in vitro methods in combination with bioinformatics can (i) increase the success rate and speed of drug development; (ii) improve the accuracy of toxicological risk assessment; and (iii) increase our understanding of disease. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models are important building blocks of this strategy which has emerged during the last years. The majority of these models are organotypic, i.e., they aim to reproduce major functions of an organ or organ system. This implies in many cases that more than one cell type forms the 3D structure, and often matrix elements play an important role. This review summarizes the state of the art concerning commonalities of the different models. For instance, the theory of mass transport/metabolite exchange in 3D systems and the special analytical requirements for test endpoints in organotypic cultures are discussed in detail. In the next part, 3D model systems for selected organs – liver, lung, skin, brain – are presented and characterized in dedicated chapters. Also, 3D approaches to the modeling of tumors are presented and discussed. All chapters give a historical background, illustrate the large variety of approaches, and highlight up- and downsides as well as specific requirements. Moreover, they refer to the application in disease modeling, drug discovery and safety assessment. Finally, consensus recommendations indicate a roadmap for the successful implementation of 3D models in routine screening. It is expected that the use of such models will accelerate progress by reducing error rates and wrong predictions from compound testing.",

This study demonstrates the generation of a vascularized skin equivalent with a perfused vascular network by combining a biological vascularized scaffold (BioVaSc) based on a decellularized segment of a porcine jejunum and a tailored bioreactor system. Briefly, the BioVaSc was seeded with human fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and human microvascular endothelial cells. After 14 days at the air-liquid interface, hematoxylin & eosin and immunohistological staining revealed a specific histological architecture representative of the human dermis and epidermis including a papillary-like architecture at the dermal-epidermal-junction. The formation of the skin barrier was measured non-destructively using impedance spectroscopy. Additionally, endothelial cells lined the walls of the formed vessels that could be perfused with a physiological volume flow. Due to the presence of a complex in-vivo-like vasculature, the here shown skin equivalent has the potential for skin grafting and represents a sophisticated in vitro model for dermatological research.",

The US EPA has funded an important project to develop new high throughput technologies based on human cell based in vitro technologies. These methods are currently being incorporated into the chemical risk assessment process. In the pharmaceutical industry, the efficacy and toxicity of new drugs are evaluated during preclinical investigations that include drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety toxicology studies. The results of these studies are analyzed and extrapolated to predict efficacy and potential adverse effects in humans. However, due to the high failure rate of drugs during the clinical phases, a new approach for a more predictive assessment of drugs both in terms of efficacy and adverse effects is getting urgent. The food industry faces the challenge of assessing novel foods and food ingredients for the general population, while using animal safety testing for extrapolation purposes is often of limited relevance. The question is whether the latest paradigm shift proposed by the Tox21c report for chemicals may provide a useful tool to improve the risk assessment approach also for drugs and food ingredients.",

Besides structure and physico-chemical properties, biological similarity based on bio­logical data adds extra strength to this process. In the simplest case, chemically similar substances also show similar test results in relevant in vitro assays. This is a well-established method for the read-across of, e.g., genotoxicity assays. Larger datasets of biological and toxicological properties of hundreds and thousands of substances are becoming available, enabling big data approaches in read-across studies. In the context of developing Good Read-Across Practice guidance, a number of case studies using various big data sources were evaluated to assess the contribution of biological data to enriching read-across. An example is given for the US EPA's ToxCast dataset which allows read-across for high quality uterotrophic assays for estrogenic endocrine disruption. Similarly, an example is given for REACH registration data that enhances read-across for acute toxicity studies. A different approach is taken using omics data to establish biological similarity: Examples are given for in vitro stem cell models and short-term in vivo repeated dose studies in rats used to support read-across and category formation. These preliminary biological data-driven read-across studies show the way towards the generation of new read-across approaches that can inform chemical safety assessment.",

Unfortunately, SRs can be labour- and time-intensive, especially the reference screening and data extraction phases. Fortunately, there are several software tools available that help make screening faster and easier. However, it is not always clear which features the tools offer. Therefore, a feature analysis was performed to compare different reference screening tools as objectively as possible. This analysis enables researchers to select the most appropriate tool for their needs. Fifteen different tools were compared: CADIMA, Covidence, DistillerSR, Endnote, Endnote using Bramer's method, EROS, HAWC, Microsoft Excel, Excel using VonVille's method, Microsoft Word, Rayyan, RevMan, SyRF, SysRev.com, and SWIFT Active Screener. Their support of 21 features was tested. Features were categorised as mandatory, desirable, and optional. DistillerSR, Covidence, and SWIFT Active Screener are the tools that support all mandatory features. These tools are preferred for screening references, but none of them are free. The best scoring free tool is Rayyan, which lacks one mandatory function: distinct title/abstract and full-text phases. The lowest scoring tools are those not specifically designed for SRs, like Microsoft Word and Endnote. Their use can only be advised for small and simple SRs. A well-informed selection of SR screening tools will benefit review quality and speed, which can contribute to the advancement of the 3Rs in animal studies.",

This happens by (1) compilation of large sets of existing data, e.g., as a result of the European REACH regulation, (2) the use of omics technologies and (3) systematic robotized testing in a high-throughput manner. All three approaches and some other high-content technologies leave us with big data--the challenge is now to make big sense of these data. Read-across, i.e., the local similarity-based intrapolation of properties, is gaining momentum with increasing data availability and consensus on how to process and report it. It is predominantly applied to in vivo test data as a gap-filling approach, but can similarly complement other incomplete datasets. Big data are first of all repositories for finding similar substances and ensure that the available data is fully exploited. High-content and high-throughput approaches similarly require focusing on clusters, in this case formed by underlying mechanisms such as pathways of toxicity. The closely connected properties, i.e., structural and biological similarity, create the confidence needed for predictions of toxic properties. Here, a new web-based tool under development called REACH-across, which aims to support and automate structure-based read-across, is presented among others.",

The OECD is working on case studies to probe general applicability of RAx, and several regulations (e.g. EU-REACH) already allow this procedure to be used to waive new in vivo tests. The decision to prepare a review on the state of the art of RAx as a tool for risk assessment for regulatory purposes was taken during a workshop with international experts in Ranco, Italy in July 2018. Three major issues were identified that need optimisation to allow a higher regulatory acceptance rate of the RAx procedure: (i) the definition of similarity of source and target, (ii) the translation of biological/toxicological activity of source to target, in the RAx procedure, and (iii) how to deal with issues of ADME that may differ between source and target. The use of new approach methodologies (NAM) was discussed as one of the most important innovations to improve the acceptability of RAx. At present, NAM data may be used to confirm chemical and toxicological similarity. In the future, the use of NAM may be broadened to fully characterize the hazard and toxicokinetic properties of RAx compounds. Concerning available guidance, documents on Good Read-Across Practice (GRAP) and on best practices to perform and evaluate the RAx process were identified. Here, in particular the RAx guidance, being worked out by the European Commission's H2020 project EU-ToxRisk, together with many external partners with regulatory experience, is given.",

    "abstract": "This year marks the 60th anniversary of Russell and Burch's pioneering book, The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique. Their 3Rs framework has helped to inspire humane and scientific progress in experimental technique. However, it is time to update its strategic application. The 21st century has already seen the development of promising, high-tech non-animal models, such as organs-on-a-chip and computational approaches that, in our view, will replace animals as the default option in biomedical experimentation. How fast this transition will take place will depend on the pace at which these new models are optimized to reflect the biology of humans, rather than that of non-human animals. While the new methods are likely to reshape all areas in which animals are currently used in science, we particularly encourage their application in biomedical research, which accounts for the bulk of animals used. We call for the pursuit of a three-prong strategy that focuses on (1) advancing non-animal methods as replacements of animal experiments, (2) applying them to biomedical research, and (3) improving their relevance to human biology. As academics and scientists, we feel that educational efforts targeted at young scientists in training will be an effective and sustainable way to advance this vision. Our strategy may not promise an imminent end to the use of animals in science, but it will bring us closer to an era in which the 3Rs are increasingly perceived as a solution to a receding problem. Russell and Burch themselves surely would have welcomed these positive changes.",

The update in the guidance was essential as cell models have advanced dramatically to more complex culture systems and need more comprehensive quality management to ensure reproducibility and high-quality scientific data. This document describes six main principles to consider when performing cell culture including characterization and maintenance of essential characteristics, quality management, documentation and reporting, safety, education and training, and ethics. The document does not intend to impose detailed procedures but to describe potential quality issues. It is foreseen that the document will require further updates as the science and technologies evolve over time.",

    "abstract": "Complementing the human genome with an exposome reflects the increasingly obvious impact of environmental exposure, which far exceeds the role of genetics, on human health. Considering the complexity of exposures and, in addition, the reactions of the body to exposures - i.e., the exposome - reverses classical exposure science where the precise measurement of single or few exposures is associated with specific health or environmental effects. The complete description of an individual's exposome is impossible; even less so is that of a population. We can, however, cast a wider net by foregoing some rigor in assessment and compensating with the statistical power of rich datasets. The advent of omics technologies enables a relatively cheap, high-content description of the biological effects of substances, especially in tissues and biofluids. They can be combined with many other rich data-streams, creating big data of exposure and effect. Computational methods increasingly allow data integration, discerning the signal from the noise and formulating hypotheses of exposure-effect relationships. These can be followed up in a targeted way. With a better exposure element in the risk equation, exposomics - new kid on the block of risk assessment - promises to identify novel exposure (interactions) and health/environment effect associations. This may also create opportunities to prioritize the more relevant chemicals for risk assessment, thereby lowering the burden on hazard assessment in an expo-sure-driven approach. Technological developments and synergies between approaches, quality assurance (ultimately as Good Exposome Practices), and the integration of mechanistic thinking will advance this approach.",

    "abstract": "Safety sciences must cope with uncertainty of models and results as well as information gaps. Acknowledging this uncer­tainty necessitates embracing probabilities and accepting the remaining risk. Every toxicological tool delivers only probable results. Traditionally, this is taken into account by using uncertainty / assessment factors and worst-case / precautionary approaches and thresholds. Probabilistic methods and Bayesian approaches seek to characterize these uncertainties and promise to support better risk assessment and, thereby, improve risk management decisions. Actual assessments of uncertainty can be more realistic than worst-case scenarios and may allow less conservative safety margins. Most importantly, as soon as we agree on uncertainty, this defines room for improvement and allows a transition from traditional to new approach methods as an engineering exercise. The objective nature of these mathematical tools allows to assign each methodology its fair place in evidence integration, whether in the context of risk assessment, sys­tematic reviews, or in the definition of an integrated testing strategy (ITS) / defined approach (DA) / integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA). This article gives an overview of methods for probabilistic risk assessment and their application for exposure assessment, physiologically-based kinetic modelling, probability of hazard assessment (based on quantitative and read-across based structure-activity relationships, and mechanistic alerts from in vitro studies), indi­vidual susceptibility assessment, and evidence integration. Additional aspects are opportunities for uncertainty analysis of adverse outcome pathways and their relation to thresholds of toxicological concern. In conclusion, probabilistic risk assessment will be key for constructing a new toxicology paradigm – probably!",

Output from the workshop includes the alignment on a working definition of MPS, a detailed description of the eleven CIVM case studies presented at the workshop, in-depth analysis, and key take aways from breakout sessions on ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), pharmacology, and safety that covered topics such as qualification and performance criteria, species differences and concordance, and how industry can overcome barriers to regulatory submission of CIVM data. In conclusion, IQ MPS Affiliate and FDA scientists were able to build a general consensus on the need for animal CIVMs for preclinical species to better determine species concordance. Furthermore, there was acceptance that CIVM technologies for use in ADME, pharmacology and safety assessment will require qualification, which will vary depending on the specific COU.",

    "abstract": "In many industrial sectors, there is a need for reliable ways to evaluate the safety of chemicals with methods anchored to human biology and pathology. For this purpose, many animal-free new approach methods (NAMs) have been developed and implemented in various stages of risk assessment. Now it is time to assemble individual NAMs into a comprehensive next-generation risk assessment (NGRA) strategy. The European Horizon 2020 RISK-HUNT3R project (Risk assessment of chemicals integrating human-centric next-generation testing strategies promoting the 3Rs) has been designed to promote a combination of computational toxicology, in vitro toxicology, and systems biology. It is anticipated that this approach will lead to faster and more accurate risk assessment procedures. The RISK-HUNT3R NGRA strategy will be developed to address the implementation of a comprehensive NAM toolbox into the regulatory framework. Critical conceptual approaches of the project include i) the integration of human-relevant data on biotransformation and elimination, ii) the translation of high-content mode-of-action datasets into predictions of adverse outcomes, iii) development of quantitative adverse outcome pathways (qAOPs), and iv) quantification of uncertainties associated with the predictions based on NGRA strategies. Many of the project steps will be used iteratively to generate datasets with sufficient quality and certainty for NGRA. Scientists and regulators will work together on case studies to evaluate practical applicability of NAMs and strategies to combine information therefrom. Here we delineate how the strategy will be deployed to establish an overall NGRA framework for chemicals, pesticides, food additives, and drugs.",

    "abstract": "Both because of the shortcomings of existing risk assessment methodologies, as well as newly available tools to predict hazard and risk with machine learning approaches, there has been an emerging emphasis on probabilistic risk assessment. Increasingly sophisticated AI models can be applied to a plethora of exposure and hazard data to obtain not only predictions for particular endpoints but also to estimate the uncertainty of the risk assessment outcome. This provides the basis for a shift from deterministic to more probabilistic approaches but comes at the cost of an increased complexity of the process as it requires more resources and human expertise. There are still challenges to overcome before a probabilistic paradigm is fully embraced by regulators. Based on an earlier white paper (Maertens et al., 2022), a workshop discussed the prospects, challenges and path forward for implementing such AI-based probabilistic hazard assessment. Moving forward, we will see the transition from categorized into probabilistic and dose-dependent hazard outcomes, the application of internal thresholds of toxicological concern for data-poor substances, the acknowledgement of user-friendly open-source software, a rise in the expertise of toxicologists required to understand and interpret artificial intelligence models, and the honest communication of uncertainty in risk assessment to the public. Lay summaryProbabilistic risk assessment, initially from engineering, is applied in toxicology to understand chemical-related hazards and their consequences. In toxicology, uncertainties abound—unclear molecular events, varied proposed outcomes, and population-level assessments for issues like neurodevelopmental disorders. Establishing links between chemical exposures and diseases, especially rare events like birth defects, often demands extensive studies. Existing methods struggle with subtle effects or those affecting specific groups. Future risk assessments must address developmental disease origins, presenting challenges beyond current capabilities. The intricate nature of many toxicological processes, lack of consensus on mechanisms and outcomes, and the need for nuanced population-level assessments highlight the complexities in understanding and quantifying risks associated with chemical exposures in the field of toxicology.",

    "abstract": "The commitment to develop a roadmap for phasing out the use of animals for chemical safety assessments was part of the European Commission's response to the European Citizens' Initiative \"Save Cruelty-Free Cosmetics - Commit to a Europe Without Animal Testing\". The roadmap aims to outline milestones and specific actions to be implemented in the short to long-term to ultimately phase out animal testing for chemical safety assessments. To advance this goal and help define a structure of the roadmap, a multi-stakeholder roundtable workshop was organised by five animal protection non-governmental organisations in June 2024. The roundtable aimed to explore and define key elements and organisational structures for shaping the roadmap and identify pathways to facilitate the transition to a non-animal testing regulatory framework. Participants discussed a range of critical issues such as revising legislation and guidance, facilitating validation/qualification and regulatory acceptance, strengthening coordination, providing education and training in non-animal approaches, transparency and accessibility to data, establishing metrics to measure progress and securing funding. The importance of a multi-faceted approach integrating scientific, regulatory, policy, ethical, societal, and practical dimensions was emphasised, along with the critical role of transdisciplinary collaboration and combining diverse knowledge, ideas, and technologies to achieve optimal outcomes. This report summarises the main findings and discussion points and provides concrete recommendations. These are intended to facilitate the Commission's work to develop the roadmap and may serve as a valuable resource for similar initiatives worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Microphysiological systems (MPS), including organ-on-chip platforms and complex organoid models, represent a transformative approach to human-relevant in vitro modeling. These technol-ogies bioengineer aspects of organ architecture and functionality, revolutionizing drug development, reducing animal testing, and enabling personalized medicine approaches. Despite significant advances, several critical challenges remain before their full potential can be realized. This article examines key obstacles facing MPS adoption and implementation while proposing actionable solu-tions to accelerate their development and acceptance. Major challenges include standardization issues across terminology and protocols, validation complexities requiring robust reference com-pounds and benchmarking standards, regulatory uncertainties regarding data requirements and qualification processes, and barriers to effective data sharing among stakeholders. The paper traces the field's evolution through various international initiatives, particularly highlighting the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing's (CAAT) contributions, including the establishment of the International MPS Society and World Summits. Proposed solutions emphasize establishing global standards through international consortia, enhancing validation frameworks through specialized validation centers, fostering collaboration through pre-competitive consortia and standardized data formats, and advancing regulatory integration through detailed case studies and clear guidance documents. Future priorities focus on overcoming technical challenges in biological complexity, addressing engineering hurdles, standardizing technologies, improving data management, increasing eco-nomic accessibility, and integrating with other emerging technologies. The path forward requires coordinated, collaborative efforts across academia, industry, regulatory agencies, and technology suppliers to systematically address these interrelated challenges.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which are characterised by a progressive airflow limitation and chronic inflammation. The pathogenesis of COPD involves different cells, mainly epithelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and CD8 lymphocytes. Bronchial epithelium lines the mucosal surface of the airways, forming a mechanical barrier that separates the external environment from the internal milieu. Recently, substantial evidence has emerged indicating that airway epithelial cells are able to liberate a number of chemokines fundamental to both inflammatory and immune responses. Therefore, we established an in vitro model by showing that cigarette smoke is able to induce the release of chemokines by lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, we show that cigarette smoke induced chemokine expression is resistant to dexamethasone, mimicking the clinical situation. In contrast, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic acid, an experimental antioxidant compound, inhibited smoke induced chemokine expression. These results suggest that this epithelial cell culture model may allow the evaluation of novel anti-inflammatory compounds for the treatment of COPD directly on the relevant target cells in vitro. This approach may result in the replacement of animal experimentation in screening of new therapeutics for COPD.",

Importantly, animals have an intrinsic value, which must be respected. There are some major advances for animal welfare, many of which had however already been common practice in the more progressive Member States. The new Directive prohibits new, more progressive legislation if not already in place and thus harmonises but also freezes the 27 Member States at a relatively high level. The revision was an important opportunity for the European Commission, on the one side to demonstrate its commitment to improve human health and safety by enabling animal testing and on the other side to improve animal health and welfare by setting minimum standards. By this Directive Europe is again taking a leading role in research and development for new non-animal tests and technologies by introducing a series of measures that strengthen the evaluation of the need of animal use in each case. It also represents a formal implementation of the 3Rs principle (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animal tests) put forward by Russel and Burch 1959.",

    "abstract": "this series of articles has already addressed in vitro and in vivo tools (Hartung, 2007; Hartung, 2008b). With this contribution addressing computational toxicology we now try to complete considerations on the main methodological approaches in toxicology. However, we do still plan to address specific aspects, such as endpoints (omics, image technologies), high-throughput testing or physiology-based pharmaco-(toxico-)kinetic modelling (PBPK), in later issues. All of these aspects have major in silico components, which already shows how difficult it is to discuss in silico methods on their own. Indeed, their integration and interplay with in vivo and in vitro approaches is critical, at least in the way their development often depends critically on the input of either in vitro or in vivo data. this is a major difference to experimental approaches. An important consideration will thus be whether in silico methods are limited by the limitations of their input and whether we have any hope of overcoming their weaknesses or can only approximate them... there are some excellent introductions to and reviews of computational toxicology (Durham and Pearl, 2001; van de Waterbeemd, 2002; Greene, 2002; Veith, 2004, Helma, 2005; Simon-Hettich et al., 2006; Kavlock et al., 2008; Merlot, 2008; Nigsch et al., 2009; Greene and Naven, 2009). In addition, the ex-eCB website (http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/qsar/), hosted by Andrew Worth and his team (chronically understaffed given the high expectations) who act as key promoters of computational toxicology, is an excellent resource. the same holds true for the US-based International QSAR Foundation (http://www.qsari. org/) around Gil Veith, non-profit research organization devoted solely to creating alternative methods for identifying chemical hazards without further laboratory testing, and Angelo Vedanis Biographics laboratory 3R in Basel, Switzerland (see his article in this issue).

    "abstract": "Developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) is a serious concern for environmental chemicals, as well as for food and drug constituents. Animal-based DNT models have relatively low sensitivity, and they are burdened by high work-load, cost and animal ethics. Murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) recapitulate several critical processes involved in the development of the nervous system if they are induced to differentiate into neural cells. They therefore represent an alternative toxicological model to predict human hazard. In this review, we discuss how mESC can be used for DNT assays. We have compiled a list of mRNA markers that define undifferentiated mESC (n = 42), neural stem cells (n = 73), astrocytes (n = 25) and the pattern of different neuronal and non-neuronal cell types generated (n = 57). We propose that transcriptional profiling can be used as a sensitive endpoint in toxicity assays to distinguish neural differentiation states during normal and disturbed development. Importantly, we believe that it can be scaled up to relatively high throughput whilst still providing rich information on disturbances affecting small cell subpopulations. Moreover, this approach can provide insight into underlying mechanisms and pathways of toxicity. We broadly discuss the methodological basis of marker lists and DNT assay design. The discussion is put in the context of a new generation of alternative assays (embryonic stem cell based DNT testing = ESDNT V2.0), that may later include human induced pluripotent stem cells, and that are not designed for 1:1 replacement of animal experiments, but are rather intended to improve human risk assessment by using independent scientific principles.",

Significant progress has been made in determining the hazard potential of ingredients without animal testing. However, hazard identification is insufficient for risk assessment, and an understanding of the dose-response is needed. Obtaining such knowledge without animal testing is challenging and requires applying available mechanistic knowledge to both assay development and the integration of these data. The recent OECD report \"The Adverse Outcome Pathway for Skin Sensitization Initiated by Covalent Binding to Proteins\" presents the available mechanistic knowledge of the sensitization response within an adverse outcome pathway (AOP). We propose to use this AOP as the mechanistic basis for physiologically- and mechanistically-based toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic models of the sensitization response. The approach would be informed by non-animal data, provide predictions of the dose-response required for risk assessment, and would be evaluated against human clinical data.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need to develop data integration and testing strategy frameworks allowing interpretation of results from animal alternative test batteries. To this end, we developed a Bayesian Network Integrated Testing Strategy (BN ITS) with the goal to estimate skin sensitization hazard as a test case of previously developed concepts (Jaworska et al., 2010). The BN ITS combines in silico, in chemico, and in vitro data related to skin penetration, peptide reactivity, and dendritic cell activation, and guides testing strategy by Value of Information (VoI). The approach offers novel insights into testing strategies: there is no one best testing strategy, but the optimal sequence of tests depends on information at hand, and is chemical-specific. Thus, a single generic set of tests as a replacement strategy is unlikely to be most effective. BN ITS offers the possibility of evaluating the impact of generating additional data on the target information uncertainty reduction before testing is commenced.",

    "abstract": "The National Academy of Sciences publication, Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy, proposes a paradigm shift in toxicology from current animal-based testing towards the application of emerging technologies, i.e., assays based on human cells or non-mammalian models, high throughput testing, omics approaches, systems biology, and computational modeling. These technologies should be used to identify how chemicals interact with cellular response networks and alter them to toxicity pathways. According to the authors, such a new paradigm would provide a better scientific understanding and more adequate data to predict the adverse effects of chemicals on human health. As expected from a vision document, the report enthusiastically and optimistically describes a radical transformation of toxicology from current practices to a new approach. Several toxicologists have commented on the report, and although they generally confirm the importance of the vision, they pose critical questions regarding its feasibility. Unlike the theoretical concepts, which are carefully described, many practical aspects of how to establish the vision are less well defined. Today's technologies provide great opportunities, although many challenges remain regarding their development, implementation, and validation to adequately assess human health effects. To bring the envisioned toxicology closer to concrete implementation, it is important to identify the current knowledge gaps in the vision and develop solutions. The goal of this review is to evaluate the technologies proposed as to their maturation to transform toxicity testing in the 21st century. This paper will provide an overview of the current standing by defining advantages, limitations, and developmental needs. In doing so, I do not intend to point out obstacles but, rather, to focus on current opportunities to advance toxicity testing for human risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Validation of new approaches in regulatory toxicology is commonly defined as the independent assessment of the reproducibility and relevance (the scientific basis and predictive capacity) of a test for a particular purpose. In large ring trials, the emphasis to date has been mainly on reproducibility and predictive capacity (comparison to the traditional test) with less attention given to the scientific or mechanistic basis. Assessing predictive capacity is difficult for novel approaches (which are based on mechanism), such as pathways of toxicity or the complex networks within the organism (systems toxicology). This is highly relevant for implementing Toxicology for the 21st Century, either by high-throughput testing in the ToxCast/Tox21 project or omics-based testing in the Human Toxome Project. This article explores the mostly neglected assessment of a test's scientific basis, which moves mechanism and causality to the foreground when validating/qualifying tests. Such mechanistic validation faces the problem of establishing causality in complex systems. However, pragmatic adaptations of the Bradford Hill criteria, as well as bioinformatic tools, are emerging. As critical infrastructures of the organism are perturbed by a toxic mechanism we argue that by focusing on the target of toxicity and its vulnerability, in addition to the way it is perturbed, we can anchor the identification of the mechanism and its verification.",

    "abstract": "The air-blood barrier is mainly composed of alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. Whereas the epithelium acts as a diffusional barrier, macrophages represent an immunological barrier, in particular for larger molecules and nanoparticles. This paper describes a new co-culture of human cell lines representing both cell types. Acquiring, culturing and maintaining primary alveolar epithelial cells presents significant logistical and technical difficulties. The recently established human alveolar epithelial lentivirus immortalized cell line, hAELVi, when grown on permeable filters, form monolayers with high functional and morphological resemblance to alveolar type I cells. To model alveolar macrophages, the human cell line THP-1 was seeded on pre-formed hAELVi monolayers. The co-culture was characterized regarding cellular morphology, viability and barrier function. Macrophages were homogenously distributed on the epithelium and could be kept in co-culture for up to 7 days. Transmission electron microscopy showed loose contact between THP-1 and hAELVi cells. When grown at air liquid interface, both cells were covered with extracellular matrix-like structure, which was absent in THP-1 mono culture. In co-culture with macrophages, hAELVi cells displayed similar, sometimes even higher, trans-epithelial electrical resistance than in mono-cultures. When exposed to silver and starch NPs, hAELVi mono-cultures were more tolerant to the particles than THP-1 mono-cultures. The viability in the co-culture was similar to that of hAELVi monocultures. Transport studies with sodium fluorescein in presence/absence of EDTA proved that the co culture acts as functional diffusion barrier. These data demonstrate that hAELVi-/THP-1 co-cultures represent a promising model for safety and permeability studies of inhaled chemicals, drugs and nanoparticles.",

The Collaborative Workshop on Aquatic Models and 21st Century Toxicology was held at North Carolina State University on May 5-6, 2014, in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. Participants discussed the ways in which small fish are being used as models to screen toxicants and understand mechanisms of toxicity. Workshop participants agreed that the lack of standardized protocols is an impediment to broader acceptance of these models, whereas development of standardized protocols, validation, and subsequent regulatory acceptance would facilitate greater usage. Given the advantages and increasing application of small fish models, there was widespread interest in follow-up workshops to review and discuss developments in their use. In this article, we summarize the recommendations formulated by workshop participants to enhance the utility of small fish species in toxicology studies, as well as many of the advances in the field of toxicology that resulted from using small fish species, including advances in developmental toxicology, cardiovascular toxicology, neurotoxicology, and immunotoxicology. We alsoreview many emerging issues that will benefit from using small fish species, especially zebrafish, and new technologies that will enable using these organisms to yield results unprecedented in their information content to better understand how toxicants affect development and health.",

    "abstract": "Human differentiated cell types, such as neurons or hepatocytes, are of limited availability, and their use for experiments requiring ectopic gene expression is challenging. Using the human conditionally-immortalized neuronal precursor line LUHMES, we explored whether genetic modification in the proliferating state could be used for experiments in the differentiated post-mitotic neurons. First, alpha-synuclein (ASYN), a gene associated with the pathology of Parkinson's disease, was overexpressed. Increased amounts of the protein were tolerated without change of phenotype, and this approach now allows further studies on protein variants. Knockdown of ASYN attenuated the toxicity of the parkinsonian toxicant 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Different lentiviral constructs then were tested: cells labeled ubiquitously with green (GFP) or red fluorescent protein (RFP) allowed the quantification of neurite growth and of its disturbance by toxicants; expression of proteins of interest could be targeted to different organelles; production of two different proteins from a single read-through construct was achieved successfully by an expression strategy using a linker peptide between the two proteins, which is cleaved by deubiquitinases; LUHMES, labeled with GFP in the cytosol and RFP in the mitochondria, were used to quantify mitochondrial mobility along the neurites. MPP+ reduced such organelle movement before any other detectable cellular change, and this toxicity was prevented by simultaneous treatment with the antioxidant ascorbic acid. Thus, a strategy has been outlined here to study new functional endpoints, and subtle changes of structure and proteostasis relevant in toxicology and biomedicine in post-mitotic human cells.",

    "abstract": "Current neurotoxicity testing heavily relies on expensive, time consuming and ethically debated in vivo animal experiments that are unsuitable for screening large number of chemicals. Consequently, there is a clear need for (high-throughput) in vitro test strategies, preferably using human cells as this increases relevance and eliminates the need for interspecies translation. However, human stem cell-derived neurons used to date are not well characterised, require prolonged differentiation and are potentially subject to batch-to-batch variation, ethical concerns and country-specific legislations. Recently, a number of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons became commercially available that may circumvent these concerns. We therefore used immunofluorescent stainings to demonstrate that human iPSC-derived neurons from various suppliers form mixed neuronal cultures, consisting of different types of (excitatory and inhibitory) neurons. Using multi-well microelectrode array (mwMEA) recordings, we demonstrate that these human iPSC-derived cultures develop spontaneous neuronal activity over time, which can be modulated by different physiological, toxicological and pharmacological compounds. Additional single cell calcium imaging illustrates the presence of functional GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine receptors as well as voltage-gated calcium channels. While human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures appear not yet suitable to fully replace the rat primary cortical model, our data indicate that these rapidly differentiating, commercially available human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures are already suitable for in vitro prioritisation and effect screening studies. Further characterisation and toxicological validation is now required to facilitate acceptance and large-scale implementation of these animal-free, physiologically-relevant human iPSC-based modelsfor future neurotoxicity testing.",

Either individually or in combination, the predictive capacity is usually described in comparison to local lymph node assay (LLNA) results. In this process an important lesson from other endpoints, such as skin or eye irritation, i.e., that the variability of reference test results – here the LLNA – must be accounted for, has not yet been fully acknowledged.In order to provide assessors as well as method and strategy developers with appropriate estimates, the variability of EC3 values from repeated substance testing in the LLNA was investigated using the publicly available NICEATM (NTP Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods) LLNA database. Repeat experiments taking the vehicle into account (76 substances) or combining data over different vehicles (38 substances) were analyzed.In general, variability was higher when different vehicles were used. In terms of skin sensitization potential, i.e., discriminating sensitizers from non-sensitizers, the false positive rate ranged from 14-20%, while the false negative rate was 4-5%. In terms of skin sensitization potency, the rate to assign a substance to the next higher or next lower potency class was approx.10-15% each. In addition, general estimates for EC3 variability are provided that can be used for modelling purposes.This analysis stresses the importance of considering the LLNA variability in the assessment of skin sensitization test methods and strategies and provides estimates thereof.",

Challenges to producing a reliable assay protocol include working with nanoparticle dispersions and living cell lines, and the potential for nano-related interference effects. Here we demonstrate the use of a 96-well plate design with several measurement controls and an interlaboratory comparison study involving five laboratories to characterize the robustness of a nanocytotoxicity MTS cell viability assay based on the A549 cell line. The consensus EC50 values were 22.1 mg/L (95% confidence intervals 16.9 mg/L to 27.2 mg/L) and 52.6 mg/L (44.1 mg/L to 62.6 mg/L) for positively charged polystyrene nanoparticles for the serum-free and serum conditions, respectively, and 49.7 μmol/L (47.5 μmol/L to 51.5 μmol/L) and 77.0 μmol/L (54.3 μmol/L to 99.4 μmol/L) for positive chemical control cadmium sulfate for the serum-free and serum conditions, respectively. Results from the measurement controls can be used to evaluate the sources of variability and their relative magnitudes within and between laboratories. This information revealed steps of the protocol that may need to be modified to improve the overall robustness and precision. The results suggest that protocol details such as cell line ID, media exchange, cell handling, and nanoparticle dispersion are critical to ensure protocol robustness and comparability of nanocytotoxicity assay results. The combi­nation of system control measurements and interlaboratory comparison data yielded insights that would not have been available by either approach by itself.",

Three recent IARC Working Groups pioneered inclusion of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ToxCast program high-throughput screening (HTS) data to supplement other mechanistic evidence. In Mono­graph V110, HTS profiles were compared between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and prototypical activators across multiple nuclear receptors. For Monograph V112-113, HTS assays were mapped to 10 key characteristics of carcinogens identified by an IARC expert group, and systematically considered as an additional mechanistic data stream. Both indi­vidual assay results and ToxPi-based rankings informed mechanistic evaluations. Activation of multiple nuclear receptors in HTS assays showed that PFOA targets not only peroxisome proliferator activated receptors, but also other receptors. ToxCast assays substantially covered 5 of 10 key characteristics, corroborating literature evidence of \"induces oxidative stress\" and \"alters cell proliferation, cell death or nutrient supply\" and filling gaps for \"modulates receptor-mediated effects.\" Thus, ToxCast HTS data were useful both in evaluating specific mechanistic hypotheses and in contributing to the overall evaluation of mechanistic evidence. However, additional HTS assays are needed to provide more comprehensive coverage of the 10 key characteristics of carcinogens that form the basis of current IARC mechanistic evaluations.",

This commentary aims to evaluate the current state and future roles of various types of evidence for hazard assessment as it applies to environmental health. In its recent evaluation of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Risk Information System assessment process, the National Research Council committee singled out the term \"weight of evidence\" (WoE) for critique, deeming the process too vague and detractive to the practice of evaluating human health risks of chemicals. Moving the methodology away from qualitative, vague and controversial methods towards generalizable, quantitative and transparent methods for appropriately managing diverse lines of evidence is paramount for both regulatory and public acceptance of the hazard assessments. The choice of terminology notwithstanding, a number of recent Bayesian WoE-based methods, the emergence of multi criteria decision analysis for WoE applications, as well as the general principles behind the foundational concepts of WoE, show promise in how to move forward and regain trust in the data integration step of the assessments. We offer our thoughts on the current state of WoE as a whole and while we acknowledge that many WoE applications have been largely qualitative and subjective in nature, we see this as an opportunity to turn WoE towards a quantitative direction that includes Bayesian and multi criteria decision analysis.",

This allows exploring toxicological data on a scale far larger than previously possible.Substance similarity analysis was used to determine clustering of substances for hazards by mapping to PubChem. Similarity was measured using PubChem 2D conformational substructure fingerprints, which were compared via the Tanimoto metric. Following K-Core filtration, the Blondel et al. (2008) module recognition algorithm was used to identify chemical modules showing clusters of substances in use within the chemical universe.The Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling provides a valuable information source for hazard analysis. The most prevalent hazards are H317 \"May cause an allergic skin reaction\" with 20% and H318 \"Causes serious eye damage\" with 17% positive substances. Such prevalences obtained for all hazards here are key for the design of integrated testing strategies. The data allowed estimation of animal use.The database covers about 20% of substances in the high-throughput biological assay database Tox21 (1,737 substances) and has a 917 substance overlap with the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (~7% of CTD). The biological data available in these datasets combined with ECHA in vivo endpoints have enormous modeling potential.

    "abstract": "The (developmental) neurotoxicity hazard is still unknown for most chemicals. Establishing a test battery covering most of the relevant adverse outcome pathways may close this gap, without requiring a huge animal experimentation program. Ideally, each of the assays would cover multiple mechanisms of toxicity. One candidate test is the human LUHMES cell-based NeuriTox test. To evaluate its readiness for larger-scale testing, a proof of concept library assembled by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) was screened. Of the 75 unique compounds, seven were defined as specifically neurotoxic after the hit-confirmation phase and additional ten compounds were generally cytotoxic within the concentration range of up to 20 micromolar. As complementary approach, the library was screened in the PeriTox test, which identifies toxicants affecting the human peripheral nervous system. Of the eight PeriTox hits, five were similar to the NeuriTox hits: rotenone, colchicine, diethylstilbestrol, berberine chloride, and valinomycin. The unique NeuriTox hit, methyl-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) is known from in vivo studies to affect only dopaminergic neurons (which LUHMES cells are). Conversely, the known peripheral neurotoxicant acrylamide was picked up in the PeriTox, but not in the NeuriTox assay. All of the five common hits had also been identified in the published neural crest migration (cMINC) assay, while none of them emerged as cardiotoxicant in a previous screen using the same library. These comparative data suggest that complementary in vitro tests can pick up a broad range of toxicants, and that multiple test results might help to predict organ specificity patterns.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and animal models mimicking human T2DM are widely used to study mechanisms of disease and to develop pharmacotherapeutics. Over the last three decades, rodent models of T2DM have yielded more than 50 publications per month; however, many details of human T2DM pathogenesis remain unclear, and means of preventing disease progression remain elusive. This review investigates the reasons for this translational discrepancy by analyzing the experimental evidence from rodent models of T2DM. The analysis reveals significant species-specific differences at every level of glucose regulation, from gene/protein expression, cellular signaling, tissue and organ to whole organism level, when compared with data acquired using human cells, tissues, organs, and populations. Given the extensive species-specific barrier that creates an immutable translational gap, there is an urgent need to further employ and develop human-based research strategies to make significant strides against the current T2DM epidemic.",

    "abstract": "A biological system is more than the sum of its parts - it accomplishes many functions via synergy. Deconstructing the system down to the molecular mechanism level necessitates the complement of reconstructing functions on all levels, i.e., in our conceptualization of biology and its perturbations, our experimental models and computer modelling. Toxicology contains the somewhat arbitrary subclass \"systemic toxicities\"; however, there is no relevant toxic insult or general disease that is not systemic. At least inflammation and repair are involved that require coordinated signaling mechanisms across the organism. However, the more body components involved, the greater the challenge to reca-pitulate such toxicities using non-animal models. Here, the shortcomings of current systemic testing and the development of alternative approaches are summarized. We argue that we need a systematic approach to integrating existing knowledge as exemplified by systematic reviews and other evidence-based approaches. Such knowledge can guide us in modelling these systems using bioengineering and virtual computer models, i.e., via systems biology or systems toxicology approaches. Experimental multi-organ-on-chip and microphysiological systems (MPS) provide a more physiological view of the organism, facilitating more comprehensive coverage of systemic toxicities, i.e., the perturbation on organism level, without using substitute organisms (animals). The next challenge is to establish disease models, i.e., micropathophysiological systems (MPPS), to expand their utility to encompass biomedicine. Combining computational and experimental systems approaches and the chal-lenges of validating them are discussed. The suggested 3S approach promises to leverage 21st century technology and systematic thinking to achieve a paradigm change in studying systemic effects.",

    "abstract": "Only few cell-based test methods are described by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guidelines or other regulatory references (e.g., the European Pharmacopoeia). The majority of toxicity tests still falls into the category of non-guideline methods. Data from these tests may nevertheless be used to support regulatory decisions or to guide strategies to assess compounds (e.g., drugs, agrochemicals) during research and development if they fulfill basic requirements concerning their relevance, reproducibility and predictivity. Only a method description of sufficient clarity and detail allows interpretation and use of the data. To guide regulators faced with increasing amounts of data from non-guideline studies, the OECD formulated Guidance Document 211 (GD211) on method documentation for the purpose of safety assessment. As GD211 is targeted mainly at regulators, it leaves scientists less familiar with regulation uncertain as to what level of detail is required and how individual questions should be answered. Moreover, little attention was given to the description of the test system (i.e., cell culture) and the steps leading to it being established in the guidance. To address these issues, an annotated toxicity test method template (ToxTemp) was developed (i) to fulfill all requirements of GD211, (ii) to guide the user concerning the types of answers and detail of information required, (iii) to include acceptance criteria for test elements, and (iv) to define the cells sufficiently and transparently. The fully annotated ToxTemp is provided here, together with reference to a database containing exemplary descriptions of more than 20 cell-based tests.",

    "abstract": "Although regulatory requirements for carcinogenicity testing of chemicals vary according to product sector and regulatory jurisdiction, the standard approach starts with a battery of genotoxicity tests. If any of the in vivo genotoxicity tests are positive, a lifetime rodent cancer bioassay may be requested, which allows the detection of non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGTxC). However, under most chemical regulations the cancer bioassay is rarely requested, specific requests to obtain information on non-genotoxic mechanisms of carcinogenicity are few, and there are no OECD approved screening methods. When the in vitro genotoxicity battery is negative, usually no further carcinogenicity testing is requested. Consequently NGTxC might remain unidentified and therefore the risks they may pose to human health will not be managed. In contrast to genotoxic carcinogens NGTxC act through a large variety of specific mechanisms, and a panel of tests covering multiple biological traits will be needed.The development of an integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA) of NGTxC could assist regulatory decision makers. We examine what NGTxC are and discuss chemical regulatory requirements and limitations. With a strong drive to reduce animal testing and costs in mind, it is essential that proper and robust alternatives for animal testing methods (3Rs) for addressing non-genotoxic modes of action are developed and used. Therefore relevant in vitro mechanisms and assays are described and tentatively organized in levels of information, indicating both a possible structure of the future IATA for NGTxC and associated OECD Test Guideline development priorities.",

    "abstract": "A good experiment reported badly is worthless. Meaningful contributions to the body of science are made by sharing the full methodology and results so that they can be evaluated and reproduced by peers. Erroneous and incomplete reporting does not do justice to the resources spent on conducting the experiment and the time peers spend reading the article. In theory peer-review should ensure adequate reporting - in practice it does not. Many areas have developed reporting standards and checklists to support the adequate reporting of scientific efforts, but in vitro research still has no generally accepted criteria. It is characterized by a \"Wild West\" or \"anything goes\" attitude. Such a culture may undermine trust in the reproducibility of animal-free methods, and thus parallel the \"reproducibility crisis\" discussed for other life science fields. The increasing data retrieval needs of computational approaches (in extreme as \"big data\" and artificial intelligence) makes reporting quality even more important so that the scientific community can take full advantage of the results. The first priority of reporting standards is to ensure the completeness and transparency of information provided (data focus). The second tier is a quality of data display that makes information digestible and easy to grasp, compare and further analyze (information focus). This article summarizes a series of initiatives geared towards improving the quality of in vitro work and its reporting. This shall ultimately lead to Good In Vitro Reporting Standards (GIVReSt).",

    "abstract": "Understanding brain function remains challenging as work with human and animal models is complicated by compensatory mechanisms, while in vitro models have been too simple until now. With the advent of human stem cells and the bioengineering of brain microphysiological systems (MPS), understanding how both cognition and long-term memory arise is now coming into reach. We suggest combining cutting-edge AI with MPS research to spearhead organoid intelligence (OI) as synthetic biological intelligence. The vision is to realize cognitive functions in brain MPS and scale them to achieve relevant short- and long-term memory capabilities and basic information processing as the ultimate functional experimental models for neurodevelopment and neurological function and as cell-based assays for drug and chemical testing. By advancing the frontiers of biological computing, we aim to (a) create models of intelligence-in-a-dish to study the basis of human cognitive functions, (b) provide models to advance the search for toxicants contributing to neurological diseases and identify remedies for neurological maladies, and (c) achieve relevant biological computational capacities to complement traditional computing. Increased understanding of brain functionality, in some respects still superior to today's supercomputers, may allow to imitate this in neuromorphic computer architectures or might even open up biological computing to complement silicon computers. At the same time, this raises ethical questions such as where sentience and consciousness start and what the relationship between a stem cell donor and the respective OI system is. Such ethical discussions will be critical for the socially acceptable advance of brain organoid models of cognition.",

    "abstract": "Developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing has seen enormous progress over the last two decades. Preceding even the publication of the animal-based OECD test guideline for DNT testing in 2007, a series of non-animal technology workshops and conferences (starting in 2005) shaped a community that has delivered a comprehensive battery of in vitro test methods (IVB). Its data interpretation is covered by a very recent OECD test guidance (No. 377). Here, we aim to overview the progress in the field, focusing on the evolution of testing strategies, the role of emerging technologies, and the impact of OECD test guidelines on DNT testing. In particular, this is an example of a targeted development of an animal-free testing approach for one of the most complex hazards of chemicals to human health. These developments started literally from a blank slate, with no proposed alternative methods available. Over two decades, cutting-edge science enabled the design of a testing approach that spares animals and enables throughput for this challenging hazard. While it is evident that the field needs guidance and regulation, the massive economic impact of decreased human cognitive capacity caused by chemical exposure should be prioritized more highly. Beyond this, the claim to fame of DNT in vitro testing is the enormous scientific progress it has brought for understanding the human brain, its development, and how it can be perturbed. Plain language summaryDevelopmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing predicts the hazard of exposure to chemicals to human brain development. Comprehensive advanced non-animal testing strategies using cutting-edge technology can now replace animal-based approaches to assess this complex hazard. These strategies can assess large numbers of chemicals more accurately and efficiently than the animal-based approach. Recent OECD test guidance has formalized this battery of in vitro test methods for DNT, marking a pivotal achievement in the field. The shift towards non-animal testing reflects both a commitment to animal welfare and a growing recognition of the economic and public health impacts associated with impaired cognitive function caused by chemical exposures. These innovations ultimately contribute to safer chemical management and better protection of human health, especially during the vulnerable stages of brain development.",

    "abstract": "About 70 million chemicals have been synthesized, as registered in Chemical Abstracts Service. It is not really clear how many are found in consumer products and the environment. Why not? First, because registrations are only required for certain production volumes. Second, no organization or entity tracks increases in production volumes. I am not aware, for example, of very many new chemicals (in Europe, those notified after September 1981) that have been reregistered and subjected to additional testing demands due to higher production volume; this might be a reason why practically all new chemicals (registered from 1981-2006) have been pre-registered again for ReACH, from which they are exempted in principle. Similarly, no procedures exist to track when thresholds for registration are exceeded on a european level by different manufacturers combined, when originally only tiny amounts were produced. In europe, until 2007, the threshold for notification was 100 kg (now 1 ton) per year, which resulted in about 300 files per year. In the smaller US chemical industry the number of premarketing notifications is about 2,000 per year, giving us an idea about how few chemicals are accurately monitored in europe. third, requirements for registration differ considerably. Many chemicals enter our markets as components of products. Who registers when a sport shoe manufactured somewhere in Asia is imported and its fashionable, decorative glitter is produced by chemicals? Sure customs (and prior to ReACH directive 67/548/eeC) ask for documentation but in practice many importers are not aware of every component of the product. Fourth, many additional compounds, especially in the environment, are decomposition and reaction products. Fifth, things get really difficult when we also have to think of different formulations as particles. It is well known that nanoparticles (i.e. chemical particles typically between 1 and 100 nm) change their behavior depending on size and shape. A whole new field of nanotoxicology is emerging, which will be the subject of a future article in this series. But effects relevant to toxicity also occur on a larger scale. We know that both crystal sizes and shapes of drugs affect bioavailability and side-effects. A reasonable estimate is that people are exposed to about 100,000 relevant synthetic chemicals (84,000 are listed in the cumulative US tSCA inventory, 100,000 in the eU eINeCS inventory) in contrast to the 5,000 to 10,000 for which actually (widely varying in depth) safety assessments exist. the knowledge gap is, from this view, tremendous. this gap is even deeper if we consider the effect of chemicals in mixtures, where synergies may occur as recently addressed by the eU Council of environment Ministers (http:// register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/09/st17/st17820.en09.pdf). However, we are most likely exposed to an even larger number of chemicals, given all the naturally occurring sources. I was once very much impressed when I learned that a plant extract used as a drug can contain 40,000 substances. With regard to possible toxic properties, there is no difference between a substance produced by chemical synthesis or by the metabolism of an organism – on the contrary, some of the most toxic substances are “natural” because evolution has optimized these poisons. Similarly, there are byproducts from chemical synthesis to be considered. Petrochemicals fall somewhere in-between, as they are very heterogeneous as natural products to start with and fractionation will always remain partial.",

    "abstract": "The topic of Integrated Testing Strategies (ITS) has attracted considerable attention, and not only because it is supposed to be a central element of REACH, the ambitious European chemical regulation effort. Although what ITSs are supposed to do seems unambiguous, i.e. speeding up hazard and risk assessment while reducing testing costs, not much has been said, except basic conceptual proposals, about the methodologies that would allow execution of these concepts. Although a pressing concern, the topic of ITS has drawn mostly general reviews, broad concepts, and the expression of a clear need for more research on ITS. Published research in the field remains scarce. Solutions for ITS design emerge slowly, most likely due to the methodological challenges of the task, and perhaps also to it its complexity and the need for multidisciplinary collaboration. Along with the challenge, ITS offer a unique opportunity to contribute to the Toxicology of the 21st century by providing frameworks and tools to actually implement 21st century toxicology data in the chemical management and decision making processes. Further, ITS have the potential to significantly contribute to a modernization of the science of risk assessment. Therefore, to advance ITS research we propose a methodical approach to their design and will discuss currently available approaches as well as challenges to overcome. To this end, we define a framework for ITS that will inform toxicological decisions in a systematic, transparent, and consistent way. We review conceptual requirements for ITS developed earlier and present a roadmap to an operational framework that should be probabilistic, hypothesis-driven, and adaptive. Furthermore, we define properties an ITS should have in order to meet the identified requirements and differentiate them from evidence synthesis. Making use of an ITS for skin sensitization, we demonstrate how the proposed ITS concepts can be implemented.",

This may appear somewhat conflicting with the idea that the intrinsic value of all animals is the same, and that also several other animal species are used in biomedical research and toxicology. This aspect and many others are discussed in an introductory chapter dealing with ethical considerations on the use of dogs as laboratory animals. The report gives an overview on the use of dogs in biomedical research, safety assessment and the drug developmental process and reflects the discussion on the use of dogs as second (non-rodent)species in toxicity testing. Approximately 20,000 dogs are used in scientific procedures in Europe every year, and their distinct genetic, physiological and behavioral characteristics may support their use as models for e.g. behavioral analysis and genetic research.

    "abstract": "The development and application of new test systems and test methods is central to the progress of in vitro toxicology. In order to live up to the future challenges, it is important to use the vast knowledge of adjoining fields, such as cell biology or developmental biology, and to attract specialists from such areas to develop new methods. Not all of them bring with them the necessary experience and training required for the development of toxicological test systems. Thus, promising new biological test systems sometimes still require additional considerations to become successful. Sometimes even the referees of scientific journals and their editors seem to lack judgement guidelines for minimum performance standards. Here we provide a list of points to be considered for the establishment of a test method. The chapters range from the explanation of the meaning of positive controls, performance standards or signal-noise ratios to a discussion of statistical considerations, suitable solvents and data display formats. The considerations are simple and expressed in a non-mathematical format, with a strong focus on plausibility and common sense. The major intention of this article is to provide a compilation of important issues requiring consideration. Whether they apply to a specific system and whether action is required must be determined by individual judgement.",

At the low concentration only eleven genes belonging to the metallothionein familiy were regulated. At the higher concentration the pathway enrichment analysis for the 536 up-regulated genes showed a large number of pathways related to cancer, whereas the 424 down-regulated genes were enriched on pathways correlated to liver function. A large percentage of modified microRNAs belonged to the let-7 family, which is considered to have oncosuppressor functions. Several pathways connected to cancer were regulated at the transcription level, and miRNAs had a potential impact on the modulation of this regulation.",

    "abstract": "Threats of pyrogenicity were discovered more than a century ago. Measures to determine the safety of parenterals and, more recently, medical devices and cell therapies for human use have been in place for 70 years. Currently, there are three testing possibilities available: the Rabbit Pyrogen Test, the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate test (Bacterial Endotoxin Test), and test systems using human whole blood or human monocytes, called Monocyte Activation Test (MAT). The MAT is based on the human fever reaction and thus most closely reflects the human situation. Unfortunately, regulations and testing guidelines are not fully harmonized, despite formal international validation. Furthermore, data showing that the MAT is capable of covering the totality of possible pyrogens relevant to humans were not included in the MAT validations of the last decade. For this review we collate evidence from published literature, unpublished data of our own, and results from the international validation study to show that there is overwhelming scientific evidence to conclude that the whole blood MAT reliably detects non-endotoxin pyrogens. Therefore, further validation exercises do not seem warranted. Erratum: doi:10.14573/altex.2013.3.352&nbsp; Addendum: doi:10.14573/altex.2014.2.226 Addendum: doi:10.14573/altex.1410081",

Furthermore, there is considerable evidence that is inconsistent with the widespread notion that high levels of stress result in a large amount of corticosteroid release, and in some cases the converse is true. This review highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques used to measure corticosteroids, describes a number of studies that failed to find a positive correlation between stress and corticosteroid levels, and delineates ancillary behavioral and cognitive tests that provide insight into an animal's well-being.

Alterations to the phenotype, due to exposure to environmental insults during sensitive periods of development, are mediated through alterations in epigenetic programming in affected tissues. Originally prepared for the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), this detailed review evaluates the potential role of chemical-induced epigenetic modifications to endocrine signaling pathways during sensitive windows of exposure as a mechanism of endocrine disruption, along with the examination of potential methods for assessing such disruption. Potential targets of disruption along putative adverse outcome pathways associated with the signaling pathways are identified, along with assays that show promise in evaluating the target in a screening and testing program such that in vitro methods are used where possible, and animal experiments only where in vitro methods are not available. Monitoring such epigenetic marks in response to toxicant exposure may in future provide a valuable tool for predicting adverse outcomes, but a more robust basis for Test Guideline recommendations is still needed. Although there is evidence to suggest that epigenomic dysregulation might mediate effects of exposures to endocrine disruptors, it is uncertain as to whether these changes are truly predictive of adverse outcome(s). Adverse effects observed in the OECD transgenerational assays could be used to inform future tests specifically designed to investigate the epigenetic mechanism of action. Follow-up studies should include both an epigenetic as well as a genomic component to differentiate between the contributions of potentially compensatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Cellular resilience describes the ability of a cell to cope with environmental changes such as toxicant exposure. If cellular metabolism does not collapse directly after the hit or end in programmed cell death, the ensuing stress responses promote a new homeostasis under stress. The processes of reverting \"back to normal\" and reversal of apoptosis (\"anastasis\") have been studied little at the cellular level. Cell types show astonishingly similar vulnerability to most toxicants, except for those that require a very specific target, metabolism or mechanism present only in specific cell types. The majority of chemicals triggers \"general cytotoxicity\" in any cell at similar concentrations. We hypothesize that cells differ less in their vulnerability to a given toxicant than in their resilience (coping with the \"hit\"). In many cases, cells do not return to the naïve state after a toxic insult. The phenomena of \"pre-conditioning\", \"tolerance\" and \"hormesis\" describe this for low-dose exposures to toxicants that render the cell more resistant to subsequent hits. The defense and resilience programs include epigenetic changes that leave a \"memory/scar\" – an alteration as a consequence of the stress the cell has experienced. These memories might have long-term consequences, both positive (resistance) and negative, that contribute to chronic and delayed manifestations of hazard and, ultimately, disease. This article calls for more systematic analyses of how cells cope with toxic perturbations in the long-term after stressor withdrawal. A technical prerequisite for these are stable (organotypic) cultures and a characterization of stress response molecular networks.",

The in vitro model consists of intestinal epithelial cells, human blood-derived macrophages, and dendritic cells that are stimulated by the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. In this study, the model was utilized for evaluation of the efficacy and deposition of budesonide, an anti-inflammatory drug, in three different pharmaceutical formulations: (1) a free drug solution, (2) encapsulated into PLGA nanoparticles, and (3) encapsulated into liposomes.

The extracted skin sensitization data was analyzed to identify relationships in skin sensitization guidelines, visualize structural relationships of sensitizers, and build models to predict sensitization.A chemical with molecular weight &gt; 500 Da is generally considered non-sensitizing owing to low bioavailability, but 49 sensitizing chemicals with a molecular weight &gt; 500 Da were found.A chemical similarity map was produced using PubChem’s 2D Tanimoto similarity metric and Gephi force layout visualization. Nine clusters of chemicals were identified by Blondel’s module recognition algorithm revealing wide module-dependent variation.Approximately 31% of mapped chemicals are Michael’s acceptors but alone this does not imply skin sensitization. A simple sensitization model using molecular weight and five ToxTree structural alerts showed a balanced accuracy of 65.8% (specificity 80.4%, sensitivity 51.4%), demonstrating that structural alerts have information value.A simple variant of k-nearest neighbors outperformed the ToxTree approach even at 75% similarity threshold (82% bal­anced accuracy at 0.95 threshold). At higher thresholds, the balanced accuracy increased. Lower similarity thresholds decrease sensitivity faster than specificity.This analysis scopes the landscape of chemical skin sensitization, demonstrating the value of large public datasets for health hazard prediction.",

    "abstract": "Amid growing efforts to advance the replacement, reduction, and refinement of the use of animals in research, there is a growing recognition that in vitro testing of medical devices can be more effective, both in terms of cost and time, and also more reliable than in vivo testing. Although the technological landscape has evolved rapidly in support of these concepts, regulatory acceptance of alternative testing methods has not kept pace. Despite the acceptance by regulators of some in vitro tests (cytotoxicity, gene toxicity, and some hemocompatibility assays), many toxicity tests still rely on animals (irritation, sensitization, acute toxicity, reproductive/developmental toxicity), even where other industrial sectors have already abandoned them. Bringing about change will require a paradigm shift in current approaches to testing – and a concerted effort to generate better data on risks to human health from exposure to leachable chemicals from medical devices, and to boost confidence in the use of alternative methods to test devices. To help advance these ideas, stir debate about best practices, and coalesce around a roadmap forward, the JHU-Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) hosted a symposium believed to be the first gathering dedicated to the topic of in vitro testing of medical devices. Industry representatives, academics, and regulators in attendance presented evidence to support the unique strengths and challenges associated with the approaches currently in use as well as new methods under development, and drew next steps to push the field forward from their presentations and discussion.",

Currently, reliable animal and in vitro models to identify and test novel scar reducing therapeutics are scarce. Here we describe the development and validation of a tissue-engineered human hypertrophic scar (HTscar) model based on reconstructed epidermis on a dermal matrix containing adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC). Although obtained from normal, healthy skin, ASC, in contrast to dermal mesenchymal cells, were found to facilitate HTscar formation. Quantifiable HTscar parameters were identified: contraction; thickness of dermis, collagen-1 secretion, epidermal outgrowth, epidermal thickness, and cytokine secretion (IL-6, CXCL8). The model was validated with therapeutics currently used for treating scars (5-fluorouracil, triamcinolon) and a therapeutic known to be unsuccessful in scar reduction (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3). Furthermore, it was shown that atorvastatin, but not retinoic-acid, may provide a suitable alternative for scar treatment. Each therapeutic selectively affected a different combination of parameters, suggesting combined therapy may be most beneficial. This animal-free hypertrophic scar model may provide an alternative model for mechanistic studies as well as a novel in vitro means to test anti-scar therapeutics, thereby reducing the use of animals.",

A research strategy was formulated based on the guiding principle to adopt a toxicological mode-of-action framework to describe how any substance may adversely affect human health. The proof of the initiative will be in demonstrating the applicability of the concepts on which SEURAT-1 is built on three levels: (i) Theoretical prototypes for adverse outcome pathways are formulated based on knowledge already available in the scientific literature on investigating the toxicological modes-of-action leading to adverse outcomes (addressing mainly liver toxicity); (ii) adverse outcome pathway descriptions are used as a guide for the formulation of case studies to further elucidate the theoretical model and to develop integrated testing strategies for the prediction of certain toxicological effects (i.e., those related to the adverse outcome pathway descriptions); (iii) further case studies target the application of knowledge gained within SEURAT-1 in the context of safety assessment. The ultimate goal would be to perform ab initio predictions based on a complete understanding of toxicological mechanisms. In the near-term, it is more realistic that data from innovative testing methods will support read-across arguments. Both scenarios are addressed with case studies for improved safety assessment. A conceptual framework for a rational integrated assessment strategy emerged from designing the case studies and is discussed in the context of international developments focusing on alternative approaches for evaluating chemicals using the new 21st century tools for toxicity testing.",

The technology has become an important tool in the fields of safety sciences and drug discovery, because it can be used for mode-of-action identification, determination of hazard potency and the discovery of toxicity targets and biomarkers. In contrast to conventional biochemical endpoints, high content imaging provides insight into the spatial distribution and dynamics of responses in biological systems. This allows the identification of signaling pathways underlying cell defense, adaptation, toxicity and death. Therefore, high content imaging is considered a promising technology to address the challenges for the \"Toxicity testing in the 21st century\" approach. Currently, high content imaging technologies are frequently applied in academia for mechanistic toxicity studies and in pharmaceutical industry for the ranking and selection of lead drug compounds or to identify/confirm mechanisms underlying effects observed in vivo. A recent workshop gathered scientists working on high content imaging in academia, pharmaceutical industry and regulatory bodies with the objective to compile the state-of-the-art of the technology in the different institutions.

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, little has changed in the practice of immunotoxicity testing for regulatory purposes, especially for immunosuppression, and autoimmunity is still a challenge. Current guidelines still rely on animal tests, which include some immune endpoints in repeated dose tests and trigger dedicated tests only when certain alerts indicate a problem. At the same time, however, a wealth of in vitro approaches has been developed, but few have been adopted for routine testing. The extent to which immunotoxicity of chemicals represents a health problem for the human population at low levels of exposure is unclear: it appears that responses of healthy individuals to immunological challenges differ widely and most immunomodulators have few adverse effects except when they coincide with an infectious or malignant challenge or when early in life exposure is expected, in which cases the odds of progressing into infection, autoimmune diseases, or cancer can be changed. The enormous overcapacity of immune defense, the presence of compensatory mechanisms, and their fast restoration each contribute to limiting health threats for the individual, though on a population base also minor immunomodulation may result in increased morbidity. In vitro alternative approaches may allow screening for problematic substances and prioritize them for in vivo testing. New approaches are emerging from mapping pathways of immunotoxicity. Increasingly, the contribution of inflammatory and infectious components to the adverse outcome pathways of chemicals is recognized for various hazards, urging inclusion of tests for proinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of chemicals into integrated testing strategies.",

    "abstract": "The proximal tubule is the primary site for renal solute reabsorption and secretion and thus a main target for drug-induced toxicity. Current nonclinical methods using 2D cell cultures are unable to fully recapitulate clinical drug responses mainly due to limited in vitro functional lifespan. Since extracellular matrices are known to be key regulators of cell development, culturing cells on classic 2D plastic surfaces inevitably results in loss of differentiation. Hence, 3D models of the human proximal tubule that recapitulate the in vivo morphology would allow for improved drug screening and disease modeling. Here, the development and characterization of a 3D proximal tubule model using RPTEC/TERT1 cells is presented. RPTEC/TERT1 cells self-assembled in matrigel to form highly differentiated and stable 3D tubular structures characterized by a branched network of monolayered cells encircling a cell-free lumen, thus mimicking the proximal tubule. In vitro tubuli resembled the polarity of a proximal tubule epithelium as indicated by polar expression of Na+/K+-ATPase and ZO-3. Furthermore, 3D cultured RPTEC/TERT1 cells showed overall increased mRNA expression of xenobiotic transporters, e.g., OCTs and MATEs and de novo expression of OAT3 when compared to cultures on plastics or membrane inserts. Finally, this model was used to assess delayed cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and demonstrated increased sensitivity when compared to 2D culture. Thus, the easy-to-use model described here may prove to be useful for mechanistic investigations, e.g., in discovery of compounds interfering with tubule formation, differentiation and polarization, as well for the detection and understanding of pharmaceutical induced nephrotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Pain has a profound effect on an animal's wellbeing. In Germany, researchers using animals have been legally required since 1972 to reduce any possible pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm to an absolute minimum. To evaluate how these provisions have been implemented in practice, an assessment of refinements to experimental techniques was conducted by retrospectively reviewing 684 surgical interventions described in 506 animal research applications that were sent to the German competent authorities for approval in 2010. This paper focuses on the efficacy of proposed anesthesia and peri- and postoperative analgesia. Postoperative analgesia was not proposed for 30 % of surgeries. Following 10 % of procedures, animals were to be given pain relieving medication if the investigators decided this was necessary; however, structured assessments to detect pain were absent. Consequences of unalleviated pain and omission of pain assessment techniques are discussed, and some recommendations to improve anesthesia and analgesia are given. The findings of this review highlight the need for improvement, both to fulfil legal requirements and to improve animal welfare. To monitor compliance with animal welfare regulations, and ensure good veterinary and scientific practices, education and training needs to be intensified. Adherence to the items listed in the PREPARE and ARRIVE guidelines and the Gold Standard Publication checklist (GSPC) should become legally binding.",

    "abstract": "Historically, early identification and characterization of adverse effects of industrial chemicals was difficult because conventional toxicological test methods did not meet R&D needs for rapid, relatively inexpensive methods amenable to small amounts of test material. The pharmaceutical industry now front-loads toxicity testing, using in silico, in vitro, and less demanding animal tests at earlier stages of product development to identify and anticipate undesirable toxicological effects and optimize product development. The Green Chemistry movement embraces similar ideas for development of less toxic products, safer processes, and less waste and exposure. Further, the concept of benign design suggests ways to consider possible toxicities before the actual synthesis and to apply some structure/activity rules (SAR) and in silico methods. This requires not only scientific development but also a change in corporate culture in which synthetic chemists work with toxicologists. An emerging discipline called Green Toxicology (Anastas, 2012) provides a framework for integrating the principles of toxicology into the enterprise of designing safer chemicals, thereby minimizing potential toxicity as early in production as possible. Green Toxicology's novel utility lies in driving innovation by moving safety considerations to the earliest stage in a chemical's lifecycle, i.e., to molecular design. In principle, this field is no different than other subdisciplines of toxicology that endeavor to focus on a specific area – for example, clinical, environmental or forensic toxicology. We use the same principles and tools to evaluate an existing substance or to design a new one. The unique emphasis is in using 21st century toxicology tools as a preventative strategy to \"design out\" undesired human health and environmental effects, thereby increasing the likelihood of launching a successful, sustainable product. Starting with the formation of a steering group and a series of workshops, the Green Toxicology concept is currently spreading internationally and is being refined via an iterative process.",

    "abstract": "Investigative toxicology describes the de-risking and mechanistic elucidation of toxicities, supporting early safety decisions in the pharmaceutical industry. Recently, investigative toxicology has contributed to a shift in pharmaceutical toxicology, from a descriptive to an evidence-based, mechanistic discipline. This was triggered by high costs and low throughput of Good Laboratory Practice in vivo studies, and increasing demands for adherence to the 3R (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) principles of animal welfare. Outside the boundaries of regulatory toxicology, investigative toxicology has the flexibility to embrace new technologies, enhancing translational steps from in silico, in vitro to in vivo mechanistic understanding to eventually predict human response. One major goal of investigative toxicology is to improve pre­clinical decisions, which coincides with the concept of animal-free safety testing. Currently, compounds under preclinical development are being discarded owing to the use of inappropriate animal models. Progress in investigative toxicology could lead to humanized in vitro test systems and the development of medicines less reliant on animal tests. To advance this field, a group of 14 European-based leaders from the pharmaceutical industry founded the Investigative Toxicology Leaders Forum (ITLF), an open, non-exclusive, and pre-competitive group that shares knowledge and experience. The ITLF collaborated with the Centre for Alternatives to Animal Testing Europe (CAAT-Europe) to organize an \"Investigative Toxicology Think Tank\", which aimed to enhance interaction with experts from academia and regulatory bodies in the field. Summarizing the topics and discussion of the workshop, this article highlights investigative toxicology's position by identifying key challenges and perspectives.",

GenRA has been described in more detail in the literature (Shah et al., 2016; Helman et al., 2018). Here we present its implementation within the EPA's CompTox Chemicals Dashboard to provide public access to a GenRA module structured as a read-across workflow. GenRA assists researchers in identifying source analogues, evaluating their validity and making predictions of in vivo toxicity effects for a target substance. Predictions are presented as binary outcomes reflecting presence or absence of toxicity together with quantitative measures of uncertainty. The approach allows users to identify analogues in different ways, quickly assess the availability of relevant in vivo data for those analogues and visualize these in a data matrix to evaluate the consistency and concordance of the available experimental data for those analogues before making a GenRA prediction. Predictions can be exported into a tab-separated value (TSV) or Excel file for additional review and analysis (e.g., doses of analogues associated with production of toxic effects). GenRA offers a new capability of making reproducible read-across predictions in an easy-to use-interface.",

Rodent models are commonly used to investigate mechanism(s) of atherogenesis. However, the 3Rs principles, aiming to limit animal testing, encourage the scientific community to develop new physiologically relevant in vitro alternatives. Leveraging the 96-chip OrganoPlate®, a microfluidic platform, we have established a three-dimensional (3D) model of endothelial microvessels-on-a-chip under flow using primary human coronary arterial endothelial cells. As functional readout, we have set up an assay to measure the adhesion of monocytes to the lumen of perfused microvessels. For monitoring molecular changes in microvessels, we have established the staining and quantification of specific protein markers of inflammation and oxidative stress using high content imaging, as well as analyzed transcriptome changes using microarrays. To demonstrate its usefulness in systems toxicology, we leveraged our 3D vasculature-on-a-chip model to assess the impact of the Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2, a candidate modified risk tobacco product, and the 3R4F reference cigarette on the adhesion of monocytic cells to endothelial microvessels. Our results show that THS 2.2 aerosol-conditioned medium had a reduced effect on monocyte-endothelium adhesion compared with 3R4F smoke-conditioned medium. In conclusion, we have established a relevant 3D vasculature-on-a-chip model for investigating leukocyte-endothelial microvessel adhesion. A case study illustrates how the model can be used for product testing in the context of systems toxicology-based risk assessment. The current model and its potential further development options also open perspectives of applications in vascular disease research and drug discovery.",

The recent development of three dimensional (3-D) organotypic nasal epithelial culture models offers a physiologically robust system for studying the effects of exposure through inhalation. Exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) is associated with nasal inflammation; thus, the nasal epithelium is relevant for evaluating the pathophysiological impact of CS exposure. The present study investigated further the application of in vitro human 3-D nasal epithelial culture models for toxicological assessment of inhalation exposure. Aligned with 3Rs strategy, this study aimed to explore the relevance of a human 3-D nasal culture model to assess the toxicological impact of aerosols generated from a candidate modified risk tobacco product (cMRTP), the Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2, as compared with smoke generated from reference cigarette 3R4F. A series of experimental repetitions, where multiple concentrations of THS2.2 aerosol and 3R4F smoke were applied, were conducted to obtain reproducible measurements to understand the cellular/molecular changes that occur following exposure. In agreement with \"Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century - a Vision and a Strategy\", this study implemented a systems toxicology approach and found that for all tested concentrations the impact of 3R4F smoke was substantially greater than that of THS2.2 aerosol in terms of cytotoxicity levels, alterations in tissue morphology, secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, impaired ciliary function, and increased perturbed transcriptomes and miRNA expression profiles.",

The goals for implementation of NAMs are to efficiently identify possible chemical hazards and to gather dose-response data to inform more human-relevant safety assessment. While work proceeds to develop NAMs, there has been less emphasis on creating decision criteria or showing how risk context should guide selection and use of NAMs. Here, we outline application scenarios for NAMs in different risk contexts and place different NAMs and conventional testing approaches into four broad levels. Level 1 relies solely on computational screening; Level 2 consists of high throughput in vitro screening with human cells intended to provide broad coverage of possible responses; Level 3 focuses on fit-for-purpose assays selected based on presumptive modes of action (MOA) and designed to provide more quantitative estimates of relevant dose responses; Level 4 has a variety of more complex multi-dimensional or multi-cellular assays and might include targeted in vivo studies to further define MOA. Each level also includes decision-appropriate exposure assessment tools. Our aims here are to (1) foster discussion about context-dependent applications of NAMs in relation to risk assessment needs and (2) describe a functional roadmap to identify where NAMs are expected to be adequate for chemical safety decision-making.",

    "abstract": "For almost fifteen years, the availability and regulatory acceptance of new approach methodologies (NAMs) to assess the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME/biokinetics) in chemical risk evaluations are a bottleneck. To enhance the field, a team of 24 experts from science, industry, and regulatory bodies, including new generation toxicologists, met at the Lorentz Centre in Leiden, The Netherlands. A range of possibilities for the use of NAMs for biokinetics in risk evaluations were formulated (for example to define species differences and human variation or to perform quantitative in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). To increase the regulatory use and acceptance of NAMs for biokinetics for these ADME considerations within risk evaluations, the development of test guidelines (protocols) and of overarching guidance documents is considered a critical step. To this end, a need for an expert group on biokinetics within the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to supervise this process was formulated. The workshop discussions revealed that method development is still required, particularly to adequately capture transporter mediated processes as well as to obtain cell models that reflect the physiology and kinetic characteristics of relevant organs. Developments in the fields of stem cells, organoids and organ-on-a-chip models provide promising tools to meet these research needs in the future.",

Although approaches exist to characterize pharmacokinetic variability, there are no methods to routinely address pharmacodynamic variability. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing inter-individual variability in a human in vitro model. Specifically, we hypothesized that genetic variability across a population of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes translates into reproducible variability in both baseline phenotypes and drug responses. We measured baseline and drug-related effects in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 27 healthy donors on kinetic Ca2+ flux and high-content live cell imaging. Cells were treated in concentration-response with cardiotoxic drugs: isoproterenol (β-adrenergic receptor agonist/positive inotrope), propranolol (β-adrenergic receptor antagonist/negative inotrope), and cisapride (hERG channel inhibitor/QT prolongation). Cells from four of the 27 donors were further evaluated in terms of baseline and treatment-related gene expression. Reproducibility of phenotypic responses was evaluated across batches and time. iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes exhibited reproducible donor-specific differences in baseline function and drug-induced effects. We demonstrate the feasibility of using a panel of population-based organotypic cells from healthy donors as an animal replacement experimental model. This model can be used to rapidly screen drugs and chemicals for inter-individual variability in cardiotoxicity. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of quantifying inter-individual variability in xenobiotic responses, and can be expanded to other cell types for which in vitro populations can be derived from iPSCs. &nbsp",

Concordance across guidelines, evaluated by comparing LD50 values ≥ 2000 or < 2000 mg/kg body weight from chemicals tested multiple times between different guidelines, was at least 75% and for their own repetition more than 90%. In 2009, Bulgheroni et al. created a simple model for predicting acute oral toxicity using no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) from 28-day repeated dose toxicity studies in rats. This was reproduced here for 1,625 substances. In 2014, Taylor et al. suggested no added value of the 90-day repeated dose oral toxicity test given the availability of a low 28-day study with some constraints. We confirm that the 28-day NOAEL is predictive (albeit imperfectly) of 90-day NOAELs, however, the suggested constraints did not affect predictivity. 1,059 substances with acute oral toxicity data (268 positives, 791 negatives, all Klimisch score 1) were used for modeling: The Chemical Development Kit was used to generate 27 molecular descriptors and a similarity-informed multilayer perceptron showing 71% sensitivity and 72% specificity. Additionally, the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm indicated that similarity-based approaches alone may be poor predictors of acute oral toxicity, but can be used to inform the multilayer perceptron model, where this was the feature with highest information value.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing human variability in susceptibility to chemical toxicity is a critical issue in regulatory decision-making, but is usually addressed by a default 10-fold safety/uncertainty factor. Feasibility of population-based in vitro experimental approaches to more accurately estimate human variability was demonstrated recently using a large (~1000) panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines. However, routine use of such a large population-based model poses cost and logistical challenges. We hypothesize that a Bayesian approach embedded in a tiered workflow provides efficient estimation of variability and enables a tailored and sensible approach to selection of appropriate sample size. We used the previously collected lymphoblastoid cell line in vitro toxicity data to develop a data-derived prior distribution for the uncertainty in the degree of population variability. The resulting prior for the toxicodynamic variability factor (the ratio between the median and 1% most sensitive individuals) has a median (90% CI) of 2.5 (1.4-9.6). We then performed computational experiments using a hierarchical Bayesian population model with lognormal population variability with samples sizes of n = 5 to 100 to determine the change in precision and accuracy with increasing sample size. We propose a tiered Bayesian strategy for fit-for-purpose population variability estimates: (1) a default using the data-derived prior distribution; (2) a pilot experiment using samples sizes of ~20 individuals that reduces prior uncertainty by > 50% with > 80% balanced accuracy for classification; and (3) a high confidence experiment using sample sizes of ~50-100. This approach efficiently uses in vitro data on population variability to inform decision-making.",

This qualitative method assesses the irritancy potential of chemicals. The chorioallantoic membrane responds to injury with an inflammatory process similar to that in the rabbit eye’s conjunctival tissue. Regarding topical toxicity assessment of medical devices, ISO 10993-10 states that any skin or eye irritant material shall be directly labelled as a potential vaginal irritant without animal testing, suggesting that the irri­tation potentials for the eye and the vaginal epithelia are similar. The aim of this work was to apply the HET-CAM assay to test the irritancy potential of vaginal formulations. Vaginal semisolid medicines and lubricants currently marketed were tested along with the Universal Placebo formulation that has been shown to be clinically safe. Nonoxynol-9 (N-9), a known vaginal irritant, was enrolled as positive control (concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 100% (v/v)). The assay was conducted according to the ICCVAM – Recommended Test Method (NIH Publication No. 10-7553 – 2010). Formulations were then classified according to irritation score (IS), using the analysis methods (A) and (B). The studied vaginal formulations showed low potential for irritation. N-9 was classified as a severe irritant at concentrations above 2%, which is in line with clinical data, envisaging a possible in vitro/in vivo correlation. IS (B) was considered a more detailed classification output. Although still requiring further validation, the HET-CAM assay seems an ideal prospect for in vitro vaginal irritancy testing.",

This need is generating increased interest in the use of zebrafish embryos as both a screening tool and an alternative to mammalian test methods. A Collaborative Workshop on Aquatic Models and 21st Century Toxicology identified the lack of appropriate and consistent testing protocols as a challenge to the broader application of the zebrafish embryo model. The National Toxicology Program established the Systematic Evaluation of the Application of Zebrafish in Toxicology (SEAZIT) initiative to address the lack of consistent testing guidelines and identify sources of variability for zebrafish-based assays. This report summarizes initial SEAZIT information-gathering efforts. Investigators in academic, government, and industry laboratories that routinely use zebrafish embryos for chemical toxicity testing were asked about their husbandry practices and standard protocols. Information was collected about protocol components including zebrafish strains, feed, system water, disease surveillance, embryo exposure conditions, and endpoints. Literature was reviewed to assess issues raised by the investigators. Interviews revealed substantial variability across design parameters, data collected, and analysis procedures. The presence of the chorion and renewal of exposure media (static versus static-renewal) were identified as design parameters that could potentially influence study outcomes and should be investigated further with studies to determine chemical uptake from treatment solution into embryos. The information gathered in this effort provides a basis for future SEAZIT activities to promote more consistent practices among researchers using zebrafish embryos for toxicity evaluation.",

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently published a test guideline incorporating the “2 out of 3” defined approach (2o3 DA) for skin sensitization hazard assessment and added the kinetic direct peptide reactivity assay (kDPRA) as a stand-alone test guideline method for GHS subclassification. The 2o3 DA requires that at least two in vitro tests are conducted. The cell-based tests and the kDPRA generate, next to a binary outcome with a fixed threshold, continuous concentration-response data, which can be used in quantitative regression models to derive a PoD. The sequence of testing for the 2o3 DA is flexible. Here we compare different testing sequences and how they can be combined with kDPRA data to provide a PoD in parallel to hazard identification (hazard ID) and GHS subclassification. A set of 188 chemicals with available in vitro data was evaluated for the final PoD using these dif-ferent testing sequences. The results indicate that testing can start with DPRA / kDPRA and either of the cell-based assays, and that testing can stop after two congruent tests without major impact on the final PoD for chemicals within the applica-bility domain of the kDPRA.",

    "abstract": "Four decades of the Human Genome Project and its consequences have shown how the entrepreneurial state, through significant investment into science, can drive scientific progress and advance biomedicine. A certain fraction of diseases can now be explained as caused by genetics, and a more significant fraction as impacted by genetics. Besides another fraction caused by pathogens, the third and probably largest impactor is exposure, i.e., the many physicochemical and lifestyle factors. This article makes the case that it is time to start a Human Exposome Project, which systematically explores and catalogs the exposure side of human health and disease.The envisioned Human Exposome Project needs to be more than a scaled exposomics approach, aiming to assess the totality of relevant exposures through ~omics of human body fluids and forming exposure hypotheses. Exposomics is increasingly complemented by exposure science and biomonitoring to measure exposure, mechanistic understanding, human-relevant microphysiological systems, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) to mine these data and integrate pieces of evidence. The potential impact of AI on a possible Human Exposome Project is so substantial that we should speak of exposome intelligence (EI) because this allows us to expand our limited current knowledge to the big unknown unknowns of threats to human health.",

    "abstract": "Cosmetic products must be safe for their intended use. Regulatory bans on animal testing for new ingredients have resulted in a shift towards the use of new approach methodologies (NAMs) such as in silico predictions and in chemico / in vitro data. Defined approaches (DAs) have been developed to interpret combinations of NAMs to provide information on skin sensitization hazard and potency, three having been adopted within OECD Test Guideline 497. However, the challenge remains as to how DAs can be used to derive a quantitative point of departure for use in next generation risk assessment (NGRA). Here we provide an update to our previously published NGRA framework and present two hypothetical consumer risk assessment scenarios (rinse-off and leave-on) on one case study ingredient. Diethanolamine (DEA) was selected as the case study ingredient based on the existing NAM information demonstrating differences with respect to the outcomes from in silico predictions and in chemico / in vitro data. Seven DAs were applied, and these differences resulted in divergent DA outcomes and reduced confidence with respect to the hazard potential and potency predictions. Risk assessment conclusion for the rinse-off exposure led to an overall decision of safe for all applied DAs. Risk assessment conclusion for the higher leave-on exposure was safe when based on some DAs but unsafe based on others. The reasons for this were evaluated as well as the inherent uncertainty from the use of each NAM and DA in the risk assessment, enabling further refinement of our NGRA framework.",

    "abstract": "Proper brain development is based on the orchestration of key neurodevelopmental processes (KNDP), including the for­mation and function of neural networks. If at least one KNDP is affected by a chemical, an adverse outcome is expected. To enable a higher testing throughput than the guideline animal experiments, a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) in vitro testing battery (DNT IVB) comprising a variety of assays that model several KNDPs was set up. Gap analysis revealed the need for a human-based assay to assess neural network formation and function (NNF). Therefore, we established the human NNF (hNNF) assay. A co-culture comprised of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as primary human astroglia was differentiated for 35 days on microelectrode arrays (MEA), and spontaneous electrical activity, together with cytotoxicity, was assessed on a weekly basis after washout of the compounds 24 h prior to measurements. In addition to the characterization of the test system, the assay was challenged with 28 com­pounds, mainly pesticides, identifying their DNT potential by evaluating specific spike-, burst-, and network parameters. This approach confirmed the suitability of the assay for screening environmental chemicals. Comparison of benchmark con­centrations (BMC) with an NNF in vitro assay (rNNF) based on primary rat cortical cells revealed differences in sensitivity. Together with the successful implementation of hNNF data into a postulated stressor-specific adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network associated with a plausible molecular initiating event for deltamethrin, this study suggests the hNNF assay as a useful complement to the DNT IVB.",

    "abstract": "The EU's chemicals regulation, REACH, requires that most chemicals in the EU be evaluated for human health and ecosystem risks, with a mandate to minimize use of animal tests for these evaluations. The REACH process has been ongoing since about 2008, but a calculation of the resulting animal use is not publicly available. For this reason, we have undertaken a count of animals used for REACH. With EU legislators set to consider REACH revisions that could expand animal testing, we are releasing results for test categories counted to date: reproductive toxicity tests, developmental toxicity tests, and repeat-ed-dose toxicity tests for human health. The total animal count as of December 2022 for these categories is about 2.9 million. Additional tests involving about 1.3 million animals are currently required by a final proposal authorization or compliance check but not yet completed. The total, 4.2 million, for just these three test categories exceeds the original European Com-mission forecast of 2.6 million for all REACH tests. The difference is primarily because the European Commission estimate excluded offspring, which are most of the animals used for REACH. Other reasons for the difference are extra animals included in tests to ensure sufficient survive to meet the minimum test requirement; dose range-finding tests; extra test animal groups, e.g., for recovery analysis; and a high rejection rate of read-across studies. Given higher than forecast animal use, the upcoming debate on proposed REACH revisions is an opportunity to refocus on reducing animal numbers in keeping with the REACH mandate.",

    "abstract": "Green toxicology is marching chemistry into the 21st century. This emerging framework will transform how chemical safety is evaluated by incorporating evaluation of the hazards, exposures, and risks associated with chemicals into early product development in a way that minimizes adverse impacts on human and environmental health. The goal is to minimize toxic threats across entire supply chains through smarter designs and policies. Traditional animal testing methods are replaced by faster, cutting-edge innovations like organs-on-chips and artificial intelligence predictive models that are also more cost-effective. Core principles of green toxicology include utilizing alternative test methods, applying the precautionary principle, considering lifetime impacts, and emphasizing risk prevention over reaction. This paper provides an overview of these foundational concepts and describes current initiatives and future opportunities to advance the adoption of green toxicology approaches. Chal­lenges and limitations are also discussed. Green shoots are emerging with governments offering carrots like the European Green Deal to nudge industry. Noteworthy, animal rights and environ­mental groups have different ideas about the needs for testing and their consequences for animal use. Green toxicology represents the way forward to support both these societal needs with sufficient throughput and human relevance for hazard information and minimal animal suffering. Green toxi­cology thus sets the stage to synergize human health and ecological values. Overall, the integration of green chemistry and toxicology has potential to profoundly shift how chemical risks are evaluated and managed to achieve safety goals in a more ethical, ecologically-conscious manner. Plain language summary Green toxicology aims to make chemicals safer by design. It focuses on preventing toxicity issues early during development instead of testing after products are developed. Green toxicology uses modern non-animal methods like computer models and lab tests with human cells to predict if chem­icals could be hazardous. Benefits are faster results, lower costs, and less animal testing. The principles of green toxicology include using alternative tests, applying caution even with uncertain data, con­sidering lifetime impacts across global supply chains, and emphasizing prevention over reaction. The article highlights European and US policy efforts to spur sustainable chemistry innovation which will necessitate greener approaches to assess new materials and drive adoption. Overall, green toxi­cology seeks to integrate safer design concepts so that human and environmental health are valued equally with functionality and profit. This alignment promises safer, ethical products but faces chal­lenges around validating new methods and overcoming institutional resistance to change.",

The five discussion topics below outline some of the key issues, opportunities and research directions for the next several years: (1) How to contextualize DNT hazard with information on potential maternal toxicity or other toxicity domains (non-DNT)? Several approaches on how to use cytotoxicity data from NAMs were discussed. (2) What opportunities exist for an immediate or near-future application of the DNT-IVB, e.g. as a prioritisation step or add-on to other information? Initial examples are already emerging; the data can be used even if the battery is not converted to a defined approach. (3) How to establish data interpretation procedures for multi-dimensional endpoints that reduce dimensionality and are suitable for classification? A decision framework is required on how to use the DNT-IVB in a regulatory context. Machine-learning (AI-approaches) may provide novel classification models. (4) How can a battery of molecular initiating events (MIEs) be smartly linked to the DNT-IVB? If decisions are required, at what tier of an overall strategy would MIEs be evaluated, and how would optimally balance cost vs information yield. (5) What is the way forward to scientific validation of DNT NAMs and the DNT-IVB? A large set of animal data would be required for conventional approaches, while mechanistic information may establish relevance in other ways.",

    "abstract": "Validation has become a primary driver of the evolution of toxicological methods. Agreement at OECD level currently requires validation of new approaches for consideration in test guideline development. Several examples of this exist. However, the toxicology in the 21(st) century movement, prompted by the 2007 NRC/NAS vision document, might lead to a revolutionary change in the toxicological toolbox. The challenge is whether the validation process, as it has been formalized over the last two decades, meets the needs for this paradigm shift.The concept of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has emerged from clinical medicine, which retrospectively assesses the evidence of adequacy of a given approach. This is not typically done in prospective studies - the equivalent of validation studies might be multicenter randomized trials. Evidently, where such unambiguous evidence is available, no other assessment is necessary. EBM, however, has developed procedures, including meta-analysis, to collect and evaluate all the available evidence where no such definitive study is available. The recent successful introduction of retrospective validation, i.e. the collection and evaluation of existing evidence from various sources, represents a step in this direction. Here, we will explore new toxicological approaches via evidence-based toxicology (EBT).",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, viruses and fungi contain components that activate the innate immune system. These components, called pyrogens (Greek: pyros=fire), can occur independently of viable microorganisms and are a major safety concern in parenterally administered drugs, since they can cause severe reactions such as fever, organ failure, and shock in the recipient. So far these drugs have been tested by injecting them intravenously into rabbits and measuring their fever reaction or, alternatively, by the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) test, employing the coagulation of the hemolymph lysate of Limulus polyphemus. Both tests have inherent limitations. A new in vitro monocyte activation test (MAT) based on human whole blood, capable of measuring all pyrogens relevant to the human patient, introduced in this journal in 1995, was validated and recently accepted by European Pharmacopoeia and US FDA. This review describes its principle, development, validation and the wide spectrum of applications, such as for testing of medical devices, blood products, toxic or immunomodulatory drugs, dialysis liquids, lipidic parenterals, and air quality. This alternative method promises to replace the rabbit pyrogen test fully and to overcome several limitations of the LAL assay.",

    "abstract": "Nano is a big thing in toxicology. Articles, journals, and conferences are mushrooming, paralleling the rise of nanotechnologies but also showing the hunger of toxicology for new objects to study. Perhaps it would be better to focus on new approaches first? Nanomedicine promises new solutions for old problems, but what about the old problems of toxicology? It is a fallacy to assume that one can gain beneficial effects in the human organism without unwanted collateral effects. First, any biologically active agent perturbs physiology, hopefully as a corrective for the patient but at least requiring compensatory reactions of the healthy. Second, few agents are specific enough to have only one effect, but it is rare that we want all the effects and in the given mix of strengths. third, many agents show excess toxicity – even desired effects often become negative if excessively stimulated. this increase in negative effects is directly linked to more sensitive subpopulations (children, elderly, the diseased, those with genetic polymorphisms, etc.). thus, the promise of nanoparticles (NP) may be paid for in possible side-effects, i.e., toxicities (Garnett et al., 2006). For most manufactured NP, toxicity data are unavailable, with some exceptions for carbon black, titanium dioxide, iron oxides, and amorphous silica (Di Giacchino et al., 2009). So far nanoparticles and other nanomaterials (I will use the abbreviation NP for both but primarily thinking of particles or fibers and not e.g. nano-thick films) are, for the most part, treated by regulatory toxicology as chemicals (see last issue of this series, Hartung, 2010b). The most common definitions for NP include materials with dimensions from 1 nm (size of a sugar molecule) to 100 nm (size of a virus). Regulatory frameworks are on the way, opening up possibilities for alternative approaches (Sauer, 2009). Whether the differences between NP and their parent compounds are actually small or big problems, remains to be seen. But to quote Albert einstein: “Anyone who doesn’t take truth seriously in small matters cannot be trusted in large ones either.” When discussing alternative methods for nanoparticle toxicology, we might first look at some phrase permutations – leaving out one word in each iteration: – Alternative methods for toxicology – Methods for nanoparticle toxicology – Alternative nanoparticle toxicology – Alternative nano-methods Consideration 1: Alternative or advanced methods for toxicology?",

The problem – determining if there is a risk of specific exposures – is as old as humanity; every generation brings its own perspective and tools for examining the problem and coming to answers and solutions. Bringing this generation's tools to bear requires us to see the problem of chemical risk assessment in a different light, both in terms of testing of toxicity pathways in vitro and in the interpretation of the tests for estimating whether exposures will be safe. One key issue will be to assess when pathway perturbations are believed to be excessive, i.e., when they are deemed adverse. Redefinition of adversity based on in vitro testing will require a new perception of dose response functions as probabilities of failures, with multiple underlying processes acting sequentially and in parallel leading to failure at a cellular and an organism level. These dose response relationships for adversity will also require a computational systems biology approach for examining toxicity pathway dynamics and stress pathway overload. While the overall approach of defining adversity for in vitro endpoints and using this definition of adversity for risk assessment can be painted in broad brush strokes, as we have done here for DNA-reactive compounds, it will take implementation with a series of prototypes to show the process in practice.",

    "abstract": "Several alternative methods to replace animal experiments have been accepted by legal bodies. An even larger number of tests are under development or already in use for non-regulatory applications or for the generation of information stored in proprietary knowledge bases. The next step for the use of the different in vitro methods is their combination into integrated testing strategies (ITS) to get closer to the overall goal of predictive \"in vitro-based risk evaluation processes.\" We introduce here a conceptual framework as the basis for future ITS and their use for risk evaluation without animal experiments. The framework allows incorporation of both individual tests and already integrated approaches. Illustrative examples for elements to be incorporated are drawn from the session \"Innovative technologies\" at the 8th World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences, held in Montreal, 2011. For instance, LUHMES cells (conditionally immortalized human neurons) were presented as an example for a 2D cell system. The novel 3D platform developed by InSphero was chosen as an example for the design and use of scaffold-free, organotypic microtissues. The identification of critical pathways of toxicity (PoT) may be facilitated by approaches exemplified by the MatTek 3D model for human epithelial tissues with engineered toxicological reporter functions. The important role of in silico methods and of modeling based on various pre-existing data is demonstrated by Altamira's comprehensive approach to predicting a molecule's potential for skin irritancy. A final example demonstrates how natural variation in human genetics may be overcome using data analytic (pattern recognition) techniques borrowed from computer science and statistics. The overall hazard and risk assessment strategy integrating these different examples has been compiled in a graphical work flow.",

    "abstract": "The whole blood pyrogen test was first described in this journal exactly twenty years ago. It employs the cytokine response of blood monocytes for the detection of microbiological contaminants with the potential to finally replace the still broadly used rabbit pyrogen test. The article reviews its development process, the current status of the test as well as the challenges and missed opportunities. The article highlights the enormous efforts of many people to get the test to where it is today. But it also shows the incredible missed opportunities for implementation and thus sparing about 400,000 rabbits still used for this purpose per year worldwide; in the EU, since the official acceptance of the test, the number of animals used for pyrogen testing did not fall but increased by about 10,000 to 170,000. The test is the first solution enabling adequate pyrogen testing of cell therapies, including blood transfusions, and medical devices, but has not been implemented for either application by authorities. As the test can quantitatively assess human-relevant airborne pyrogens, the contribution of pyrogens to chronic obstructive lung diseases and childhood asthma can for the first time be defined and home and workplace safety improved in the future.",

This has renewed the interest towards alternative methods such as QSAR in the regulatory context. The assessment of Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) required by these regulations is expensive, in terms of costs, time, and laboratory animal sacrifices. Herein, we present QSAR models based on the ANTARES dataset, which is a large collection of known and verified experimental BCF data. Among the models developed, the best results were obtained from a nine-descriptor highly predictive model. This model was derived from a training set of 608 chemicals and challenged against a validation and blind set containing 152 and 76 chemicals. The model's robustness was further controlled through several validation strategies and the implementation of a multi-step approach for the applicability domain. Suitable safety margins were used to increase sensitivity. The easy interpretability of the model is ensured by the use of meaningful biokinetics descriptors. The satisfactory predictive power for external compounds suggests that the new models could represent a reliable alternative to the in vivo assay, helping the registrants to fulfill regulatory requirements in compliance with the ethical and economic necessity to reduce animal testing.",

    "abstract": "Legislation and prospective legislative proposals internationally (may) require that chemicals be tested for their ability to disrupt the hormonal systems of mammals. Chemicals found to test positive in vitro are considered to be endocrine active substances (EAS) and may be putative endocrine disruptors (EDs) in vivo. While there is a growing body of international in vitro test guidelines addressing EAS mechanisms and modes of action, to date there are still few or no standardized methods to incorporate metabolic and toxicokinetic aspects into these in vitro tests for EAS. In vitro assays for EAS should incorporate metabolic enzyme systems to better address the relevance of EAS tests to in vivo adverse outcome pathways, and a previous OECD review paper indicated how this could be done. This paper revisits those recommendations, addressing where research and funding efforts are needed to expedite the development of suitable in vitro metabolism systems to improve the accuracy of in vitro assays for identifying EAS and EDs. Recommendations are made for projects to support short, medium, and long-term goals. The complexity of in vivo metabolism presents major challenges for the development of predictive models suitable for the extrapolation of data from in silico/in vitro approaches to models that can occur in vivo. Therefore, the long-term recommendations are intended to foster an international harmonization of databases, delineation of metabolic pathways, and development of predictive tools that will provide a fundamental understanding of the processes by which metabolism occurs, increasing the predictive accuracy of in silico/in vitro methods.",

    "abstract": "Despite being widely used for basic and preclinical studies in dermatology, available animal models only partly reca­pitulate human skin features, often leading to disappointing outputs when preclinical results are translated to the clinic. Therefore, the need to develop alternative, non-animal models is widely recognized to more closely recapitulate human skin pathophysiology and to address the pressing ethical demand to reduce the number of animals used for research purposes, following the globally accepted 3Rs principle (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement). Skin is the outermost organ of the body, and is, as such, easily accessible. Different skin cell types can be propagated in vitro, and skin can be reconstructed for therapeutic transplantation as well as for in vitro modelling of pathophysiological conditions. Bio­engineered skin substitutes have been developed and have evolved from elementary to complex systems, more and more closely resembling complete skin architecture and biological responses. In silico analyses take advantage of the huge amount of data already available from human studies to identify and model molecular pathways involved in skin pathophysiology without further animal testing. The present review recapitulates the available non-animal models for der­matological research and sheds light on their prospective technological evolution.",

The overall number of animals used for scientific purposes in these countries, i.e., about 11 million/year, remained relatively constant between 1995 and 2011, with net increases in Germany and the UK and net decreases in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden. The relatively low and constant numbers of experimental animals used for safety assessment (toxicology, 8%) may be due to the particularly intensive research on alternative methods in this area. The many efficiently working NGOs, multiple initiatives of the European Parliament, and coordinated activities of industry and the European Commission may have contributed to keeping the animal numbers in this field in check.Basic biological science, and research and development for medicine, veterinary and dentistry together currently make up 65% of animal use in science. Although the total numbers have remained relatively constant, consumption of transgenic animals has increased drastically; in Germany transgenic animals accounted for 30% of total animal use in 2011. Therefore, more focus on alternatives to the use of animals in biomedical research, in particular on transgenic animals, will be important in the future. One initiative designed to provide inter-sector information exchange for future actions is the \"MEP – 3Rs scientists pairing scheme\" initiated in 2015 by CAAT-Europe and MEP Pietikäinen.",

Model compounds tested included triiodothyronine (T3), propylthiouracil (PTU), methimazole (MMI), sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) and amiodarone hydrochloride (AMI), selected to represent different modes of action affecting thyroid activity. Tested time windows included 48-120 hours post fertilization (hpf), 0-72 hpf and 0-120 hpf. All tested compounds resulted in developmental changes, with T3 being the most potent. The developmental parameters affected included reflective iridophores, beat and glide swimming, inflated swim bladders, as well as resorbed yolk sacs. These effects are only evident by 120 hpf and therefore an existing General Morphology Score (GMS) system was extended to create a General Developmental Score(GDS) that extends beyond the 72 hpfscoring limit of GMS and includes additional parameters that are affected by exposure to model thyroid-active compounds. Moreover, the GDS is cumulative as it includes not only the scoring of developmental morphologies but also integrates developmental dysmorphologies. Exposures from 48-120 hpf did not provide additional information to exposures from 0-120 hpf. The results indicate that the zebrafish GDS can detect the developmental toxicity of thyroid toxicants and may be of use in an integrated testing strategy to reduce, refine and in certain cases replace animal testing.",

The threshold criteria are prescribed in the respective OECD test guidelines and the conclusion is used for regulatory hazard assessment, i.e., classification and labelling of the substance. We can identify a borderline range (BR) around the classification threshold within which test results are inconclusive due to a test method's biological and technical variability. We quantified BRs in the prediction models of the non-animal test methods DPRA, LuSens and h-CLAT, and of the animal test LLNA, respectively. Depending on the size of the BR, we found that between 6% and 28% of the substances in the sets tested with these methods were considered borderline. When the results of individual non-animal test methods were combined into integrated testing strategies (ITS), borderline test results of individual tests also affected the overall assessment of the skin sensitization potential of the testing strategy. This was analyzed for the 2-out-of-3 ITS: Four out of 40 substances (10%) were considered borderline. Based on our findings we propose expanding the standard binary classification of substances into \"positive\"/\"negative\" or \"hazardous\"/\"non-hazardous\" by adding a \"borderline\" or \"inconclusive\" alert for cases where test results fall within the borderline range.",

Research to prevent DR is hindered by a lack of experimental model systems that faithfully reproduce the disease pathology, in particular for type 2 diabetes, which requires prolonged disease progression in animals to develop some hallmarks of DR. Here, we introduce an alternative in vitro model system for DR, based on serum-free, organotypic rodent retinal explant cultures, which allow physiological and pharmacological manipulation of the retina for up to two weeks under tightly controlled conditions. Retinal explant cultures have the advantage of isolating direct neuronal consequences of diabetic conditions from indirect systemic effects mediated via the retinal vasculature or the immune system. Exposed to conditions emulating type 1 or type 2 diabetes, retinal explants displayed elevated cell death rates among inner retinal neurons as well as photoreceptors, with a particularly strong loss of cone photoreceptors. Our results support a direct impact of diabetic conditions on retinal neurons and may help explain color vision defects observed in DR patients. This serum-free in vitro DR model avoids the animal suffering of established DR models and reduces the overall number of animals needed for such research. It should prove useful to study the mechanisms of neuronal cell death caused by DR and to screen for potential future DR treatments.",

Results revealed little use of quantitative animal or human kinetic data in risk evaluations of food chemicals, compared with pesticides and medicines. Risk evaluations of medicines provided sufficient in vivo kinetic data from different species to evaluate the predictive value of animal kinetic data for humans. These data showed a relatively poor correlation between the in vivo bioavailability in rats and dogs versus that in humans. In contrast, in vitro (human) kinetic data have been demonstrated to provide adequate predictions of the fate of compounds in humans, using appropriate in vitro-in vivo scalers and by integration of in vitro kinetic data with in silico kinetic modelling. Even though in vitro kinetic data were found to be occasionally included within risk evaluations of food chemicals, particularly results from Caco-2 absorption experiments and in vitro data on gut-microbial conversions, only minor use of in vitro methods for metabolism and quantitative in vitro-in vivo extrapolation methods was identified. Yet, such quantitative predictions are essential in the development of alternatives to animal testing as well as to increase human relevance of toxicological risk evaluations. Future research should aim at further improving and validating quantitative alternative methods for kinetics, thereby increasing regulatory acceptance of non-animal kinetic data.",

The idea is that such threshold values do not need to be established for each and every chemical based on experimental data, but that by analyzing the distribution of lowest orno-effect doses of many chemicals, a TTC can be defined – typically using the 5th percentile of this distribution and lowering it by an uncertainty factor of, e.g., 100. In doing so, TTC aims to compare exposure information (dose) with a threshold below which any hazard manifestation is very unlikely to occur. The history and current developments of this concept are reviewed and the application of TTC for different regulated products and their hazards is discussed. TTC lends itself as a pragmatic filter to deprioritize testing needs whenever real-life exposures are much lower than levels where hazard manifestation would be expected, a situation that is called \"negligible exposure\" in the REACH legislation, though the TTC concept has not been fully incorporated in its implementation (yet). Other areas and regulations – especially in the food sector and for pharmaceutical impurities – are more proactive. Large, curated databases on toxic effects of chemicals provide us with the opportunity to set TTC for many hazards and substance classes and thus offer a precautionary second tier for risk assessments if hazard cannot be excluded. This allows focusing testing efforts better on relevant exposures to chemicals.",

Malformations arise if NCC migration and differentiation are impaired genetically or by toxicants. In the currently available test systems for migration inhibition of NCC (MINC), the manual generation of a cell-free space results in extreme operator dependencies, and limits throughput. Here a new test format was established. The assay avoids scratching by plating cells around a commercially available circular stopper. Removal of the stopper barrier after cell attachment initiates migration. This microwell-based circular migration zone NCC function assay (cMINC) was further optimized for toxicological testing of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived NCCs. The challenge of obtaining data on viability and migration by automated image processing was addressed by developing a freeware. Data on cell proliferation were obtained by labelling replicating cells, and by careful assessment of cell viability for each experimental sample. The role of cell proliferation as an experimental confounder was tested experimentally by performing the cMINC in the presence of the proliferation-inhibiting drug cytosine arabinoside (AraC), and by a careful evaluation of mitotic events over time. Data from these studies led to an adaptation of the test protocol, so that toxicant exposure was limited to 24 h. Under these conditions, a prediction model was developed that allows classification of toxicants as either inactive, leading to unspecific cytotoxicity, or specifically inhibiting NC migration at non-cytotoxic concentrations.",

In this study, we developed a 3-dimensional synovial membrane model made of either human primary synovial cell suspensions or a mix of primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes and CD14+ mononuclear cells. We analyzed the composition of the mature micromasses by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry and showed that the outer surface forms a lining layer consisting of fibroblast-like and macrophage-like cells, reflecting the in vivo naïve synovial membrane. To model the affected synovial membrane in rheu­matoid arthritis (RA), micromasses were exposed to the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which led to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and production, and to hyperplasia of the membrane. To recreate the synovial membrane in osteoarthritis (OA), the micromasses were exposed to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which led to fibrosis-like changes of the membrane, including increased alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and increased expression of fibrosis-related genes PLOD2 and COL1A1. Interestingly, the macrophages in the micromasses showed phenotypic plasticity, as prolonged TNF-α or TGF-β stimulation strongly reduced the occurrence of CD163+ M2-like macrophages. We show the plasticity of the micromasses as a synovial model for studying RA and OA pathology and propose that the synovial lining micromass system can be a good alternative for drug testing.",

Historical animal control group data collected in a repository could be used to construct virtual control groups (VCGs) for toxicity studies. VCGs are an established concept in clinical trials, but the idea of replacing living beings with virtual data sets has so far not been introduced into the design of regulatory animal studies. The use of VCGs has the potential to reduce animal use by 25% by replacing control group animals with existing randomized data sets. Prerequisites for such an approach are the availability of large and well-structured control data sets as well as thorough statistical evaluations. The foundation of data-sharing has been laid within the Innovative Medicines Initiatives projects eTOX and eTRANSAFE. To establish proof of principle, participating companies have started to collect control group data for subacute (4-week) GLP studies with Wistar rats (the strain preferentially used in Europe) and are characterizing these data for its variability. In a second step, the control group data will be shared among the companies, and cross-company variability will be investigated. In a third step, a set of studies will be analyzed to assess whether the use of VCG data would have influenced the outcome of the study compared to the real control group.",

    "abstract": "A sizeable proportion of drug attrition is due to drug-induced seizures. Current available animal models frequently fail to predict human seizure liability. Therefore, there is a need for in vitro alternatives, preferably based on human-derived neurons to circumvent interspecies translation. The increasing number of commercially available human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal models holds great promise for replacing rodent primary cultures. We therefore tested three different hiPSC-derived neuronal models for their applicability for in vitro seizure liability assessment. Using immunofluorescent staining and multi-well micro-electrode arrays we show that all models develop functional neuronal networks that exhibit spontaneous activity and (network) bursting behavior. Developmental patterns differ between the models, probably due to differences in model composition and seeding density. Nevertheless, neuronal activity and (network) bursting can be reproducibly modulated with the seizurogenic compounds strychnine, picrotoxin (PTX) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). However, the sensitivity and degree of chemical-induced effects differs between the models, which can likely be explained by differences in seeding density, maturation and different ratios of inhibitory and excitatory cell types. Importantly, compared to rat primary cortical neurons, the hiPSC-derived neuronal models were equally, or even better in the case of 4-AP, suited to detect seizurogenicity. Overall, our data indicate that hiPSC-derived neuronal models may in the future be used as a first screening tool for in vitro seizure liability assessment. However, before hiPSC-derived neuronal models can fully replace animal experiments, more compounds should be tested and the available models must be further characterized to fully understand their applicability.",

    "abstract": "The lack of adequate toxicity data for the vast majority of chemicals in the environment has spurred the development of new approach methodologies (NAMs). This study aimed to develop a practical high-throughput in vitro model for rapidly evaluating potential hazards of chemicals using a small number of human cells. Forty-two compounds were tested using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells (hepatocytes, neurons, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells), and a primary endothelial cell line. Both functional and cytotoxicity endpoints were evaluated using high-content imaging. Concentration-response was used to derive points-of-departure (POD). PODs were integrated with ToxPi and used as surrogate NAM-based PODs for risk characterization. We found chemical class-specific similarity among the chemicals tested; metal salts exhibited the highest overall bioactivity. We also observed cell type-specific patterns among classes of chemicals, indicating the ability of the proposed in vitro model to recognize effects on different cell types. Compared to available NAM datasets, such as ToxCast/Tox21 and chemical structure-based descriptors, we found that the data from the five-cell-type model was as good or even better in assigning compounds to chemical classes. Additionally, the PODs from this model performed well as a conservative surrogate for regulatory in vivo PODs and were less likely to underestimate in vivo potency and potential risk compared to other NAM-based PODs. In summary, we demonstrate the potential of this in vitro screening model to inform rapid risk-based decision-making through ranking, clustering, and assessment of both hazard and risks of diverse environmental chemicals.",

The new report is the first to correspond to the requirements of the new Directive 2010/63/EU. Beside minor problems in reporting, the new reporting format is a major step forward, with additional new categories like severity allowing insight into animal use related questions that goes far beyond the previous reports. An in-depth analysis confirms a slight decrease in animal use from 2015 to 2017, but also compared to the 2005, 2008 and 2011 reports, though the new reporting scheme makes this comparison difficult. Notable success is evident for replacing rabbit pyrogen testing but, in general, the implementation of accepted alternative methods lags behind expec­tations. Beside the roughly 10 million animals per year covered in the report, about 8 million animals were identified that fall under the Directive but are not included in this number. Their omission downplays the impact of REACH on animal use. The report, second to none in its detail internationally, represents an important instrument for benchmarking and strategi­cally focusing activities in the 3Rs.",

    "abstract": "Food contact materials (FCMs) are perceived as major sources of chemical food contamination, bringing signif­icant safety uncertainties into the food chain. Consequently, there has been an increasing demand to improve hazard and risk assessment of FCMs. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) coupled to a genotoxicity bio­assay has been promoted as an alternative approach to assess food packaging migrates. To investigate the value of such a testing approach, a sensitive planar SOS-Umu-C assay has been developed using the Salmonella strain. The new conditions established based on HPTLC were verified by comparison with microtiter plate assays, the Ames and Salmonella-SOS-Umu-C assays. The lowest effective concentration of the genotoxin 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (0.53 nM; 20 pg/band) in the SOS-Umu-C assay was 176 times lower than in the microtiter plate counterpart. This was achieved by the developed chromatographic setup, including a fluorogenic instead of chromogenic substrate. As proof-of-principle, FCM extracts and migrates from differently coated tin cans were analyzed. The performance data highlighted reliable dose-response curves, good mean reproducibility, no quenching or other matrix effects, no solvent exposure limitations, and no need for a solid phase extraction or concentration step due to high sensitivity in the picomolar range. Although further performance developments of the assay are still needed, the developed planar assay was successfully proven to work quantitatively in the food packaging field.",

    "abstract": "Human cell-based neural organoids are increasingly being used for investigations of neurotoxicity and to study the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we present a fast and robust method to generate 3D cultured human dopaminergic neurons (LUHMES) for toxicity testing and long-term culture. Moreover, a plating step was introduced to allow generation of neurite networks with a defined 2D orientation and several mm length while all cell bodies (somata) remained in a 3D, dome-like structure. These cultures, named 2.5D (for 2.5 dimensional), offer new approaches to quantify toxicant effects on organoids by standard technology and in high throughput. For instance, the system reacted to the parkinsonian model toxicants MPP+, rotenone and MG-132, and to the ferroptosis-inducer erastin. Moreover, stable incorporation of human stem cell-derived astrocytes or microglia was possible. Addition of astrocytes stabilized the post mitotic state of the LUHMES neurons and thereby allowed formation of a stable microphysiological system. Neuroprotection against the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and the ferroptosis-inducer erastin was mediated by such glia, exemplifying the crucial protective role of astrocytes in neurodegeneration. The modularity of the system was further employed to incorporate microglia together with astrocytes into the organoids. Such ratio-defined, three cell type-based organoids will allow new approaches to study human pathophysiology and toxicology of the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "The use of new approach methodologies (NAMs) in support of read-across (RAx) approaches for regulatory purposes is a main goal of the EU-ToxRisk project. To bring this forward, EU-ToxRisk partners convened a workshop in close collaboration with regulatory representatives from key organizations including European regulatory agencies, such as the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), as well as the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS), national agencies from several European countries, Japan, Canada and the USA, as well as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). More than a hundred people actively participated in the discussions, bringing together diverse viewpoints across academia, regulators and industry. The discussion was organized starting from five practical cases of RAx applied to specific problems that offered the oppor-tunity to consider real examples. There was general consensus that NAMs can improve confidence in RAx, in particular in defining category boundaries as well as characterizing the similarities/dissimilarities between source and target substances. In addition to describing dynamics, NAMs can be helpful in terms of kinetics and metabolism that may play an important role in the demonstration of similarity or dissimilarity among the members of a category. NAMs were also noted as effective in providing quanti-tative data correlated with traditional no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) used in risk assessment, while reducing the uncertainty on the final conclusion. An interesting point of view was the advice on calibrating the number of new tests that should be carefully selected, avoiding the allure of \"the more, the better\". Unfortunately, yet unsurprisingly, there was no single approach befitting every case, requiring careful analysis delineating the optimal approach. Expert analysis and assessment of each specific case is still an important step in the process.",

    "abstract": "Chemical read-across is commonly evaluated without specific knowledge of the biological mechanisms leading to observed adverse outcomes in vivo. Integrating data that indicate shared modes of action in humans will strengthen read-across cases. Here we studied transcriptomic responses of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) to a large panel of carboxylic acids to include detailed mode-of-action data as a proof-of-concept for read-across in risk assessment. In rodents, some carboxylic acids, including valproic acid (VPA), are known to cause hepatic steatosis, whereas others do not. We investigated transcriptomics responses of PHHs exposed for 24 h to 18 structurally different VPA analogues in a concentration range to determine biological similarity in relation to in vivo steatotic potential. Using a targeted high-throughput screening assay, we assessed the differential expression of ~3,000 genes covering relevant biological pathways. Differentially expressed gene analysis revealed differences in potency of carboxylic acids, and expression patterns were highly similar for structurally similar compounds. Strong clustering occurred for steatosis-positive versus steatosis-negative carboxylic acids. To quantitatively define biological read-across, we combined pathway analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Active carboxylic acids displayed high similarity in gene network modulation. Importantly, free fatty acid synthesis modulation and stress pathway responses are affected by active car­boxylic acids, providing coherent mechanistic underpinning for our findings. Our work shows that transcriptomic analysis of cultured human hepatocytes can reinforce the prediction of liver injury outcome based on quantitative and mechanistic biological data and support its application in read-across.",

The guideline methods provide continuous data that could charac-terize the sensitization potency on a more granular scale beyond (sub)classifications. We assembled a comprehensive database of in vitro and in vivo results from OECD guideline tests. Building on a previous approach using regression models, we provide quantitative models using input data from the kinetic direct peptide reactivity assay (kDPRA), the KeratinoSens™ (KS) assay, and the human cell line activation test (h-CLAT) to calculate a point of departure (PoD) in the form of a predicted local lymph node assay (LLNA) EC3 value for use in risk assessment. Predictive models include results from either two or all three assays. Detailed analysis versus in vivo data estimates redundancy between different tests and helps guide model selection. All models were tested on a set of case studies selected for their availability of multiple LLNA reference data in the OECD database. The predicted PoDs were within or close to the range of the variation of the historical LLNA data for most of these cases studies, and overall, the models predicted the in vivo value with a median fold-misprediction factor of around 2.5. The robustness of the models was characterized by comparing a comprehensive historical database versus the curated dataset provided by the OECD working group on DA.",

The goal was to explore integration of systematic review with mechanistic evidence evaluation. Participants were invited to work on concrete products to advance the exploration of how evidence-based approaches can support the development and application of adverse outcome pathways (AOP) in chemical risk assessment. The workshop discussions were centered around three related themes: 1) assessing certainty in AOPs, 2) literature-based AOP development, and 3) integrating certainty in AOPs and non-animal evidence into decision frameworks. Several challenges, mostly related to methodology, were identified and largely determined the workshop recommendations. The workshop recommendations included the comparison and potential alignment of processes used to develop AOP and systematic review methodology, including the translation of vocabulary of evidence-based methods to AOP and vice versa, the development and improvement of evidence mapping and text mining methods and tools, as well as a call for a fundamental change in chemical risk and uncertainty assessment methodology if to be conducted based on AOPs and new approach methodologies (NAM). The usefulness of evidence-based approaches for mechanism-based chemical risk assessments was stressed, particularly the potential contribution of the rigor and transparency inherent to such approaches in building stakeholders’ trust for implementation of NAM evidence and AOPs into chemical risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Publication of scientific findings is fundamental for research, pushing innovation and generating interventions that benefit society, but it is not without biases. Publication bias is generally recognized as a journal’s preference for publishing studies based on the direction and magnitude of results. However, early evidence of a newly recognized type of publication bias has emerged in which journal policy, peer reviewers, or editors request that animal data be provided to validate studies produced using nonanimal-based approaches. We describe herein “animal methods bias” in publishing: a preference for animal-based methods where they may not be necessary or where nonanimal-based methods may be suitable, which affects the likelihood of a manuscript being accepted for publication. To gather evidence of animal methods bias, we set out to collect the experiences and perceptions of scientists and reviewers related to animal- and nonanimal-based experiments during peer review. We created a cross-sectional survey with 33 questions that was completed by 90 respondents working in various biological fields. Twenty-one survey respondents indicated that they have carried out animal-based experiments for the sole purpose of anticipating reviewer requests. Thirty-one survey respondents indicated that they have been asked by peer reviewers to add animal experimental data to their nonanimal study; 14 of these felt the request was sometimes justified, and 11 did not think it was justified. The data presented provide preliminary evidence of animal methods bias and indicate that status quo and conservatism biases may explain such attitudes by peer reviewers and editors.",

    "abstract": "I would like to devote the first article of this series that I am writing after my move to the US to the topic that has become my chair’s designation, i.e. evidence-based toxicology. this topic is really close to my heart. It all began in 1993, when my friend edmund “edi” Neugebauer co-edited the book “Handbook of Mediators in Septic Shock” (Neugebauer and Holaday, 1993). To the best of my knowledge, this was the first book to apply principles of evidence-based medicine (eBM) not only to clinical studies but also to animal studies and in vitro experimental work. So, when I started at eCVAM in 2002 and was developing ideas for possible directions to take, my list included evidence-based toxicology, i.e. the translation of eBM (for an introduction to this see, for example, Mayer, 2004) to toxicology, as a most interesting option. I was most fortunate that a Ph.D. student of mine at that time, Sebastian Hoffmann, who is a statistician by training, not only joined me to go from Konstanz to eCVAM, but agreed to refocus his thesis under my supervision to developing the concepts of an evidence-based toxicology (eBt). His thesis “evidence-based in vitro toxicology,” submitted in January 2005 to the University of Konstanz (Hoffmann, 2005), is the first extensive publication on EBT, as far as I am aware. Sure, there were a few previous attempts to link eBM and toxicology (Buckley and Smith, 1996), especially in the discussion around the toxicity of amalgam (Dodes, 2001). Also, Phil Guzelian and co-authors (Guzelian et al., 2005) independently developed a concept for eBt, though they took a different approach, focusing on causation and not on method evaluation (see below). One might ask whether these “Food for thought” articles are not the opposite of evidence-based. they are by purpose personal, provocative, not really peer-reviewed, not evaluated by statistics, broad in scope, etc. that is correct, but they also do not pretend to produce new knowledge but try to challenge common beliefs and stimulate new thinking. By this, they might, however, occasionally initiate a systematic review in the spirit of eBM and eBt. With this disclaimer in mind, let’s get into evidence-based science. Consideration 1: EBM tries to solve some problems that are strikingly similar to those of toxicology",

The new approach would test for in vitro perturbations of toxicity pathways using human cells with high-throughput testing platforms. The NRC report proposed a deliberate timeline, spanning about 20 years, to implement a wholesale replacement of current in-life toxicity test approaches focused on apical responses with in vitro assays. One approach to accelerating implementation is to focus on well-studied prototype compounds with known toxicity pathway targets. Through a series of carefully executed case studies with four or five pathway prototypes, the various steps required for implementation of an in vitro toxicity pathway approach to risk assessment could be developed and refined. In this article, we discuss alternative approaches for implementation and also outline advantages of a case study approach and the manner in which the case studies could be pursued using current methodologies. A case study approach would be complementary to recently proposed efforts to map the human toxome, while representing a significant extension toward more formal risk assessment compared to the profiling and prioritization approaches inherent in programs such as the EPA's ToxCast effort.",

    "abstract": "Genotoxicity tests are essential to identify compounds that have a potential to compromise not only the environment but also human and animal health, including compounds that increase the risk of cancer. At present, no single test is capable of detecting all types of genotoxic effects; therefore a battery of in vitro and, if positive, in vivo tests is necessary to determine the genotoxicity of a substance. However, the respective specificities of current assays have been criticized for their high percentage of false positive results. We recently published an automated version of the \"Fluorimetric detection of Alkaline DNA Unwinding\" (FADU) assay for measuring DNA strand breaks in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in cell lines. Using this new technology we show detection of DNA strand breaks in cells treated with several compounds known to induce DNA strand breaks by various mechanisms. We also tested toxic compounds that were not expected to induce DNA strand breaks; these were negative in the assay as expected. Finally, we included zinc oxide nanoparticles of high production volume to explore further fields of potential FADU applications. The main advantages of this assay are high reproducibility, easy handling, lack of operator bias, high-throughput, speed, and low cost.",

    "abstract": "The European cosmetics legislation foresees a review in 2011 and possible postponement of the 2013 marketing ban to enforce the testing ban for systemic and repeated-dose animal tests. For this purpose, a 119-page report commissioned by the European Commission was published recently. Here, a group of 17 independent experts from the US, Europe, and Japan was brought together to evaluate the report. The expert panel strongly endorsed the report and its conclusions. A number of important options not considered were identified; these do not, however, affect the overall conclusions regarding the current lack of availability of a full replacement, especially for the areas of repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity testing, and reproductive toxicity, though a roadmap for change is emerging. However, some of these options may provide adequate data for replacement of some animal studies in the near future pending validation. Various recommendations expand the original report. The reviewers agree with the report that there is greater promise in the short term for the areas of sensitization and toxicokinetics. Additional opportunities lie in more global collaborations and the inclusion of other industry sectors.",

According to ECHA, 4,599 substances have been registered so far, and the corresponding dossiers of many of them are now partially available in a public database. A sample of 400 records was randomly selected and analyzed with regard to reproductive and developmental toxicity. Most dossiers do not follow the strict requirements in the official guidelines, and some dossiers lack some very basic information. A broad variety of existing data is used, and the read-across opportunity is very much exploited. Surprisingly, a number of in vivo tests have been performed already, apparently for REACH purposes, in spite of the legal requirement to make a public proposal and wait for authorization by ECHA. The number of animals used so far, plus the number of animals that will derive from testing proposals of the first REACH deadline, is very high; it may add up to 1.6 million animals just to accomplish reproductive and developmental toxicity endpoints if the data collected from 400 dossiers are extrapolated to the total number of registered substances. In vitro tests are completely absent, even though there are many tests that may be used to complement either read-across strategies or partially reliable existing data. It is recommended, in the spirit of REACH, to protect human health through an in-depth assessment of the chemicals and simultaneously, to promote the use of in vitro alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction induced by small reactive chemicals (haptens). Currently, the sensitising potential and potency of new chemicals is usually characterised using data generated via animal studies, such as the local lymph node assay (LLNA). There are, however, increasing public and political concerns regarding the use of animals for the testing of new chemicals. Consequently, the development of in vitro, in chemico or in silico models for predicting the sensitising potential and/or potency of new chemicals is receiving widespread interest.The Colipa Skin Tolerance task force currently collaborates with and/or funds several academic research groups to expand our understanding of the molecular and cellular events occurring during the acquisition of skin sensitisation. Knowledge gained from this research is being used to support the development and evaluation of novel alternative approaches for the identification and characterisation of skin sensitising chemicals. At present three non-animal test methods (Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (DPRA), Myeloid U937 Skin Sensitisation Test (MUSST) and human Cell Line Activation Test (hCLAT)) have been evaluated in Colipa interlaboratory ring trials for their potential to predict skin sensitisation potential and were recently submitted to ECVAM for formal pre-validation. Data from all three test methods will now be used to support the study and development of testing strategy approaches for skin sensitiser potency prediction. This publication represents the current viewpoint of the cosmetics industry on the feasibility of replacing the need for animal test data for informing skin sensitisation risk assessment decisions.",

Differentiation was assessed by monitoring monolayer permeability, alkaline phosphatase and sucrase activities, and the transport of digoxin and cephalexin. Notably, the serum-reduced protocol produced results that were comparable to cells differentiated in the control medium and should be recommended as an alternative to the use of 10% FBS in both apical (AP) and BL media. ITS serum-free medium elicited permeability values and cephalexin transport similar to control cells. MITO+™ medium was the most efficient in promoting the two transport activities investigated, and it should be further evaluated with a larger set of substances, although its undisclosed composition represents a limit that may override these advantages.",

Perspectives on resources and initiatives reviewed include OpenTox, eTOX, Pistoia Alliance, ToxWiz, Virtual Liver, EU-ADR, BEL, ToxML, and Bioclipse. We also review existing ontology developments in neighboring fields that can contribute to establishing an ontological framework for predictive toxicology. A significant set of resources is already available to provide a foundation for an ontological framework for 21st century mechanistic-based toxicology research. Ontologies such as ToxWiz provide a basis for application to toxicology investigations, whereas other ontologies under development in the biological, chemical, and biomedical communities could be incorporated in an extended future framework. OpenTox has provided a semantic web framework for the implementation of such ontologies into software applications and linked data resources. Bioclipse developers have shown the benefit of interoperability obtained through ontology by being able to link their workbench application with remote OpenTox web services. Although these developments are promising, an increased international coordination of efforts is greatly needed to develop a more unified, standardized, and open toxicology ontology framework.",

There are many initiatives that aim to replace, reduce, or refine laboratory animal use, but the regulatory acceptance and use of 3R models lags behind. The central question of this study is: \"Which variables influence the regulatory acceptance and use of 3R models and in what way?\" Regulatory acceptance is seen as one of the biggest hurdles 3R models face, but the rationale behind this is still underexplored. This study is an approach to filling that gap by combining opinions from experts in the field with literature on technology acceptance and risk regulation, resulting in a model of the variables that determine the process of the regulatory acceptance and use of 3R models.",

However, validated methods, which provide information about the potency of skin sensitizers, are still lacking. The cell-based assay Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection (GARD), targeting key event 3, dendritic cell activation, of the skin sensitization AOP, uses gene expression profiling and a machine learning approach for the prediction of chemicals as sensitizers or non-sensitizers. Based on the GARD platform, we here expanded the assay to predict three sensitizer potency classes according to the European Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation, targeting categories 1A (strong), 1B (weak) and no cat (non-sensitizer). Using a random forest approach and 70 training samples, a potential biomarker signature of 52 transcripts was identified. The resulting model could predict an independent test set consisting of 18 chemicals, six from each CLP category and all previously unseen to the model, with an overall accuracy of 78%. Importantly, the model was shown to be conservative and only underestimated the class label of one chemical. Furthermore, an association of defined chemical protein reactivity with distinct biological pathways illustrates that our transcriptional approach can reveal information contributing to the understanding of underlying mechanisms in sensitization.",

In this paper we present three studies with our novel ex vivo osteochondral culture platform. It consists of two separated media compartments for cartilage and bone, which better represents the in vivo situation and enables supply of factors specific to the different needs of bone and cartilage. We investigated whether separation of the cartilage and bone compartments and/or culture media results in the maintenance of viability, struc­tural and functional properties of cartilage tissue. Next, we evaluated for how long we can preserve cartilage matrix stability of osteochondral explants during long-term culture over 84 days. Finally, we determined the optimal defect size that does not show spontaneous self-healing in this culture system. It was demonstrated that separated compartments for cartilage and bone in combination with tissue-specific medium allow for long-term culture of osteochondral explants while maintaining cartilage viability, matrix tissue content, structure and mechanical properties for at least 56 days. Furthermore, we could create critical size cartilage defects of different sizes in the model. The osteochondral model represents a valuable preclinical ex vivo tool for studying clinically relevant cartilage ther­apies, such as cartilage biomaterials, for their regenerative potential, for evaluation of drug and cell therapies, or to study mechanisms of cartilage regeneration. It will undoubtedly reduce the number of animals needed for in vivo testing.",

    "abstract": "Science is based on facts and their discourse. Willingly or unwillingly, facts are mixed with opinion, i.e., views or judgments formed, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge. This is often necessary, where we have controversial facts or no definitive evidence yet, because we need to take decisions or have to prioritize. Evidence-based approaches aim at identifying the facts and their quality objectively and transparently; they are now increasingly embraced in toxicology, especially by employing systematic reviews, meta-analyses, quality scoring, risk-of-bias tools, etc. These are core to Evidence-based Toxicology. Such approaches aim at minimizing opinion, the \"eminence-based\" part of science. Animal experiments are the basis of a lot of our textbook knowledge in the life sciences, have helped to develop desperately needed therapies, and have made this world a safer place. However, they represent only one of the many possible approaches to accomplish all these things. Like all approaches, they come with shortcomings, and their true contribution is often overrated. This article aims to summarize their limitations and challenges beside the ethical and economical concerns (i.e., costs and duration as well as costs following wrong decisions in product development): they include reproducibility, inadequate reporting, statistical under-powering, lack of inter-species predictivity, lack of reflection of human diversity and of real-life exposure. Each and every one of these increasingly discussed aspects of animal experiments can be amended, but this would require enormous additional resources. Together, they prompt a need to engineer a new paradigm to ensure the safety of patients and consumers, new products and therapies.",

Current vascular modelling is mainly based on animal biology leading to species-to-species variation when extrapolating the results to humans. Although there are a few human cell based vascular models available, these assays are insufficiently characterized in terms of culture conditions and developmental stage of vascular structures. Therefore, well characterized vascular models with human relevance are needed for basic research, embryotoxicity testing, development of therapeutic strategies and for tissue engineering.We have previously shown that the in vitro vascular model based on co-culture of human adipose stromal cells (hASC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is able to induce an extensive vascular-like network with high reproducibility. In this work we developed a defined serum-free vascular stimulation medium (VSM) and performed further characterization in terms of cell identity, maturation and structure to obtain a thoroughly characterized in vitro vascular model to replace or reduce corresponding animal experiments.The results showed that the novel vascular stimulation medium induced an intact and evenly distributed vascular-like network with morphology of mature vessels. Electron microscopic analysis assured the three-dimensional microstructure of the network containing lumen. Additionally, elevated expression levels of the main human angiogenesis-related genes were detected.In conclusion, with the newly defined medium the vascular model can be utilized as a characterized test system for chemical testing as well as in creating vascularized tissue models.",

    "abstract": "Within the framework of reduction, refinement and replacement of animal experiments, new approaches for identification and characterization of chemical hazards have been developed. Grouping and read across has been promoted as a most promising alternative approach. It uses existing toxicological information on a group of chemicals to make predictions on the toxicity of uncharacterized ones. In the present work, the feasibility of applying in vitro and in silico techniques to group chemicals for read across was studied using the food mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) and metabolites as a case study. ZEN and its reduced metabolites are known to act through activation of the estrogen receptor α (ERα). The ranking of their estrogenic potencies appeared highly conserved across test systems including binding, in vitro and in vivo assays. This data suggests that activation of ERα may play a role in the molecular initiating event (MIE) and be predictive of adverse effects and provides the rationale to model receptor-binding for hazard identification. The investigation of receptor-ligand interactions through docking simulation proved to accurately rank estrogenic potencies of ZEN and reduced metabolites, showing the suitability of the model to address estrogenic potency for this group of compounds. Therefore, the model was further applied to biologically uncharacterized, commercially unavailable, oxidized ZEN metabolites (6α-, 6β-, 8α-, 8β-, 13- and 15-OH-ZEN). Except for 15-OH-ZEN, the data indicate that in general, the oxidized metabolites would be considered a lower estrogenic concern than ZEN and reduced metabolites.",

This model allows the representation of puberty, a critical life period with regard to endocrine disruptors. The cellular modifications were followed for three weeks through transcriptomic and proteomic profiling analysis. A quantitative and comparative method was developed to estimate how known pathways were disturbed by each substance. This pathway-driven analysis revealed a strong alteration of steroidogenesis and an impairment of meiosis in all cases, albeit the initial molecular events were different for both substances. The ex vivo cytogenetic analysis confirmed that both fungicides alter the course of the first meiotic prophase. In addition, the mixture of both substances triggered effects greater than the sum of their cumulative effects and compromised future sperm motility after a shorter time of exposure compared with the fungicides tested separately. The alliance of an ex vivo culture with omics strategies complemented with a physiological examination is a powerful combination of tools for testing substances, separately or in a mixture, for their testicular toxicity. In particular, proteomics allowed the iden­tification of systematically differentially expressed proteins in the secretomes of exposed cultures, such as FUCO and PEBP1, two proteins linked with the motility and fertilizing ability of spermatozoa, respectively. These proteins may be potential biomarkers of testicular dysfunction and infertility.",

However, multiple animal models are available for each disease. We evaluated the argumentation behind the selection of a specific animal model using thematic content analysis in project applications issued in 2017-2019 in the Netherlands. In total, 125 animal models for translational and applied research from 110 project applications were assessed. Explanations to select a specific model included: the model's availability (79%); the availability of expertise (62%); and the model showing similar disease pathology/symptoms (59%) to humans. Therefore, current selection of a specific animal model seems to be based on tradition rather than its potential predictive value for clinical outcome. The applicants' explanations for the implementation of the 3R prin­ciples (replacement, reduction and refinement) as to the animal model were unspecific. Replacement was achieved by using data from prior in vitro studies, reduction by optimal experimental design and statistics, and refinement by reducing discomfort. Additionally, due to the stated need for a test model with high complexity (47%) and intactness (30%), the full replacement of animal models with alternative (non-live animal) approaches was thought unachievable. Without a clear, systematic and transparent justification for the selection of a specific animal model, the likelihood of poorly trans­latable research remains. It is not only up to the researcher to demonstrate this, as ethical committees and funding bodies can provide positive stimuli to drive this change.",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D in vitro cancer models have become important alternatives to animal tests for establishing the efficacy of anticancer treatments. In this work, 3D SKOV-3 cell-laden alginate hydrogels were established as ovarian tumor models and cultured within a fluid-dynamic bioreactor (MIVO®) device able to mimic the capillary flow dynamics feeding the tumor. Cisplatin efficacy tests were performed within the device over time and compared with (i) the in vitro culture under static conditions and (ii) a xenograft mouse model with SKOV-3 cells, by monitoring and measuring cell proliferation or tumor regression, respectively, over time. After one week of treatment with 10 μM cisplatin, viability of cells within the 3D hydrogels cultured under static conditions remained above 80%. In contrast, the viability of cells within the 3D hydrogels cultured within dynamic MIVO® decreased by up to 50%, and very few proliferating Ki67-positive cells were observed through immunostaining. Analysis of drug diffusion, confirmed by computational analysis, explained that these results are due to different cisplatin diffusion mechanisms in the two culture conditions. Interestingly, the outcome of the drug efficacy test in the xenograft model was about 44% of tumor regression after 5 weeks, as predicted in a shorter time in the fluid-dynamic in vitro tests carried out in the MIVO® device. These results indicate that the in vivo-like dynamic environment provided by the MIVO® device allows to better model the 3D tumor environment and predict in vivo drug efficacy than a static in vitro model.",

    "abstract": "Several in vitro OECD test guidelines address key events 1-3 of the adverse outcome pathway for skin sensitization, but none are validated for sensitizer potency assessment. The reaction of sensitizing molecules with skin proteins is the molecular initiating event and appears to be rate-limiting, as chemical reactivity strongly correlates with sensitizer potency. The kinetic direct peptide reactivity assay (kDPRA), a modification of the DPRA (OECD TG 442C), allows derivation of rate constants of the depletion of the cysteine-containing model peptide upon reaction with the test item. Its reproducibility was demonstrated in an inter-laboratory study. Here, we present a database of rate constants, expressed as log kmax, for 180 chemicals to define the prediction threshold to identify strong sensitizers (classified as GHS 1A). A threshold of log kmax -2 offers a balanced accuracy of 85% for predicting GHS 1A sensitizers according to the local lymph node assay. The kDPRA is proposed as a stand-alone assay for identification of GHS 1A sensitizers among chemicals identified as sensitizers by other tests or defined approaches. It may also be used for the prediction of sensitizer potency on a continuous scale, ideally in combination with continuous parameters from other in vitro assays. We show how the rate constant could be combined with read-outs of other in vitro assays in a defined approach. A decision model based on log kmax alone has, however, a high predictivity and can be used as stand-alone model for identification of GHS 1A sensitizers among chemicals predicted as sensitizers.",

    "abstract": "Ideally, humane endpoints allow early termination of experiments by minimizing an animal's discomfort, distress and pain while ensuring that scientific objectives are reached. Yet, lack of commonly agreed methodology and heterogeneity of cut-off values published in the literature remain a challenge to the accurate determination and application of humane endpoints.With the aim to synthesize and appraise existing humane endpoint definitions for commonly used physiological param­eters, we conducted a systematic review of mouse studies of acute and chronic disease models that used body weight, temperature and/or sickness scores for endpoint definition. We searched for studies in two electronic databases (MEDLINE/Pubmed and Embase). Out of 110 retrieved full-text manuscripts, 34 studies were included. We found large intra- and inter-model variance in humane endpoint determination and application due to varying animal models, lack of standardized experimental protocols, and heterogeneity of performance metrics (part 1).We then used previously published and unpublished data on weight, temperature, and sickness scores from mouse models of sepsis and stroke and applied machine learning models to assess the usefulness of this method for parameter selection and endpoint definition across models. Machine learning models trained with physiological data and sickness severity score or modified DeSimoni neuroscore identified animals with a high risk of death at an early time point in both mouse models of stroke (male: 93.2% at 72 h post-treatment; female: 93.0% at 48 h post-treatment) and sepsis (96.2% at 24 h post-treatment), thus demonstrating generalizability of endpoint determination across models (part 2).",

    "abstract": "One of the most challenging areas in regulatory science is assessment of the substances known as UVCB (unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products and biological materials). Because the inherent complexity and variability of UVCBs present considerable challenges for establishing sufficient substance similarity based on chemical characteristics or other data, we hypothesized that new approach methodologies (NAMs), including in vitro test-derived biological activity signatures to characterize substance similarity, could be used to support grouping of UVCBs. We tested 141 petroleum substances as representative UVCBs in a compendium of 15 human cell types representing a variety of tissues. Petroleum substances were assayed in dilution series to derive point of departure estimates for each cell type and phenotype. Extensive quality control measures were taken to ensure that only high-confidence in vitro data were used to determine whether current groupings of these petroleum substances, based largely on the manufacturing process and physico-chemical properties, are justifiable. We found that bioactivity data-based groupings of petroleum substances were generally consistent with the manufacturing class-based categories. We also showed that these data, especially bioactivity from human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived and primary cells, can be used to rank substances in a manner highly concordant with their expected in vivo hazard potential based on their chemical compositional profile. Overall, this study demonstrates that NAMs can be used to inform groupings of UVCBs, to assist in identification of repre­sentative substances in each group for testing when needed, and to fill data gaps by read-across.",

    "abstract": "Only few cell-based test methods are described by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guidelines or other regulatory references (e.g., the European Pharmacopoeia). The majority of toxicity tests still falls into the category of non-guideline methods. Data from these tests may nevertheless be used to support regulatory decisions or to guide strategies to assess compounds (e.g., drugs, agrochemicals) during research and development if they fulfill basic requirements concerning their relevance, reproducibility and predictivity. Only a method description of sufficient clarity and detail allows interpretation and use of the data. To guide regulators faced with increasing amounts of data from non-guideline studies, the OECD formulated Guidance Document 211 (GD211) on method documentation for the purpose of safety assessment. As GD211 is targeted mainly at regulators, it leaves scientists less familiar with regulation uncertain as to what level of detail is required and how individual questions should be answered. Moreover, little attention was given to the description of the test system (i.e., cell culture) and the steps leading to it being established in the guidance. To address these issues, an annotated toxicity test method template (ToxTemp) was developed (i) to fulfill all requirements of GD211, (ii) to guide the user concerning the types of answers and detail of information required, (iii) to include acceptance criteria for test elements, and (iv) to define the cells sufficiently and transparently. The fully annotated ToxTemp is provided here, together with reference to a database containing exemplary descriptions of more than 20 cell-based tests.",

    "abstract": "Allergic contact dermatitis, or the clinical manifestation of skin sensitization, is a leading occupational hazard. Several testing approaches exist to assess skin sensitization, but in silico models are perhaps the most advantageous due to their high speed and low-cost results. Many in silico skin sensitization models exist, though many have only been tested against results from animal studies (e.g., LLNA); this creates uncertainty in human skin sensitization assessments in both a screening and regulatory context. This project’s aim was to evaluate the accuracy of eight in silico skin sensitization models against two human data sets: one highly curated (Basketter et al., 2014) and one screening level (HSDB). The binary skin sen­sitization status of each chemical in each of the two data sets was compared to the prediction from eight in silico skin sensitization tools (Toxtree, PredSkin, OECD’s QSAR Toolbox, UL’s REACHAcross™, Danish QSAR Database, TIMES-SS, and Lhasa Limited’s Derek Nexus). Models were assessed for coverage, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as optimization features (e.g., probability of accuracy, applicability domain, etc.), if available. While there was a wide range of sensitivity and specificity, the models generally performed comparably to the LLNA in predicting human skin sensitization status (i.e., approximately 70-80% accuracy). Additionally, the models did not mispredict the same com­pounds, suggesting there might be an advantage in combining models. In silico skin sensitization models offer accurate and useful insights in a screening context; however, further improvements are necessary so these models may be con­sidered fully reliable for regulatory applications.",

The CIAO project “Modelling the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 using the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework” aims at building a holistic assembly of the available scientific knowledge on COVID-19 using the AOP framework. An individual AOP depicts the disease progression from the initial contact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus through biological key events (KE) toward an adverse outcome such as respiratory distress, anosmia or multiorgan failure. Assembling the individual AOPs into a network highlights shared KEs as central biological nodes involved in multiple outcomes observed in COVID-19 patients. During the workshop, the KEs and AOPs established so far by the CIAO members were presented and posi­tioned on a timeline of the disease course. Modulating factors influencing the progression and severity of the disease were also addressed as well as factors beyond purely biological phenomena. CIAO relies on an interdisciplinary crowd­sourcing effort, therefore, approaches to expand the CIAO network by widening the crowd and reaching stakeholders were also discussed. To conclude the workshop, it was decided that the AOPs/KEs will be further consolidated, inte­grating virus variants and long COVID when relevant, while an outreach campaign will be launched to broaden the CIAO scientific crowd.",

    "abstract": "The application of in vitro biological assays as new approach methodologies (NAMs) to support grouping of UVCB (unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products, and biological materials) substances has recently been demonstrated. In addition to cell-based phenotyping as NAMs, in vitro transcriptomic profiling is used to gain deeper mechanistic understanding of biological responses to chemicals and to support grouping and read-across. However, the value of gene expression profiling for characterizing complex substances like UVCBs has not been explored. Using 141 petroleum substance extracts, we performed dose-response transcriptomic profiling in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, neurons, and endothelial cells, as well as cell lines MCF7 and A375. The goal was to determine whether transcriptomic data can be used to group these UVCBs and to further characterize the molecular basis for in vitro biological responses. We found distinct transcriptional responses for petroleum substances by manufacturing class. Pathway enrichment informed interpretation of effects of substances and UVCB petroleum-class. Transcriptional activity was strongly correlated with concentration of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), especially in iPSC-derived hepatocytes. Supervised analysis using transcriptomics, alone or in combination with bioactivity data collected on these same substances/cells, suggest that transcriptomics data provide useful mechanistic information, but only modest additional value for grouping. Overall, these results further demonstrate the value of NAMs for grouping of UVCBs, identify informative cell lines, and provide data that could be used for justifying selection of substances for further testing that may be required for registration.",

For this purpose, a dataset was created of 38,772 Cmax predictions for 44 compounds by applying different combinations of in vitro and in silico approaches for chemical parameterization, and these predicted Cmax values were compared to reported in vivo data. Best results were achieved when the hepatic clearance was parameterized based on in vitro (i.e., hepatocytes or liver S9) measured intrinsic clearance values, the method of Rodgers and Rowland for calculating tissue:plasma partition coefficients, and the method of Lobell and Sivarajah for calculating the fraction unbound in plasma. With these parameters, the median Cmax values of 34 out of the 44 compounds were predicted within 5-fold of the observed Cmax, and the Cmax values of 19 compounds were predicted within 2-fold. The median Cmax values of 10 compounds were more than 5-fold overestimated. Underestimations (> 5-fold) did not occur. A comparison of the current generic PBK model structure with chemical-specific PBK models available in literature was made to identify possible kinetic processes not included in the generic PBK model that might explain the overestimations. Overall, the results provide crucial insights into the predictive performance of PBK models based on in vitro and in silico input and the influence of different input approaches on the model predictions.",

The present study optimized a 3D culture system using metabolically competent HepaRG cells for in vitro genotoxicity testing. 3D HepaRG spheroids, formed in 96- or 384-well ultra-low attachment plates, were exposed to various concentrations of 34 test articles, including 8 direct-acting and 11 indirect-acting genotoxicants/carcinogens as well as 15 compounds that show different genotoxic responses in vitro and in vivo. DNA damage was evaluated using the high-throughput CometChip assay with concurrent cytotoxicity assessment by the ATP assay in both 2D and 3D cultures. Our results showed that 3D HepaRG spheroids maintained a stable phenotype up to 30 days with higher levels of albumin secretion, cytochrome P450 gene expression and enzyme activities compared to 2D cultures. 3D spheroids also demonstrated a higher sensitivity than 2D cultures for detecting both direct- and indirect-acting genotoxicants/carcinogens, indicating a better prediction of in vivo genotoxicity responses. When DNA damage dose-response data were quantified using PROAST software, 3D spheroids generally had lower or similar benchmark dose values compared to 2D HepaRG cells and were more comparable with those of primary human hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that 3D models can be adapted to the CometChip technology for high-throughput genotoxicity testing, and that 3D HepaRG spheroids may be used as a reliable and pragmatic in vitro approach to better support the hazard identification and risk assessment of potential human genotoxic carcinogens.",

    "abstract": "Historical data from control groups in animal toxicity studies are currently mainly used for comparative purposes to assess validity and robustness of study results. Due to the highly controlled environment in which the studies are performed and the homogeneity of the animal collectives it has been proposed to use the historical data to build so-called virtual control groups, which could partly or entirely replace the concurrent control group. This would constitute a substantial contribution to the reduction of animal use in safety studies. Before the concept can be implemented, the prerequisites regarding data collection, curation, and statistical evaluation together with a validation strategy need to be identified to avoid any impairment of the study outcome and subsequent consequences for human risk assessment. To further assess and develop the concept of virtual control groups, the transatlantic think tank for toxicology (t4) sponsored a workshop with stakeholders from the phar­maceutical and chemical industry, academia, FDA, contract research organizations (CROs), and non-governmental organizations in Washington, which took place in March 2023. This report sum­marizes the current efforts of a European initiative to share, collect, and curate animal control data in a centralized database and the first approaches to identify optimal matching criteria between virtual controls and the treatment arms of a study as well as first reflections about strategies for a qualifi­cation procedure and potential pitfalls of the concept.",

    "abstract": "Disease models enable researchers to investigate, test, and identify therapeutic targets that would alter the patients’ disease condition and improve quality of life. Advances in genetic alteration and analytical techniques have enabled rapid devel­opment of disease models using preclinical animals and cell cultures. However, success rates of drug development remain low due to limited recapitulation of clinical pathophysiology by these models. To resolve this challenge, the pharmaceutical industry has explored microphysiological system (MPS) disease models, which are complex in vitro systems that include but are not limited to organ-on-a-chip, organoids, spheroids, and 3D bioengineered tissues (e.g., 3D printing, hydrogels). Capable of integrating key in vivo properties, such as disease-relevant human cells, multi-cellularity/dimensionality of organs, and/or well-controlled physical and molecular cues, MPS disease models are being developed for a variety of indications. With on-going qualifications or validations for wide adoption within the pharmaceutical industry, MPS disease models hold exciting potential to enable in-depth investigation of in vivo pathophysiology and enhance drug discovery and development processes. To introduce the present status of MPS disease models, this paper describes notable examples in six disease areas: cancer, liver/kidney diseases, respiratory diseases/COVID-19, neurodegenerative diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and select rare diseases. Additionally, we describe current technical limitations and provide recommendations for future development that would expand application opportunities within the pharmaceutical industry.",

On November 22, 2019, some pioneering and leading scientists and researchers in the field gathered at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Bal­timore for the 60 Years of the 3Rs Symposium: Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead. The event was sponsored by the Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT), the Foundation for Chemistry Research and Initiatives, the Alternative Research & Development Foundation (ARDF), the American Cleaning Institute (ACI), the International Fragrance Association (IFRA), the Institute for In Vitro Sciences (IIVS), John “Jack” R. Fowle III, and the Society of Toxicology (SoT). Fourteen pres­entations shared the history behind the groundbreaking publication, international efforts to achieve its aims, stumbling blocks to progress, as well as remarkable achievements. The day was a tribute to Russell and Burch, and a testament to what is possible when people from many walks of life – science, government, and industry – work toward a common goal.",

    "abstract": "Since the late 2010s, the idea of phase-out planning for animal experimentation (PPAE) has come to the foreground of political debates, but central notions and arguments are understood differently by different participants and stand in need of clarification. This article draws on public communications on ten political projects related to PPAE to propose a philosophical explication of PPAE and to artic­ulate the proponents’ central moral argument. According to the argument, the phase-out of animal experimentation is morally desirable, and planned interventions are both necessary and sufficient to achieve it. The normative and descriptive premises of the argument are stated and discussed, flagging questions that need answering for a more thorough assessment of the argument. This results in a series of seven action points for researchers and stakeholders of PPAE. The overall goal is to enable an open and productive discussion about PPAE in public, political, and academic settings.",

    "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals with important applications; they are persistent in the environment and may pose human health hazards. Regulatory agencies are considering restrictions and bans of PFAS; however, little data exists for informed decisions. Several prioritization strategies were proposed for evaluation of potential hazards of PFAS. Structure-based grouping could expedite the selection of PFAS for testing; still, the hypothesis that structure-effect relationships exist for PFAS requires confirmation. We tested 26 structurally diverse PFAS from 8 groups using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes, and tested concentration-response effects on cell function and gene expression. Few phenotypic effects were observed in hepatocytes, but negative chronotropy was observed for 8 of the 26 PFAS. Substance- and cell type-dependent transcriptomic changes were more prominent but lacked substantial group-specific effects. In hepatocytes, we found up-regulation of stress-related and extracellular matrix organization pathways, and down-regulation of fat metabolism. In cardiomyocytes, contractility-related pathways were most affected. We derived phenotypic and transcriptomic points of departure and compared them to predicted PFAS exposures. The conservative estimates for bioactivity and exposure were used to derive bioactivity-to-exposure ratio (BER) for each PFAS, most (23 of 26) PFAS had BER>1. Overall, these data suggests that structure-based grouping of PFAS may not be sufficient to predict their biological effects. Testing of individual PFAS may be needed for scientific-based decision-making. Our proposed strategy of using two human cell types and considering phenotypic and transcriptomic effects, combined with dose-response analysis and calculation of BER, may be used for PFAS prioritization. Plain language summaryPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are man-made chemicals used in many products. However, most of these substances have not been tested for safety, and concerns exist that they may be harmful to human health and/or the environment. This study aimed to use human cell-based models to investigate if some of the PFAS may exhibit hazardous properties and if similarities among substances are observed. Few effects were observed in liver cells, but a decrease in beating frequency was observed in heart cells for some PFAS. Gene expression changes were substance- and cell type-dependent. We did not find convincing structure-based similarities among PFAS; this suggests that testing of individual PFAS may be necessary in the future to inform health decisions. Overall, this study showed that a test strategy of using two human cell types, from liver and heart, may inform PFAS prioritization without a need for testing in animals.",

    "abstract": "The virtual control group (VCG) concept provides a potential opportunity to reduce animal use in drug development by replacing concurrent control groups (CCGs) in nonclinical toxicity studies. This work investigated the feasibility and reliability of using VCGs in place of CCGs. A historical control database (HCD), constructed from Genentech Inc. rat toxicity study data, was reviewed to under­stand trends and sources of variability in control animals over time, and to identify data curation requirements for assembling VCGs, e.g., alignment of units of measurement. Several endpoints were investigated and stratified against different study design parameters. Sex, route of administration, fasting status, and body weight at study initiation were among the parameters that were indicated as key matching criteria. With a high-level understanding of potential sources of variability, a retro­spective proof-of-concept (POC) study was designed, evaluating a historical rat pilot toxicity study for test article-related changes. A masked interpretation of the study was conducted using its CCG and two unique VCGs that were constructed from individual animal data pulled from our HCD. While the results of the microscopic pathology assessment and most endpoints were similar across the different control groups, the POC revealed the risk of using VCGs to interpret subtle test article-related changes in clinical pathology parameters. Within the context of our POC, it appears the use of a VCG is not completely equivalent to the CCG, especially with clinical pathology parameters. Additional work is needed to understand the potential utility, and thus, viability of VCGs in other contexts.",

    "abstract": "Performance of pharmacokinetic models developed using in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) methods may be improved by refining assumptions regarding fraction absorbed (Fabs) through the intestine, a component of oral bioavailability (Fbio). Although in vivo measures of Fabs are often unavailable for non-pharmaceuticals, in vitro measures of apparent permeability (Papp) using the Caco-2 cell line have been highly correlated with Fabs. We measured bidirectional Papp for over 400 non-pharmaceutical chemicals using the Caco-2 assay. A random forest quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model was developed using these and peer-reviewed pharmaceutical data. Both Caco-2 data (R²=0.37) and the QSPR model (R²=0.29) were better at predicting human bioavailability compared to in vivo rat data (R²=0.23). After incorporation into a high throughput toxicokinetics (HTTK) framework for IVIVE, the Caco-2 data were used to estimate in vivo administered equivalent dose (AED) for bioactivity assessed in vitro, The HTTK-predicted plasma steady state concentrations (Css) for IVIVE were revised, with modest changes predicted for poorly absorbed chemicals. Experimental data were evaluated for sources of measurement uncertainty, which were then accounted for using the Monte Carlo method. Revised AEDs were subsequently compared with exposure estimates to evaluate effects on bioactivity:exposure ratios, a surrogate for risk. Only minor changes in the margin between chemical exposure and predicted bioactive doses were observed due to the preponderance of highly absorbed chemicals.",

The discussions emphasized the heightened vulnerability of the developing human brain to toxic exposures and the potential of NAMs to provide more ethical, economical, and scientifically robust alternatives to traditional testing. Various NAMs for DNT were discussed, including in silico, in chemico, in vitro, non-mammalian whole organisms, and novel mammalian approaches. In addition to progress in the field, the workshop discussed ongoing challenges such as expectations to perfectly replicate the complex biology of human neurodevelopment and integration of DNT NAMs into regulatory frameworks. Presentations and panel discussions provided a comprehensive overview of the state of the science, assessed the capabilities and limitations of current DNT NAMs, and outlined critical next steps in advancing the field of DNT testing.",

    "abstract": "Chemical safety assessment still heavily relies on animal testing, presenting ethical dilemmas and limited human predictive value. New approach methodologies (NAMs), including in vitro and in silico techniques, offer alternative solutions. In silico toxicology has made progress in predicting chemical effects but frequently lacks biological mechanistic foundations. Recent developments focus on mechanistic understanding of adverse effects inflicted by chemicals, as embedded in (quantitative) adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). However, there is a demand for more detailed mechanistic insights at the gene and cell levels, encompassing both pathology and physiology. Drawing inspiration from the Disease Maps Project, this paper introduces Physiological Maps (PMs) as comprehensive graphical representations of biochemical processes related to specific organ functions. PMs are standardized using Systems Biology Graphical Notation and controlled vocabularies and annotations. Curation guidelines have been developed to ensure reproducibility and usability. This paper presents the methodology used to build PMs, emphasizing the essential collaboration between domain experts and curators. PMs offer user-friendly, standardized visualization for data analysis and educational purposes. Enabling a better understanding of (patho)physiology, they also complement and support the development of AOPs by providing detailed mechanistic information at the gene and cell level. Furthermore, PMs contribute to developing in vitro test batteries and to building (dynamic) in silico models aiming to predict the toxicity of chemicals. Collaborative efforts between the toxicology and systems biology communities are crucial for creating standardized and comprehensive PMs, supporting and accelerating the development of human-relevant NAMs for next-generation risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Surfactants and film-forming polymers are common ingredients in consumer spray products such as cleaning products, hair care products, and anti-perspirants. Spraying eases application by creating aerosolized droplets of the product that can distribute evenly over the treated surface. However, these aerosols can potentially be inhaled during their normal application. Droplets that reach the alveoli can interact with the pulmonary surfactant; a complex mixture of phospholipids and proteins that regulates the surface tension at the air-liquid interface. This interaction could elevate the minimum surface tension at maximum compression and change the surface rheology of the pulmonary surfactant at the interface. We tested four surfactants and seven polymers for their ability to inhibit pulmonary surfactant function in vitro and investigated if the inhibition is dose-rate dependent i.e., the product of the concentration (mg/mL) and aerosolization rate (mL/min). We found that independent of chemical class (surfactant or polymer) there was a clear dose-rate dependent inhibition of pulmonary surfactant function and that different chemicals inhibited function at different dose-rates. We compared the points of departure of inhibitory chemicals to a polymer with known dose-rate dependent lung toxicity. When assessing the risk of chemicals that might be inhaled, it is essential to ensure normal use would not inhibit pulmonary surfactant function leading to immediate effects on the lungs.",

The conference convened experts from regulatory agencies, industry, and academia to explore the latest advancements in DNT testing and the integration of animal-free new approach methodologies (NAMs) into next-generation risk assessment (NGRA). The key topic was the appli-cation and further development of the recently established DNT in vitro test battery (DNT-IVB). To support this, OECD held a satellite meeting to discuss necessary next steps for further implementation of the DNT-IVB in regulatory contexts. Validation of new DNT test methods and use of their data for in-vitro-to-in-vivo extrapolations in physiologically based kinetic models were also important themes of the main meeting. In this context, the question was raised when a comprehensive biological and chemical coverage by the DNT-IVB would be reached. A need for additional testing data was recognized. Context-specific validation approaches for the entire DNT-IVB and the potential for intelligent combinations of assays to enhance the predictive power of the test battery were also addressed. Many presentations demonstrated the field's embrace of novel developments, including the use of multi-endpoint embryonic zebrafish tests, the development of artificial intelligence-driven computational approaches, and the establishment of complex, electrically active brain organoids and other self-organizing structures. Through its highly interactive format, DNT5 promoted extensive collaborative efforts in advancing the field toward more human-relevant, scientifically reliable, and ethical toxicological assessments.",

    "abstract": "Under the European Union's REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is required to assess the compliance of safety data submitted by chemical registrants. ECHA must check a proportion of registration dossiers for compliance. From 2010 to 2023, 4,854 compliance checks (CCHs) were conducted. When dossiers lack required studies or use inappropriate adaptations, ECHA issues decisions that are publicly available. As of April 2, 2024, 2,311 such decisions have been published. This study systematically analyzed these published CCH decisions, focusing on ECHA's findings of non-compliant REACH registrations and the use of adaptations to standard data requirements. We found that over 70% of published CCH decisions included at least one adaptation, with \"read-across\" being the most common (48%). Among these, 83 documents contained read-across adaptations with justifications that ECHA deemed plausible. To understand what made these read-across hypotheses acceptable, we evaluated them using 17 assessment elements that capture specific arguments registrants proposed to justify the adaptation. Elements of \"acceptable\" read-across hypotheses included strong evidence of (i) toxicokinetic similarity between the registered substance and its analogues, and (ii) toxicodynamic similarity, supported by bridging studies. Additional support from in vitro studies and QSAR predictions further strengthened the accepted read-across hypotheses. Overall, this analysis provides insights into what constitutes a successful read-across under REACH data requirements. By identifying and evaluating accepted cases or read-across adaptations, we highlight best practices for establishing scientifically robust justifications for chemical similarity that can meet ECHA's high regulatory standards.",

Endotoxin-specific LAL was not suitable to test HSA due to unacceptable endotoxin recovery. Experiments combining polymyxin B and MAT demonstrated that pyrogenic batches were mainly contaminated with endotoxins. However, endotoxin-specific LAL failed to detect one of them. The contaminating (1,3)-β-glucans enhanced the MAT/IL-6 response to endotoxin, but not that of MAT/IL-1β. The endotoxin equivalent concentrations obtained using the IL-6 readout were usually higher than those using IL-1β, probably owing to the direct induction of IL-6 release from monocytes by (1,3)-β-glucans.The MAT correlates with the rabbit pyrogen test, providing a higher safety level for pyrogenicity testing of HSA and probably other therapeutic proteins.",

The gold standards to assess toxins in aquatic food have traditionally been in vivo methods, i.e., the mouse as well as the rat bioassay. Besides ethical concerns, there is also a need for more reliable test methods because of low inter-species comparability, high intra-species variability, the high number of false positive and negative results as well as questionable extrapolation of quantitative risk to humans. For this reason, a transatlantic group of experts in the field of marine biotoxins was convened from academia and regulatory safety authorities to discuss future approaches to marine biotoxin testing. In this report they provide a background on the toxin classes, on their chemical characterization, the epidemiology, on risk assessment and management, as well as on their assumed mode of action. Most importantly, physiological functional assays such as in vitro bioassays and also analytical techniques, e.g., liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS), as substitutes for the rodent bioassay are reviewed. This forms the basis for recommendations on methodologies for hazard monitoring and risk assessment, establishment of causality of intoxications in human cases, a roadmap for research and development of human-relevant functional assays, as well as new approaches for a consumer directed safety concept.",

    "abstract": "Chemical hypersensitivity is an immunological response towards foreign substances, commonly referred to as sensitizers, which gives rise primarily to the clinical symptoms known as allergic contact dermatitis. For the purpose of mitigating risks associated with consumer products, chemicals are screened for sensitizing effects. Historically, such predictive screenings have been performed using animal models. However, due to industrial and regulatory demand, animal models for the purpose of sensitization assessment are being replaced by non-animal testing methods, a global trend that is spreading across industries and market segments. To meet this demand, the Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection (GARD) assay was developed. GARD is a novel, cell-based assay that utilizes the innate recognition of xenobiotic substances by dendritic cells, as measured by a multivariate readout of genomic biomarkers. Following cellular stimulation, chemicals are classified as sensitizers or non-sensitizers based on induced transcriptional profiles. Recently, a number of non-animal methods were comparatively evaluated by Cosmetics Europe, using a coherent and blinded test panel of reference chemicals with human and local lymph node assay data, comprising a wide range of sensitizers and non-sensitizers. The outcome of the GARD assay is presented in this paper. It was demonstrated that GARD is a highly functional assay with a predictive performance of 83% in this Cosmetics Europe dataset. The average accumulated predictive accuracy of GARD across independent datasets was 86% for skin sensitization hazard.",

    "abstract": "Many types of assays in cell biology, pharmacology and toxicology generate data in which a parameter is measured in a reference system (negative control) and then also under conditions of increasing stress or drug exposure. To make such data easily comparable, they are normalized, i.e., the initial value of the system (e.g., viability or transport function) is set to 100%, and all data are indicated relative to this value. Then, curves are fitted through the data points and summary data of the system behavior are determined. For this, a benchmark response (BMR) is given (e.g., a curve drop by 15 or 50%), and the corresponding benchmark concentration (BMC15 or BMC50) is determined. Especially for low BMRs, this procedure is not very robust and often results in incorrect summary data. It is often neglected that a second normalization (re-normalization) is necessary to make the data suitable for curve fitting. It is also frequently overlooked that this requires knowledge of the system behavior at very low stress conditions. Here, good in vitro practice guidance for the re-normalization procedure is provided so that data of higher fidelity can be generated and presented.",

However, the test is a current Pharmacopeial method and is used to evaluate the pyrogen content of some vaccines. In this article the limitations and pitfalls of using the test to measure pyrogenicity of vaccines containing outer membrane vesicles are described. The method is unsuitable as a safety test for these products due to the high levels of endotoxin present in the vaccine which generate a pyrogenic response in rabbits when delivered intravenously without any dilution. Its use as a consistency test is also ambiguous as the test gives a qualitative rather than quantitative response and the rabbit models are highly variable. In addition there is evidence that measuring the temperature rise of the animals over three hours does not capture the maximum fever response. Finally the article considers the use of alternative methods and the validity of animal models when applying a consistency based approach for assessing the quality of licensed products.",

The distinction between toxic and non-toxic products is difficult to make for producers and product users alike, as there is no clearly described relationship between the chemical composition of the products and induction of toxicity. The currently accepted method for determination of acute inhalation toxicity is based on experiments on animals; it is time-consuming, expensive and causes stress for the animals. Impregnation products are present on the market in large numbers and amounts and exhibit great variety. Therefore, an alternative method to screen for acute inhalation toxicity is needed. The aim of our study was to determine if inhibition of lung surfactant by impregnation products in vitro could accurately predict toxicity in vivo in mice. We tested 21 impregnation products using the constant flow through set-up of the constrained drop surfactometer to determine if the products inhibited surfactant function or not. The same products were tested in a mouse inhalation bioassay to determine their toxicity in vivo. The sensitivity was 100%, i.e., the in vitro method predicted all the products that were toxic for mice to inhale. The specificity of the in vitro test was 63%, i.e., the in vitro method found three false positives in the 21 tested products. Six of the products had been involved in accidental human inhalation where they caused acute inhalation toxicity. All of these six products inhibited lung surfactant function in vitro and were toxic to mice.",

The process has been described as an adverse outcome pathway (AOP), including several key events, from skin penetration and covalent protein binding, to keratinocyte activation, dendritic cell activation and T-lymphocyte proliferation. The in vitro assay KeratinoSens™ measures the activation of keratinocytes. It is fully accepted at a regulatory level (OECD TG 442d) and complies with a range of legislation including the EU Cosmetics Regulation, REACH, and the CLP Regulation. Currently, many in vitro methods use animal-derived components in their cell culture systems. Many stakeholders in the cosmetics industry have both scientific and ethical concerns relating to this issue and have stated a strong preference for fully human in vitro test systems. We have adapted the KeratinoSens™ method to animal product-free condi­tions, and carried out an in-house validation with 21 reference substances, including those listed in the Performance Standards associated with OECD TG442d. The modified method was shown to be equivalent to the Validated Ref­erence Method (VRM), with comparable values for accuracy (85.7%), sensitivity (84.6%) and specificity (87.5%), and all acceptance criteria being met. In Europe, data generated by the adapted method may be used in REACH submissions, and we are now seeking approval to list the adaptation in OECD TG 442d, enabling formal compliance with a range of global regulations.",

    "abstract": "Current efforts in chemical safety are focused on utilizing human in vitro or alternative animal data in biological pathway context. However, it remains unclear how biological pathways, and toxicology data developed in that context, can be used to quantitatively facilitate decision-making. The objective of this work is to determine if hypothesis testing using Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) can provide quantitative chemical hazard predictions. Current methods for predicting hazards of chemicals in a biological pathway context were extensively reviewed, specific case studies examined and computational modeling used to demonstrate quantitative hazard prediction based on an AOP. Since AOPs are chemically agnostic, we propose that AOPs function as hypotheses for how specific chemicals may cause adverse effects via specific pathways. Three broad approaches were identified for testing the hypothesis with AOPs, semi-quantitative weight of evidence, probabilistic, and mechanistic modeling. We then demonstrate how these approaches could be used to test hypotheses using high throughput in vitro data and alternative animal data. Finally, we discuss standards in development and documentation that would facilitate use in a regulatory context. We conclude that quantitative AOPs provide a flexible hypothesis framework for predicting chemical hazards. It accommodates a wide range of approaches that are useful at many stages and build upon one another to become increasingly quantitative.",

We investigated these aspects by coculturing THP-1 cells, as surrogate dendritic cells, with HaCaT keratinocytes. We tested our HaCaT/THP-1 model with a set of 14 sensitizers, containing 7 prohaptens, and 10 non-sensitizers. Compared to exposing THP-1 alone, coculturing resulted in up to 3.1-fold enhanced maximal CD86 and/or CD54 upregulation on THP-1, and improved concentration-dependency. All 14 sensitizers were found positive for CD86 and/or CD54 upregulation based on ∆ mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ≥ 10 for CD86 and ∆MFI ≥ 50 for CD54. Only 1 of 10 non-sensitizers was false-positive. Remarkably, coculture with HaCaT keratinocytes improved the rank correlation of the estimated minimum chemical concentrations inducing a positive response in vitro with in vivo data on sensitization potency, especially for CD54 (Spearman: r = 0.739, p = 0.006; CD86: r = 0.571, p = 0.041). These promising data suggest that the coculture model has the potential to support the prediction of sensitization potency based on in vitro data.",

Chondrocytes can be spa­tially positioned in hydrogels and thus in defects, while current clinical cell therapies introduce chondrocytes in the defect depth. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of spatial chondrocyte distribution on the reparative process. To reduce animal experiments, an ex vivo osteochondral plug model was used and evaluated. The role of the delivered and endogenous cells in the repair process was investigated.Full thickness cartilage defects were created in equine osteochondral plugs. Defects were filled with (A) chondrocytes at the bottom of the defect, covered with a cell-free hydrogel, (B) chondrocytes homogeneously encapsulated in a hydrogel, and (C, D) combinations of A and B with different cell densities. Plugs were cultured for up to 57 days, after which the cartilage and repair tissues were characterized and compared to baseline samples. Additionally, at day 21, the origin of cells in the repair tissue was evaluated.Best outcomes were obtained with conditions C and D, which resulted in well-integrated cartilage-like tissue that com­pletely filled the defect, regardless of the initial cell density. A critical role of the spatial chondrocyte distribution in the repair process was observed. Moreover, the osteochondral plugs stimulated cartilage formation in the hydrogels when cultured in the defects. The resulting repair tissue originated from the delivered cells.These findings confirm the potential of the osteochondral plug model for the optimization of the composition of cartilage implants and for studying repair mechanisms.",

Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) implies that the current scientific communityagrees on the adequacy of how data is generated. This system has come under public pressure because of doubts as to its efficiency and the FDA's recent GRAS rule is part of the response. The FDA guidance for testing food additives,known as the \"Redbook\", is about two decades old. Work toward a new \"Redbook\" is on the way, but the US Grocery Manufacturer Association (GMA) also has initiated the development of an independent standard on how to performGRAS determinations.This review of the current guidance shows a very rigorous system for higher concern levels, but also many waiving options. Opportunities and challenges for safety evaluations of food additives are discussed. Where scientific progresshas allowed improving existing and adapting new methods, these should be adopted to improve product safety and animal welfare. The continuous adaptation of such improved methods is therefore needed. Especially, there are opportunitiesto embrace developments within the toxicity testing for the 21st century movement and evidence-based toxicology approaches.

However, this approach often fails to take into account the role of biotransformation on the activity of the test substances. A method incorporating an S9 metabolic system into the CALUX-reporter gene assays for estrogen receptor α- and anti-androgen receptor -mediated activities has been developed. Methoxychlor, which is known to exhibit increased estrogenic and anti-androgenic activities after biotransformation, was used to set up the method in ERa and anti-AR CALUX. For the anti-androgenic assay, stanozolol was used as a competing agonist not metabolized by S9. The method was first applied in both agonist and antagonist modes to methoxychlor and bisphenol A, as positive and negative controls, respectively. Then, benzo(a)pyrene and flutamide were also tested for their potential of bioactivation. Co-treatment with S9 successfully increased the ERα agonist and AR antagonist potency of methoxychlor; no change was observed for bisphenol A. Incubation with S9 also enhanced the anti-androgenic activity of flutamide. Interestingly, the metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene by the S9 resulted in an increased estrogen receptor-mediated transcriptional activation; any increase in the potency was only minor. It is likely that both enzyme kinetics and metabolite stability have influenced these effects, which would affect the composition of the final metabolite mixture. Together these results demonstrate the relevance of including biotransformation in in vitro bioassays for the detection of EAS.",

During toxicity testing in vivo, clinical signs are used to monitor animal welfare and to inform about potential toxicity. This study investigated possible associations between clinical signs, body weight change and histopathological findings observed after necropsy. We hypothesized that clinical signs and body weight loss observed during experiments could be used as early markers of organ toxicity. This represents a potential for refinement in terms of improved study man­agement and decreasing of pain and distress experienced during animal experiments. Data from three sequential toxicity studies of an anti-cancer drug candidate in rats were analyzed using the multivariate partial least squares (PLS) regression method. Associations with a predictive value over 80% were found between the occurrence of mild to severe clinical signs and histopathological findings in the thymus, testes, epididymides and bone marrow. Piloerection, eyes half shut and slightly decreased motor activity were most strongly associated with the pathological findings. A 5% body weight loss was found to be a strong empirical predictor of pathological findings but could also be predicted accurately by clinical signs. Thus, we suggest using mild clinical signs and a 5% body weight loss as toxicity markers and as a non-invasive surveillance tool to monitor research animal welfare in toxicity testing. These clinical signs may also enable reduction of animal use due to their informative potential to support scientific decisions regarding drug candidate selection, dose setting, study design, and toxicity assessment.",

For this purpose, several concentrations of the test substance are incubated with the synthetic peptide for several incubation times. The reaction is stopped by addition of monobromobimane, which forms a fluorescent complex with the free cysteine of the model peptide. The relative remaining non-depleted amount of peptide is determined. Kinetic rate constants are derived from the depletion vs concentration and time matrix and used to distinguish between UN GHS sub-category 1A sensitizers and test substances in sub-category 1B/not classified test substances. In this study, we present a ring trial of the kDPRA with 24 blind-coded test substances in seven laboratories. The intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility were 96% and 88%, respectively (both for differentiating GHS Cat 1A sensitizers from GHS Cat 1B/not classified). Following an independent peer review, the kDPRA was considered to be acceptable for the identification of GHS Cat 1A skin sensitizers. Besides GHS Cat 1A identification, the kDPRA can be used as part of a defined approach(es) with a quantitative data integration procedure for skin sensitization potency assessment. For this aim, next to reproducibility of classification, the quantitative reproducibility and variability of the rate constants were quantified in this study.",

    "abstract": "The whole blood pyrogen test invented 25 years ago, and its variant based on cryo-preserved blood one year later, brought momentum into the field of pyrogen testing, which, despite the broad application of the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, aka bacterial endotoxin test (BET), consumed several hundred thousand rabbits per year world-wide. The resulting international validation and lengthy acceptance and implementation process of what are called now monocyte activation tests (MATs) finally is impacting on animal numbers - at least in Europe - reducing them by more than 70% and counting. The author sees no reason for continuing any regulatory rabbit testing for pyrogens except the lack of acceptance of MATs in some regions of the world. The availability of MATs has opened also the discussion about the shortcomings of LAL/BET, namely its restriction to Gram-negative pyrogens, non-reflection of the potency of these in humans, interference and masking by many products, and animal welfare concerns for horseshoe crabs. The obvious advantages of MATs in all these respects should lead to a shift from LAL/BET to MATs. We are starting to see this for vac-cines and medical devices, but other areas like safety testing of blood transfusions, cell therapies and nanomaterials, and the assessment of air-borne pyrogens still need to grasp the opportunity provided by MATs. While the different MATs can jointly serve these needs, the whole blood MAT has some advantages as discussed here.",

    "abstract": "Internationally, there are thousands of existing and newly introduced chemicals in commerce, highlighting the ongoing importance of innovative approaches to identify emerging chemicals of concern. For many chemicals, there is a paucity of hazard and exposure data. Thus, there is a crucial need for efficient and robust approaches to address data gaps and support risk-based prioritization. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of in vitro bioactivity data from the ToxCast program in deriving points of departure (PODs). ToxCast contains data for nearly 1,400 endpoints per chemical, and the bioactivity concentrations, indicative of potential adverse outcomes, can be converted to human-equivalent PODs using high-throughput toxicokinetics (HTTK) modeling. However, data gaps need to be addressed for broader application: the limited chemical space of HTTK and quantitative high-throughput screening data. Here we explore the applicability of in silico models to address these data needs. Specifically, we used ADMET predictor for HTTK predictions and a generalized read-across approach to predict ToxCast bioactivity potency. We applied these models to profile 5,801 chemicals on Canada’s Domestic Substances List (DSL). To evaluate the approach’s performance, bioactivity PODs were compared with in vivo results from the EPA Toxicity Values database for 1,042 DSL chemicals. Comparisons demonstrated that the bioac­tivity PODs, based on ToxCast data or read-across, were conservative for 95% of the chemicals. Comparing bioactivity PODs to human exposure estimates supports the identification of chemicals of potential interest for further work. The bioac­tivity workflow shows promise as a powerful screening tool to support effective triaging of chemical inventories.",

    "abstract": "Banning or reduction of the use of animals for laboratory experiments is a frequently-discussed societal and scientific issue. Moreover, the usefulness of animals needs to be considered in any decision process on the permission of specific animal studies. This complex issue is often simplified and generalized in the media around the question, \"Are animals useful as a model?\" To render an often emotional discussion about animal experimentation more rational, it is important to define \"usefulness\" in a structured and transparent way. To achieve such a goal, many sub-questions need to be asked, and the following aspects require clarification: (i) consistency of animal-derived data (robustness of the model system); (ii) scientific domain investigated (e.g., toxicology vs disease modelling vs therapy); (iii) measurement unit for \"benefit\" (inte­grating positive and negative aspects); (iv) benchmarking to alternatives; (v) definition of success criteria (how good is good enough); (vi) the procedure to assess benefit and necessity. This series of articles discusses the overall benchmarking process by specifying the six issues. The goal is to provide guidance on what needs to be clarified in scientific and political discussions. This framework should help in the future to structure available information, to identify and fill information gaps, and to arrive at rational decisions in various sub-fields of animal use. In part I of the series, we focus on the robustness of animal models. This describes the capacity of models to produce the same output/response when faced with the \"same\" input. Follow-up articles will cover the remaining usefulness aspects.",

However, as with all types of data and knowledge today, AOPs need to be reusable by machines, i.e., machine-actionable, in order to reach their full impact potential. Machine-actionability is supported by the FAIR principles, which guide findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data and knowledge.

    "abstract": "The adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) were developed to accelerate evidence-based chemical risk assessment by leveraging data from new approach methodologies. Thanks to their stressor-agnostic approach, AOPs were seen as instrumental in other fields. Here, we present AOPs that report non-chemical stressors along with the challenges encountered for their development. Challenges regarding AOPs linked to nanomaterials include non-specific molecular initiating events, limited understanding of nanomaterial biodistribution, and needs for adaptations of the in silico modeling and testing systems. Development of AOPs for radiation face challenges in how to incorporate ionizing events type, dose rate, energy deposition, and how to account for targeting multiple macromolecules. AOPs for COVID-19 required the inclusion of SARS-CoV-2-specific replicative steps to capture the essential events driving the disease. Developing AOPs to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of cell therapies necessitates addressing the cellular nature and the therapeutic function of the stressor. Finally, addressing toxicity of emerging biological stressors like microbial pesticides can learn from COVID-19 AOPs. We further discuss that the adaptations needed to expand AOP applicability beyond chemicals are mainly at the molecular and cellular levels while downstream key events at tissue or organ level, such as inflammation, are shared by many AOPs initiated by various stressors. In conclusion, although it is challenging to integrate non-chemical stressors within AOPs, this expands opportunities to account for real-world scenarios, to identify vulnerable individuals, and to bridge knowledge on mechanisms of adversity. Plain language summaryThe adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework was developed to help predict whether chemicals have toxic effects on humans. Structuring available information in an accessible database can reduce animal testing. AOPs usually capture the path from the interaction of a stressor, usually a chemical, with the human body to an adverse outcome, e.g., a disease symptom. The concept of AOPs has now been expanded to include non-chemical stressors such as nanomaterials, radiation, viruses, cells used to treat patients, and microorganisms employed as pesticides. We use discuss how these stressors need to be accommodated within the framework and point out that pathways initiated by these stressors share downstream events like inflammation with chemical stressors. By integrating non-chemical stressors into the framework, real-world scenarios where people may be exposed to different stressor types can be considered, vulnerable individuals can be identified, and knowledge on toxic effects can be compounded.",

It is based on a fully automated protocol and calculates the binding affinity of any molecule of interest towards a series of 12 proteins, known or suspected to trigger adverse effects and estimates the resulting toxic potential. In contrast to other approaches in the field, the technology allows to rationalize a prediction at the molecular level by interactively analyzing the binding mode of the tested compound with any target protein in 3D. The technology is accessible over the Internet (via a secure SSH protocol) and available for any science-oriented organization.The toxic potential — a complex value derived from the individual binding affinities, their standard deviation and the quality of the underlying model (number and ratio of training and test compounds, activity range covered) — of existing and hypothetical compounds is estimated by simulating and quantifying their interactions towards a series of macromolecular targets at the molecular level using automated flexible docking combined with multi-dimensional QSAR (mQSAR). Currently, those targets comprise 12 proteins: the androgen, aryl hydrocarbon, estrogen α/β, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, thyroid α/β liver X and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ as well as the enzymes cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) and 2A13 (CYP 2A13).Up to date, the technology has been used to predict the toxic potential for more than 2,000 drugs, chemicals and natural compounds. All results are posted in the Internet — in this account, a few will be discussed in detail with reference to the molecular mechanisms triggering the adverse effect.",

    "abstract": "Bone grafting is commonly used to treat large bone defects. Since autografts are limited and frequently associated with postoperative donor morbidity, allografts from bone banks are often used. However, vascularisation of the allograft is often impaired, resulting in inadequate bone healing and functional graft failure. In bone bank processing, tissue is stored at -80°C and subsequently subjected to a harsh multi-step cleaning and sterilisation procedure to prevent immune rejection or transmission of diseases.To determine which step of this procedure diminishes the ability of allografts to induce or promote vascularisation, we used the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model to monitor the vascular reaction to sample bone chips representing the respective procedural steps. The CAM model monitors the angiogenic potency of xenogeneic and, hence, potentially immunogeneic materials (e.g. cells, tissues, tissue-engineered matrices). Due to the chicken embryo's lack of a fully functional immune system, it provides test conditions that are analogous to immunologically incompetent mice and is a well-suited alternative to their use. Bone chips were placed onto the CAM, and vascular reactions were quantified by image analysis after 48 h incubation. The vascular reaction was most pronounced to fresh, untreated bone chips that had been kept at +2°C prior to the experiment. Surprisingly, storage of bone samples at -80°C was sufficient to drastically reduce the vascular reaction. Consistent with this, samples representing different stages of the subsequent procedure showed similarly low vascular indices.",

Human hepatocytes were cultured for several weeks in a serum-free twodimensional culture system, which was used to study the effects of acetaminophen (APAP) on hepatocellular functions and vitality. Non-invasive determinations of albumin, urea and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations in cell culture supernatants allowed continuous monitoring for at least two weeks. APAP was applied every 4 days for 24 h. Each application reduced urea production by 25% and albumin synthesis by approximately 70% without any effects on cellular viability. After removal of the substance, hepatocellular functions returned to control levels within one (urea) to three (albumin) days. The repetitive analyses of APAP-mediated effects on cellular metabolism led to identical results for up to five cycles. The drug also caused reversible and repetitive ultrastructural modifications, in particular an almost complete replacement of rough endoplasmic reticulum by smooth endoplasmic reticulum and a massive degradation of glycogen stores. The data demonstrate the suitability of the culture system to serve as a model for repetitive testing of drug-mediated changes on hepatocellular functions, thereby reducing animal studies during drug development.",

This workshop report is intended to provide scientists with a broad overview of relevant testicular toxicity literature and to suggest opportunities where bioengineering principles and techniques could be used to build improved in vitro testicular models for safety evaluation. Tissue engineering techniques could, conceivably, be immediately implemented to improve existing models.

The relative estrogenic potencies determined, based on ERα binding to coregulator peptides in the presence of ligands on the PamChip® plate, were compared to the relative estrogenic potencies as determined in the in vivo uterotrophic assay. The results show that the estrogenic potencies predicted by the 57 coactivators on the peptide microarray for 18 compounds that display a clear E2 dose-dependent response (goodness of fit of a logistic dose-response model of 0.90 or higher) correlated very well with their in vivo potencies in the uterotrophic assay, i.e., coefficient of determination values for 30 coactivators higher than or equal to 0.85. Moreover, this coregulator binding assay is able to distinguish ER agonists from ER antagonists: profiles of selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen, were distinct from those of pure ER agonists, such as dienestrol. Combination of this coregulator binding assay with other types of in vitro assays, e.g., reporter gene assays and the H295R steroidogenesis assay, will frame an in vitro test panel for screening and prioritization of chemicals, thereby contributing to the reduction and ultimately the replacement of animal testing for (anti-)estrogenic effects.",

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in the development and validation of non-animal test methods for skin sensitization assessment. At present, three of the four key events of the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) are assessable by OECD-accepted in vitro methods. The fourth key event describes the immunological response in the draining lymph node where activated dendritic cells present major histocompatibility complex-bound chemically modified peptides to naive T cells, thereby priming the proliferation of antigen-specific T cells. Despite substantial efforts, modelling and assessing this adaptive immune response to sensitizers with in vitro T cell assays still represents a challenge. The Cosmetics Europe Skin Tolerance Task Force organized a workshop, bringing together academic researchers, method developers, industry representatives and regulatory stakeholders to review the scientific status of T cell-based assays, foster a mutual scientific understanding and conceive new options to assess T cell activation. Participants agreed that current T cell assays have come a long way in predicting immunogenicity, but that further investment and collaboration is required to simplify assays, optimize their sensitivity, better define human donor-to-donor variability and evaluate their value to predict sensitizer potency. Furthermore, the potential role of T cell assays in AOP-based testing strategies and subsequent safety assessment concepts for cosmetic ingredients was discussed. It was agreed that it is currently difficult to anticipate uses of T cell assay data for safety assessment and concluded that experience from case studies on real-life risk assessment scenarios is needed to further consider the usefulness of assessing the fourth AOP key event.",

Consequently, the EPA launched the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) to develop and validate estrogen, androgen, and thyroid (EAT) pathway screening assays and to produce standardized and harmonized test guidelines for regulatory application. In 2009, the EPA issued the first set of test orders for EDSP screening and a total of 50 pesticide actives and 2 inert ingredients have been evaluated using the battery of EDSP Tier 1 screening assays (i.e., five in vitro assays and six in vivo assays).To provide a framework for retrospective analysis of the data generated and to collect the insight of multiple stakeholders involved in the testing, more than 240 scientists from government, industry, academia, and non-profit organizations recently participated in a workshop titled \"Lessons Learned, Challenges, and Opportunities: The U.S. Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.\" The workshop focused on the science and experience to date and was organized into three focal sessions: (a) Performance of the EDSP Tier 1 Screening Assays for Estrogen, Androgen, and Thyroid Pathways; (b) Practical Applications of Tier 1 Data; and (c) Indications and Opportunities for Future Endocrine Testing. A number of key findings and recommendations related to future EDSP evaluations emanated from the collective sessions.",

It assesses the chemical concentration resulting in 50% cytotoxicity (EE-EC50) or the 2-fold increase in IL-1α (IL-1α2x). Four laboratories received 13 coded sensitizers. Reproducible results were obtained in each laboratory. A binary prediction model, EC50 ≥7 mg/ml = weak to moderate sensitizer and EC50 <7 mg/ml = strong to extreme sensitizer had an accuracy of 77%. A superior EE (EC50 and IL-1α2x) correlation was observed to human in vivo DSA05 data compared to LLNA-EC3 data. Human in vivo NOEL and LLNA-EC3 data correlated to a similar extent to in vitro EE data. Our results indicate that this easily transferable EE potency assay is suitable for testing chemical allergens of unknown potencies and may now be ready for further validation, providing complementary potency information to other assays already undergoing validation for assessing skin sensitization potential.",

However, systematic and quantitative studies of the absorption of molecules are quite limited due to a lack of reliable experimental models able to mimic human in vivo responses. In this work, we present an in vitro perfused model of the small intestinal barrier using a 3D reconstructed intestinal epithelium integrated into a fluid-dynamic biore­actor (MIVO®) resembling the physiological stimuli of the intestinal environment. This platform was investigated in both healthy and induced pathological conditions by monitoring the absorption of two non-metabolized sugars, lactulose and mannitol, frequently used as indicators of intestinal barrier dysfunctions. In healthy conditions, an in vivo-like plateau of the percentage of absorbed sugars was reached, where mannitol absorption was much greater than lactulose absorption. Moreover, a model of pathologically altered intestinal permeability was generated by depleting extracellular Ca2+, using a calcium-specific chelator. After calcium depletion, the pattern of sugar passage observed under pathological conditions was reversed only in dynamic conditions in the MIVO® chamber, due to the dynamic fluid flow beneath the membrane, but not in static conditions. Therefore, the combination of the MIVO® with the EpiIntestinal™ platform can rep­resent a reliable in vitro model to study the passage of molecules across the healthy or pathological small intestinal barrier by discriminating the two main mechanisms of intestinal absorption.",

We investigated the applicability of an integrated systems toxicology approach on five selected pesticides to get an overview of their modes of action in humans, to group them according to their modes of action, and to hypothesize on their potential effects on human health. We extracted human proteins associated to prochloraz, tebuconazole, epoxiconazole, procymidone, and mancozeb and enriched each protein set by using a high confidence human protein interactome. Then, we explored modes of action of the chemicals, by integrating protein-disease information to the resulting protein networks. The dominating human adverse effects affected were reproductive disorders followed by adrenal diseases. Our results indicated that prochloraz, tebuconazole, and procymidone exerted their effects mainly via interference with steroidogenesis and nuclear receptors. Prochloraz was associated to a large number of human diseases, and together with tebuconazole showed several significant associations to Testicular Dysgenesis Syndrome. Mancozeb showed a differential mode of action, involving inflammatory processes. This method provides an efficient way of overviewing data and grouping chemicals according to their mode of action and potential human adverse effects. Such information is valuable when dealing with predictions of mixture effects of chemicals and may contribute to the development of adverse outcome pathways.",

    "abstract": "During the past decades, many epidemiological, toxicological and biological studies have been performed to assess the role of environmental chemicals as potential toxicants for diverse human disorders. However, the relationships between diseases based on chemical exposure have been rarely studied by computational biology. We developed a human environmental disease network (EDN) to explore and suggest novel disease-disease and chemical-disease relationships. The presented scored EDN model is built upon the integration on systems biology and chemical toxicology using chemical contaminants information and their disease relationships from the reported TDDB database. The resulting human EDN takes into consideration the level of evidence of the toxicant-disease relationships allowing including some degrees of significance in the disease-disease associations. Such network can be used to identify uncharacterized connections between diseases. Examples are discussed with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Additionally, this computational model allows to confirm already know chemical-disease links (e.g. bisphenol A and behavioral disorders) and also to reveal unexpected associations between chemicals and diseases (e.g. chlordane and olfactory alteration), thus predicting which chemicals may be risk factors to human health. With the proposed human EDN model, it is possible to explore common biological mechanism between two diseases through chemical exposure helping us to gain insight into disease etiology and comorbidity. Such computational approach is an alternative to animal testing supporting the 3R concept.",

    "abstract": "The replacement of animals in acute systemic toxicity testing remains a considerable challenge. Only animal data are currently accepted by regulators, including data generated by reduction and refinement methods. The development of integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA) is hampered by an insufficient understanding of the numerous toxicity pathways that lead to acute systemic toxicity. Therefore, central to our work has been the collection and evalu­ation of the mechanistic information on eight organs identified as relevant for acute systemic toxicity (nervous system, cardiovascular system, liver, kidney, lung, blood, gastrointestinal system, and immune system). While the nervous and cardiovascular systems are the most frequent targets, no clear relationship emerged between specific mechanisms of target organ toxicity and the level (category) of toxicity. From a list of 114 chemicals with acute oral in vivo and in vitro data, 97 were identified with target organ specific effects, of which 94% (91/97) were predicted as acutely toxic by the 3T3 neutral red uptake cytotoxicity assay and 6% (6/97) as non-toxic. Although specific target organ mechanisms of toxicity could in some cases explain the false negative prediction obtained with the cytotoxicity assay, in general it is difficult to explain in vitro misclassifications only on the basis of mechanistic information. This analysis will help to prioritize the development of adverse outcome pathways for acute oral toxicity, which will support the assessment of chemicals using mechanistically informed IATA.",

We characterized the influence of the added complexity using network perturbation analysis and gene expression data. This allowed us to gain insight into the steady-state profile of the assembled, complete three-dimensional model using all four cell types, and of simpler models of one, two, or three cell types. Gene expression data were analyzed using cause-and-effect biological network models, together with a quantitative network-scoring algorithm, to determine the biological impact of co-culturing the various cell types. In the tetra-culture, macrophages appeared to be the largest contributors to overall network perturbations, promoting high basal levels of oxidative stress and inflammation. This finding led to further optimization of the model using rested macrophages, which decreased the basal inflammatory and cell stress status of the co-culture. We compared transcriptional profiles from publicly available datasets of other in vitro models representing the airways and of healthy human lung tissue with those of our model. We found an increasing correlation between airway models and normal human lung tissue as cell types became more physiologically relevant and the complexity of the system increased. This indicates that the combination of multiple lung-relevant cell types in vitro does indeed increase similarity to the physiological counterpart.",

    "abstract": "The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is a conceptual construct that mechanistically links molecular initiating events to adverse biological outcomes through a series of causal key events (KEs) that represent the perturbation of the biological system. Quantitative, predictive AOPs are necessary for screening emerging contaminants and potential substitutes to inform their prioritization for testing. In practice, they are not widely used because they can be costly to develop and validate. A modular approach for assembly of quantitative AOPs, based on existing knowledge, would allow for rapid development of biological pathway models to screen contaminants for potential hazards and prioritize them for subsequent testing and modeling. For each pair of KEs, a quantitative KE relationship (KER) can be derived as a response-response function or a conditional probability matrix describing the anticipated change in a KE based on the response of the prior KE. This transfer of response across KERs can be used to assemble a quantitative AOP. Here we demonstrate the use of proposed approach in two cases: inhibition of cytochrome P450 aromatase leading to reduced fecundity in fathead minnows and ionic glutamate receptor mediated excitotoxicity leading to memory impairment in rodents. The model created from these chains have value in characterizing the pathway and the potential or relative level of toxicological effect anticipated. This approach to simplistic, modular AOP models has wide applicability for rapid development of biological pathway models.",

Nonhuman primates are routinely used biomedical models however it remains challenging to recognise negative states, including pain, in these animals. This study aimed to identify behavioural and facial changes that could be used as pain or general wellness indicators in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). Thirty-six macaques scheduled for planned neuroscience procedures were opportunistically monitored at four times: Pre-Operative (PreOp), Post-Operative (PostOp) once the effects of anaesthesia had dissipated, Pre-Analgesia (PreAn) on the subsequent morning prior to repeating routine analgesic treatment, and Post-Analgesia (PostAn) following administration of analgesia. Pain states were expected to be absent in PreOp, moderate in PreAn, and mild or absent in PostOp and PostAn when analgesia had been administered. Three potential pain indicators were identified: lip tightening and chewing, which were most likely to occur in PreAn, and running which was least likely in PreAn. Arboreal behaviour indicated general wellness, while half-closed eyes, leaning of the head or body shaking indicated the opposite. Despite considerable individual variation, behaviour and facial expressions could offer important indicators of pain and wellness and should be routinely quantified, and appropriate interventions applied to prevent or alleviate pain, and promote positive welfare.",

    "abstract": "Testing chemicals for fish acute toxicity is a legal requirement in many countries as part of environmental risk assessment. To reduce the numbers of fish used, substantial efforts have been focussed on alternative approaches. Prominently, the cell viability assay with the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) gill cell line, RTgill-W1, has been recognized, owing to its high predictive power and robustness. Like gills, the intestine is considered a major site of chemical uptake and biotransformation but, in contrast to gills, is expected to be exposed to rather hydrophobic chemicals, which enter the fish via food. In the present study, we therefore aimed to extend the cell bioassay to the rainbow trout epithelial cell line from intestine, RTgutGC. Using 16 hydrophobic and volatile chemicals from the fragrance palette, we showed that also the RTgutGC cell line can be used to predict fish acute toxicity of chemicals and yields intra-laboratory variability in line with other bioassays. By comparing the RTgutGC toxicity to a study employing the RTgill-W1 assay on the same group of chemicals, a fragrance specific relationship was established which reflects an almost perfect 1:1 relationship between in vitro and in vivo toxicity results. Thus, both cell lines can be used to predict fish acute toxicity, either by using the obtained in vivo-in vitro relationship or by taking the in vitro results at face value. We moreover demonstrate the derivation of non-toxic concentrations for downstream applications which rely on a healthy cell state, such as the assessment of biotransformation or chemical transfer.",

    "abstract": "Myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) establish saltatory nerve conduction during white matter development. Thus, interference with oligodendrogenesis leads to an adverse outcome on brain performance in the child due to aberrant myelination. An intertwined network of hormonal, transcriptional and biosynthetic processes regulates OL development, thereby simultaneously creating various routes of interference for environmental toxicants. The flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is debated as an endocrine disruptor, especially of the thyroid hormone (TH) system. We identified how TBBPA interferes with the establishment of a population of maturing OLs by two independent modes-of-action (MoA), dependent and independent of TH signaling. Combining the previously published oligodendrocyte maturation assay (NPC6) with large-scale transcriptomics, we describe TBBPA as a TH disruptor, impairing human OL maturation in vitro by dysregulation of oligodendrogenesis-associated genes (i.e., MBP, KLF9 and EGR1). Furthermore, TBBPA disrupts a gene expression network regulating cholesterol homeostasis, reducing OL numbers independently of TH signaling. These two MoA converge in a novel putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network on the key event (KE) hypomyelination. Comparative analyses of human and rat neural progenitor cells (NPCs) revealed that human oligodendrogenesis is more sensitive to endocrine disruption by TBBPA. Therefore, ethical, cost-efficient and species-overarching in vitro assays are needed for developmental neurotoxicity hazard assessment. By incorporation of large-scale transcriptomic analyses, we brought the NPC6 assay to a higher readiness level for future applications in a regulatory context. The combination of phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses helps to study MoA to eventually build AOPs for a better understanding of neurodevelopmental toxicity.",

First, the model was established with sterile implants to evaluate biocompatibility. Titanium or stainless steel implants were implanted without adverse effects over the entire observation period of 5 days compared to controls and even up to the pupae and moth stage. Then, stainless steel and titanium implants contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus were implanted into larvae to mimic biofilm-associated infection. For both materials, pre-incubation of the implant with S. aureus led to significantly reduced survival of the larvae compared to sterile implants. Larvae could not be rescued by gentamicin, whereas gentamicin significantly improved the survival of the larvae in case of planktonic infection with S. aureus without an implant, confirming the typical character­istics of reduced antibiotic susceptibility of biofilm infections. Biofilm formation and various stages of biofilm maturation were confirmed by surface electron microscopy and by measuring bacterial gene expression of biofilm-related genes on contaminated implants, which confirmed biofilm formation and upregulation of autolysin (atl ) and sarA genes. In con­clusion, G. mellonella can be used as an alternative in vivo model to study biofilm-associated infections on stainless steel and titanium implants, which may help to reduce animal infection experiments with vertebrates in the future.",

Microcystin congener structural diversity is a challenge for the risk assessment of these toxins, especially as several different PPPs have to be included in the risk assessment. The inhibition of PPP1, PPP2A and PPP5 by 18 structurally different microcystins was determined and demonstrated microcystin congener-dependent inhibition activity and a lower susceptibility of PPP5 to inhibition than PPP1 and PPP2A. The data were employed to train a machine learning algorithm that allows prediction of PPP inhibition (toxicity) based on 2D chemical structure of micro­cystins. IC50 values were classified into three toxicity classes, and three machine learning models were used to predict the toxicity class, resulting in 80-90% correct predictions.",

    "abstract": "Bioprinting is a rapidly developing technology that enables the exact positioning of living cells embedded in bio-materials in precise spatial arrangements to fabricate engineered tissues and organs. While the ultimate goal of bio­printing approaches is to produce organs for transplantation purposes, bioprinted organ models also hold great potential for research purposes to serve as alternatives to animal experiments. By using human cells, humanized organ models can be generated that may produce more relevant results for human (patho-)physiology than animal models. However, standard bioprinting procedures currently use numerous hidden animal components. Virtually all studies published in the field to date make use of cells grown in media with fetal bovine serum (FBS). In addition, Matrigel, the extracellular matrix (ECM) harvested from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma grown in mice, is widely employed to cultivate stem cells and 3D organ models. Finally, most bioinks currently in use contain gelatin or comparable animal components to improve cell viability and adhesion. The present review will give an introduction to the potential of bioprinting to fabricate 3D models that may be substituted for animal experiments and will go on to describe strategies to replace animal components cur­rently included in standard procedures of bioprinting. These approaches comprise the adaptation of cells to FBS-free media, the use of bioinks composed of synthetic or plant material, and the replacement of animal ingredients by materials of human origin. We propose denoting bioprinting strategies devoid of animal components as clean bioprinting.",

We designed a hydrogel rat nerve-on-a-chip (RNoaC) construct that promotes axon growth analogous to mature nerve anatomy and is the first 3D in vitro model to collect electrophysiological and histomorphic metrics to assess in vivo pathophysiology. Here we culture embryonic rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in the construct to demonstrate its potential to screen for implications of nerve dysfunction in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). RNoaC constructs containing DRG explants from E15 rat pups were exposed to the chemotherapeutics bortezomib, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel or vincristine for 7 days. Then, axons were electrically stimulated to collect nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and peak amplitude (AMP), which are clinical electrophysiological metrics indicative of healthy or diseased populations. All chemotherapeutics decreased NCV and AMP in a concentration-dependent manner. At high drug concentrations, NCV and AMP were 10-60% lower than control values. Histopathological analysis revealed hallmarks of peripheral neuropathy. IC50 values calculated from concentration-response curves indicate that the significant decrease in function occurred before a decrease in viability. Our data suggest that electrophysiology recordings collected from our RNoaC platform can closely track subtle pathological changes in nerve function. The ability to collect clinically relevant data from RNoaC suggests it can be an effective tool for in vitro preclinical screening for peripheral neuropathy.",

Building on an analysis on how this applies to toxicology and its change in approach in 2008, we concluded at the time that toxicology had encountered a number of such anomalies and was moving into crisis. Here, the progress along Kuhn’s trajectory over the last 12 years of a scientific revolution is discussed.

The increased production and use of NMs are raising concerns among different stakeholder groups with regard to their effects on human and environmental health. Currently, nanosafety hazard assessment is still widely performed using in vivo (animal) models, however the development of robust and reg­ulatory relevant strategies is required to prioritize and/or reduce animal testing. An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) is a structured representation of biological events that start from a molecular initiating event (MIE) leading to an adverse outcome (AO) through a series of key events (KEs). The AOP framework offers great advancement to risk assessment and regulatory safety assessments. While AOPs for chemicals have been more frequently reported, the AOP collection for NMs is limited. By using existing AOPs, we aimed to generate simple and testable strategies to predict if a given NM has the potential to induce a MIE leading to an AO through a series of KEs. Firstly, we identified potential MIEs or initial KEs reported for NMs in the literature. Then, we searched the identified MIE or initial KEs as keywords in the AOP-Wiki to find associated AOPs. Finally, using two case studies, we demonstrate how in vitro strategies can be used to test the identified MIE/KEs.",

This paper reviews ten characteristics that should be considered when selecting a positive control material for an in vitro assay: 1) the biological mechanism of action, 2) ease of preparation, 3) chemical purity, 4) verifiable physical properties, 5) stability, 6) ability to generate responses spanning the dynamic range of the assay, 7) technical or biological interference, 8) commercial availability, 9) user toxicity, and 10) disposability. Examples and a case study of the monocyte activation test are provided to demonstrate the application of these characteristics for identification and selection of potential positive control materials. Because specific positive control materials are often written into testing standards for in vitro assays, selection of the positive control material based on these characteristics can aid in ensuring the long-term relevance and usability of these standards.",

The purpose of the workshop was to bring together international regulatory bodies, risk assessors, academic scientists, and industry to explore how systematic review methods and the adverse outcome pathway framework could be combined to develop and use mechanistic test methods for predicting the toxicity of chemical substances in an evidence-based manner. The meeting covered the history of biological frameworks, the way adverse outcome pathways are currently developed, the basic principles of systematic methodology, including systematic reviews and evidence maps, and assessment of cer­tainty in models, and adverse outcome pathways in particular. Specific topics were discussed via case studies in small break-out groups. The group concluded that adverse outcome pathways provide an important framework to support mechanism-based assessment in environmental health. The process of their development has a few challenges that could be addressed with systematic methods and automation tools. Addressing these challenges will increase the transparency of the evidence behind adverse outcome pathways and the consistency with which they are defined; this in turn will increase their value for supporting public health decisions. It was suggested to explore the details of applying systematic methods to adverse outcome pathway development in a series of case studies and workshops.",

    "abstract": "The need for reliable, sensitive (developmental) neurotoxicity testing of chemicals has steadily increased. Given the limited capacities for routine testing according to accepted regulatory guidelines, there is potential risk to human health and the environment. Most toxicity studies are based on mammalian test systems, which have been questioned for low sensitivity, limited relevance for humans, and animal welfare considerations. This increased the need for alternative models, one of which is the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo. This study assessed selected neonicotinoids at sub-lethal concentrations for their effects on embryonic development and behavior. The fish embryo acute toxicity test (OECD TG 236) determined the lowest observable effective concentrations, which were used as the highest test concentrations in subsequent behavioral assays. In the FET test, no severe compound-induced sublethal effects were seen at < 100 µM. In the coiling assay, exposure to ≥ 1.25 µM nicotine (positive control) affected both the burst duration and burst count per minute, whereas ≥ 50 µM thiacloprid affected the mean burst duration. Exposure to ≥ 50 µM acetamiprid and imidacloprid induced significant alterations in both mean burst duration and burst count per minute. In the swimming assay, 100 µM acetamiprid induced alterations in the frequency and extent of movements, whilst nicotine exposure only induced non-significant changes. All behavioral changes could be correlated to findings in mammalian studies. Given the quest for alternative test methods of (developmental) neurotoxicity, zebrafish embryo behavior testing could be integrated into a future tiered testing scheme.",

With the advent of new approach methodologies in toxicological risk assessment, guidance on integrating evidence from multiple evidence streams is needed to ensure that all available data is given due consideration in both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment. The present report summarizes the discussions among academic, government, and private sector participants from North America and Europe in an international workshop convened to explore the development of an evidence-based risk assessment framework, taking into account all available evidence in an appropriate manner in order to arrive at the best possible characterization of potential human health risks, and associated uncertainty. Although consensus among workshop participants was not a specific goal, there was general agreement on the key considerations involved in evidence-based risk assessment incorporating 21st century science into human health risk assessment. These considerations have been embodied into an overarching prototype framework for evidence integration that will be explored in more depth in a follow-up meeting.",

    "abstract": "Skin sensitizer potency assessment based on new approach methodologies is key to deriving a point of departure (PoD) for risk assessment. Regression models to predict a PoD based on OECD-validated in vitro tests and trained on local lymph node assay (LLNA) data were previously presented, and results from human tests were recently compiled. To integrate both data sources, the Reference Chemical Potency List (RCPL), which provides potency values (PV) for 33 chemicals integrating LLNA and human data in a structured weight-of-evidence approach, was developed. When calculating regression models vs PV or LLNA data, different weights for the input parameters were noted. As the RCPL is based on too few chemicals to train robust statistical models, the list of human data was extended to a larger set of PV (n = 139) with associated in vitro data. This database was used to retrain the regression models and to compare regression models trained vs (i) LLNA, (ii) PV or (iii) human DSA04 values. Using the PV as a target, predictive models of similar predictivity to the LLNA-based models were obtained, which mainly differ in a lesser weight of cytotoxicity and a higher weight of cell activation and reactivity parameters. Analysis of the human DSA04 dataset indicates a similar pattern but also shows that the human dataset is too small and biased to be a key dataset for potency prediction. Hence, an enlarged set of PV values appears to be a complementary tool to train predictive models next to an LLNA-only database.",

The addition of 0.5% Poloxamer 188 increased proliferation of subcultivated cells 1.5 fold and that of thawed cells about twofold. According to microaspiration experiments the non-ionic surfactant increased the tension of the cell membrane most notably at concentrations = 0.5% owing to adsorption and incorporation into the phospholipid bilayer. Thus, the performance of the cells appears to be improved.

In the current contract project of JRC/ECVAM In vitro-Toxicology Unit, 55 organic chemicals, mostly drugs and pesticides, most belonging to ECVAM/ICCVAM validation compounds, expected to be analyzable by LC-MS technique, were subjected to a feasibility study. The simple experimental setup consisted of one concentration of a chemical (25 μM), enzyme preparation (human or rat liver homogenate or microsomes), a set of cofactors (NADPH, UDPGA, PAPS, GSH), 4 time points (0, 15, 30, 60 min, including cofactor-less tubes). Metabolites produced were analyzed and tentatively identified by LC-MS techniques. Most of the chemicals were metabolized and metabolites were tentatively identified by TOF-MS analysis. For some chemicals, about 10 or even more metabolites were detectable (e.g. thioridazine, verapamil, amitriptyline). Altogether 11 out of 55 did not display any metabolites under the experimental conditions of this study. Regarding the metabolites formed, there were mostly quantitative differences, but about 20 substances displayed also species-dependent qualitative differences, i.e. a major metabolite was formed in one species, but not in the other. For most chemicals, differences between microsomes and homogenates were relatively modest at least in the initial analysis. The results demonstrate that LC-MS approach is feasible and rather efficient in providing useful metabolic data from a simple experimental setup. More complex analyses, e.g. quantitative assessment of differences between species or biological preparations, or in vitro-in vivo extrapolations, require more complex approaches and a collection of appropriate, preferably curated, data bases of in vivo characteristics of the studied chemicals.",

In the development of new therapeutic agents, it is essential that the potential adverse effects of all candidates be identified as early as possible. The field of predictive toxicology strives to profile the potential for adverse effects of novel chemical substances before they occur, both with traditional in vivo experimental approaches and increasingly through the development of in vitro and computational methods which can supplement and reduce the need for animal testing. To be maximally effective, the field needs access to the largest possible knowledge base of previous toxicology findings, and such results need to be made available in such a fashion so as to be interoperable, comparable, and compatible with standard toolkits. This necessitates the development of open, public, computable, and standardized toxicology vocabularies and ontologies so as to support the applications required by in silico, in vitro, and in vivo toxicology methods and related analysis and reporting activities. Such ontology development will support data management, model building, integrated analysis, validation and reporting, including regulatory reporting and alternative testing submission requirements as required by guidelines such as the REACH legislation, leading to new scientific advances in a mechanistically-based predictive toxicology. Numerous existing ontology and standards initiatives can contribute to the creation of a toxicology ontology supporting the needs of predictive toxicology and risk assessment. Additionally, new ontologies are needed to satisfy practical use cases and scenarios where gaps currently exist. Developing and integrating these resources will require a well-coordinated and sustained effort across numerous stakeholders engaged in a public-private partnership. In this communication, we set out a roadmap for the development of an integrated toxicology ontology, harnessing existing resources where applicable. We describe the stakeholders' requirements analysis from the academic and industry perspectives, timelines, and expected benefits of this initiative, with a view to engagement with the wider community.",

The conazoles were investigated in the embryonic stem cell test, and data were compared to in vivo embryotoxicity data. The same conazoles were evaluated on the basis of data from a battery of cell assays for endocrine activity, including assays for AR, ER, AhR, and sex hormone synthesis, and data were compared to in vivo developmental toxicity data. Overall, the ranking of the five conazole fungicides based on in vitro data were in reasonably good agreement with available in vivo effects. Ketoconazole and epoxiconazole are the most potent embryotoxic compounds, whereas prochloraz belongs to the most potent developmental toxicants. In conclusion, a rough prediction of the ranking of these conazole fungicides for in vivo toxicity data was possible by a holistic evaluation of data from a panel of cell-based assays.",

Third parties can submit \"scientifically valid information\" relevant to these proposals to the Agency responsible, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), who are obliged to take the information into account. The European Coalition to End Animal Experiments (ECEAE) provided comments on nearly half of the 817 proposals for vertebrate tests on 480 substances published for comment for the first REACH deadline (between August 1, 2009 and July 31, 2012).This paper summarizes the response by registrants and the Agency to third party comments and highlights issues with the use of read-across, in vitro tests, QSAR, and weight of evidence approaches. Use of existing data and evidence that testing is legally or scientifically unjustified remain the most successful comments for third parties to submit. There is a worrying conservatism within the Agency regarding the acceptance of alternative approaches and examples of where registrants have also failed to maximize opportunities to avoid testing.",

    "abstract": "The call for a new toxicology is mainly a call for cellular approaches and their computational integration. This article reflects on cell models, which are necessary to facilitate the transition. A mechanistic perspective has prompted the characterization of toxicity pathways and toxicity networks in order to develop robust cell-based assays for toxicity testing. Differing use scenarios for cell systems require higher degrees of sophistication, e.g., human-on-a-chip approaches are based on complex organotypic cultures to approximate the repertoire of human physiological reactions and high-throughput tests require simplicity and robustness. The new paradigm emerging under the branding of Toxicology for the 21st Century needs complex models for pathway of toxicity identification and simpler assays for testing the perturbation of any given pathway. With increasing knowledge about underlying mechanisms, the needs for complexity and test specificity will change. Selective cell-based assays are desirable, especially for the detection of novel toxicants and biothreats. Examples from endocrine disruption, pyrogenicity, and especially shellfish toxin testing are used to illustrate such developments.",

Its evaluation refers to the Lowest-Observed-(Adverse)-Effect-Level (LO(A)EL) explicitly requested in several regulatory contexts, such as REACH and EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetic products. So far in vivo tests have been the sole viable option to assess repeated dose toxicity. We report a customized k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) approach for predicting sub-chronic oral toxicity in rats. A training set of 254 chemicals was used to derive models whose robustness was challenged through leave-one-out cross-validation. Their predictive power was evaluated on an external dataset comprising 179 chemicals. Despite the intrinsically heterogeneous nature of the data, our models give promising results, with q2 ≥ 0.632 and external r2 ≥ 0.543. The confidence in prediction was ensured by implementing restrictive user-adjustable rules, excluding suspicious chemicals irrespective of the goodness in their prediction. Comparison with the very few LO(A)EL predictive models in the literature indicates that the results of the present analysis can be valuable in prioritizing the safety assessment of chemicals and thus making safe decisions and justifying waiving animal tests according to current regulations concerning chemical safety.",

    "abstract": "The willingness of the cephalopod mollusc Octopus vulgaris to attack a live crab is traditionally used as a method to assess the overall health and welfare of octopuses in the laboratory. This method requires placing a crab in the home tank of an animal, measuring the time (latency) taken for the octopus to initiate an attack and withdrawing the crab immediately prior to capture. The same crab is commonly used to assess multiple octopuses as part of daily welfare assessment. Growing concern for the welfare of crustaceans and a review of all laboratory practices for the care and welfare of cephalopods following the inclusion of this taxon in Directive 2010/63/EU prompted a study of the utility of an artificial crab to replace a live crab in the assessment of octopus health. On consecutive days O. vulgaris (N=21) were presented with a live, a dead or an artificial crab, and the latency to attack measured. Despite differences in the predatory performance towards the three different crab alternatives, octopuses readily attacked the artificial (and the dead) crab, showing that they can generalize and respond appropriately towards artificial prey. Researchers should consider using an artificial crab to replace the use of a live crab as part of the routine health assessment of O. vulgaris.",

We revisited these hypotheses that were previously tested solely in rodent models, this time using a 3-dimensional proximal tubule microphysiological system incorporating primary human proximal tubule epithelial cells. Using this human cell-derived model, we confirmed that 25OHD3 is transported into the human proximal tubule epithelium via megalin-mediated endocytosis while bound to vitamin D binding protein. Building upon these findings, we then evaluated the role of megalin in modulating the cellular uptake and biological activity of 1α,25(OH)2D3. Inhibition of megalin function decreased the 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated induction of both cytochrome P450 24A1 protein levels and 24-hydroxylation activity following perfusion with vitamin D binding protein and 1α,25(OH)2D3. The potential for reciprocal effects from 1α,25(OH)2D3 on megalin expression were also tested. Contrary to previously published observations from rat proximal tubule epithelial cells, 1α,25(OH)2D3 did not induce megalin gene expression, thus highlighting the potential for meaningful interspecies differences in the homeostatic regulation of megalin in rodents and humans. These findings challenge a recently promoted hypothesis, predicated on the rodent cell data, that attempts to connect 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated regulation of renal megalin expression and the pathology of chronic kidney disease in humans. In addition to providing specific insights related to the importance of renal megalin in vitamin D homeostasis, these results constitute a proof-of-concept that human-derived microphysio­logical systems are a suitable replacement for animal models for quantitative pharmacology and physiology research.",

Two further companies (Merz and Ipsen) have recently validated similar cell-based assays to replace animals in their batch testing.However, the number of animals being used in batch tests across Europe remains at record levels; an estimated 400,000 animals per year, based on official statistics and non-technical summaries. There are concerns from animal protection organisations about the authorisation of animal testing for Botulinum toxin products that are to be used for aesthetic purposes. Furthermore, should testing for companies that have not yet implemented the alternative method continue to be permitted under EU Directive 2010/63 on the use of animals for scientific purposes? Whilst we are on the cusp of an era where the mouse bioassay has been replaced for the potency testing of Botulinum toxin A for injection, it is important that Europe sees a reduction of animal testing in real terms.",

Although RA has been described in the medical lit­erature for over two hundred years, its etiology and pathophysiology are insufficiently understood. The current treatment of RA is mainly empirical or based on drugs that interfere with generic steps of the immune response, with limited efficacy and/or significant side effects. Much of RA research has been traditionally based on animals and simplistic in vitro models, which have been shown to poorly recapitulate human RA etiopathogenesis and drug responses. A revolution in science and technology has produced a new generation of more relevant and predictive tools. These tools, which include patient-derived cells, innovative 3D cell culture systems, computational analyses and models, together with omics and large-scale epidemiological studies represent novel and exciting approaches to enhance and forward RA research in a human biology-based perspective. After considering some pitfalls and flaws of traditional models, in this review we discuss novel tools applicable to design human-oriented RA research, while fostering the need for a more holistic and pre­ventative approach to the disease. Our goal is to stimulate discussion, both at scientific and public level, on the need to explore new avenues in RA research and to support a paradigm-shift from animal-based towards human biology-based systems to better understand human pathophysiology and to develop more effective targeted therapies for personalized treatment and prevention.",

In this assay,hTPO activity was shown to be inhibited by 5 known TPO inhibitors and not inhibited by 5 non-inhibitors. Similar results were obtained with porcine TPO (pTPO).The inhibition of hTPO by the model compounds was also tested with guaiacol and Ampliflu Red as alternative indicator substrates. While all substrates allowed the detection of pTPO activity and its inhibition, only the Ampliflu Red and luminol-based methods were sensitive enough to allow the quantification of hTPO activity from Nthy-ori 3-1 cell lysates. Moreover, luminol gave results with a narrower 95% confidence interval and therefore more reliable data.Whole extracts of fast-growing Nthy-ori 3-1 cells circumvent the need for animal-derived thyroid organs,thereby reducing costs, eliminating potential contamination and providing the possibility to study human instead of porcine TPO. Overall, the application of luminol and Nthy-ori 3-1 cell lysate for the detection of the disruption of hTPO activity was found to represent a valuable in vitro alternative and a possible candidate for inclusion within a high throughput integrated testing strategy for the detection of compounds that potentially interfere with normal thyroid function in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Organs-on-chip (OC) have gained much interest as animal-free toxicity testing methods due to their closer resemblance to human tissues and longer culture viability than conventional in vitro methods. The current paper discusses where and how OCs may take a role in the transition to a more predictive, animal-free safety assessment for regulatory purposes. From a preliminary analysis of a repeated dose toxicity database, ten organs of priority for OC development for regu­latory use have been identified. For a number of these organs (lung, skin, liver, kidney, heart, and intestine), OCs are already at rather advanced stages of development, such that involvement of regulators becomes of value in the optimi­zation towards fitness-for-purpose of these methods. For organs such as testis, spleen, brain, and stomach, OCs are much more premature, if existing at all. Therefore, developmental work on OCs for these latter organs is expected to stay in the academic arena for the coming time. A number of technical recommendations and some challenges to reaching final implementation are discussed. We recommend that the development of OCs goes forward together with the development of adverse outcome pathways (AOP) and that they are combined with other methods into integrated testing strategies. Overall, opportunities exist, but much still needs to be done. In our view, regular interactions in multi-stakeholder work­shops on the application of animal-free innovations such as OCs will be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of high throughput in vitro assays has the potential to significantly improve toxicological evaluations and lead to more efficient, accurate, and less animal-intensive testing. However, directly using all available in vitro assays in a model is usually impractical and inefficient. On the other hand, mechanistic knowledge has always been critical for toxicological evaluations and should not be ignored even with the increasing availability of data. In this paper, we illus­trate a promising approach to integrating mechanistic knowledge with multiple data sources for in vitro assays, using drug-induced liver injury (DILI) as an example. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework was used as a source for mechanistic knowledge and as a selection tool for high throughput predictors. Our results confirm the value of AOPs as a knowledge source for understanding adverse events and show that the majority of drugs classified as most-DILI-concern were mapped to AOPs related to liver toxicity found in AOPwiki. AOPs were also used effectively to select a subset of assays from the Tox21 and L1000 projects as the predictors in predictive modeling of DILI risk. Together with previously published drug properties for daily dose, lipophilicity, and reactive metabolite formation, these assay endpoints were used to build a penalized logistic regression model for assessing DILI risk. This model obtained an accuracy of 0.91, thus confirming the potential power of integrating mechanistic knowledge with high throughput assays for toxicological evalu­ations. The results also provide a roadmap for data integration that could be used for other adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Many toxicological test methods, including assays of cell viability and function, require an evaluation of concentration-response data. This often involves curve fitting, and the resulting mathematical functions are then used to determine the concentration at which a certain deviation from the control value occurs (e.g. a decrease of cell viability by 15%). Such a threshold is called the benchmark response (BMR). For a toxicological test, it is often of interest to determine the concentration of test compound at which a pre-defined BMR of e.g. 10, 25 or 50% is reached. The concentration at which the modelled curve crosses the BMR is called the benchmark concentration (BMC). We present a user-friendly, web-based tool (BMCeasy), designed for operators without programming skills and profound statistical background, to determine BMCs and their confidence intervals. BMCeasy allows simultaneous analysis of viability plus a functional test endpoint, and it yields absolute BMCs with confidence intervals for any BMR. Besides an explanation of the algorithm underlying BMCeasy, this article also gives multiple examples of data outputs. BMCeasy was used within the EU-ToxRisk project for preparing data packages that were submitted to regulatory authorities, demonstrating the real-life applicability of the tool.",

    "abstract": "Animals have been considered an indispensable tool to teach about the functioning of living organisms, to obtain skills necessary for practicing human and veterinary medicine, as well as for acquiring skills for caring for and conducting experiments on animals in laboratories. However, the efficacy of this practice has been questioned in recent decades, and societal views have evolved to place a much stronger emphasis on animal welfare and ethics that needs to be reflected in our teaching and training practices. Currently, many alternatives to harmful animal use are available, and it is not clear why thousands of animals continue to be used every year for educational and training purposes. Therefore, this study aimed to identify reasons for the lack of uptake of non-harmful educational and training methods by analyzing recently published non-technical summaries in the EU and EEA Member States and to provide examples of alternatives for specific learning objectives. Results from non-technical summaries from 18 countries spanning the most recent years (2017-2019) revealed that the two main perceived reasons for continued animal use are: 1) the necessity to use a living animal for “proper” learning and 2) the lack of an adequate alternative. We argue that these reasons often do not reflect reality. In conclusion, we consider it is necessary to place a stronger emphasis on engagement with ethical questions that underlie the use of animals and careful consideration of how the learning objectives could be achieved through non-harmful alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Systematic reviews provide a structured framework for summarizing the available evidence in a comprehensive, objective, and transparent manner. They inform evidence-based guidelines in medicine, public policy, and more recently, in environmental health and toxicology. Many regulatory agencies have extended and adapted the well-established systematic review methods, initially developed for clinical studies, for their assessment needs. The use of systematic reviews to summarize evidence from existing human, animal, and mechanistic studies can reduce reliance on animal test data in risk assessment and can help avoid unnecessary duplication of animal experiments that have already been conducted. As alternative test methods can be expected to play an increasing role in human health risk assessment in the future, systematic reviews can be particularly helpful in validating these alternatives. The field of evidence-based toxicology has undergone extensive development since its first meeting in 2007 as a result of collaborative efforts among international experts and public health agencies, particularly with respect to the use of mechanistic data and evidence integration. The continued development and wider adoption of systematic review methodology can lead to better 3R implementation. As undertaking a systematic review can be a complex and lengthy process, it is important to understand the main steps involved. Key steps, along with current best practices, are described with references to guidance from organizations with expertise in evidence synthesis. Applications of systematic reviews in clinical, observational, and experimental studies are presented. Finally, software tools available to facilitate and increase the efficiency of completing a systematic review are described.",

For NAMs that require laboratory experiments, it is critical that they provide consistent and reliable results. While guidance has been provided on improving the reproducibility of NAMs that require laboratory experiments, there is not yet an overarching technical framework that details how to add measurement quality features into a protocol. In this manuscript, we discuss such a framework and provide a step-by-step process describing how to refine a protocol using basic quality tools. The steps in this framework include 1) conceptual analysis of sources of technical variability in the assay, 2) within-laboratory evaluation of assay performance, 3) statistical data analysis, and 4) determination of method transferability (if needed). While each of these steps has discrete components, they are all inter-related, and insights from any step can influence the others. Following the steps in this framework can help reveal the advantages and limitations of different choices during the design of an assay such as which in-process control measurements to include and how many replicates to use for each control measurement and for each test substance. Overall, the use of this technical framework can support optimizing NAM reproducibility, thereby supporting meeting research and regulatory needs.",

    "abstract": "Manufacturing and functionalizing materials at the nanoscale has led to the generation of a whole array of nanoforms (NFs) of substances varying in size, morphology, and surface characteristics. Due to financial, time, and ethical considerations, testing every unique NF for adverse effects is virtually impossible. Use of hypothesis-driven grouping and read-across approaches, as supported by the GRACIOUS Framework, represents a promising alternative to case-by-case testing that will make the risk assessment process more efficient. Through application of appropriate grouping hypotheses, the Framework facilitates the assessment of similarity between NFs, thereby supporting grouping and read-across of information, minimizing the need for new testing, and aligning with the 3R principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement of animals in toxicology studies. For each grouping hypothesis an integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA) guides the user in data gathering and acquisition to test the hypothesis, following a structured format to facilitate efficient decision-making. Here we present the template used to generate the GRACIOUS grouping hypotheses encompassing information relevant to “Lifecycle, environmental release, and human exposure”, “What they are: physicochemical characteristics”, “Where they go: environmental fate, uptake, and toxicokinetics”, and “What they do: human and environmental toxicity”. A summary of the template-derived hypotheses focusing on human health is provided, along with an overview of the IATAs generated by the GRACIOUS project. We discuss the application and flexibility of the template, providing the opportunity to expand the application of grouping and read-across in a logical, evidence-based manner to a wider range of NFs and substances.",

As the usefulness of animals in research is also a significant societal and political issue, criteria to structure debates and evaluations are needed. Here, background information is given on laboratory animal studies. Moreover, parameters that may be considered in judging their usefulness are suggested. The discussion is strictly focused on animals used as tools/test systems/models to provide information on humans. In this context, general features and performance characteristics of models are discussed. Examples are given for well-recognized criteria (e.g., robustness, relevance, predictivity) to judge the usefulness of predictive models. The main hypothesis put forward here is that a benefits evaluation (usefulness metrics) is only possible within sharply circumscribed \"use domains\". Examples are given for the research fields of drug and vaccine research, toxicology, disease pathogenesis, and basic biological research. Efficacy, safety, and quality studies are highlighted as \"use domains\" within the field of drug discovery and production. A further separation into individual diseases, drug targets or symptoms is suggested for, e.g., efficacy studies or pathophysiology. Finally, an outlook is given on the evaluation of model advantages and disadvantages to arrive at their \"net benefit\". Moreover, the need to compare the net benefits of animal models versus that of their alternatives is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with only a fraction of patients responding to immunotherapy. The correlation between increased T-cell infiltration and positive patient outcomes has motivated the search for therapeutics promoting T-cell infiltration. While transwell and spheroid platforms have been employed, these models lack flow and endothelial barriers, and cannot faithfully model T-cell adhesion, extravasation, and migration through 3D tissue. Presented here is a 3D chemotaxis assay, in a lung tumor-on-chip model with 3D endothelium (LToC-Endo), to address this need. The described assay consists of a HUVEC-derived vascular tubule cultured under rocking flow, through which T-cells are added; a collagenous stromal barrier, through which T-cells migrate; and a chemoattractant/tumor (HCC0827 or NCI-H520) compartment. Here, activated T-cells extravasate and migrate in response to gradients of rhCXCL11 and rhCXCL12. Adopting a T-cell activation protocol with a rest period enables proliferative burst prior to introducing T-cells into chips and enhances assay sensitivity. In addition, incorporating this rest recovers endothelial activation in response to rhCXCL12. As a final control, we show that blocking ICAM-1 interferes with T-cell adhesion and chemotaxis. This microphysiological system, which mimics in vivo stromal and vascular barriers, can be used to evaluate potentiation of immune chemotaxis into tumors while probing for vascular responses to potential therapeutics. Finally, we propose translational strategies by which this assay could be linked to preclinical and clinical models to support human dose prediction, personalized medicine, and the reduction, refinement, and replacement of animal models.",

    "abstract": "Many laboratory procedures generate data on properties of chemicals, but they cannot be equated with toxicological \"test methods\". This apparent discrepancy is not limited to in vitro testing, using animal-free new approach methods (NAM), but also applies to animal-based testing approaches. Here, we give a brief overview of the differences between data generation and the setup or use of a complete test method. While there is excellent literature available on this topic for specialists (GIVIMP guidance; ToxTemp overview), a brief overview and easily-accessible entry point may be useful for a broader community. We provide a single figure to summarize all test method elements and processes required in the development (setup and adaptation) of a test method. The exposure scheme, the endpoint, and the test system are briefly outlined as fundamental elements of any test method. A rationale is provided, why they are not sufficient. We then explain the importance and role of purpose definition (including some information on what is modelled) and the prediction model, aka data interpretation procedure, which depends on the purpose definition, as further essential elements. This connection exemplifies that all fundamental elements are interdependent, and none can be omitted. Finally, discussion is provided on validation as a measure to provide confidence in the reliability, performance, and relevance of a test method. In this sense, validation may be considered a sixth fundamental element for practical use of test methods. Plain language summary Many laboratory procedures generate data on chemicals, but they cannot be considered complete toxicological \"test methods\". Here, we give a brief explanation of the fundamental elements of a toxicological test method. We provide an illustration that gives a complete overview of the devel­opment of a test method for non-specialists. We introduce the six fundamental elements, i.e., the exposure scheme, the test endpoint, the test system, the purpose definition and the prediction model and describe how they work together. Finally, we discuss the concept of validation. An understanding of these concepts is important for good-quality scientific research and especially for the development and acceptance of alternatives to animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "The 4th Annual Forum on Endocrine Disrupters organized by the European Commission brought together the authors of this article around the topic: “From bench to validated test guidelines: (pre)val­idation of test methods”. Validation activities are meant to demonstrate the relevance and reliability of methods and approaches used in regulatory safety testing. These activities are essential to facil­itate regulatory use, still they are largely underfunded and unattractive to the scientific community. In the last decade, large amounts of funding have been invested in European research towards the development of approaches that can be used in regulatory decision-making, including for the identification of endocrine disrupters. There is a vast pool of candidate test methods for potential reg­ulatory applications, but most of them will not be used due to the absence of consideration of their relevance and reliability outside the method developer’s laboratory. This article explains the reasons why such a gap exists between the outputs of research projects and the uptake in a regulatory context. In parallel, there are also increasing expectations from the regulatory science community that validation becomes more efficient with respect to time and resources. This article shares some of the lessons learned and proposes paths forward for validation of new methods that are not intended as one-to-one replacements of animal studies. This includes submitting only mature methods for validation that were developed following good practices and good documentation, proposing a greater emphasis on well-documented transferability studies, and adopting a cost-sharing model among those who benefit from validated methods.",

Such methodology, if properly applied, could help substantially reduce the use of animals in pre-clinical research. Here, quinidine was chosen as an example of a drug with cardiac effects and results of nine published clinical studies describing its PK (plasma concentration) and PD (QTcB/?QTcB) effects were mimicked by combination of the IVIVE platform Simcyp (pharmacokinetics prediction) with the ToxComp (cardiac effect prediction) system, based exclusively on in vitro data.

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are activated in most chronic neurodegenerative diseases associated with inflammatory events such as Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease, but also in stroke. Due to an aging population worldwide, research efforts in these areas are likely to expand in the future. This will entail an increased demand for appropriate experimental models. We introduce here the new immortalized mouse astrocyte cell line IMA 2.1 as an alternative to currently used primary astrocyte cultures. IMA 2.1 were directly compared with primary mouse astrocytes with respect to their response to proinflammatory stimuli, expression of typical astrocyte markers, and to the cell line's capacity to metabolize the parkinsonian toxin MPTP to its toxic metabolite MPP+. Under inflammatory conditions, mimicked with the addition of a cytokine mix, IMA 2.1 responded similarly to primary astrocytes with mRNA upregulation, expression of iNOS and COX-2, and the release of various inflammatory mediators. Analysis of astrocytic markers indicated that IMA 2.1 represent a relatively early, GFAP-negative stage of astrocyte development. Moreover, conversion of MPTP by monoamine oxidase-B proceeded in IMA at least as quickly as in primary cells. For all endpoints investigated, the cell line IMA 2.1, derived from a single clone, delivered reproducible results over a period of several years and allowed upscaling of experiments due to its easy handling compared with primary cells.",

    "abstract": "The present study evaluates the applicability of the zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET) to assess prenatal developmental toxicity (PDT) potency of the DMSO-extracts of 9 petroleum substances (PS), with variable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content, and 2 gas-to-liquid (GTL) products, without any PAHs but otherwise similar properties to PS. The results showed that all PS extracts induced concentration-dependent in vitro PDT, as quantified in the ZET and that this potency is associated with their 3-5 ring PAH content. In contrast and as expected, GTL products did not induce any effect at all. The potencies obtained in the ZET correlated with those previously reported for the embryonic stem cell test (EST) (R2=0.61), while the correlation with potencies reported in in vivo studies were higher for the EST (R2=0.85) than the ZET (R2=0.69). Combining the results of the ZET with those previously reported for the EST (Kamelia et al., 2017), the aryl hydrocarbon (AhR) CALUX assay (Kamelia et al., 2018), and the PAH content, ranked and clustered the test compounds in line with their in vivo potencies and chemical characteristics. To conclude, our findings indicate that the ZET does not outperform the EST as a stand-alone assay for testing PDT of PS, but confirms the hypothesis that PAHs are the major inducers of PDT by some PS, while they also indicate that the ZET is a useful addition to a battery of in vitro tests able to predict the in vivo PDT of PS.",

    "abstract": "Experiments with cultured mammalian cells represent an in vitro alternative to animal experiments. Fetal calf serum (FCS) is the most commonly used medium supplement worldwide. FCS contains a variable mixture of growth factors and cyto­kines that support cell proliferation. This undefined nature of FCS is a source of experimental variation, undesired immune responses, possible contaminations and, because of the way it is obtained, an ethical concern. Thus, alternative, defined, valid, and reliable medium supplements should be characterized in a large number of experiments. Human platelet lysate (hPL) is increasingly appreciated as an alternative to FCS. Since it is unclear whether cells respond differentially to clin­ically relevant chemotherapeutics inducing replicative stress and DNA damage (hydroxyurea, irinotecan), induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKi) imatinib, and novel epigenetic modifiers belonging to the group of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), we investigated these issues. Here we show that cancer cells derived from leukemia and colon cancer grow very similarly in culture media supplemented with FCS or outdated hPL. Notably, cells have practically identical proteomes under both culture conditions. Moreover, cells grown with FCS or hPL responded equally to all types of drugs and stress conditions that we tested. In addition, the transfection of blood cells by electroporation can be achieved under both conditions. Furthermore, we reveal that class I HDACs, but not HDAC6, are required for the expression of the pan-leukemic marker WT1 under various culture conditions. Hence, hPL is a moderately priced substitute for FCS in various experimental settings.",

    "abstract": "E-cigarettes have become within only one decade an important commodity, changing the market of the most mass-killing commercial product. While a few years ago estimates suggested that in the course of the 21st century one billion people would die prematurely from tobacco consumption, e-cigarettes continuously gaining popularity promise 10-30fold lower health effects, possibly strongly changing this equation. However, they still are not a harmless life-style drug. Acceptability simply depends on whether we compare their use to smoking or to not-smoking. In the absence of long-term follow-up health data of users, additional uncertainty comes from the lack of safety data, though this uncertainty likely only is whether they represent 3 or 10% of the risk of their combustible counterpart. This means that there is little doubt that they represent a prime opportunity for smokers to switch, but also that their use by non-smokers should be avoided where possible. The real safety concerns, however, are that e-cigarettes expose their users to many compounds, contaminants and especially flavors (more than 7,000 according to recent counts), which have mostly not been tested, especially not for long-term inhalation exposure. Neither the precautionary traditional animal testing nor post-marketing surveillance will offer us data of sufficient quality or sufficiently fast to support product development and regulatory decisions. Thus, alter­native methods lend themselves to fill this gap, making this new product category a possible engine for new method development and its implementation and validation.",

    "abstract": "The maximal chemical concentration that causes an acceptably small or no effect in an organism or isolated cells is an often-sought-after value in toxicology. Existing approaches to derive this value have raised several concerns; thus, it is often chosen case-by-case based on personal experience. To overcome this ambiguity, we propose an approach for choosing the non-toxic concentration (NtC) of a chemical in a rational, tractable way. We developed an algorithm that identifies the highest chemical concentration that causes no more than 10% effect (≤ EC10) including the modeled 95% confidence intervals and considering each of the measured biological replicates; and whose toxicity is not significantly different from no effect. The developed algorithm was validated in two steps: by comparing its results with measured and modeled data for 91 dose-response experiments with fish cell lines and/or zebrafish embryos; and by measuring actual effects caused by NtCs in a separate set of experiments using a fish cell line and zebrafish embryos. The algorithm provided an NtC that is more protective than NOEC (no-observed-effect-concentration), NEC (modeled no-effect concentration), EC10 and BMD (benchmark dose). Despite focusing on small-scale bioassays here, this study indicates that the NtC algorithm could be used in various systems. Its application to the survival of zebrafish embryos and to metabolic activity in cell lines showed that NtCs can be applied to different effect measure&shy;ments, time points, and levels of biological organization. The algorithm is available as Matlab and R source code, and as a free, user-friendly online application.",

    "abstract": "Instilling confidence in use of in vitro assays for predictive toxicology requires evaluation of assay performance. Performance is typically assessed using reference chemicals--compounds with defined activity against the test system target. However, developing reference chemical lists has historically been very resource-intensive. We developed a semi-automated process for selecting and annotating reference chemicals across many targets in a standardized format and demonstrate the workflow here. A series of required fields defines the potential reference chemical: the in vitro molecular target, pathway, or phenotype affected; and the chemical's mode (e.g. agonist, antagonist, inhibitor). Activity information was computationally extracted into a database from multiple public sources including non-curated scientific literature and curated chemical-biological databases, resulting in the identification of chemical activity in 2995 biological targets. Sample data from literature sources covering 54 molecular targets ranging from data-poor to data-rich was manually checked for accuracy. Precision rates were 82.7% from curated data sources and 39.5% from automated literature extraction. We applied the final reference chemical lists to evaluating performance of EPA's ToxCast program in vitro bioassays. The level of support, i.e. the number of independent reports in the database linking a chemical to a target, was found to strongly correlate with likelihood of positive results in the ToxCast assays, although individual assay performance had considerable variation. This overall approach allows rapid development of candidate reference chemical lists for a wide variety of targets that can facilitate performance evaluation of in vitro assays as a critical step in imparting confidence in alternative approaches.",

    "abstract": "Here we describe a reconstructed full thickness human oral mucosa (gingiva) equivalent with integrated Langerhans Cells (GE-LC) and use it to compare LC activation and migration from oral versus skin epithelium. The physiologically representative models consist of differentiated reconstructed epithelium (keratinocytes and Langerhans-like cells derived from the MUTZ-3 cell line) on a fibroblast-populated collagen hydrogel which serves as a lamina propria for gingiva and dermis for skin. Topical exposure of GE-LC and the skin equivalent (SE-LC) to sub-toxic concentrations of the allergens cinnamaldehyde, resorcinol and nickel sulphate, resulted in LC migration out of the epithelia. Neutralizing antibody to CXCL12 blocked allergen-induced LC migration in SE-LC but not in GE-LC. Also, gingival fibroblasts secreted very low amounts of CXCL12 compared to skin fibroblasts even when stimulated with rhTNFα or rhIL-1α. Surprisingly, cinnamaldehyde exposure of GE-LC resulted in an increase in MUTZ-3 LC and CD83 mRNA in the hydrogel but did not result in an increase in CD1a+ cells in the collagen hydrogel (as was observed for SE-LC. These results indicate that in gingiva, upon allergen exposure, MUTZ-3 LC migrate in a CXCL12 independent manner from epithelium-to-lamina propria and in doing so mature become CD1a- and increase CD83+ mRNA. These physiologically relevant in vitro models which not only are human but which also resemble specific tissues, may aid in the identification of factors regulating immune stimulation which in turn will aid the development of therapeutic interventions for allergy and inflammation, anti-cancer vaccines as well as improving diagnostics for skin and oral allergy.",

    "abstract": "The REACH Regulation requires information on acute oral toxicity for substances produced or imported in quantities greater than one ton per year. When registering, animal testing should be used as last resort. The standard acute oral toxicity test requires use of animals. Therefore, the European Chemicals Agency examined whether alternative ways exist to generate information on acute oral toxicity. The starting hypothesis was that low acute oral toxicity can be predicted from the results of low toxicity in oral sub-acute toxicity studies. Proving this hypothesis would allow avoiding acute toxicity oral testing whenever a sub-acute oral toxicity study is required or available and indicates low toxicity. ECHA conducted an analysis of the REACH database and found suitable studies on both acute oral and sub-acute oral toxicities for 1,256 substances. 415 of these substances had low toxicity in the sub-acute toxicity study (i.e., NO(A)EL at or above the limit test threshold of 1,000 mg/kg). For 98% of these substances, low acute oral toxicity was also reported (i.e., LD50 above the classification threshold of 2,000 mg/kg). On the other hand, no correlation was found between lower NO(A)ELs and LD50. According to the REACH Regulation, this approach for predicting acute oral toxicity needs to be considered as part of a weight of evidence analysis. Therefore, additional sources of information to support this approach are presented. Ahead of the last REACH registration deadline, in 2018, ECHA estimates that registrants of about 550 substances can omit the in vivo acute oral toxicity study by using this adaptation.",

New in vitro methods may replace, or at least reduce, these animal experiments, provided they are able to correctly predict safety or possible toxicity in humans. However, the challenge is to link in vitro data obtained in human cells to human in vivo data. We here present a new approach to the safety assessment of excipients (SAFE) for pulmonary drug delivery. The SAFE model is based on a dose response curve of 23 excipients tested on the human pulmonary epithelial cell lines A549 and Calu-3. The resulting in vitro IC50 values were correlated with the FDA-approved concentrations in pharmaceutical products for either pulmonary (if available) or parenteral administration. Setting a threshold of 0.1% (1 mg/mL) for either value yielded four safety classes and allowed to link IC50 data as measured in human cell cultures in vitro with the concentrations of the same compounds in FDA-approved drug products. The necessary in vitro data for novel excipients can be easily generated, and the SAFE approach allows putting them into context for eventual use in human pulmonary drug products. Excipients that are most likely not safe for use in humans can be excluded early on from further pharmaceutical development. The SAFE approach thus helps to avoid unnecessary animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "Dermal toxicity is driven by the ability of a substance to penetrate the skin. The “triple pack” approach, which combines in vivo rat, in vitro rat, and in vitro human data, is used to calculate an estimated human dermal absorption factor (DAF). To assess the feasibility of deriving a DAF using only in vitro data, we retrospectively evaluated agrochemical formulations to compare the DAF derived from each individual method to the DAF generated from the triple pack approach. For most of the formulations evaluated, the in vitro rat method generated a similar or higher DAF value than the in vivo method. Absorption through in vitro human skin was similar to or less than that observed in rat skin for all formulations. For most of the formulations, the human in vitro method provided a similar or higher estimate of dermal absorption than the triple pack approach. For human health risk assessment, in vitro assays using human skin would be preferable, as they would be directly relevant to the species of interest and avoid overestimation of dermal absorption using rat models. However, rat in vitro studies would still have utility in the absence of human in vitro data. In vitro rat data provide estimates of dermal absorption that are at least as protective as in vivo rat data and thus could also be considered adequate for use in estab­lishing DAFs. The comparisons presented support potentially using in vitro data alone for DAF derivation for human health risk assessment of pesticides.",

Reference data are of even greater importance for regulatory acceptance. In contrast to most other adverse effects, human skin sensitization data on many chemicals are available, next to data from animal studies, such as the local lymph node assay (LLNA). Skin sensitization NAM data can therefore be compared to different reference datasets. Recent publications and validation at the OECD focused on human and LLNA reference data. The \"2 out of 3\" DA (2o3 DA) is the first DA for skin sensitization solely based on experimental data from validated tests and was recently adopted as an OECD test guideline. Here we review the predictivity of the 2o3 DA on multiple human and LLNA reference datasets. Concomitantly, we compare the predictivity of the LLNA for human data within the same datasets. Comparing predictivity of methods not only bilaterally (NAM or DA vs. animal method) but including human data in a triangle \"NAM data – animal data – human data\" offers a comprehensive assessment of the NAM's and DA's predictivity. In all these assessments, the 2o3 DA was superior to the LLNA in predicting human skin sensitization hazard. This highlights the importance of a holistic view of reference data instead of limiting validation of NAMs and DAs to data from a single animal test only.",

    "abstract": "Read-across approaches are considered key in moving away from in vivo animal testing towards addressing data-gaps using new approach methods (NAMs). Ample successful examples are still required to substantiate this strategy. Here we present and discuss the learnings from two OECD IATA endorsed read-across case studies. They involve two classes of pesticides – rotenoids and strobilurins – each having a defined mode-of-action that is assessed for its neurological hazard by means of an AOP-based testing strategy coupled to toxicokinetic simulations of human tissue concentrations. The endpoint in question is potential mitochondrial respiratory chain mediated neurotoxicity, specifically through inhibition of complex I or III. An AOP linking inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons formed the basis for both cases but was deployed in two different regulatory contexts. The two cases also exemplify several different read-across concepts: analogue versus category approach, consolidated versus putative AOP, positive versus negative prediction (i.e., neurotoxicity versus low potential for neurotoxicity), and structural versus biological similarity. We applied a range of NAMs to explore the toxicodynamic properties of the compounds, e.g., in silico docking as well as in vitro assays and readouts – including transcriptomics – in various cell systems, all anchored to the relevant AOPs. Interestingly, although some of the data addressing certain elements of the read-across were associated with high uncertainty, their impact on the overall read-across conclusion remained limited. Coupled to the elaborate regulatory review that the two cases underwent, we propose some generic learnings of AOP-based testing strategies supporting read-across.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition with a multifactorial origin. To date, approaches to drug discovery for PD have resulted in symptomatic therapies for the motor manifestations and signs associated with neurodegeneration but have failed to identify preventive or curative therapies. This failure mainly originates from the persistence of major gaps in our understanding of the specific molecular basis of PD initiation and progression. New approach methodologies (NAMs) hold the potential to advance PD research while facilitating a move away from ani-mal-based research. We report a workshop involving NAM experts in the field of PD and neurodegenerative diseases, who discussed and identified a scientific strategy for successful, human-specific PD research. We outline some of the most important human-specific NAMs, along with their main potentials and limitations, and suggest possible ways to overcome the latter. Key recommendations to advance PD research include integrating NAMs while accounting for multiple levels of complexity, from molecular to population level; learning from recent advances in Alzheimer’s disease research; increasing the sharing of data; promoting innovative pilot studies on disease pathogenesis; and accessing philanthropic funding to enable studies using novel approaches. Collaborative efforts between different stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians, and funding agencies, are urgently needed to create a scientific roadmap and support a paradigm change towards effective, human-specific research for neurodegenerative diseases without animals, as is already happening in the field of toxicology.",

    "abstract": "Hazard assessments of skin sensitizers are increasingly being performed using new approach methodologies (NAMs), with several in chemico, in vitro and most recently also defined approaches (DAs) being accepted for regulatory use. However, keeping track of potential limitations of each method in order to define applicability domains remains a crucial component to ensure adequate predictivity as well as facilitating the appropriate selection of method(s) for each hazard assessment task. The objective of this report is to share test results generated with the GARD™skin assay on chemicals that have traditionally been considered as difficult to test in some of the conventional in vitro and in chemico OECD Test Guidelines for skin sensitization. Such compounds may include, for example, indirectly acting haptens, hydrophobic substances, and substances of unknown variable composition or biological substances (UVCBs). Based on the results of this study, the sensitivity for prediction of skin sensitizing hazard of indirectly acting haptens was 92.4% and 87.5%, when compared with LLNA (n=25) and human data (n=8), respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity for prediction of skin sensitizing hazard of hydrophobic substances was 85.1% and 100%, when compared with LLNA (n=24) and human data (n=9), respectively. Lastly, a case study involving assessment of a set of hydrophobic UVCBs (n=7) resulted in a sensitivity of 100, as compared to available reference data. Thus, it was concluded that these data provide support for the inclusion of such chemistries in the GARD™skin applicability domain, without an increased risk of false negative classifications.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced neurotoxicity is a leading cause of safety-related attrition for therapeutics in clinical trials, often driven by poor predictive capability of preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of neurotoxicity. Over a dozen different iPSC-derived 3D spheroids have been published in recent years, but their ability to predict neurotoxicity in patients has not been evaluated, nor compared with the predictive power of nonclinical species. To assess the predictive capabilities of the human iPSC-derived neural spheroids (microBrains), we used 84 structurally diverse pharmaceuticals with robust clinical and preclinical datasets with varying degrees of seizurogenic and neurodegenerative liability. Drug-induced changes in neural viability and phenotypic calcium bursts were assessed using 7 endpoints based on calcium oscillation profiles and cellular ATP levels. These endpoints normalized by therapeutic exposure were used to build logistic regression models to establish endpoint cutoffs and evaluate probability for clinical neurotoxicity. The neurotoxicity score calculated from the logistic regression model could distinguish neurotoxic from non-neurotoxic clinical molecules with a specificity as high as 93.33% and a sensitivity of 53.49%, demonstrating a very low false positive rate for the prediction of seizures, convulsions and neurodegeneration. In contrast, nonclinical species showed a higher sensitivity (75%) and much lower specificity (30.4%). The neural spheroids demonstrated higher likelihood ratio positive and inverse likelihood ratio negative compared with nonclinical safety studies. This assay has the potential to be used as a predictive assay to detect neurotoxicity in early drug discovery, aiding in the early identification of compounds that eventually may fail due to neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "A literature survey funded by the Foundation Animalfree Research was performed to obtain an overview on animal experiments in nanotechnology. Scientific articles from Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland published between 2004 and 2007 were collected. A total of 164 articles was retrieved covering in vivo nanotechnological research. The majority of animal experiments were conducted in “nanomedicine”, i.e. nanotechnology in the health care area, to study targeted drug, vaccine or gene delivery. Further areas of research relate to nanotechnology-based imaging technologies, the toxicity of nanomaterials, tissue engineering for regenerative treatments, and magnetic tumour thermotherapy. Many experiments were classified as moderately and even severely distressful to the animals. Due to the significance of the scientific topics pursued, the possible scientific benefit of the research depicted in the articles is also assigned to be moderate to high. Nevertheless, it has to be asked whether such animal experiments are truly the only means to answer the scientific questions addressed in nanotechnology. An overview on non-animal test methods used in nanotechnological research revealed a broad spectrum of methodologies applied in a broad spectrum of scientific areas, including those for which animal experiments are being performed. Explicit incentives to avoid animal experiments in nanotechnology currently can only be found in the area of nanotoxicology, but not in the area of nanomedicine. From the point of view of animal welfare, not least because of the new technologies that arise due to nanotechnology, it is time for a paradigm change both in fundamental and applied biomedical research to found research strategies on non-animal test methods.",

Today, in the US, the National Academy of Sciences publication of Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy proves their point. This pivotal publication recognizes that the future of toxicity testing lies in the use of human cells in culture and in methods that Bill Russell and Rex Burch could not have possibly conceived of in 1959 but which they identified generically as \"the future.\" To truly establish this 21st Century approach will require very specific training in translational toxicology (the use of clinical observations to develop in vitro methods to understand pathways and systems biology), the development of transnational programs, and ways to evaluate the accuracy, validity and importance of new and/or traditional studies. These evaluations are known at evidence-based toxicology (EBT). Science is \"the art of the question.\" The concepts identified above are the tools to answer these questions – and to lead us to the next round of questions. The principles that Bill Russell and Rex Burch developed during the 1954-59 writing of \"The Book\" may be more important today than ever before. They argued that the newest science, the most humane science is also the very best science. This hypothesis is being proven now, as each of us contributes to the world's body of knowledge.",

This paper describes the parallels and discontinuities between the approach and methods of evidence-based medicine and health care and those proposed for toxicology. The critical element of an evidence-based approach for either discipline is the adoption of unbiased, transparent methodologies during the collection, appraisal, and pooling of evidence. This approach, implemented during the conduct of a systematic review, allows evaluation of the breadth and quality of available evidence. At present, systematic reviews are rarely done in toxicology by regulatory agencies, international organizations, or academic scientists. Adopting an EBT approach will necessitate significant changes in practice as well as attention to distinctive characteristics of toxicological studies, notably their emphasis on identifying harms and their reliance on experimental animal studies. An evidence-based approach does not obviate the role of judgment and values in decision making; its goal is to ensure provision of all available information in a transparent and unbiased manner.",

    "abstract": "The practice of risk assessment and regulation of substances has largely developed as a patchwork of circumstantial additions to a nowadays more or less shared international toolbox. The dominant drivers from the US and Europe have pursued remarkably different approaches in the use of these tools for regulation, i.e., a more risk-based approach in the US and a more precautionary approach in Europe. We argue that there is need for scientific developments not only for the tools but also for their application, i.e., a need for Regulatory Science or, perhaps better, Safety Science. While some of this is emerging on the US side as strategic reports, e.g., from the National Academies, the NIH and the regulatory agencies, especially the EPA and the FDA, such strategic developments beyond technological developments are largely lacking in Europe or have started only recently at EFSA, ECHA or within the flagship project EU-ToxRisk.This article provides a rationale for the creation of a European Safety Sciences Institute (ESSI) based on regulatory and scientific needs, political context and current EU missions. Moreover, the possible modus operandi of ESSI will be described along with possible working formats as well as anticipated main tasks and duties. This mirrors the triple alliance on the American side (US EPA, NIH and FDA) in revamping regulatory sciences. Moreover, this could fit the political agenda of the European Commission for better implementation of existing EU legislation rather than creating new laws. Corrigendum: doi:10.14573/altex.1703281",

A febrile response may be caused by endotoxin contamination, microbial components other than endotoxin, or chemical agents that generate a material-mediated pyrogenic response. While test methods for the assessment of endotoxin contamination and some microbial components other than endotoxin are well-established, material-mediated pyrogens remain elusively undefined. This review presents the findings of literature searches conducted to identify material-mediated pyrogens associated with medical devices. The in vivo rabbit pyrogen test (RPT) is considered to be the \"gold standard\" for medical device pyrogenicity testing, despite the fact that few medical device-derived material-mediated pyrogens are known. In line with global efforts to reduce the use of research animals, an in vitro monocyte activation test (MAT) has the potential to replace the RPT. The MAT is used to detect substances that activate human monocytes to release cytokines. This review will also describe the potential opportunities and challenges associated with MAT adoption for the detection of material-mediated pyrogens in medical device testing.",

The technique is in accordance with the 3R principles and represents an excellent opportunity to investigate the physiology of organs in detail under standardized conditions. It is also suitable for the translation of basic pre-clinical research into a more relevant arena prior to or avoiding live animal research altogether. Furthermore, organ perfusion has also been an important tool in developing methods of organ preservation for transplantation surgery. Yet, due to the nature of the experiments, only short-term observations can be made and while cells are still exposed to their regional secretome, the whole organ itself is isolated from the body and correlations between organ systems cannot be taken into consideration. This review gives an overview over the history of extracorporeal perfusion of large animal organs and limbs, highlighting major achievements in the field and discussing different experimental set-ups. Advantages and limitations of the technique are presented. Prospective future research perspectives, which may include tracking of specific cell types and study of their distinct behavior towards different stimuli, are given to illustrate the relevance of this method.",

Skin sensitisation is defined as a series of key events, that form an adverse outcome pathway (AOP). Key event three in the AOP is dendritic cell activation that can be modelled by the human Cell Line Activation Test (h-CLAT) and is typified by changes in cell surface markers CD54 and CD86 in dendritic cells. The h-CLAT is accepted at a regulatory level (OECD Test-Guideline (TG)442E) and can be used to assess skin sensitisation potential as part of an integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA). Stakeholders in the cosmetics and chemical industries have scientific and ethical concerns relating to use of animal derived material and have communicated a strong preference for fully human based in vitro methods. Therefore, we adapted the h-CLAT to animal-product-free conditions and validated the adapted method with the proficiency panel substances in Annex II of TG442E, using 3 independent batches of pooled human serum. The modified method showed equivalence to the validated reference method (VRM), as all proficiency substances were correctly classified. Comparable values for CV75 (concentration yielding 75% cell viability), EC150 and EC200 (concentration yielding RFI of ≥150 for CD86 and ≥200 for CD54) were obtained. Data generated using the adapted method may be used in European REACH submissions, provided the proficiency data is included.

    "abstract": "Nephrotoxicity of chemotherapeutics is a major hindrance in the treatment of various tumors. Therefore, test systems that reflect mechanisms of human kidney toxicity are necessary, and to reduce animal testing cell culture based systems have to be developed. One cell type that is of specific interest in this regard are renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, as they reabsorb substances from human primary urine filtrates and thus are exposed to urinary excreted xenobiotics and are a major target of cisplatin toxicity. While animal studies using gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) knock-out mice or GGT inhibitors show that GGT activity increases kidney toxicity of cisplatin, the use of various cell models gives contradictory results. We therefore used a cell panel of immortalized human renal proximal tubular epithelial (RPTECs) cell lines differing in GGT activity. Low GGT activity resulted in high cisplatin sensitivity, as observed in RPTEC-SV40 cells or after siRNA mediated knock-down of GGT in RPTEC/TERT1 cells that have high GGT activity. However, the addition of GGT did not rescue, but also increased cisplatin sensitivity and adding GGT inhibitor as well as substrate (glutathione) or product (cysteinyl-glycine) of GGT resulted in decreased sensitivity. While our data suggest that the use of cell panels are of value in toxicology and toxicogenomics, they also emphasize on the complex interplay of toxins with the intracellular and extracellular microenvironment. In addition, we hypothesize that especially epithelial barrier formation and polarity of RPTECs need to be considered in toxicity models to validly predict the in vivo situation.",

However, it is often not clear how a methods paper differs from a methods protocol. Confusion between these two very different types of publication is widespread. The resultant misunderstanding contributes to a relatively poor reputation of methods research in biology despite the fact that many Nobel prizes have been awarded specifically for method development. Here, the key components of a methods paper are summarized: (i) methods description, (ii) performance standards, (iii) applicability domains, (iv) evidence for advances compared to the state-of-the-art, (v) exemplification of the method by practical application. In addition, information domains are discussed that are desirable but may be provided on a case-by-case basis or over the course of a series of papers: (vi) method robustness, (vii) accuracy and (viii) precision measures, including various quantifications of method performance, and (ix) measures of uncertainty, including a sensitivity analysis. Finally, elements of the overall framing of the method description are highlighted. These include the scientific, technical and, e.g., toxicological rationale for the method, and also the prediction model, i.e., the procedure used to transform primary data into new information.",

    "abstract": "Some laboratory issues are taken for granted as they seem to be simple and not worth much thought. This applies to “concentrations of a chemical tested for bioactivity/toxicity”. Can there be any issue about weighing a compound, diluting it in culture medium and calculating the final mass (or particle number)-to-volume ratio? We discuss here some basic concepts about concentrations and their units, addressing also differences between “dose” and “concentration”. The problem of calculated nominal concentrations not necessarily corresponding to local concentrations (relevant for biological effects of a chemical) is highlighted. We present and exemplify different concentration measures, for instance those relying on weight, volume, or particle number of the test compound in a given volume; we also include normalizations to the mass, protein content, or cell number of the reference system. Interconversion is discussed as a major, often unresolved, issue. We put this into the context of the overall objective of defining concentrations, i.e., the determination of threshold values of bioactivity (e.g., an EC50). As standard approach for data display, the negative decadic logarithm of the molar concentrations (–log(M)) is recommended here, but arguments are also presented for exceptions from such a rule. These basic definitions are meant as a foundation for follow-up articles that examine the concepts of nominal, free, and intracellular concentrations to provide guidance on how to relate in vitro concentrations to in vivo doses by in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) in order to advance the use of new approach methods (NAM) in regulatory decision making.",

The model development was carried out using 77 compounds for which gene expression data for treated primary human hepatocytes is available in the LINCS database and for which rodent in vivo hepatotoxicity information is available in the eTOX database. The data from LINCS were used to determine the type and number of pathways disturbed by each compound and to estimate the extent of disturbance (network perturbation elasticity), and were used to analyze the correspondence with the in vivo information from eTOX. Predictive models were developed through this integrative analysis, and their specificity and sensitivity were assessed. The quality of the predictions was determined on the basis of the area under the curve (AUC) of plots of true positive vs. false positive rates (ROC curves). The ROC AUC reached values of up to 0.9 (out of 1.0) for some hepatotoxicity endpoints. Moreover, the most frequently disturbed metabolic pathways were determined across the studied toxicants. They included, e.g., mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and amino acid metabolism. The process was exemplified by successful predictions on various statins. In conclusion, an entirely new approach linking gene expression alterations to the prediction of complex organ toxicity was developed and evaluated.",

Two major mechanisms of this complex physiological process are (I) chemotaxis of fibroblasts from surrounding tissue to the implant region, followed by (II) tissue remodeling. As an alternative to animal studies, we here propose a process-aligned in vitro test platform to investigate the material dependency of fibroblast chemotaxis and tissue remodeling mediated by material-resident macrophages. Embedded in a biomimetic three-dimensional collagen hydrogel, chemotaxis of fibroblasts in the direction of macrophage-material-conditioned cell culture supernatant was analyzed by live cell imaging. A combination of statistical analysis with a complementary parameterized random walk model allowed quantitative and qualitative characterization of the cellular walk process. We thereby identified an increasing macrophage-mediated chemotactic potential ranking of biomaterials from glass over polytetrafluorethylene to titanium. To address long-term effects of bio-material-resident macrophages on fibroblasts in a three-dimensional microenvironment, we further studied tissue remodeling by applying macrophage-material-conditioned medium on fibrous in vitro tissue models. A high correlation of the in vitro tissue model to state of the art in vivo study data was found. Titanium exhibited a significantly lower tissue remodeling capacity compared to polytetrafluorethylene. With this approach, we identified a material dependency of both chemotaxis and tissue remodeling processes, strengthening knowledge on their specific contribution to the foreign body reaction.",

    "abstract": "Read-across (RAX) is a popular data gap-filling technique that uses category and analogue approaches to predict toxicological endpoints for a target. Despite its increasing relevance, RAX relies on human expert judgement and lacks a reproducible and automated protocol. It also relies only on structural similarity for identifying the analogues, while other aspects are often neglected. In this paper, we propose an automated procedure for the selection of analogues for data gap-filling. Analogues were identified by a decision algorithm that integrates three similarity metrics, each considering different toxicologically relevant aspects (i.e., structural, biological and metabolic similarity). Structural filters based on the presence of maximum common substructures (MCS) and common functional groups (FGs) were applied to narrow the chemical space for the analogue search. The procedure has been implemented as a workflow in KNIME and is freely available. The workflow provides informative tabular and graphical outputs to support toxicologists and risk assessors in drawing conclusions based on the RAX approach. The procedure has been validated for its predictive power on two datasets related to high-tier in vivo toxicological endpoints, i.e., human hepatotoxicity and druginduced liver injury (DILI). The validation results gave good accuracy values (i.e., up to 0.79 for the binary hepatotoxicity classification and up to 0.67 for the three-class DILI classification) that were higher than those returned by RAX based on the sole use of structural similarity. Results confirmed the suitability of the procedure as a source of data to support regulatory decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Although several in vitro assays that predict the sensitizing potential of chemicals have been developed, none can distinguish between chemical respiratory and skin sensitizers. Recently, we established a new three-dimensional dendritic cell (DC) coculture system consisting of a human airway epithelial cell line, immature DCs derived from human peripheral monocytes, and a human lung fibroblast cell line. In this coculture system, compared to skin sensitizers, respiratory sensitizers showed enhanced mRNA expression in DCs of the key costimulatory molecule OX40 ligand (OX40L), which is important for T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation. Herein, we established a new two-step DC/T cell coculture system by adding peripheral allogeneic naïve CD4+ T cells to the DCs stimulated in the DC coculture system. In this DC/T cell coculture system, model respiratory sensitizers, but not skin sensitizers, enhanced mRNA expression of the predominant Th2 marker interleukin-4 (IL-4). To improve the versatility, in place of peripheral monocytes, monocyte-derived proliferating cells called CD14-ML were used in the DC coculture system. As in peripheral monocytes, enhanced mRNA expression of OX40L was induced in CD14-ML by respiratory sensitizers compared to skin sensitizers. When these cell lines were applied to the DC/T cell coculture system with peripheral allogeneic naïve CD4+ T cells, respiratory sensitizers but not skin sensitizers enhanced the mRNA expression of IL-4. Thus, this DC/T cell coculture system may be useful for discriminating between respiratory and skin sensitizers by differential mRNA upregulation of IL-4 in T cells.",

The present report summarizes the discussions among academic, government, and private sector participants from North America and Europe in an international workshop convened to explore the development of an evidence-based risk assessment framework, taking into account all available evidence in an appropriate manner in order to arrive at the best possible characterization of potential human health risks, and associated uncertainty. Although consensus among workshop participants was not a specific goal, there was general agreement on the key considerations involved in evidence-based risk assessment incorporating 21st century science into human health risk assessment. These considerations have been embodied into an overarching prototype framework for evidence integration that will be explored in more depth in a follow-up meeting.",

Food also has an enormous economic impact on society, with the european food and drink industry boasting a turnover of about 600 billion € (i.e. 15% of the manufacturing output of europe) and 2.6 million employees (Holland and Pope, 2004). this still excludes the agricultural sector, which produces 220 billion € of products and provides 7.5 million people with jobs. In an often quoted speech made in 1962, John F. Kennedy declared consumer safety a fundamental right. Due to globalisation (roughly 50% of our food is nowadays imported) and condensation of the industry, in particular of food retailers, to a rather small number in recent years, an asymmetry of information with respect to the safety and control of food products has developed which requires international attention.",

    "abstract": "\"Endocrine disruption\" is a public and political buzzword that has and is still receiving high media attention. Based on the latter, numerous tiered testing strategies have evolved that should ensure that humans will not run a health risk due to the voluntary or involuntary exposure to endocrine active compounds (EAS). An analysis of the currently available knowledge on EAS mediated endocrine disruption in humans demonstrates that there are very few EAS that causally induce endocrine disruptive effects. Conversely, the association EAS exposure with increased risk or incidences of endocrine disruptive effects in humans are difficult to reconcile with the results from animal studies. Consequently, the analysis of the traditional and historically grown tiered approach in EAS testing, often at very high doses or concentrations, demonstrates that the likelihood of detecting EAS with true potential for endocrine disruption in humans is very low, primarily due to inherent differences between the surrogate species and the human, and will provide for a high number of false-positives commensurate with low efficiency, high cost, and often violently disputed interpretations of what the data would mean for human risk assessment. It is thus proposed that EAS testing for putative endocrine disruption in humans and qualitative and quantitative evaluation for risk assessment purposes should be entirely focused on human data, and derived from a combination of in silico and in vitro systems, PBPK modeling, metabonomic or genomic profiling of human tissue, realistic human EAS exposure, dose-effect principles and adverse effect scenarios, human patient or exposure cohort datasets, etc. Animals models should be used only where specific pathways in endocrine physiology and thus development and reproduction is nearly identical to the situation in the human, thereby guaranteeing that causal exposure and effect relationships in the animals can be extrapolated to the human.",

They then explained how the Three Rs can be used to diminish or remove direct inhumanity (“the infliction of distress as an unavoidable consequence of the procedure employed”) and contingent inhumanity (“the infliction of distress as an incidental and inadvertent by-product of the use of a procedure”). They concluded that “Replacement is always a satisfactory answer, but Reduction and Refinement should, whenever possible, be used in combination”.Many of the commonsense insights in The Principles are no less relevant today than they were in 1959. However, their warnings about the limited value of models and, in particular, the danger of succumbing to the high-fidelity fallacy (whereby it is assumed that the best models for humans are always placental mammals, because they are more like humans than other animals), appear to have largely gone unheeded. Of particular importance is their discussion on toxicity testing, which they saw as one use of laboratory animals “which is an urgent humanitarian problem, for it regularly involves considerable and sometimes acute distress”. How, then, can it be that mammalian models are still routinely used in attempts to detect chemical carcinogens and reproductive toxins, despite the fact that the relevance to humans of the data they provide has not been, and perhaps could never be, satisfactorily established? Nevertheless, there are signs that some significant changes in attitude are taking place, particularly in the USA, which could be more in line with the main thrust of The Principles, the belief that good science and human technique inextricably go hand-in-hand.",

Several important points arose from the meeting. First, industry and regulatory bodies should not wait for complete suites of alternative tests to become available, but should begin working with methods available right now (e.g., mining of existing animal data to direct future studies, implementation of alternative tests wherever scientifically valid rather than continuing to rely on animal tests) in non-animal and animal integrated strategies to reduce the numbers of animals tested. Second, sharing of information (communication), harmonization and standardization (coordination), commitment and collaboration are all required to improve the quality and speed of validation, acceptance and implementation of tests. Finally, how alternative methods can be used in research and development before formal implementation in regulations should be considered. Here we present the conclusions on what can be done already and suggest some solutions and strategies for the future.",

    "abstract": "Among the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine candidates, SO2 is the prototype of the first live-attenuated vaccine that recently entered into clinical trials. To investigate the capacity of SO2 to stimulate an appropriate immune response in vitro within a human immunological context, a comparative analysis of the effects promoted by SO2, the current Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was conducted in human primary dendritic cells (DC), which are critical modulators of vaccine-induced immunity.In particular, we found that SO2 promotes the expression of maturation markers similarly to BCG but to a lower extent than Mtb. Moreover, SO2-infected DC released higher levels of interleukin (IL)-23 than BCG-infected cells, which accounts for the expansion of interferon (IFN)-γ-producing T cells in an IL-12-independent manner. In the autologous mixed leukocyte reaction setting, the expansion of IL-17-producing T cells was also observed in response to SO2 infection. Interestingly, apoptosis and autophagic flux, events required for antigen presentation within MHC class II complex, were not affected in DC infected with SO2, converse to what we observed upon Mtb stimulation.Collectively, our results indicate that SO2 represents a promising TB vaccine candidate, which displays an attenuated phenotype and promotes in DC a stronger capacity to stimulate the Th response than BCG vaccine. Interestingly, the data obtained by using the human DC-based experimental setting mirrored the results derived from studies in animal models, suggesting that this system could be used for an efficient and rapid down-selection of new TB vaccine candidates, contributing to achieving the 3Rs objective.",

Limited availability of cadavers, undesirable changes in tissue texture and the absence of bleeding are the main disadvantages of cadaver-based training compared to training in live animals. This study proposes a chemical cadaver preservation method aimed at overcoming the aforementioned limitations. Blood circulation could be reproduced in preserved cadavers, thereby enabling satisfactory simulation-based training of several surgical procedures, from incision to suture and including hemostatic techniques. The model in this study introduces a high-fidelity simulation training alternative to prepare students for the practice of surgery. In this manner, surgical interventions would be restricted to surgical cases and healthy animals would not be submitted to surgical procedures exclusively for learning purposes.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical animal toxicity studies may not accurately predict human toxicity. In light of this, in vitro systems have been developed that have the potential to supplement or even replace animal use. We examined in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) of gene expression data obtained from The Open Japanese Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation System (Open TG-GATEs) for 131 compounds given to rats for 28 days, and to human or rat hepatocytes for 24 hours. Notably, a pair ranking (PRank) method was developed to assess IVIVE potential with a PRank score based on the preservation of the order of similarity rankings of compound pairs between the platforms using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to measure area under the curve (AUC). A high IVIVE potential was noted for rat primary hepatocytes when compared to rat 28-day studies (PRank score = 0.71) whereas the IVIVE potential for human primary hepatocytes compared to rat 28-day studies was lower (PRank score = 0.58), indicating that species difference plays a critical role in IVIVE. When limiting the analysis to only those drugs causing drug-induced liver injury, the IVIVE potential was slightly improved both for rats (from 0.71 to 0.76) and for humans (from 0.58 to 0.62). Similarly, PRank scores were improved when the analysis focused on specific hepatotoxic endpoints such as hepatocellular injury, or cholestatic injury. In conclusion, toxicogenomic data generated in vitro yields a ranking of drugs regarding their potential to cause toxicity which is comparable to that generated by in vivo analyses.",

Standardly used animal-derived sera therein, are associated to ethical concerns, the risk of contaminations and many uncertainties in their composition and impact on cells. Therefore their use should be completely omitted. In this study we developed a serum-free, defined co-culture medium and implemented it to set up an adipocyte-endothelial cell (EC) co-culture model. Human adipose-derived stem cells were differentiated under defined conditions (diffASCs) and, like human microvascular ECs (mvECs), cultured in a developed defined co-culture medium in mono-, indirect or direct co-culture for 14 days. The developed defined co-culture medium was superior to compared mono-culture media and facilitated the functional maintenance and maturation of diffASCs including perilipin A expression, lipid accumulation and glycerol and leptin release. The medium equally allowed mvEC maintenance, confirmed by the expression of CD31 and vWF and acLDL uptake. Thereby mvECs showed a strong dependency on EC-specific factors. Additionally the development of vascular structures by mvECs was facilitated when directly co-cultured with diffASCs. The completely defined co-culture system allows for the serum-free setup of adipocyte/EC co-cultures and thereby represents a valuable and ethically acceptable tool for the setup of vascularized adipose tissue models.",

Pituitary cell proliferation in the T-screen was stimulated by three out of eleven tested compounds, namely thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Of these three compounds, only T4 causes an increase in relative pituitary weight, and thus T4 was the only compound for which the effect in the in vitro assay correlated with a reported in vivo effect. As to the newly developed TSH-screen, two compounds had an effect, namely, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) induced and T4 antagonized FRTL-5 cell proliferation. These effects correlated with in vivo changes induced by these compounds on thyroid weight. Altogether, the results indicate that most of the selected compounds affect pituitary and thyroid weights by modes of action different from a direct thyroid hormone receptor (THR) or TSH receptor (TSHR)-mediated effect, and point to the need for additional in vitro tests for an ITS. Additional analysis of the T-screen revealed a positive correlation between the THR-mediated effects of the tested compounds in vitro and their effects on relative heart weight in vivo, suggesting that the T-screen may directly predict this THR-mediated in vivo adverse effect.",

    "abstract": "To protect the human skin from extensive solar radiation, melanocytes produce melanin and disperse it via melanosomes to keratinocytes in the basal and suprabasal layers of the human epidermis. Moreover, melanocytes are associated with pathological skin conditions such as vitiligo and psoriasis. Thus, an in vitro skin model that comprises a defined cutaneous pigmentation system is highly relevant in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and medical research. Here, we describe how the epidermal-melanin-unit can be established in vitro. Therefore, primary human melanocytes are implemented in an open source reconstructed epidermis. Following 14 days at the air liquid interface, a differentiated epidermis was formed and melanocytes were located in the basal layer. The functionality of the epidermal-melanin-unit could be shown by the transfer of melanin to the surrounding keratinocytes, and a significantly increased melanin content of models stimulated with either UV-radiation or the melanin precursor dihydroxyphenylalanine. Additionally, an UV50 assay was developed to test the protective effect of melanin. In analogy to the IC50 value in risk assessment, the UV50 value facilitates a quantitative investigation of harmful effects of natural UV-radiation to the skin in vitro. Employing this test, we could demonstrate that the melanin content correlates with the resilience against simulated sunlight, which comprises 2.5 % UVB and 97.5 % UVA. Besides demonstrating the protective effect of melanin in vitro, the assay was used to determine the protective effect of a consumer product in a highly standardized setup.",

Due to dichotomizing continuous read-outs into discrete \"positive/negative\" hazard data, non-animal methods can reveal discordant classifications if results are sufficiently close to a defined classification threshold. This paper explores the impact of precision uncertainty on the predictive accuracy of non-animal methods. Using selected non-animal methods for assessing skin sensitization hazard as case study examples, we explore the impact of precision uncertainty separately and in combination with uncertainty due to varying composition and size of experimental samples. Our results underline that discrete numbers on a non-animal method's sensitivity, specificity, and concordance are of limited value for evaluation of its predictivity. Instead, information on the variability and the upper and lower limits of accuracy metrics should be provided to ensure a transparent assessment of a testing method's predictivity, and to allow for a meaningful comparison of the predictivity of a non-animal method with that of an animal test.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing need to develop alternatives to animal testing to derive biokinetic data for evaluating both efficacy and safety of chemicals. One such alternative is bottom-up physiologically-based biokinetic (PBK) modeling, which requires only in vitro data. The primary objective of this study was to develop and validate bottom-up PBK models of 3 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, and pitavastatin. Bottom-up PBK models were built using the Simcyp® sim­ulator by incorporating in vitro transporter and metabolism data (Vmax, Jmax, Km, CLint) obtained from the literature and proteomics-based scaling factors to account for differences in transporter expression between in vitro systems and in vivo organs. Simulations were performed for single intravenous, single oral, and multiple oral doses of these chemicals. The results showed that our bottom-up models predicted systemic exposure (AUC0h-t), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), plasma clearance, and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) within two-fold of the observed data, with the exception of parameters associated with multiple oral pitavastatin dosing and single oral fluvastatin dosing. Additional middle-out simulations were performed using animal distribution data to inform tissue-to-plasma equilibrium distribution ratios for rosuvastatin and pitavastatin. This improved the predicted plasma-concentration time profiles but did not significantly alter the predicted biokinetic parameters. Our study demonstrates that quantitative proteomics-based mechanistic in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) can account for downregulation of transporters in culture and predict whole organ clearance without empirical scaling. Hence, bottom-up PBK modeling incorporating mechanistic IVIVE could be a viable alternative to animal testing in predicting human biokinetics.",

Their exposure in coculture was found to have the potential to increase their response to sensitizing chemicals, enable the detection of pro-haptens and support the identification of skin sensitization potency. The present study was undertaken to assess the predictive capacity of COCAT to both skin sensitization hazard and potency and to assess the intra-laboratory reproducibility of COCAT based on the blind testing of chemicals. Results showed a reproducibility between runs of 80 % for 15 coded chemicals. 100 % sensitivity (9/9), 75 % specificity (3/4) and 92.3 % accuracy (12/13) was found for skin sensitization hazard prediction, while the tests of two chemicals were inconclusive. Including additional chemicals tested during the optimization phase in addition to the blind tested chemicals, the skin sensitization UN GHS sub-categories were correctly predicted for 85.7 % (12/14) Sub-category 1A chemicals, 83.3 % (10/12) Sub-category 1B chemicals and 92.3 % (12/13) 'No Category' chemicals, resulting in an overall accuracy of 87.4 % (34/39).

    "abstract": "In biological systems (cell culture media, cells, body fluids), drugs/toxicants are usually not freely dissolved but partially bound to biomolecules; only a fraction of the chemical is free/unbound (fu). To predict pharmacological effects and toxicity, it is important that the fu of the drug is known. As the differences between free and nominal concentrations are determined by test system parameters (e.g., the protein and lipid content, and the type of surface material), comparison of nominal concentrations between two different new approach methods (NAM) may lead to faulty conclusions. The same problem exists when in vitro concentrations are compared to those in human subjects. Therefore, the respective fu of a chemical in a test system needs to be determined for in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolations (IVIVE). Besides direct measurements, prediction models can help to obtain fu. Here we describe a simplified approach to approximate fu and provide background information on the underlying assumptions. Comparative predictions and measurements of fu of various drugs are shown to exemplify the approach. Basic input data, like protein and lipid concentrations, are also provided. Beyond such test systems data, the only required chemical-specific inputs are the lipophilicity of the candidate drug and its ionization state, as determined by the dissociation constants of its acidic or basic groups. This overview is intended to be used by any lab scientist without specific toxicokinetics training to obtain an estimate of fu in a given cell culture medium.",

It focuses on the impact for the first 10 years of testing, the period of greatest impact on animals and costs. The analysis suggests the first 10 years of testing under the Act could evaluate, at most, about 50% of ingredients used in cosmetics. Testing during this period would cost about $ 1.7-$ 9 billion and 1-11.5 million animals. By test year 10, alternative, high-throughput test methods under development are expected to be available, replacing animal testing and allowing rapid evaluation of all ingredients. Given the high cost in dollars and animal lives of the first 10 years for only about half of ingredients, a better choice may be to accelerate development of high-throughput methods. This would allow evaluation of 100% of cosmetic ingredients before year 10 at lower cost and without animal testing.",

The products are composed of one or more active film-forming components dissolved or suspended in an appropriate solvent mixture. Exposure to impregnation spray products may cause respiratory distress and new cases are reported frequently. The toxicity appears to be driven by a disruption of the pulmonary surfactant film, which coats the inside of the lungs. Due to the complex chemistry of impregnation spray products, it is impossible to predict if inhalation of an aerosolized product is toxic in vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether disruption of the pulmonary surfactant film can be used as a predictor of the toxic effects in vivo. Nine impregnation products with various chemical compositions were selected for testing and the main constituents of each product, e.g., solvents, co-solvents and film-forming compounds, were identified by mass spectrometry. We used a capillary surfactometry method to assess disruption of pulmonary surfactant function in vitro and a mouse model to evaluate acute respiratory toxicity during inhalation. Concentration-response relationships were successfully determined both in vitro and in vivo. The true positive rate of the in vitromethod was 100%, i.e. the test could correctly identify all products with toxic effects in vivo, the true negative rate was 40%. Investigation of inhibition of the pulmonary surfactant system, e.g. by capillary surfactometry, was found useful for evaluation of the inhalation toxicity of impregnation spray products and thus may reduce the need for animal testing",

It is used as drug to treat a number of serious ailments and, more frequently, for aesthetic medical interventions. Botulinum toxin for pharmacological applications is isolated from bacterial cultures. Due to partial denaturation of the protein, the specific activity of these preparations shows large variations. Because of its extreme potential toxicity, pharmacological preparations must be carefully tested for their activity. For the current gold standard, the mouse lethality assay, several hundred thousand mice are killed per year. Alternative methods have been developed that suffer from one or more of the following deficits: In vitro enzyme assays test only the activity of the catalytic subunit of the toxin. Enzymatic and cell based immunological assays are specific for just one of the different serotypes. The current study takes a completely different approach that overcomes these limitations: Neuronal cell lines were stably transfected with plasmids coding for luciferases of different species, which were N-terminally tagged with leader sequences that redirect the luciferase into neuro-secretory vesicles. From these vesicles, luciferases were released upon depolarization of the cells. The depolarization-dependent release was efficiently inhibited by botulinum toxin in a concentration range (1 to 100 pM) that is used in pharmacological preparations. The new assay might thus be an alternative to the mouse lethality assay and the immunological assays already in use.",

The predictive power of Test 1 or Interview 1 on Test 2 or Interview 2, respectively, as well as the relevance of various factors was analyzed. We found no significant differences between Tests 1 and 2 regarding the behavior reactions. However, body language scores and heart rates changed significantly, indicating a more relaxed state of the dogs in their new homes. The interviews revealed a significant change toward desired behavior in most dogs within the 11 week period (p < 0.0001). The main behavior problems included separation problems (28%; n = 126), destroying objects (24%), and not being housebroken (39%). Owners of 9 dogs returned the animals, resulting in a rehoming success rate of 94%. Test 1 revealed a significant age effect (p = 0.0066), with younger and older dogs reaching higher scores than dogs who were approximately 2 years old. Dogs that had been born and reared in the research facility scored higher than dogs that had originally been acquired from a commercial breeder (p = 0.0257).

    "abstract": "Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), as defined by the Stockholm Convention, may alter biological systems and cause toxic effects. Computational studies appear to be a relevant approach to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms triggered by POPs. We investigated the use of a systems toxicology approach to explore the effects of POPs on human health. A protein-protein association network (PPAN) was developed based on known POP-protein interactions. This model was used to predict protein complexes for several candidate POPs, including dicofol, methoxychlor, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), that are listed or proposed to be listed as POPs by the Stockholm Convention. Integration of multiple data sources (pathways, disease annotations, adverse outcome pathways) involving the identified protein complexes was performed independently in order to reveal putative risk factors for human health. This approach revealed that several systems may be disturbed by these candidate POPs, mainly the reproductive, metabolic and nervous systems.This study highlights that a computational systems toxicology approach may help to decipher putative biological mecha­nisms of poorly studied chemicals and link them to possible adverse effects with the aim to support regulatory assessment and trigger new epidemiological and experimental studies. In order to develop more accurate computational models as alternative methods to animal testing, the next challenge will be to integrate more data according to the findable, acces­sible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data principles.",

    "abstract": "Pre-competitive data sharing can offer the pharmaceutical industry significant benefits in terms of reducing the time and costs involved in getting a new drug to market through more informed testing strategies and knowledge gained by pooling data. If sufficient data is shared and can be co-analyzed, then it can also offer the potential for reduced animal usage and improvements in the in silico prediction of toxicological effects. Data sharing benefits can be further enhanced by applying the FAIR Guiding Principles, reducing time spent curating, transforming and aggregating datasets and allowing more time for data mining and analysis. We hope to facilitate data sharing by other organizations and initiatives by describing lessons learned as part of the Enhancing TRANslational SAFEty Assessment through Integrative Knowledge Management (eTRANSAFE) project, an Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) partnership which aims to integrate publicly available data sources with proprietary preclinical and clinical data donated by pharmaceutical organizations. Methods to foster trust and overcome non-technical barriers to data sharing such as legal and IPR (intellectual property rights) are described, including the security requirements that pharmaceutical organizations generally expect to be met. We share the consensus achieved among pharmaceutical partners on decision criteria to be included in internal clearance pro­cedures used to decide if data can be shared. We also report on the consensus achieved on specific data fields to be excluded from sharing for sensitive preclinical safety and pharmacology data that could otherwise not be shared.",

This standard predominantly refers to the in vivo test but does not exclude the use of in vitro methods that have been sufficiently technically and scientifically validated for medical device testing. It is foreseen that, due to the complexity of the sensitization endpoint, a combination of several methods will be needed to address all key events occurring in the sensitization process. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the sensitization potential of selected medical devices using a combination of in chemico (DPRA, OECD TG 442C) and in vitro (LuSens, OECD TG 442D) methods in comparison with the in vivo (LLNA DA, OECD TG 442A) method and to suggest a possible testing strategy for the safety assessment of medical device extracts. Overall, one of the 42 tested samples exhibited positive results in all employed test methods, while 33 samples were predicted as non-sensitizing in all three performed methods. This study demonstrated good agreement between in vitro and in vivo results regarding non-sensitizing samples; however, some discrepancies in positive classification were recorded. A testing strategy is suggested in which negative results are accepted and any positive results in the in chemico or in vitro tests are followed up with a third in vitro test and evaluated in accordance with the “2 out of 3 approach”. This strategy may reduce and replace animal use for testing the sensitization potential of medical devices.",

    "abstract": "The traditional paradigm for safety assessment of chemicals for their carcinogenic potential to humans relies heavily on a battery of well-established genotoxicity tests, usually followed up by long-term, high-dose rodent studies. There are a variety of problems with this approach, not least that the rodent may not always be the best model to predict toxicity in humans. Consequently, new approach methodologies (NAMs) are being developed to replace or enhance predictions coming from the existing assays. However, a combination of the data arising from NAMs is likely to be required to improve upon the current paradigm, and consequently a framework is needed to combine evidence in a meaningful way. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) represent an ideal construct on which to organize this evidence. In this work, a data structure outlined previously was used to capture AOPs and evidence relating to carcinogenicity. Knowledge held within the predictive system Derek Nexus was extracted, built upon, and arranged into a coherent network containing 37 AOPs. 60 assays and 351 in silico alerts were then associated with KEs in this network, and it was brought to life by associating data and contextualizing evidence and predictions for over 13,400 compounds. Initial investigations into using the network to view knowledge and reason between evidence in different ways were made. Organizing knowledge and evidence in this way provides a flexible framework on which to carry out more consistent and meaningful carcinogenicity safety assessments in many different contexts.",

Preclinical animal and in vitro models fail to provide a physiologically relevant testbed to parse potential contributors to human bioavailability, therefore new strategies are necessary. Here, we present a microphysiological model of the human hypodermal vasculature at the injection site to study the interactions of administered protein therapeutics within the microenvironment that influence subcutaneous bioavailability. Our model combines human dermal endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and adipocytes, self-assembled into three-dimensional, perfusable microvessels that express relevant extracellular matrix. We demonstrate the utility of the model for measurement of biophysical parameters within the hypodermal microenvironment that putatively impact protein kinetics and distribution at the injection site. We propose that microphysiological models of the subcutaneous space have applications in preclinical development of protein therapeutics intended for subcutaneous administration with optimal bioavailability.",

Human stem and primary cell-derived culture systems are a major focus of efforts to create biologically relevant models that enhance preclinical predictive value of intestinal efficacy and toxicity. The inherent variability in stem cell-based cultures makes development of useful models a challenge; the stochastic nature of stem cell differentiation interferes with the ability to build and validate reproducible assays that query drug responses and pharmacokinetics. In this study, we aimed to characterize and reduce sources of variability in a complex stem cell-derived intestinal epithelium model, termed RepliGut® Planar, across cells from multiple human donors, cell lots, and passage numbers. Assessment criteria included barrier for­mation and integrity, gene expression, and cytokine responses. Gene expression and culture metric analyses revealed that controlling cell passage number reduces variability and maximizes physi­ological relevance of the model. In a case study where passage number was optimized, distinct cytokine responses were observed among four human donors, indicating that biological variability can be detected in cell cultures originating from diverse human sources. These findings highlight key considerations for designing assays that can be applied to additional primary cell-derived systems, as well as establish utility of the RepliGut® Planar platform for robust development of human-pre­dictive drug-response assays.",

    "abstract": "Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the major components of long-chain per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), known for their chemical stability and environmental persistence. Even if PFOA and PFOS have been phased out or are limited in use, they still represent a concern for human and environmental health. Several studies have been per­formed to highlight the toxicological behavior of these chemicals and their mode of action (MoA). Data have suggested a causal association between PFOA or PFOS exposure and carcinogenicity in humans, but the outcomes of epidemiological studies showed some inconsistency. Moreover, the hypothesized MoA based on animal studies is considered not relevant for human cancer. To improve the knowledge on PFAS toxicology and contribute to the weight of evidence for the regu­latory classification of PFAS, we used the BALB/c 3T3 cell transformation assay (CTA), an in vitro model under consideration to be included in an integrated approach to testing and assessment for non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGTxCs). PFOS and PFOA were tested at several concentrations using a validated experimental protocol. Our results demonstrate that PFOA does not induce cell transformation, whereas PFOS exposure induced a concentration-related increase of type III foci. Malignant foci formation was triggered at PFOS concentrations equal to or higher than 50 ppm and was not directly associated with cytotoxicity or proliferation induction. The divergent CTA outcomes suggest that different molecular events could be responsible for the toxicological profiles of PFOS and PFOA, which were not fully captured in our study.",

    "abstract": "The Human Exposome Project aims to revolutionize our understanding of how environmental exposures affect human health by systematically cataloging and analyzing the myriad exposures individuals encounter throughout their lives. This initiative draws a parallel with the Human Genome Project, expanding the focus from genetic factors to the dynamic and complex nature of environ-mental interactions. The project leverages advanced methodologies such as omics technologies, biomonitoring, microphysiological systems (MPS), and artificial intelligence (AI), forming the foun-dation of exposome intelligence (EI) to integrate and interpret vast datasets. Key objectives include identifying exposure-disease links, prioritizing hazardous chemicals, enhancing public health and regulatory policies, and reducing reliance on animal testing. The Implementation Moonshot Project for Alternative Chemical Testing (IMPACT), spearheaded by the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT), is a new element in this endeavor, driving the creation of a public-private part-nership toward a Human Exposome Project with a stakeholder forum in 2025. Establishing robust infrastructure, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, and ensuring quality assurance through sys-tematic reviews and evidence-based frameworks are crucial for the project's success. The expected outcomes promise transformative advancements in precision public health, disease prevention, and a more ethical approach to toxicology. This paper outlines the strategic imperatives, challenges, and opportunities that lie ahead, calling on stakeholders to support and participate in this landmark initiative for a healthier, more sustainable future.",

    "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is a widely used biopharmaceutic for the treatment of neurological diseases and aesthetic medicine, allowing months-long paralysis of target muscles and glands. Large numbers of mice are used for multiple botulinum applications including batch release potency testing, antitoxin testing, countermeasure development and basic research. The mouse bioassay (MBA) has historically been the industry gold-standard in the botulinum field and is still heavily used for commercial product testing. BoNT/A intoxication causes severe suffering and application-specific, non-animal alternatives are urgently needed. It is widely accepted, that a cell-based assay (CBA) is the only way to faithfully replicate all the physiological steps of botulinum intoxication; comprising neuronal binding, internalization, endosomal escape, and cleavage of synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25). However, it has not been straightforward to develop these assays and there are only a limited number of CBA currently in use. This is in part, due to the fact that very few cell lines have the appropriate levels of sensitivity to BoNT/A. In this study we have identified that LAN5 cells, a human neuroblastoma derived cell line, are sensitive to BoNT/A and can be engineered to express a recombinant NanoLuc luciferase tagged SNAP25 reporter molecule. On intoxication, the reporter molecule is cleaved and releases a NanoLuc-SNAP25 fragment which can be specifically captured on a 96-well plate for quantitative luminometry. Importantly, we demonstrate this new cell-based assay exhibits sensitivity comparable to the MBA. Plain language summaryBotulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is extensively used in the treatment of neurological disorders and aesthetics. When the toxin enters cells, it targets a protein called SNAP25 and inhibits neurotransmitter release. Traditionally, the potency and safety of BoNT/A has been tested using the mouse bioassay, which causes significant distress to the animals being used. Our study introduces a new method for detecting BoNT/A activity based on LAN5 cells, which are a self-replicating, neuroblastoma-derived human cell line. We have engineered the cells to express a version of SNAP25 that allows the potency of BoNT/A to be measured using a luminescence assay. This new cell-based assay is as sensitive as the mouse bioassay and can be used for commercial product testing. This development could lead to fewer animals being used in research and commercial testing of BoNT/A, benefiting both scientific progress and animal welfare.",

    "abstract": "ReACH is the new european Regulation for the assessment of both toxicological and eco-toxicological risks related to chemicals. It is the most challenging system for chemical safety ever implemented worldwide. the basis for the development of this important regulation was the increasing awareness that thousands of chemicals commonly circulate in the european Union in spite of little knowledge about their (eco)toxicological properties (White Paper, 2001). the increasing incidence of allergic reactions, some tumours, fertility impairment and other diseases contributed to rising concern about the role of chemicals in our daily lives (european Risk Observatory Report, 2009). According to ReACH, all substances that are marketed in the european Union at more than one tonne per year need to be registered by presenting an extensive dossier to the european Chemical Agency (eCHA) located in Helsinki. the extent of this dossier depends on the tonnage band of the manufactured/ imported substances, being very demanding for chemicals circulating above 1000 t/year and less so for thresholds of 100, 10 and 1 t/year. tables 1a-c summarise all data that need to be submitted according to the different Annexes of ReACH. ReACH requirements are not limited to a general characterisation of the physico-chemical and (eco)toxicological properties. the dossier must include information about the whole lifecycle of the substance and should be completed with a detailed description about how the chemical is handled, how it is used, how it is disposed of, which are the risk management measures that are implemented and so on. For all chemicals that are distributed in quantities above 10 t/year, the dossier must include a more extensive Chemical Safety Assessment (CSA) and in case the chemical is classified, the CSA must comprehend a very detailed exposure scenario for workers, consumers and the environment. the delivery of the CSA is part of the Chemical Safety Report (CSR), which is attached to the submission file. the complexity of the registration dossier needs many different professional skills, ranging from chemistry, toxicology, analytical skills, occupational safety and health, and so on. But these are not the only difficulties. REACH introduces the rule of “one substance, one registration”, forcing all parties who are interested in the registration of a given substance to join what is called a SIeF (Substance Information exchange Forum). the dimensions of a SIeF range from 2-4 companies up to several hundred, typically located in different eU countries. the participants of a SIeF are de facto competitors and day-to-day relationships in the SIeF are generally very difficult, as the participants must agree on a common CSA and share registration costs. this is the level on which lawyers and accountants start working. each SIeF has a lead registrant, who does most of the job, generally helped by a consultant company, which can take care of different aspects of the registration process. For the preparation of these complex and multifaceted dossiers, eCHA developed and distributed for free a very comprehensive software-tool, which is called IUClID 5.2. the starting window of IUClID 5.2 is shown in Figure 1. the use of this software is complex and probably very few people in europe have had the opportunity to learn intensively how to deal with it.",

Surgical aspects such as energy dependent tissue response and tissue sealing to reduce bleeding are usually investigated in animal experiments. Extra-corporal organ models can provide the required experimental information without harming animals and thus reduce or even replace in vivo experiments. Here we describe the ex vivo ox-foot-model, which can be used for surgical investigations and for training purposes.In the ox-foot-model the vein remains in its anatomical bed under reproducible experimental conditions, i.e., blood perfusion, blood pressure, and temperature. Innovative endoluminal surgical procedures using laser light and radio frequency for varicosis treatment were tested. Treatment parameters were investigated systematically in a large number of samples. A standardized preclinical testing procedure could be established and optimized on the basis of acute macroscopic and histological findings. Further, optical coherence tomography could be evaluated as a time-saving diagnostic tool. The ox-foot-model is suitable for training surgical techniques relevant for the treatment of varicosis veins.It is a cost-effective alternative to conventional in vivo experiments, providing standardized experimental conditions and reproducible experimental results while respecting the Principles of Humane Experimental Techniques: Reduction, Refinement, and Replacement of animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "Assuring consumer safety without the generation of new animal data is currently a considerable challenge. However, through the application of new technologies and the further development of risk-based approaches for safety assessment, we remain confident it is ultimately achievable. For many complex, multi-organ consumer safety endpoints, the development, evaluation and application of new, non-animal approaches is hampered by a lack of biological understanding of the underlying mechanistic processes involved. The enormity of this scientific challenge should not be underestimated.To tackle this challenge a substantial research programme was initiated by Unilever in 2004 to critically evaluate the feasibility of a new conceptual approach based upon the following key components:1. Developing new, exposure-driven risk assessment approaches2. Developing new biological (in vitro) and computer-based (in silico) predictive models3. Evaluating the applicability of new technologies for generating data (e.g. “omics”, informatics) and for integrating new types of data (e.g. systems approaches) for risk-based safety assessment. Our research efforts are focussed in the priority areas of skin allergy, cancer and general toxicity (including inhaled toxicity). In all of these areas, a long-term investment is essential to increase the scientific understanding of the underlying biology and molecular mechanisms that we believe will ultimately form a sound basis for novel risk assessment approaches.Our research programme in these priority areas consists of in-house research as well as Unilever sponsored academic research, involvement in EU-funded projects (e.g. Sens-it-iv, Carcinogenomics), participation in cross-industry collaborative research (e.g. Colipa, EPAA) and ongoing involvement with other scientific initiatives on non-animal approaches to risk assessment (e.g. UK NC3Rs, US “Human Toxicology Project” consortium).",

    "abstract": "An ex vivo, porcine spleen perfusion model was established to study the early events occurring in the spleen prior to the onset of bacterial sepsis, using organs retrieved from animals slaughtered for food production. Porcine spleens were harvested from adult pigs and connected to a normothermic extracorporeal perfusion circuit. A constant perfusion of heparinized blood was performed for 6 hours. After injection of Streptococcus pneumoniae to the circuit serial samples of both blood and spleen biopsies were collected and analysed. Functionality of the perfused organs was assessed by monitoring the blood-gas parameters, flow rate and filtering capability of the organ. Interestingly, we observed full clearance of bacteria from the blood and an increase in bacterial counts in the spleen. Classical histology and immunohistochemistry on biopsies also confirmed no major damages in the organ architecture and changes in the immune cell distribution, other than the presence of clusters of pneumococci. A time-course study confirmed that each focus of infection derived from the replication of single pneumococcal cells within splenic macrophages. The model proposed - in line with the 3Rs principles - has utility in the replacement of experimental animals in infection research. Murine models are prevalently used to study pneumococcal infections, but are often not predictive for humans due to substantial differences in the immune systems of the two species. This model is designed to overcome these limitations, since porcine immunology and splenic architecture in particular, closely resemble those of humans.",

However, most studies do not evaluate the plausibility of score sheets and do not attempt to reduce the suffering of animals by determining earlier and, therefore, more humane endpoints. The present study uses data from BALB/cANCrl mice after bile duct ligation to retrospectively analyze which score sheet criteria are informative to determine humane endpoints. The performance of each single as well as com­binations of multiple animal welfare parameters was analyzed by a Cox proportional-hazards model followed by Harrell's concordance index. The addition of behavioral parameters, such as burrowing activity, helped to define a more humane early endpoint for euthanizing these animals. Using this approach, we determined that a body weight loss of 10-20% combined with a reduction of burrowing activity by more than 79.4% was able to predict that these animals would die within two days. Thus, this approach successfully determined an earlier humane endpoint and will reduce the suffering of animals in future experiments. Application of such an approach or similar methods can contribute to the refinement of various animal experiments.",

A policy document issued by the EPA in 2013 and updated in 2015 describes the alternate testing framework that industry could apply to new registrations of AMCPs and, on a case-by-case basis, to conventional pesticide products. Despite the collaborative effort, the availability of relevant non-animal methods, and the EPA's change in policy, only a limited number of AMCPs have been registered using the framework. Companies continue to conduct animal tests when registering AMCPs due to various challenges surrounding adoption of the new testing framework; however, recent discussions between industry, regulators, and other interested parties have identified ways these challenges may be overcome. In this article we explore how use of the alternate framework could be expanded through efforts such as increasing international harmonization, more proactively publicizing the framework, and enhancing the training of regulatory reviewers. Not only can these strategies help to increase use of the EPA alternate eye irritation framework, they can also be applied to facilitate the uptake of other alternative approaches to animal testing in the future.",

    "abstract": "Translating in vitro biological data into actionable information related to human health holds the potential to improve disease treatment and risk assessment of chemical exposures. While genomics has identified regulatory pathways at the cellular level, translation to the organism level requires a multiscale approach accounting for intra-cellular regu­lation, inter-cellular interaction, and tissue/organ-level effects. Tissue-level effects can now be probed in vitro thanks to recently developed systems of three-dimensional (3D), multicellular, \"organotypic\" cell cultures, which mimic functional responses of living tissue. However, there remains a knowledge gap regarding interactions across different biological scales, complicating accurate prediction of health outcomes from molecular/genomic data and tissue responses. Systems biology aims at mathematical modeling of complex, non-linear biological systems. We propose to apply a systems biology approach to achieve a computational representation of tissue-level physiological responses by inte­grating empirical data derived from organotypic culture systems with computational models of intracellular pathways to better predict human responses. Successful implementation of this integrated approach will provide a powerful tool for faster, more accurate and cost-effective screening of potential toxicants and therapeutics. On September 11, 2015, an interdisciplinary group of scientists, engineers, and clinicians gathered for a workshop in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, to discuss this ambitious goal. Participants represented laboratory-based and computational modeling approaches to pharmacology and toxicology, as well as the pharmaceutical industry, government, non-profits, and academia. Discussions focused on identifying critical system perturbations to model, the computational tools required, and the experimental approaches best suited to generating key data.",

Its evaluation refers to the Lowest-Observed-(Adverse)-Effect-Level (LO(A)EL) explicitly requested in several regulatory contexts, such as REACH and EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetic products. So far in vivo tests have been the sole viable option to assess repeated dose toxicity. We report a customized k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) approach for predicting sub-chronic oral toxicity in rats. A training set of 254 chemicals was used to derive models whose robustness was challenged through leave-one-out cross-validation. Their predictive power was evaluated on an external dataset comprising 179 chemicals. Despite the intrinsically heterogeneous nature of the data, our models give promising results, with q2 ≥ 0.632 and external r2 ≥ 0.543. The confidence in prediction was ensured by implementing restrictive user-adjustable rules, excluding suspicious chemicals irrespective of the goodness in their prediction. Comparison with the very few LO(A)EL predictive models in the literature indicates that the results of the present analysis can be valuable in prioritizing the safety assessment of chemicals and thus making safe decisions and justifying waiving animal tests according to current regulations concerning chemical safety.",

Development of in vitro non-animal sensory irritation assay suitable for a large number of chemicals is needed to replace the mouse assay. An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) is designed to provide a clear description of the biochemical and cellular processes leading to toxicological effects or an adverse outcome. The AOP for chemical sensory pulmonary irritation was developed according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development guidance including the Bradford Hill criteria for a weight of evidence to determine the confidence of the AOP. The proposed AOP is based on an in-depth review of the relevant scientific literature to identify the initial molecular event for respiratory irritation. The activation of TRPA1 receptor (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1) is the molecular initial event (MIE) leading to sensory irritation. A direct measure of TRPA1 activation in vitro should identify chemical sensory irritants and provide an estimate of potency. Fibroblasts expressing TRPA1 are used to determine TRPA1 activation and irritant potency. We report a linear relationship between the in vivo RD₅₀ and the in vitro pEC₅₀ values (R=0.81) to support this hypothesis. We propose that this in vitro assay after additional analysis and validation could serve as a suitable candidate to replace the mouse sensory irritation assay.",

Current in vivo test methods for assessing DNT require the use of high numbers of laboratory animals. Most alternative in vitro testing methods monitor rather simple toxicological endpoints, whereas the formation of a functional brain requires precisely timed navigation of axons within a complex tissue environment. We address this complexity by monitoring defects in axonal navigation of pioneer axons of intact locust embryos after exposure to chemicals. Embryos develop in serum-free culture with test chemicals, followed by immunolabeling of pioneer neurons. Defects in axon elongation of pioneer axons are quantified in concentration-response curves and compared to the general viability of the embryo, as measured by a resazurin assay. We show that selected chemical compounds interfering with calcium signaling, the cytoskeletal organization, and the reference developmental neurotoxicant rotenone, can be classified as DNT positive. The pesticide rotenone inhibits pioneer neuron elongation with a lower IC50 than the viability assay. The rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 can partially rescue outgrowth inhibition, supporting the classification of rotenone as a specific DNT positive compound. Since mechanisms of axonal guidance, such as growth cone navigation along molecular semaphorin gradients are conserved between locust and mammalian nervous systems, we will further explore the potential of this invertebrate preparation as an assay for testing the DNT potential of chemicals in humans.",

A paradigm shift towards an assessment of human health risks that is fully based on animal-free approaches is not foreseen within the next decades. To accelerate the use of animal-free innovations (in vitro experiments, in silico methods, etc.) in the EU, it has multiple advantages to simultaneously work towards a new risk assessment paradigm and to aim the development of animal- free methods at better meeting current regulatory needs. To achieve this, a multi-stakeholder collaboration is needed already in the development phase, where regulators can inform on the regulatory needs and the criteria for acceptance. As a first step, the present paper discusses what information is needed within the context of four areas of chemical safety assessment in the EU: 1) classification, labelling and packaging, 2) the derivation of health-based guidance values and product limits, 3) risk assessments of exposure situations of concern and 4) addressing specific topics of societal concern. Further agreements on the level of detail and uncertainty, robustness, predictive value, reproducibility and validation are a prerequisite to develop tools that can be trusted and that will be legally binding.",

AZM also has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions unrelated to its antibacterial activity that contribute to the effectiveness of this drug in chronic respiratory diseases. The mechanisms behind these beneficial effects are not yet fully elucidated. We have previously shown that AZM enhances barrier integrity of bronchial epithelial cells and directs them towards epidermal differentiation.In this study, we analyzed the effect of AZM pre-treatment of human bronchial and alveolar derived cell lines on mechanical stress in a cyclical pressure air-liquid interface device (CPAD) that models the disruption of the epithelial barrier with increased inflammatory response in lung tissue, which is associated with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Immunostaining and electron microscopy showed that barrier integrity of the epithelium was compromised by cyclically stressing the cells but maintained when cells had been pre-treated with AZM. Lamellar body formation was revealed in AZM pre-treated cells, possibly further supporting the barrier-enhancing effects. RNA sequencing showed that the inflammatory response was attenuated by AZM treatment before cyclical stress. YKL-40, an emerging inflammatory marker, increased both due to cyclical stress and upon AZM treatment. These data confirm the usefulness of the CPAD to model ventilator-induced lung injury and suggest that AZM has barrier protective and immunomodulatory effects, attenuating the inflammatory response during mechanical stress, and might therefore be lung protective during mechanical ventilation. The model could be used to assess further drug candidates that influence barrier integrity and modulate inflammatory response.",

Here, the authors present a mapping review and a searchable database, giving a complete overview of all studies mea­suring endogenous corticosterone in mice up to February 2018. For each study, information was recorded regarding mouse strain and sex; corticosterone sample matrix and quantification technique; and whether the study covered the research theme animal welfare, neuroscience, stress, inflammation, or pain (the themes of specific interest in our con­sortium). Using all database entries for the year 2012, an exploratory meta-regression was performed to determine the effect of predictors on basal corticosterone concentrations. Seventy-five studies were included using the predictors sex, time-since-lights-on, sample matrix, quantification technique, age of the mice, and type of control. Sex, time-since-lights-on, and type of control significantly affected basal corticosterone concentrations. The resulting database can be used, inter alia, for preventing unnecessary duplication of experiments, identifying knowledge gaps, and standardizing or heterogenizing methodologies. These results will help plan more efficient and valid experiments in the future and can answer new questions in silico using meta-analyses.",

Identification of bitter taste liability during drug discovery utilises the rat in vivo brief access taste aversion (BATA) test which apart from animal use is time consuming with limited throughput. We investigated the suitability of using a simple, non-animal model, the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum to investigate taste-related responses and particularly identification of compounds with a bitter taste liability. The effect of taste-related compounds on Dictyostelium behaviour following acute exposure (15 minutes) was monitored. Dictyostelium did not respond to salty, sour, umami or sweet tasting compounds, however, cells rapidly responded to bitter tastants. Using time-lapse photography and computer-generated quantification to monitor changes in cell membrane movement, we developed an assay to assess the response of Dictyostelium to a wide range of structurally diverse known bitter compounds and blinded compounds. Dictyostelium showed varying responses to the bitter tastants, with IC50 values providing a rank order of potency. Comparison of Dictyostelium IC50 values to those observed in response to a similar range of compounds in the rat in vivo brief access taste aversion test showed a significant (p = 0.0172) positive correlation between the two models, and additionally a similar response to that provided by a human sensory panel assessment test. These experiments demonstrate that Dictyostelium may provide a suitable model for early prediction of bitterness for novel tastants and drugs. Interestingly, a response to bitter tastants appears conserved from single-celled amoebae to humans.",

    "abstract": "Monocyte activation tests (MAT) are widely available but rarely used in place of animal-based pyrogen tests for safety assessment of medical devices. To address this issue, the National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods and the PETA International Science Consortium Ltd. convened a workshop at the National Institutes of Health on September 18-19, 2018. Participants included representatives from MAT testing laboratories, medical device manufacturers, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiologic Health (CDRH), the U.S. Pharmacopeia, the International Organization for Standardization, and experts in the development of MAT protocols. Discussions covered industry experiences with the MAT, remaining challenges, and how CDRH's Medical Device Development Tools (MDDT) Program, which qualifies tools for use in evaluating medical devices to streamline device development and regulatory evaluation, could be a pathway to qualify the use of MAT in place of the rabbit pyrogen test and the limulus amebocyte lysate test for medical device testing. Workshop outcomes and follow-up activities are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Oligonucleotide therapeutics (ONTs) encompass classes of medicines that selectively target and potentially ameliorate previously untreatable and often rare diseases. Several unique classes of ONTs provide versatility, enabling direct modu­lation of gene expression by virtue of Watson-Crick base pairing or modulation of cell signaling through structural mimicry or interference with protein-receptor interactions. Due to a lack of suitable in vitro models capable of recapitulating or predicting in vivo effects of ONTs, their discovery and optimization has relied heavily on animal studies for predicting efficacy and safety in humans. Since ONTs often lack cross-species activity, animal models with genetic humanization and/or species-specific surrogate ONTs are often required. Human microphysiological systems (MPS) offer an oppor­tunity to reduce the use of animals and may enable evaluation of drug mechanisms, optimization of cell and tissue targeting ligands or delivery vehicles, and characterization of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of candidate ONTs. The lack of published examples for MPS applications with ONT demonstrates the need for a focused effort to characterize and build confidence in their utility. The goals of this review are to summarize the current landscape of ONTs and highlight potential opportunities and challenges for application of MPS during ONT discovery and development. In addition, this review aims to raise awareness with ONT drug developers and regulatory authorities on the potential impact of MPS with respect to characterizing pharmacology, ADME, and toxicity and to educate MPS platform developers on unique design attributes needed to fully appreciate MPS advantages in ONT development.",

    "abstract": "Dogs occupy a full place in the family, and their well-being is of paramount importance to their owners. Digestion, a complex process involving physicochemical, mechanical, and microbial parameters, plays a central role in maintaining canine health. As in vivo studies in dogs are increasingly restricted by ethical, regulatory, societal, and cost pressures, an alternative option is the use of in vitro models simulating the different compartments of the canine gastrointestinal tract. This review introduces digestion and gut microbiota as key factors in dog nutrition and health under both healthy and diseased conditions (obesity and inflammatory bowel disease) and highlights similarities and differences between the human and canine digestive tract and processes. We provide the first in-depth description of currently available models of the canine digestive tract, discuss technical and scientific challenges that need to be addressed, and introduce potential applications of in vitro gut models in the food and veterinary fields. Even if the development of some in vitro models is still limited by a lack of in vivo data in dogs that is necessary for relevant configuration and validation, translation of long-term expertise on human in vitro gut models to dogs opens avenues for model optimization and adaptation to specific canine digestive conditions associated with various dog ages, sizes, breeds and/or diets, in both physiological and diseased states.",

    "abstract": "Immune responses are heavily involved in the regulation and pathogenesis of human diseases, including infectious diseases, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiometabolic syndromes. The immune system is considered a double-edged sword serving as a powerful host defense mechanism against infection and cancerous cells and causing detrimental tissue damage when the immune response is exaggerated or uncontrollable. One of the challenges in studying the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that target or modulate the immune system is the lack of suitable preclinical human models that are predictive of human response. Recent advancements in human microphysiological systems (MPS) have provided a promising in vitro platform to evaluate the response of immune organs ex vivo, to investigate the interaction of immune cells with non-lymphoid tissue cells, and to reduce the reliance on animals in preclinical studies. The development, regulation, trafficking, and responses of immune cells have been extensively studied in preclinical animal models and clinically, providing a wealth of knowledge by which to evaluate new in vitro models. Therefore, the application of immunocompetent MPS in drug discovery and development should first verify that the immune response in an MPS model recapitulates the complexity of the human immune physiology. This manuscript reviews biological functions of immune organ systems and tissue-resident immune cells and discusses contexts-of-use for commonly used immunocompetent and immune organ MPS models. Current perspective and recommendations are provided to guide the continued development of immune organ and immunocompetent MPS models and their application in drug discovery and development.",

    "abstract": "Animal methods bias in scientific publishing is a newly defined type of publishing bias describing a preference for animal-based methods where they may not be necessary or where nonanimal-based methods may already be suitable, which impacts the likelihood or timeliness of a manuscript being accepted for publication. This article covers the output from a workshop between stakeholders in publishing, academia, industry, government, and non-governmental organizations. The intent of the workshop was to exchange perspectives on the prevalence, causes, and impact of animal methods bias in scientific publishing, as well as to explore mitigation strategies. Output from the workshop includes summaries of presentations, breakout group discussions, participant polling results, and a synthesis of recommendations for mitigation. Overall, participants felt that animal methods bias has a meaningful impact on scientific publishing, though more evidence is needed to demonstrate its prevalence. Significant consequences of this bias that were identified include the unnecessary use of animals in scientific procedures, the continued reliance on animals in research – even where suitable nonanimal methods exist, poor rates of clinical translation, delays in publication, and negative impacts on career trajectories in science. Workshop participants offered recommendations for journals, publishers, funders, governments, and other policy makers, as well as the scientific community at large, to reduce the prevalence and impacts of animal methods bias. The workshop resulted in the creation of working groups committed to addressing animal methods bias, and activities are ongoing.",

    "abstract": "Scientists are usually good at teaching, sometimes even to lay audiences. But communicating with journalists, activists, or policymakers can be a different story - hesitancy to make mistakes as well as the temptation to disproportionally promote one's own case come into play. The multitude of social media and other web-based outlets has diversified and accelerated the communication of science. Real-time reactions, sharing of data, tools and results, increasing invitation of personal opinion, demand for transparency, political correctness, and loss of trust in experts are challenges to researchers in general. The field of alternatives to animal testing is more political and important to lay audiences than many others, so its scientists must be especially aware of these challenges. Public engagement offers the opportunity to form community and create wide support for non-animal research and its implementation. This requires scientists to step out of the ivory tower of higher education and engage with diverse interest groups by outreach activities, interviews, and press releases, etc. by employing tailored communication.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters such as renal clearance is fundamental to the development of effective and safe new treatments for patients. However, conventional renal models have a limited ability to predict renal drug secretion, a process that is dependent on transporters in the proximal tubule. Improvements in microphysiological systems (MPS) have extended our in vitro capabilities to predict pharmacokinetic parameters. In this study a kidney-MPS model was developed that successfully recreated renal drug secretion. Human proximal tubule cells grown in the kidney-MPS, resembling an in vivo phenotype, actively secreted organic cation drug metformin and organic anion drug cidofovir, in contrast to cells cultured in conventional culture formats. Metformin and cidofovir renal secretory clearance were predicted from kidney-MPS data within 3.3- and 1.3-fold, respectively, of clinically reported values employing a semi-mechanistic drug distribution model, using kidney-MPS drug transport parameters together with in vitro to in vivo extrapolation. This approach introduces an effective application of a kidney-MPS model coupled with pharmacokinetic modelling tools to evaluate and predict renal drug clearance in humans. Kidney-MPS renal clearance predictions can potentially complement pharmacokinetic animal studies and contribute to the reduction of pre-clinical species use during pre-clinical drug development.",

Beyond contributing to gut health itself, these microbial metabolites significantly impact multiple organ systems by participating in key signaling pathways along the well documented gut-organ axes. Chemicals ingested through food might interact with our gut microbiota, altering metabolites production with consequences on health. However, gut microbial metabolism is currently overlooked in toxicology. While efforts are underway to develop standardized human-based new approach methodologies to assess microbiome-component interactions, anchoring those assays within a mechanistic-based framework would enhance their relevance and regulatory implementation.",

    "abstract": "Since its discovery as an innate bacterial immune system, the Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated nuclease 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system has quickly landed on mammalian genomes to become the first-in-class editing technique. CRISPR-Cas9 offered an invaluable approach to correct pathogenic mutations, thus becoming a promising cure for diseases with highly unmet medical needs. To date, several attempts with different degrees of success were done to understand, categorize and predict the outcome of genetic manipulation. The lack of an appropriate and translatable model to test CRISPR/Cas9 effects, both wanted and unwanted, has therefore limited its applications to advance gene therapies. Herein we describe the potential of microphysiological systems (MPS) as an alternative to the classical surrogates used in CRISPR safety studies, such as immortalized cell lines or small mammals (e.g. rodents), to facilitate the progress of new CRISPR medicines to the clinics.",

    "abstract": "Botulism is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)-producing bacteria of the genus Clostridium. Laboratory detection of BoNTs in patients' samples is essential to confirm clinical diagnoses and to identify the causative BoNT serotype. The current 'gold standard' method for BoNT detection is the mouse bioassay (MBA), a highly stressful animal experiment. A viable animal experiment replacement method must demonstrate high sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and robustness, as well as comprehensive BoNT subtype detection, and be widely accepted in the field, necessitating rigorous validation. Here, we report on the validation of a previously established in vitro endopeptidase suspension immunoassay (Endopep-SIA) for the simultaneous detection, differentiation and quantification of BoNT serotypes A and B, the most frequent serotypes associated with human botulism. This assay uses monoclonal antibodies for BoNT extraction, followed by detection of the catalytic activity using neoepitope-specific monoclonal antibodies and suspension array technology. The Endopep-SIA showed high reproducibility with intra- and inter-assay variabilities between 7 and 22%, it demonstrated a sensitivity two- to twenty-fold higher than the MBA for BoNT in buffer samples and was equally sensitive for human serum samples with a limit of detection of 0.4 MLD/mL for BoNT/A and 1.0 MLD/mL for BoNT/B. Importantly, it reliably detected all six BoNT/A and six BoNT/B subtypes tested, including clinically relevant and bivalent strains, hereby proving high diagnostic safety. Based on the results obtained, we expect the Endopep-SIA to be instrumental in markedly reducing the number of animals used in botulism diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model for benzophenone-4 (BP-4) in humans based on in vitro and in silico input data and to achieve scientific confidence in predicted internal exposures of BP-4 in the absence of human kinetic data. The key steps included are: 1) establishing a core PBK model containing minimal required input for dermal absorption, liver metabolism, plasma protein binding, blood to plasma ratio, and tissue:plasma partition coefficients, 2) using chemical-specific characteristics to define additional key kinetic processes, which led to inclusion of transporter kinetics, and 3) conducting sensitivity analyses and assessing population variability. The in vitro kinetic results revealed limited skin penetration of BP-4 (⟨ 0.4%), no metabolic conversion by the liver, and involvement of active transporters, including OAT1, OAT2, OAT3, BCRP and MRP4. Inclusion of the transporter activity in the PBK model (scaled to kidney and liver) resulted in BP-4 active excretion and lowering of the plasma concentrations from 4 µM to 0.7 µM. Due to faster influx rates, by OAT1, OAT2, and OAT3, compared to efflux rates by BCRP and MRP4, relatively higher organ concentrations were predicted for the liver (0.31 µM) and kidney (0.18 µM) compared with other organs. While the PBK model results could not be evaluated against human data, we could evaluate the evolution of predicted concentrations in the process of developing the model. Increasing the physiological relevance of the model through inclusion of transporters increased confidence in the plausible ranges in plasma and organ concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Microphysiological systems (MPS) are envisioned to improve drug approval success rates. Yet, integration of MPS into drug development processes has been hampered in part by uncertainties in data translation. To speed adoption, development of animal cell-based MPS is advocated by the pharmaceutical industry. In our view, animal MPS availability would fill a key gap in the ability to examine in vitro to in vivo translatability. Since in vivo animal data will be available and guide decision making in regulatory activities for the foreseeable future, there is significant opportunity for translational assessments. In vivo animal study findings that are recapitulated using in vitro models generated from the corresponding animal species provide validation that those models possess the relevant and necessary attributes, e.g., species-specific pharmacodynamics, metabolism, transport, susceptibility to toxicity, etc. Results from the corresponding human models can then be interpreted with greater confidence for the relevant context of use (COU). Some drugs do not get to the clinic due to adverse findings in animals, so there is considerably more data to directly compare to animal in vitro models than human systems. Another benefit of animal MPS is that drug candidates exhibiting animal safety findings might be easier to derisk, for example if the finding was observed in animal but not the corresponding human in vitro model. This paper reviews considerations and recommendations for adopting animal MPS models in drug discovery and development and describes how their deployment is consistent with 3Rs principles.",

It includes a detailed description of the types of OoCs, the organs, tissues and interactions mimicked, as well as their various applications. A broad range of organs and combinations of organs were modelled in the reviewed OoCs, with the liver, kidney and heart being the most frequently mimicked. Consistent with this, hepatoxicity and metabolism-induced toxicity were the primary focus of the safety assessment, highlighting the interest in improving safety testing in this organ. Furthermore, a list of the reported biological safety endpoints and medicinal compounds tested in all OoCs is detailed. The majority of OoCs reviewed measured toxicity using only one endpoint, which were often related to viability or cell death. In the context of the data collected, this review also includes a regulatory discussion, highlighting challenges and opportunities for increased regulatory acceptance of OoCs for safety assessment. Key considerations for OoC qualification are discussed, including the importance of defining a clear context of use, selecting relevant endpoints and reference compounds. The ongoing activities of the European Medicines Agency to promote the integration of new approach methodologies (NAMs), including OoCs, into regulatory submissions are also outlined.",

    "abstract": "Consideration and incorporation of all available scientific information is an important part of the planning of any scientific project. As regards research with sentient animals, EU Directive 86/609/EEC for the protection of laboratory animals requires scientists to consider whether any planned animal experiment can be substituted by other scientifically satisfactory methods not entailing the use of animals or entailing less animals or less animal suffering, before performing the experiment. Thus, collection of relevant information is indispensable in order to meet this legal obligation. However, no standard procedures or services exist to provide convenient access to the information required to reliably determine whether it is possible to replace, reduce or refine a planned animal experiment in accordance with the 3Rs principle. The search engine Go3R, which is available free of charge under http://Go3R.org, runs up to become such a standard service. Go3R is the world-wide first search engine on alternative methods building on new semantic technologies that use an expert-knowledge based ontology to identify relevant documents. Due to Go3R’s concept and design, the search engine can be used without lengthy instructions. It enables all those involved in the planning, authorisation and performance of animal experiments to determine the availability of non-animal methodologies in a fast, comprehensive and transparent manner. Thereby, Go3R strives to significantly contribute to the avoidance and replacement of animal experiments.",

To understand the epidemiology of the causative virus and predict viral transmission dynamics, quantified transmission parameters are essential to decision makers and modellers alike. However, such quantified parameters are scarcely available, and recently a series of animal experiments was set up to obtain such data experimentally. In this communication, however, we report on the use of data from an animal experiment conducted 10 years ago to quantify transmission of foot-and-mouth disease virus between non-vaccinated sheep and from sub-clinically infected sheep to in-contact pigs. This new analysis utilises a state-of-the-art Generalised Linear Model to estimate the transmission rate. From the obtained results it is concluded that meta-analysis of \"old\" experiments using newly developed techniques can provide useful data to replace, reduce and refine future foot-and-mouth disease transmission experiments, thereby minimising animal suffering for research purposes.",

Our results revealed that HCK continue to proliferate in both monolayer cultures as well as after seeding in a collagen matrix and resemble primary corneal keratocytes in morphology and functional characteristics under defined serum-free conditions. Furthermore, HCK were shown to transform into activated corneal fibroblast phenotypes in response to serum and TGFβ1. In summary, HCK cells mimic their in vivo (primary) precursors, both in sustaining the quiescent keratocyte phenotype (serum-starved conditions) and in responding to growth factor stimulation. Hence, this cell line may provide a useful tool to study the toxicity and wound healing response of corneal keratocytes in vitro.",

Using polystyrene nanoparticles as reference, the particle size distribution and aggregation status of wood furnace PM and quartz particles in standard cell culture medium and water was characterized. Characterization was carried out via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), light microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and laser diffraction.

In the present study, a strategy based on non-animal approaches was developed to prioritize non-evaluated printed paper and board food contact material (FCM) substances for further in-depth safety evaluation. Within the strategy, focus was put on genotoxicity, a key toxicological endpoint when evaluating safety. By combining in silico predictions with existing in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity data from publicly available literature sources and results from in vitro gene mutation experiments, the 106 study substances could all be assigned to one of the four priority classes (ranging from low to very high concern). Importantly, 19 substances were considered of very high concern due to in vivo genotoxicity. Five of these are furthermore listed as a Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), in addition to demonstrating physicochemical properties linked to a high migration potential as well as oral bioavailability and being used in primary food packaging materials. The current animal-free strategy proved useful for the priority ranking of printed paper and board FCM substances, but it can also be considered to prioritize other substances of emerging concern.",

The survey covers 193 scientific articles published during the years 1981-2010, as well as preclinical studies leading to the approval of mAb drugs by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States. The frequency of the articles has decreased by more than two- thirds from their highs in the late 1980's, and the aggregate number of chimpanzees used in these studies has decreased by more than 90%. The experimental protocols ranged from single or multiple blood draws to extraction of body fluids and tissue samples, and to multiple, repeated organ biopsies. Many studies involved infecting the chimpanzee(s) with pathogenic organisms and immunization and infusion protocols. Addressing the health history and status of the chimpanzees was an exception rather than the rule, and anesthesia and analgesia were mentioned only in a small minority of the surveyed articles. In the past two decades, the FDA has approved 32 mAb drugs, but only three of those drugs could be determined to involve the chimpanzee in the preclinical stage. Two of those three drugs have been withdrawn from the market due to their severe adverse effects in human patients. Available alternatives, together with ethical and economic reasons, suggest that the use of the chimpanzee in this manner may not be necessary or appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Chemical UV filters are frequently applied as active ingredients in sunscreens to protect from detrimental effects of UV radiation. Regardless, many of these compounds are not well characterized concerning their capacity to counteract UV induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intracellular ROS release is an early event upon UV exposure and a crucial trigger of reaction cascades that may provoke adverse effects both in the short- and long-term. We report a strategy to assess the capacity of UV filters (ecamsule, oxybenzone, and menthyl anthranilate) to counteract UVA/UVB stress in the human keratinocyte HaCaT and the wildtype Fibs E6/E7 fibroblast cell lines. The reduction of ROS levels was taken as primary endpoint. The effect of treatment on the cells' metabolic activity was analyzed as an indicator of viability post-treatment to investigate potential immediate and late (photo)toxicity. Additionally, the compounds' antioxidative capacity was investigated using an azo-based radical generator. Established antioxidants, quercetin and N-acetylcysteine, were used as controls. Data showed remarkable differences in the mode of action of the chemical UV filters, ranging from protective to pro-oxidative properties, indicating the need for more detailed mode of action-based investigations. Cer­tainly, additional consideration and evaluation will be necessary to further extrapolate these in vitro data for the assessment of in vivo exposure situations. However, the presented approach enables parallel investigations of photoprotective and phototoxic effects of UV filters, and thus can complement and extend existing in vitro testing strategies.",

The simulated results can also be used to support in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of toxicity data, especially when the VCBA is coupled to a physiologically based kinetic model. In this work, we selected 83 chemicals previously tested for in vitro cytotoxicity with a neutral red uptake (NRU) assay and used the respective in vitro data to optimize a toxicity and effects model simulating the 3T3 BALB/c cell line in a 96-well microplate with 5% serum supplementation. We then used the optimized parameters to simulate alternative experimental conditions. The simulations show the impact of different physicochemical properties on chemical fate of this diverse group of chemicals and how the different partitioning (to protein, lipid, and plastic) and kinetic (evaporation and degradation) events are intrinsically connected.

    "abstract": "The monocyte activation test (MAT) is used to detect pyrogens in pharmaceutical products and serves as replacement of the rabbit pyrogen test. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell-based MAT assay requires the addition of serum to the medium and is performed with either fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum (HS). Since the capacity to detect non-endotoxin pyrogens (NEPs) in a sensitive manner is an important strength of MAT compared to the bacterial endo­toxin test, the performance of the MAT using FBS and HS was compared using endotoxin and several NEPs. The MAT was more sensitive for endotoxin when FBS was used, however for most NEPs the MAT was more sensitive when per­formed in HS. Furthermore, heat-inactivation of FBS affected the performance of the MAT for endotoxin to some extent but not for the NEPs. Interestingly, heat-inactivation of HS led to an almost complete loss of reactivity towards endotoxin, reduced the response towards heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus and peptidoglycan, but had minor or no effects on the responses towards R848, flagellin, and Pam3CSK4. Product testing of a human blood-derived product in MAT using HS was beneficial since endotoxin spike recoveries were improved. This product is therefore currently batch released with the HS-based MAT assay. Overall, to guarantee optimal performance of MAT, heat-inactivated serum should be avoided. The HS-based MAT appears to be the first choice to replace the rabbit pyrogen test, while in some cases the FBS-based MAT may be favored.",

The assessment of the local tissue reaction to vaccination by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could reduce the number of animals needed because repeated examinations can be performed in the same animal over time. The present study compared the evaluation of local tissue reactions to vaccination using MRI in live pigs with histopathology of porcine tissue, the current gold standard in regulatory safety testing. Eight piglets each were administered one of two commercial vaccines into marked injection sites. All animals were sedated and scanned repeatedly by MRI using a contrast agent up to day 29 after vaccination. On day 29, the animals were euthanized and underwent a pathological examination. The MRI results were compared with the pathomorphological findings at the injection site by regression analysis. The MR images and the pathological examinations yielded matching results concerning the sizes of the affected tissue volumes or areas. The use of MRI for regulatory safety testing can reduce the number of animals needed to 8 per examination group. The volume of a local reaction and its progression over time can be evaluated and documented. If persistent lesions develop a final pathomorphological examination is needed to identify the kind and local distribution of the reaction.",

Besides their use in cosmetics, the food industry and biomedicine, TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are also used as highly efficient photocatalysts due to their unique ability to convert complex organic materials to carbon dioxide, water and simple mineral acids via complex radical and electron transfer reactions. We assessed the potential dermal effect (phototoxicity and skin toxicity) of TiO2 nanosheets (TIG-800) synthesized from the lyophilized aqueous colloids of peroxo-polytitanic acid at high temperatures. The nanoparticles were examined in the reconstructed human skin model EpiDerm™ in a test pre-validated by ECVAM and adopted into the ICH S10 guidelines for the preclinical photo-safety assessment of drugs. For comparison, two further commercial samples of nanocrystalline TiO2, Aeroxide P25 and Eusolex T-2000, and six benchmark materials from pre-validation studies were tested. None of the TiO2 NPs tested in the study caused acute phototoxicity or cytotoxicity in the reconstructed 3D tissues up to the highest concentration tested. The prediction of photo-irritation potency for the benchmark chemicals was comparable to previous studies. For some of the tested materials, we identified reasons for false negative results or variability in previously published datasets by improving dosing, conditions of irradiation, and choice of suitable solvents. The method proved its suitability for photo-irritation assessment of topically applied materials.",

An alternative approach, which is being increasingly used by a select number of laboratories worldwide, is to perform functional mechanistic studies in brain slices of living human tissue resected during surgery for drug resistant epilepsies. Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a major clinical problem with a significant proportion of patients not receiving any symptomatic benefit from available anti-epileptic drugs. Animal models of epilepsy have dominated the landscape with regard to research and development, however they have failed to deliver new agents that would provide seizure control in patients with drug refractory epilepsy. Moreover, these models have considerable issues with respect to validity and animal welfare considerations. A compelling alternative is the use of live human epileptic tissue, which recapitulates a number of key features of refractory epilepsy. The use of live epileptic human tissue offers unprece­dented opportunities to understand the mechanisms associated with difficult to treat epilepsy whilst also permitting studies of efficacy of novel agents that are being developed to alleviate epilepsy in drug resistant patients.",

The software allows an overall toxicological evaluation of cosmetic ingredients without the need for additional testing and, depending on the product type, it applies defined exposure scenarios to derive risk for consumers. It takes regulatory thresholds into account and uses either experimental values, if available, or predictions. Based on the exper­imental or predicted no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL), the software can define a point of departure (POD), which is used to calculate the margin of safety (MoS) of the query chemicals. The software also provides other toxico­logical properties, such as mutagenicity, skin sensitization, and the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) to provide an overall evaluation of the potential chemical hazard. Predictions are calculated using in silico models implemented within the VEGA software. The full list of ingredients of a cosmetic product can be processed at the same time, at the effective concentrations in the product as given by the user. SpheraCosmolife is designed as a support tool for safety assessors of cosmetic products and can be used to prioritize the cosmetic ingredients or formulations according to their potential risk to consumers. The major novelty of the tool is that it wraps a series of models (some of them new) into a single, user-friendly software system.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the applicability of an in vitro-in silico approach to predict human cardiotoxicity of the herbal alkaloid ibogaine and its metabolite noribogaine, which are promising anti-addiction drugs. Physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models were developed using in silico-derived parameters and biokinetic data obtained from in vitro liver microsomal incubations and Caco-2 transport studies. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes combined with a multi-electrode array (MEA) assay were used to determine in vitro concentration-dependent cardiotoxicity reflected by prolongation of field potential duration, which was subsequently translated to in vivo dose-dependent prolongation of the QTc (heart rate corrected duration from ventricular depolarization to repolarization) using PBK modeling-based reverse dosimetry. Results showed that the predictions matched well with in vivo kinetic data and QTc data for ibogaine and noribogaine available in the literature, indicating a good performance of the NAM. Benchmark dose analysis of the predicted dose response curves adequately predicted the onset of in vivo cardiotoxicity detected by QTc prolongation upon oral exposure to ibogaine and noribogaine. The present study provides an additional proof-of-principle of using PBK modeling-based reverse dosimetry as a NAM to predict human cardiotoxicity.",

Here, we explored the use of cardinal ethical weights for clinical signs and symptoms in rodents by conducting trade-off interviews with members of Swedish Animal Ethics Committees in order to derive such weights for nine typical clinical signs of toxicity. The participants interviewed represent researchers, politically nominated political nominees and representatives of animal welfare organizations. We observed no statistically significant differences between these groups with respect to the magnitude of the ethical weights assigned, though the political nominees tended to assign lower weights. Overall, hunched posture was considered the most severe clinical sign and body weight loss the least severe. The ethical weights assigned varied considerably between individuals, from zero to infinite value, indicating discrepancies in prioritization of reduction and refinement. Cardinal ethical weights may be utilized to include both animal welfare refinement and reduction of animal use in designing as well as in retrospective assessment of animal experiments. Such weights may also be used to estimate ethical costs of animal experiments.",

This development is also changing risk assessment practices and will impact the assessment of uncertainties in the evidence for risks to human health that are posed by exposure to chemicals. The potential of evidence-based methodology for characterizing uncertainties in risk assessment has been widely recognized, while its contribution to uncertainty reduction is yet to be fully elucidated. We therefore present some key aspects of the evidence-based approach to risk assessment, showing how they can contribute to the identification and the assessment of uncertainties. We focus on the pre-specification of an assessment method­ology in a protocol, comprehensive search strategies, study selection using predefined eligibility criteria, critical appraisal of individual studies, and an evidence integration and uncertainty characterization process based on certainty of evi­dence frameworks that are well-established in health care research. We also provide examples of uncertainty in risk assessment and discuss how evidence-based methodology could address those. This perspective, which neither claims to be comprehensive nor complete, is intended to stimulate discussion of the topic and to motivate detailed exploration of how evidence-based methodology contributes to characterization of uncertainties, and how it will lead to uncertainty reduction in the conduct of health risk assessment.",

Each year, hundreds of publications report the use of dogs in invasive biomedical procedures, often without sufficient explanation of the purpose and justification for selecting dog as the experimental model. The European Union requires detailed reporting of animal use that includes research purpose, but animal use reporting in the United States, overseen by the USDA, does not require this information. The ability to replace dogs with alternative models begins by understanding how they are used. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the types of invasive biomedical procedures that dogs are subjected to in US laboratories. Well-defined sets of research publications and grants were accessed to obtain information on the types of biomedical research using dogs. USDA databases provided additional information. An ontology to categorize biomedical research uses of dogs identified the most common as translational studies for cardiovascular, cancer, nervous/mental, and musculoskeletal disorders. Information typically reported for experimental animals was sometimes missing or incomplete in publications, including number, source, and fate of dogs; species justification; and pain management, suggesting that many journals have not adopted the ARRIVE guidelines on animal use reporting. It was not possible to identify the research purpose for all dogs used by US institutions because a) not all dog use is published and b) animal research purpose is not required reporting in the US. These findings should be informative to future initiatives to replace, reduce, and refine the use of dogs in research.",

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) offer great opportunities within the 3R framework. In the field of toxicology, they may contribute greatly to the reduction and eventually replacement of animal models. However, culturing hiPSC as well as the differentiation of hiPSC into target cells that are used for toxicity testing, mainly depend on the presence of extracellular matrix (ECM) coatings. The most widely used ECM coating is Matrigel, an animal product that is derived from mice sarcomas. Drawbacks of Matrigel are widely recognized and include batch-to batch variations, usage of animal rather than human material and ethical concerns for its production. While alternative coatings exist, factors such as higher cost and limited characterizations may hinder a broader uptake by the scientific community. Here, we report an extensive comparison of three commercial human ECM coatings, vitronectin, laminin-511 and laminin-521, to Matrigel in three different hiPSC lines in long term culture (&lt; 9 passages). Characterization included expression of pluripotent markers in a genome-wide transcriptomics study (TempO-Seq), capacity to differentiate into embryoid bodies and karyotype stability by analyzing copy number variations by shallow DNA sequencing. Furthermore, a low-cost alternative, decellularized ECM produced by human neonatal dermal fibroblasts was analyzed. In addition, all alternative coatings were tested for hiPSC differentiation into renal podocyte-like cells in a genome-wide transcriptomics screen. Our results showed that all tested coatings were highly comparable to the animal-derived Matrigel for both hiPSC maintenance and differentiation into renal podocyte-like cells. Furthermore, decellularized fibroblast ECM could be a novel attractive low-cost coating.",

Previously, we developed the GENOMARK biomarker, consisting of 84 genes selected based on whole genomics DNA microarray profiles of 24 (non-)genotoxic reference chemicals covering different modes of action in metabolically competent human HepaRG™ cells. In the present study, new prediction models for genotoxicity were developed based on an extended reference dataset of 38 chemicals including existing as well as newly generated gene expression data. Both unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms were used, but as unsupervised machine learning did not clearly distinguish between groups, the performance of two supervised machine learning algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), was evaluated. More specifically, the predictive accuracy was compared, the sensitivity to outliers for one or more biomarker genes was assessed, and the prediction performance for 10 misleading positive chemicals exposed at their IC10 concentration was determined. In addition, the applicability of both prediction models on a publicly available gene expression dataset, generated with RNA-sequencing, was investigated. Overall, the RF and SVM models were complementary in their classification of chemicals for genotoxicity. To facilitate data analysis, an online application was developed, combining the outcomes of both prediction models. This research demonstrates that the combination of gene expression data with supervised machine learning algorithms can contribute to the ongoing paradigm shift towards a more human-relevant in vitro genotoxicity testing strategy without the use of experimental animals.",

In addition, it is prone to errors, defects, and mistakes introduced by operators, laboratory equipment, or materials used. Adherence to an SOP and comprehensive validation of the test method cannot guarantee that each test run produces data within the acceptable range of variability and with the precision and accuracy determined during the method validation. We illustrate here (part I) why controlling the validity of each test run is an important element of experimental design. The definition and application of acceptance criteria (AC) for the validity of test runs is important for the setup and use of test methods, particularly for the use of new approach methods (NAM) in toxicity testing. AC can be used for decision rules on how to handle data, e.g., to accept the data for further use (AC fulfilled) or to reject the data (AC not fulfilled). The adherence to AC has important requirements and consequences that may seem surprising at first sight: (i) AC depend on a test method's objectives, e.g., on the types/concentrations of chemicals tested, the regulatory context, the desired throughput; (ii) AC are applied and documented at each test run, while validation of a method (including the definition of AC) is only performed once; (iii) if AC are altered, then the set of data produced by a method can change. AC, if missing, are the blind spot of quality assurance: Test results may not be reliable and comparable. The establishment and uses of AC will be further detailed in part II of this series.",

    "abstract": "An increasing body of evidence identifies pollutant exposure as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), while CVD incidence rises steadily with the aging population. Although numerous experimental studies are now available, the mechanisms through which lifetime exposure to environmental pollutants can result in CVD are not fully understood. To comprehensively describe and understand the pathways through which pollutant exposure leads to cardiotoxicity, a systematic mapping review of the available toxicological evidence is needed. This protocol outlines a step-by-step framework for conducting this review. Using the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Health Assessment and Translation (HAT) approach for conducting toxicological systematic reviews, we selected 362 out of 8111 in vitro (17%), in vivo (67%), and combined (16%) studies for 129 potential cardiotoxic environmental pollutants, including heavy metals (29%), air pollutants (16%), pesticides (27%), and other chemicals (28%). The internal validity of included studies is being assessed with HAT and SYRCLE Risk of Bias tools. Tabular templates are being used to extract key study elements regarding study setup, methodology, techniques, and (qualitative and quantitative) outcomes. Subsequent synthesis will consist of an explorative meta-analysis of possible pollutant-related cardiotoxicity. Evidence maps and interactive knowledge graphs will illustrate evidence streams, cardiotoxic effects and associated quality of evidence, helping researchers and regulators to efficiently identify pollutants of interest. The evidence will be integrated in novel Adverse Outcome Pathways to facilitate regulatory acceptance of non-animal methods for cardiotoxicity testing. The current article describes the progress of the steps made in the systematic mapping review process. Plain language summaryHeart disease is a leading global cause of death. Recent research indicates that certain environmental chemicals can worsen heart problems. We're conducting a rigorous review of scientific studies to understand how these chemicals affect the heart. This will inform policymakers and promote non-animal testing methods for cardiotoxicity by providing a clear overview of the toxicological evidence. We have reviewed over 8,000 articles and focused on 362 studies about 129 chemicals, including heavy metals, air pollutants and pesticides, and their effects on the heart. The current manuscript describes the used methods and steps made in this process. The outcome of our systematic review of these 362 articles will be a comprehensive database that will aid the development of alternative testing methods for cardiotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Reducing the number of animals required for a given experiment is part of the 3Rs strategies for animal welfare. Sample size estimation is a critical step in efficient and ethical experimental design. It is generally believed that pilot studies can be used to estimate sample sizes, which could lead to an overall reduction in the number of animals used. As part of the standard approach to ensuring that a planned animal experiment has sufficient statistical power, estimates of effect size and population variance are required. Here we derive the distribution of the sample size estimator when both effect size and variance are unknown. We show that, in this case, it is not feasible to conduct a preliminary pilot study to estimate the required sample size. Our analysis indicates that the sample size of a useful pilot study will often be much larger than that of the main study itself when the effect size is unknown. Therefore, we conclude that performing pilot studies with the aim of estimating sample size will not help to minimize the overall number of animal experiments in basic or pre-clinical research. A practical example is given, and alternative approaches are proposed and discussed.",

    "abstract": "(Quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SARs) are widely used in chemical safety assessment to predict toxicological effects. Many thousands of (Q)SAR models have been developed and published, however, few are easily available to use. This investigation has applied previously developed Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse (FAIR) Principles for in silico models to six published, different, machine learning (ML) (Q)SARs for the same toxicity dataset (inhibition of growth to Tetrahymena pyriformis). The majority of principles were met, however, there are still gaps in making (Q)SARs FAIR. This study has enabled insights into, and recommendations for, the FAIRification of (Q)SARs including areas where more work and effort may be required. For instance, there is still a need for (Q)SARs to be associated with a unique identifier and full data / metadata for toxicological activity or endpoints, molecular properties and descriptors, as well as model description to be provided in a standardised manner. A number of solutions to the challenges were identified, such as building on the QSAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) and the application of QSAR Assessment Framework (QAF). This study also demonstrated that resources such as the QSAR Databank (QsarDB, www.qsardb.org) are valuable in storing ML QSARs in a searchable database and also provide a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Many activities related to FAIR are currently underway and (Q)SAR modellers should be encouraged to utilise these to move towards the easier access and use of models. Enabling FAIR computational toxicology models will support the overall progress towards animal free chemical safety assessment.",

    "abstract": "Skin sensitization is an endpoint in the safety evaluation of chemicals. OECD guideline 497 includes three defined approaches (DAs) integrating new approach methodologies (NAMs) for skin sensitization hazard identification or UN GHS potency categorization. The \"2 out of 3\" (2o3) DA predicts skin sensitization hazard by sequentially testing in up to three NAMs covering key events (KEs) 1-3 of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP). To increase flexibility, OECD is considering the adoption of \"alternate\" NAMs in guideline 497 targeting the same AOP KE as in test guidelines 442C, 442D, 442E. This study evaluated the feasibility of substituting the h-CLAT with U-SENS™ in the 2o3 DA as NAM for AOP KE 3. To define areas where uncertainty may exist in U-SENS™ predictions, borderline range thresholds around the 150% CD86 stimulation index (SI) cut-off were calculated using a log pooled median absolute deviation method. A revised U-SENS™ prediction model implementing these thresholds classifies a chemical as positive (SI > 176%), negative (SI < 128%), or borderline (128 ≤ SI ≤ 176%). Application of the model changed the U-SENS™ predictions for 35 of 191 chemicals in the OECD database. Substituting the h-CLAT with U-SENS™ in the 2o3 DA resulted in a balanced accuracy of 71% against LLNA (n=168) and 77% against human data (n=66), without considering borderline range thresholds. Incorporating thresholds improved the balanced accuracy to 77% (LLNA, n=142) and 88% (human, n=55). These findings support the inclusion of the U-SENS™ and its borderline range thresholds in OECD guideline 497.",

Korean Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (KoCVAM) developed and optimized an in vitro phototoxicity test method using KeraSkin™, a reconstructed human epidermis model (RhE), (KeraSkin™ Phototoxicity Assay) as a 'me-too' test method in a previous study. KeraSkin™ Phototoxicity Assay was added to the OECD Workplan for inclusion in OECD test guideline (TG) 498. This study, conducted based on OECD Performance Standard No. 356 by one lead laboratory and four participating laboratories, aimed to validate the relevance and reliability of the KeraSkin™ Phototoxicity Assay for regulatory application in the safety assessment of cosmetics and drugs. Based on the test results, the 12 reference chemicals showed 91.7% to 100% within-lab reproducibility and 100% between-lab reproducibility in all participating labs. Further, the predictive capacity for the 12 reference chemicals calculated based on the total number of runs (144) showed 100% sensitivity (72/72), 98.6% specificity (71/72), and 99.3% accuracy (143/144). Overall predictive capacity (32 test chemicals) calculated based on the total number of runs (164) showed 97.6% (80/82) sensitivity, 97.6% (80/82) specificity, and 97.6% (160/164) accuracy.

    "abstract": "New approach methodologies (NAMs) are rapidly being developed to help improve the speed of risk assessment and reduce the use of animals. In vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) is necessary to translate NAM data to human exposures. While past IVIVE efforts have demonstrated impressive success, several specialized scenarios exist where current IVIVE methods have not been tested, including pregnancy and developmental toxicity. To that end, this investigation proposes a preliminary IVIVE workflow for identification of potential developmental toxicants. Readily available in vitro and in vivo data with developmental toxicity endpoints were aggregated from the US Environmental Protection Agency's CompTox Chemicals Dashboard. In vitro distribution models (i.e. Armitage model) and both generic (httk) and bespoke physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were used to estimate exposures from blood concentrations associated with in vitro bioactivity (reverse dosimetry) and NAM-based bioactive doses were compared to in vivo endpoints (LOAELs) where available. Based on literature sources, this method identified chemicals as a high, medium, or low priority for follow-up as a developmental toxicant. Of the 23 chemicals with in vitro developmental toxicity assays, 7 had a NAM-based human oral equivalent dose (hOED) that was lower for developmental assays than for all available assays, indicating that the use of all in vitro data to derive a hOED would generally provide the most conservative approach. Potential data streams and refinements for improvement of the IVIVE workflow are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "N-nitrosamines (NAs) are potentially carcinogenic organic compounds, and nitrosamine drug substance-related impurities (NDSRIs) are currently regulated with class-specific thresholds in the low nanogram range according to the carcinogenic potency categorization approach (CPCA) classification schema. Beyond direct exposure, NDSRIs can form endogenously in the human organism after ingestion of secondary amines. As recently shown, enalapril, propranolol, and fluoxetine form NDSRIs under conditions mimicking the acidic environment in the stomach. The MUTAMIND project investigated whether such endogenously formed NA levels lead to plasma or liver concentrations which align with or exceed the acceptable intake limits based on the current CPCA. A generic physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model was built using compound-specific in vitro ADME parameters such as intestinal permeability and hepatic clearance. The predictions correlated well with measured in vivo ADME data for the data-rich APIs, so the same PBK approach was applied to the corresponding NDSRIs. While the modelling of propranolol was unremarkable, the highest NA conversion rate observed for N-nitrosoenalapril under gastric conditions resulted in plasma and liver levels exceeding those derived from the CPCA threshold by a factor of about 800 and 400, respectively. The long half-life of fluoxetine suggests a risk of bioaccumulation of its nitrosamine with chronic exposure. These findings indicate that PBK modelling could be a valuable tool as part of a weight of evidence approach in contributing to the risk assessment of nitrosamine impurities in pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "The use of non-human primates (NHPs) in biomedical research entails significant ethical considerations, demanding careful evaluation of both scientific necessity and research outcomes. This study presents a retrospective literature review comparing non-technical summaries (NTS) of research projects authorized in France between 2016 and mid-2019 with corresponding peer-reviewed scientific publications. The primary objective was to assess the publication rate of NHP-based projects, with secondary outcomes including time to publication, discrepancy in animal use reporting, and the scientific impact of published results. Literature searches were conducted primarily via PubMed, supplemented with additional methods such as author-based searches. Out of 191 projects analyzed, 56% led to at least one publication, the publication rate varying markedly, ranging from 83% in ophthalmology to 30% in immunology. In most cases, publications reported fewer animals than originally authorized: 1,751 actually used out of the 3,649 planned. 2,421 animals had been authorized for the projects for which no publication could be identified. The overall median Relative Citation Ratio (RCR), representing the field- and time-normalized citation rate for published studies, was 1.1, indicating a moderate scientific impact. These findings highlight the need for greater transparency in reporting, including the publication of negative or inconclusive results. The study underscores the importance of systematic retrospective assessments, improved harm/benefit evaluations under the EU Directive, and stronger upstream review mechanisms. Key recommendations include pre-registration of studies, mandated publication of all research outcomes, and the development of open-access platforms to facilitate data sharing, reduce unnecessary duplication, and enhance both ethical and scientific value.",

    "abstract": "New approach methodologies (NAMs) refer to any technology, methodology, or combination thereof used to inform on chemical hazard and risk, and support replacement, reduction, or refinement of animal use. While the development and application of NAMs has recently increased, their adoption in regulatory decisions is slow and awareness outside the community is low. The Consideration of Alternative Methods Working Group (CAMWG) within the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods focused on understanding how NAMs are considered by stakeholders and identifying ways to encourage adoption. A set of questions was developed to focus stakeholder discussions; CAMWG members met with stakeholder representatives to collect perspectives on how alternatives to traditional animal tests are considered when developing toxicology testing and research programs. Participants represented agrochemical, industrial chemical, consumer products, and pharmaceutical companies; academic researchers in toxicology; and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. All stakeholders currently use or consider NAMs-some more than others. Challenges to broader NAM adoption were identified and five common themes emerged as potential barriers: perception, regulatory acceptance, scientific and technical limitations, education, and financial considerations. Solutions to overcoming barriers were identified, such as tailored education, proactive collaboration and improved communication. Additional recommendations were ensuring fit-for-purpose use of NAMs, developing harmonized national and global acceptance criteria, identifying funding sources, increasing awareness about NAMs strengths and limitations, and a need for a more central repository for NAMs information. Here, we detail these discussions about NAMs use, barriers, and proposed solutions, to successfully expand awareness, consideration, and adoption.",

    "abstract": "A broad range of computational models are available for animal-free chemical safety assessment. The models are used to predict a variety of endpoints, including adverse effects or apical endpoints, toxicokinetic properties and exposure, often from chemical structure or in vitro inputs alone. To support their wider use, such models need to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR). This study has reevaluated the existing FAIR principles applied to quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) in order to adapt these principles to a wider range of computational models. Despite the breadth and variety of approaches, many computational models comprise common components including the training series, information about the modelling engine and the model itself. As a result, a refined set of four FAIR Lite principles is proposed based on the methodological foundations of computational toxicology which are unambiguously understood by practitioners such as developers and end-users. To this end, it is proposed that to comply with the original , a computational toxicology model should be associated with (i) a globally unique identifier for model citation; (ii) the capture and curation of the model; (iii) the metadata for the dependent and independent variables and, where possible, data; and (iv) storage in a searchable and interoperable platform. The FAIR Lite principles are mapped onto the original FAIR principles applied to QSARs, thereby demonstrating that a simpler checklist approach covers all aspects.",

It was compiled from various existing reference documents coming from different sources and is meant to be a point of reference on alternatives to animal testing. Giving the ever-increasing number of alternative test methods and approaches being developed over the last decades, a combination, revision, and harmonization of earlier published collections of terms used in the validation of such methods is required. The need to update previous glossary efforts came from the acknowledgement that new words have emerged with the development of new approaches, while others have become obsolete, and the meaning of some terms has partially changed over time. With this glossary we intend to provide guidance on issues related to the validation of new or updated testing methods consistent with current approaches. Moreover, because of new developments and technologies, a glossary needs to be a living, constantly updated document. An Internet-based version based on this compilation may be found at http://altweb.jhsph.edu/, allowing the addition of new material.",

    "abstract": "The usefulness of genetically modified mice is discussed critically. Nevertheless, their number has increased dramatically over the past years. A principle for the use these mice is the isolation of DNA to determine whether an individual carries the genetic modification or not. This \"genotyping\" is usually done by invasive tissue sampling, e.g. tail biopsies, which likely causes discomfort and pain to the animals and is therefore discussed in animal welfare regulations. Although non-invasive tissue sampling by stool samples was already described over 10 years ago, it is not commonly used so far. In the present study we therefore tested the practicality of this method by the use of three commercial kits for genotyping and compared the results to those attained using tail biopsies. Our data shows that DNA isolation from stool samples is practical, sensitive and effective. In addition, the possibility of repeated sampling represents a clear advantage to invasive genotyping. Therefore, this method represents a useful tool in the 3R concept, since replacement of invasive tissue sampling refines the use of transgenic mice.",

    "abstract": "The 7th Amendment to the EU's Cosmetic Directive (now recast as Regulation 1223/2009) bans the testing of cosmetic ingredients and products on animals, effective 2009. An extension until 2013 was granted, for marketing purposes only, for three endpoints: repeated dose, toxicokinetics, and reproductive toxicity. If the European Commission determines that alternatives for these endpoints are not likely to be available, it can propose a further extension. To this end, the Commission has instructed experts to produce reports on the status of alternatives for the 2013 deadline. We criticized the draft reports on a number of issues. First, the experts fell into the \"high fidelity fallacy trap,\" i.e. asserting that full replication of the in vivo response, as opposed to high predictivity, is required before an animal test can be considered useful for regulatory purposes. Second, the experts' reports were incomplete, omitting various methods and failing to provide data on the validity, reliability, and applicability of all the methods discussed, regardless of whether the methods were in vivo, in vitro, or in silico. In this paper we provide a summary of our criticisms and provide some of the missing data in an alternative proposal for replacement of animal tests by 2013. It is our belief that use of the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) will be a useful method to mitigate much animal testing. Alternative approaches for carcinogenicity and skin sensitization could be considered sufficient in the very near future, even though these tests are not listed under the 2013 extension. For repeated dose, toxicokinetics, and reproductive toxicity a combination of in vitro methods may be able to provide appropriate protection for consumers, especially when viewed in the context of the poor predictivity of the animal models they replace. We hope the revised report will incorporate these comments, since a more thorough and positive review is required if the elimination of animal testing for cosmetics in Europe and beyond is to be achieved.",

Therefore, six compounds with presumably narcotic or unknown mode of action, and for which a previous meta-analysis has indicated weaker sensitivity were experimentally analysed for their fish embryo acute toxicity and exposure concentrations were monitored. The data indicated that ZFET and AFT for the selected compounds revealed similar sensitivity and differences were in the range of species differences of the AFT.",

Even though the scientific knowledge on assay variability is available, not much has been done so far to tackle the issues from the technological side. Therefore, this study addresses the question in how far the precise and accurate control over the physical parameters of electrophoresis is able to reduce variability of single cell gel electrophoresis assay results. All four above mentioned categories make up the overall assay variability. To resolve the contribution from a single category, the remaining three have to be kept as constant as possible. To achieve this we generated a set of x-ray treated control cells, worked according to a well-defined standard operating procedure and one single operator performed the analysis. Thereby variability resulting from the electrophoresis tank could be elucidated. We compared assay performance in two such tank systems: a newly developed electrophoresis tank that accurately controls voltage, temperature during the electrophoretic run and the homogeneity of the electric field, and a widely used commercially available standard platform tank. In summary, our results demonstrate that, irrespective of the cellular sample and its intrinsic biological variability, accurate control over physical parameters considerably increases repeatability, reproducibility and precision of single cell gel electrophoresis.",

    "abstract": "Food contamination due to unintentional leakage of chemicals from food contact materials (FCM) is a source of increasing concern. Since for many of these substances, only limited or no toxicological data are available, the development of alternative methodologies to establish rapidly and cost-efficiently level of safety concern is critical to ensure adequate consumer protection. Computational toxicology methods are considered the most promising solutions to cope with this data gap. In particular, mutagenicity assessment has a particular relevance and is a mandatory requirement for all substances released from plastic FCM, regardless how low migration and exposure are. In the present work, a strategy integrating a number of (Quantitative) Structure Activity Relationship ((Q)SAR) models for Ames mutagenicity predictions is proposed. A list of chemicals representing likely migrating moieties from FCM was selected to test the value of the newly defined strategy and the possibility to combine predictions given by the different algorithms was evaluated. In particular, a scheme to integrate mutagenicity estimations into a single final assessment was developed resulting in an increased domain of applicability. In most cases, a deeper analysis of experimental data, where available, allowed fixing misclassification errors, highlighting the importance of data curation in the development, validation and application of in silico methods. The high accuracy of the strategy provided the rationales for its application for toxicologically uncharacterized chemicals. Finally, the overall strategy of integration will be automated through its implementation into a freely available software application.",

    "abstract": "Since the EU banned animal testing for cosmetic products and ingredients in 2013, many defined approaches (DA) for skin sensitization assessment have been developed. Machine learning models were shown to be effective in DAs, but the predictivity might be affected by data imbalance (i.e. more numbers of sensitizers than non-sensitizers) and limited information in the databases. To improve the predictivity of DAs, here we attempted to apply data-rebalancing ensemble learning (bagging with support vector machine (SVM)) and a novel and comprehensive Cosmetics Europe database. For predicting human hazard and three-class potency, 12 models were built for each using a training set of 96 substances and a test set of 32 substances from the database. The model with the highest accuracy for predicting hazard (90.63% for the test set and 88.54% for the training set, named hazard-DA) used the SVM-bagging with combinations of all variables (V6), while the model with the highest accuracy for predicting potency (68.75% for the test set and 82.29% for the training set, named potency-DA) used SVM alone. Both DAs showed higher performance than LLNA and other machine-learning-based DAs, and the potency-DA could provide more in-depth assessment. Those findings indicated that SVM-bagging-based DAs provided enhanced predictivity for hazard assessment by further data rebalancing. Meanwhile, the effect of imbalanced data might be offset by more detailed categorization of sensitizers for potency assessment, thus SVM-based DA without bagging could provide sufficient predictivity. The improved DAs in this study could be promising tools for skin sensitization assessment without animal testing.",

    "abstract": "Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) are used in a number of applications from food to cosmetics and from medical applications to magnetic storage. In spite of the 550 tons produced each year in Europe alone, no effective dose limit recommendations are established and the overall risks connected to IONs are still debated. The incorporation of IONs in daily life raises a concern about their effects on the environment, on living organisms, and on human health. In this study, we used freshwater planarians to assess the nanoecotoxicity of IONs. Planarians are free-living invertebrates known for their astonishing regenerative ability. Because of their sensitivity to toxicants, they are often used to determine the effects of toxic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic environmental compounds with an approach in line with the 3Rs (Reduce, Refine, Replace) principle. Planarians were exposed to IONs at concentrations up to 1 mg/ml and their effects were evaluated at the behavioral, morphofunctional, and molecular levels, with a special emphasis on the regeneration process. Our results indicate that IONs did not affect the stem cell population dynamics, nor did they induce substantial changes in either homeostatic or regenerating planarians. As positive controls, gold nanoparticles coated with the pro-apoptotic anti-cancer drug hexadecylmethylammonium bromide and highly concentrated polystyrene nanoparticles were used; these all elicited toxic effects. Therefore, we conclude that IONs at environmental concen­trations are safe for planarians, and that the planarian is a powerful model system that can replace vertebrate animal models in nanoecotoxicology research and for nanoecotoxicology studies.",

In this study, we subcutaneously implanted ALZET® osmotic pumps continuously releasing buprenorphine to reduce pain in mice with LCMV-induced meningitis. Mice treated with buprenorphine demonstrated strongly reduced symptoms of pain. The LCMV-specific cytotoxic T cell response and the immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) were unchanged in analgesia treated mice, indicating that the LCMV-induced immune response was not altered in these mice.

    "abstract": "Safety testing of veterinary vaccines requires the use of a large number of animals to investigate possible local and systemic reactions. This includes amongst others the pathological examination of the injection site in frequent intervals. For this a selected killing of animals in frequent intervals is inevitable. To reduce the number of animals needed for this kind of safety testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to detect and quantify possible inflammatory reactions after vaccination in vivo. Sixty four pigs were subdivided into 4 experimental groups (n=16); two groups consisting of 12 weeks old pigs and 2 of 6 month old pigs at vaccination day. The pigs were vaccinated with four licensed products (each group receiving one vaccine) and examined up to 6 times using MRI during a period of 5 weeks. The MRI images were evaluated semi-automatically comparing the volumes of altered signal intensities at the vaccination side (VS) with the volumes of the signal intensities at the control side (CS). A paired t-Test was used to identify significant differences (p<0.05) between VS and CS. The results show that MRI allows a 3D-quantification of the extent of local reactions in vivo, scanning the same animals at several points of time after vaccination. MRI is a suitable alternative method for non-invasive safety testing of injectable medicines and can therefore be used as an alternative method to reduce animal numbers for safety testing purposes.",

    "abstract": "Next generation risk assessment of chemicals revolves around the use of mechanistic information without animal experimentation. In this regard, toxicogenomics has proven to be a useful tool to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of adverse effects of xenobiotics. In the present study, two widely used human in vitro hepatocyte culture systems, namely primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and human hepatoma HepaRG cells, were exposed to liver toxicants known to induce liver cholestasis, steatosis or necrosis. Benchmark concentration-response modelling was applied to transcriptomics gene co-expression networks (modules) to derive benchmark concentrations (BMCs) and to gain mechanistic insight into the hepatotoxic effects. BMCs derived by concentration-response modelling of gene co-expression modules recapitulated concentration-response modelling of individual genes. Although PHH and HepaRG cells showed overlap in deregulated genes and modules by the liver toxicants, PHH demonstrated a higher responsiveness, based on the lower BMCs of co-regulated gene modules. Such BMCs can be used as transcriptomics point of departure (tPOD) for assessing module-associated cellular (stress) pathways/processes. This approach identified clear tPODs of around maximum systemic concentration (Cmax) levels for the tested drugs, while for cosmetics ingredients the BMCs were 10-100-fold higher than the estimated plasma concentrations. This approach could serve next generation risk assessment practice to identify early responsive modules at low BMCs, that could be linked to key events in liver adverse outcome pathways. In turn, this can assist in delineating potential hazards of new test chemicals using in vitro systems and used in a risk assessment when BMCs are paired with chemical exposure assessment. Plain language summaryRisk assessment of chemicals has traditionally been focused on animal experiments. In contrast, next generation risk assessment uses biological information obtained from experiments in cell culture models without animals to identify potential hazards. Since the liver is the main target organ of toxicity, many liver cell (hepatocyte) models have been developed and applied for hazard assessment. In this study, two widely used human hepatocyte cell models, PHH and HepaRG, were exposed to liver toxic chemicals. Biological changes in gene expression were measured in a concentration range to identify the concentration at which a biological response was perturbed using concentration response modelling. Genes belonging to the same biological process were joined based on co-expression to derive an average concentration of this process. This animal-free approach could be applied for risk assessment when biological response concentrations were related to the expected human exposure to identify potential hazard of the test chemicals.",

Our initial review of the NTS reported in ALTEX in 2018 had found the NTS to be deficient in their accessibility and quality, notably the “adverse effects” section where the harms to the animals are meant to be described. Here we repeat our review to see if these legislative changes have improved the accessibility and quality of the NTS. As before, we focused on the NTS from the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany; even though the UK has left the EU, it is using the same template. We found significant improvement in the reporting of five of the six elements we identified as essential to the “predicted harms” section. However, there was no significant improvement in the reporting of adverse effects. Only 41% of German NTS and 48% of UK NTS are fully reporting this important element of the “predicted harms” section. In our view, researchers need support in describing the impact of their research on the animals and to assist here we include a checklist for competent authorities and a list of suggested terminology for standard administration and sampling procedures. Unless the NTS improve further, their utility as a tool for sharing of good practices in the 3Rs or to support evidence-based policy­making will remain limited.",

This study investigates the performance of VCGs on statistical outcomes of body weight development between treatment and control groups in legacy studies. The objective is to reproduce the statistical outcomes of 28-day sub-chronic studies (legacy studies) after replacing the concurrent control group with virtual ones. In rodent toxicity studies initial body weight is used as surrogate for the age of animals. For the assessment of VCG-sampling methods, three different approaches were explored: (i) sam­pling VCGs from the entire HCD, ignoring initial body weight information of the legacy study, (ii) sampling from HCD by matching the legacy study’s initial body weights, and (iii) sampling from HCD with assigned statistical weights derived from legacy study initial body weight information. The ability to reproduce statistical outcomes using virtual controls was determined by the congruence between the legacy study and the HCD weight distribution: regardless of the chosen approach, the ability to reproduce statistical outcomes was high for VCGs when the legacy study’s initial body weight distribution was similar to the HCD’s. When the initial body weight range of the legacy study was at the extreme ends of the HCD’s distribution, the weighted sampling approach was superior. This article demonstrates the importance of proper HCD matching by the legacy study’s initial body weight and discusses conditions to accurately reproduce body weight development.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR) contributes to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD), making it a potential target for CVD risk assessment. High throughput screening (HTS) approaches have resulted in large-scale in vitro data, providing mechanistic information that can help assess chemical toxicity and identify molecular-initiating events (MIEs) of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). AOPs represent a logical sequence of biological responses contributing to toxicity and are valuable tools to inform chemical risk assessments. Here, we used HTS data to formulate an AOP relating VEGF signaling perturbation to atherosclerosis. ToxCast, Tox21, and PubChem data were evaluated to obtain bio-profiles of 4165 compounds active in assays targeting VEGFR. Cheminformatics analysis identified 109 enriched structural fingerprints. Applying a subspace clustering approach based on chemical structure bioactivity yielded 12 primary targets, whose relevance to CVD was confirmed by an AI-assisted literature review. An AOP was hypothesized by coupling mechanistic relationships highlighted by HTS data with literature review findings, linking Serotonin Receptor (HTR), Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα), and Vasopressin Receptor (AVPR) targets with VEGFR activity, angiogenic signaling, and atherosclerosis. Several endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), e.g., bisphenols, triclosan, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were identified as relevant chemical stressors. Subspace clustering of these chemicals evaluated potential MIEs and highlighted associations with use-case classes. By applying computational methods to profile HTS data and hypothesize a mechanistic AOP, this study proposes a data-driven approach to evaluating environmental cardiotoxicity, which could eventually supplement and reduce the need for animal testing in toxicological assessments. Plain language summaryThis study explores how disruptions in VEGFR contribute to atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaques in arteries that can lead to CVD. By analyzing data from HTS relevant to CV health, researchers identify how different chemicals affect VEGFR and potentially cause CVD. Using these screening methods, which quickly test many chemicals, the study identifies specific biological changes leading to adverse health outcomes. This research aims to develop methods to assess chemical toxicity without relying on animal testing, making it relevant to human health. The findings link certain chemicals e.g., bisphenols and DDT, changing VEGRF activity and the development of atherosclerosis. An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework maps the sequence of biological events from molecular perturbations to disease, providing mechanistic insight and identifying chemicals impacting the AOP targets. This approach helps understand the risks posed by environmental chemicals and protects public health while reducing animal experiments.",

Octavio Presgrave published a scientific article on \"The Need for the Establishment of a Brazilian Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods.\" Also in 2008, Jadir Nunes, together with Dermeval de Carvalho, prepared and presented a proposal to the Brazilian National Agency of Health Surveillance (ANVISA) for the creation of a Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods. ECVAM and other European stakeholders have been involved in the initiatives. Furthermore, also in 2008, a new legislation has been adopted in Brazil regarding the use of animals for scientific purposes (\"lei Arouca\"). The legislation establishes, among other provisions, the task of monitoring and evaluating the introduction of alternative methods. However, the legislation does not provide for promotion of or information about, existing alternative methods to the larger Brazilian scientific community.

    "abstract": "In 2007, 2.7 million vertebrates were used for animal experiments and other scientific purposes in Germany alone. Since 1998 there has been an increase in the number of animals used for research purposes, which is partly attributable to the growing use of transgenic animals (Fig. 1). These animals are, for instance, used as in vivo models to mimic human diseases like diabetes, cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Here, transgenic model organisms serve as valuable tools, being instrumental in facilitating the analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases, and might contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Due to variable and, sometimes low, efficiency (depending on the species used), however, the generation of such animals often requires a large number of embryo donors and recipients. The experts evaluated methods that could possibly be utilised to reduce, refine or even replace experiments with transgenic vertebrates in the mid-term future. Among the promising alternative model organisms available at the moment are the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Specific cell culture experiments or threedimensional (3D) tissue models also offer valuable opportunities to replace experiments with transgenic animals or reduce the number of laboratory animals required by assisting in decision-making processes. Furthermore, at the workshop an in vitro technique was presented which permits the production of complete human antibodies without using genetically modified (“humanised”) animals. Up to now, genetically modified mice are widely used for this purpose. Improved breeding protocols, enhanced efficiency of mutagenesis as well as training of laboratory personnel and animal keepers can also help to reduce the numbers of laboratory animals. Well-trained staff in particular can help to minimise the pain, suffering and discomfort of animals and, at the same time, improve the quality of data obtained from animal experiments. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in the numbers of animals needed for each experiment. The experts also came to the conclusion that the numbers of laboratory animals can be reduced by open access to a central database that provides detailed documentation of completed experiments involving transgenic animals. This documentation should not be restricted to experiments with substantial scientific results that warrant publication, but should also include those with “negative” outcome, which are usually not published. Capturing all kinds of results within such a database provides added value to the respective scientists and the scientific community as a whole; it could also help to stimulate collaborations and to ensure funding for future research. An important aspect to be considered in the generation of this kind of database is the quality and standardisation of the information provided on existing in vitro models and the respective opportunities for their use.The experts felt that the greatest potential for reducing the numbers of laboratory animals in the near future realistically might not be offered by the complete replacement of transgenic animal models but by opportunities to examine specific questions to a greater degree using in vitro models, such as cell and tissue cultures including organotypic models. The use of these models would considerably reduce the number of in vivo experiments using transgenic animals. However, the overall number of experimental animals may still be increasing or remain unaffected, e.g. when transgenic animals continue to serve as the source of primary cells and organs/tissues for in vitro experiments.",

This report envisions a not-so-distant future where all routine toxicity testing for environmental agents will be conducted in human cells in vitro evaluating perturbations of cellular responses in a suite of toxicity pathway assays. Dose response modeling would utilize computational systems biology models of the circuitry underlying each toxicity pathway; in vitro to in vivo extrapolations would use pharmacokinetic models, ideally physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, to predict human blood and tissue concentrations under specific exposure conditions. Results from these toxicity pathway assays and associated dose response modeling tools rather than those from high dose studies in animals would represent the new gold standard for chemical risk assessment. This talk focuses on some of the scientific challenges required to make this vision a reality, including characteristics of assay design, prospects for mapping and modeling toxicity pathways, assay validation, and biokinetic modeling. All of these tools necessary for this transformation of toxicity testing to an in vitro platform are either available or in advanced development. Science must lead the transformation. The scientific community, animal alternatives groups, regulatory agencies, and funding organizations will also have to muster the resolve to work together to make this vision a reality.",

The LLNA went through a validation process that allowed the delineation of a robust protocol for performing new tests. The OECD accepted this method in 2002 and published OECD TG 429. The European Chemical Agency (ECHA) recently published data that were submitted in the registration dossiers of chemicals. This database was analysed to determine how testing laboratories apply OECD TG 429. This analysis comes after a detailed analysis of four full study reports that were also prepared for REACH purposes. Although the majority of the tests are fully compliant with OECD TG 429, some showed major deviations, and a number of others used more animals than necessary. This suggests that in vivo tests need to be planned more carefully and consciously to obtain meaningful results with the minimum animal number necessary.",

Currently, there is an expectation that toxicity test methods used for regulatory purposes must be formally validated by a legislated body. In this manuscript, we review the genesis of current formal validation programs, their purpose, their justification for future need, and an examination of the scientific process as the driving force. With the collision of three major international events in the scientific and regulatory communities (viz. EU Cosmetic Directive, EU REACH legislation, and the NRC publication, Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy), there may be a need for a shift in the current validation paradigm. Further, test method validity may be recognized by the appropriate authorities when specific criteria and the fundamental precepts of reliability and reproducibility have been adequately met.",

The DPRA and the ADRA, respectively, monitor the depletion of model peptides and modified amino acids induced by crosslinking with test chemicals. In the current study we compared these two assays and analyzed their suitability to predict skin sensitization potential of several chemical substances. In order to study the combined effect of a chemical compound and UV light, we modified DPRA (photo-DPRA) as well as ADRA (photo-ADRA) by introduction of a photo-irradiation parameter. Analysis using photo-DPRA and photo-ADRA correctly distinguished known photoallergens from non-photoallergens. Upon irradiation, photoallergens selectively showed higher depletion of model peptides or modified amino acids. Thus, photo-DPRA and/or photo-ADRA can serve as non-animal in vitro methods for the identification and assessment of photoallergens/ photosensitizers.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to establish an in vitro fracture hematoma (FH) model that mimics the in vivo situation of the human fracture gap in order to assess drug efficacy and effectiveness for the treatment of fracture healing disorders. Human peripheral blood and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were coagulated to produce in vitro FH models, which were incubated in osteogenic medium under normoxia/hypoxia and analyzed for cell composition, gene expression and cytokine/chemokine secretion. To evaluate the model, we studied the impact of dexamethasone (impairing fracture healing) and deferoxamine (promoting fracture healing). Under hypoxic conditions, MSCs represented the predominant cell population, while the frequencies of leukocyte populations decreased. Marker gene expression of osteogenesis, angiogenesis, inflammation, migration and hypoxic adaptation increased significantly over time and compared to normoxia, while cytokine/chemokine secretion remained unchanged. Dexamethasone favored the frequency of immune cells compared to MSCs, suppressed osteogenic and pro-angiogenic gene expression, and enhanced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, deferoxamine favored the frequency of MSCs over that of immune cells and enhanced the expression of the osteogenic marker RUNX2 and markers of hypoxic adaptation. In summary, we demonstrate that hypoxia is an important factor for modeling the initial phase of fracture healing in vitro and that both fracture-healing disrupting and promoting substances can influence the in vitro model comparable to the in vivo situation. Therefore, we conclude that our model is able to mimic in part the human FH and could reduce the number of animal experiments in early preclinical studies.",

In vitro screening using toxicogenomic biomarkers has been proposed as a first-tier screen in chemical assessment and has been endorsed internationally. We previously developed, evaluated, and validated an in vitro transcriptomic biomarker responsive to DNA damage-inducing (DDI) agents, namely TGx-DDI, for genotoxicity testing in human cells and demonstrated the feasibility of using TGx-DDI in a medium-throughput, cell-based genotoxicity testing system by implementing this biomarker with the Nanostring nCounter system. In this current study, we took advantage of Nanostring nCounter Plexset technology to develop a highly auto­mated, multiplexed, and high-throughput genotoxicity testing assay, designated the TGx-DDI Plexset assay, which can increase the screening efficiency eight-fold compared to standard nCounter technology while decreasing the hands-on time. We demonstrate the high-throughput capability of this assay by eliminating concentration determination and RNA extraction steps without compromising the specificity and sensitivity of TGx-DDI. Thus, we propose that this simple, highly automated, multiplexed high-throughput pipeline can be widely used in chemical screening and assessment.",

Unfortunately, this test is associated with severe pain and distress in animals and consumes large numbers of mice. Here we used cocultures of spinal cord and muscle tissue to assess botulinum toxin potency. Cocultures were prepared from mouse embryonic tissue (C57/BL6J) and cultured for 24-27 days. Spontaneous muscle activity was quantified in sham- and botulinum toxin-treated cultures for up to 3 days by video microscopy. At a concentration of 58 fmol/l or higher, incobotulinumtoxin A significantly reduced the frequency of muscle contractions within 24 h after exposure. Hence, the sensitivity of nerve-muscle cultures is comparable to that of the mouse LD50 assay. The limit of detection observed in this study is close to that of the most sensitive cell-based bioassays, capable of detecting concentrations of botulinum neurotoxin A of between 30 and 50 fmol/l. However, spontaneous muscle activity of individual cultures displayed considerable fluctuations when evaluated on a day-to-day basis and, in its present form, this in vitro assay might be too laborious for botulinum toxin potency testing. Thus, methodical improvements to decrease data variability and increase throughput are the next milestones towards developing the model into an assay that can be utilized to reduce animal experimentation.",

Human medical papers citing those animal studies were carefully analyzed by two independent raters to evaluate the contribution of the animal data to the human studies.211 publications describing relevant animal studies were located. Approximately half (3,342) of their 6,406 citations were by other animal studies. 446 human medical papers cited 121 of these 211 animal studies, a total of 500 times. 254 of these 446 papers were human studies of ADHD. However, only eight of the cited animal papers (cited 10 times) were relevant to the hypothesis of the human medical study in question. Three of these eight papers described results from both human and animal studies, but their citations solely referred to the human data. Five animal research papers were relevant to the hypotheses of the applicable human medical papers.Citation analysis indicates that animal research has contributed very little to contemporary understanding of ADHD.

However, replacement is unlikely to occur in the near future; therefore the scientific community as a whole must continue to devote considerable effort to ensure optimal animal welfare for the benefit of the science and the animals, i.e., the R of refinement. Laws governing the care and use of laboratory animals have recently been revised in Europe and the US and these place greater emphasis on promoting the well-being of the animals in addition to minimizing pain and distress. Social housing for social species is now the default condition, which can present a challenge in certain experimental settings and for certain species. The practice of positive reinforcement training of laboratory animals, particularly non-human primates, is gathering momentum but is not yet universally employed. Enhanced consideration of refinement extends to rodents, particularly mice, whose use is still increasing as more genetically modified models are generated. The wastage of extraneous mice and the method of their euthanasia are refinement issues that still need to be addressed. An international, concerted effort into defining the needs of laboratory animals is still necessary to improve the quality of the animal models used as well as their welfare.",

However, only commercial reconstructed human epidermis models (RHEm) have undergone formal validation. Although these commercial models are suitable for a wide range of applications, they are costly, lack flexibility, and the protocols used to generate them are not transparent. In this study, we present an open-source full-thickness skin model (FTSm) and assess its potential for drug testing. The FTSm was developed using endogenous extracellular matrix to recreate the dermal compartment, avoiding animal-derived hydrogels. An RHEm based on an open-source protocol was evaluated in parallel. The integrity of the skin barrier was analyzed by challenging the surface with detergents and measuring cell viability as well as by trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. Skin irritation studies were performed based on OECD guidelines and complemented with an evaluation of the impact on the skin barrier by TEER measurement. The permeation of a dye through the developed models and a commercial membrane (Strat-M®) was compared using Franz diffusion cells and an infinite dose approach. The FTSm demonstrated structural and barrier properties comparable to native human skin. Although the RHEm showed a better performance in drug testing, the FTSm presented better barrier properties than commercial models as reported in the literature. These skin models can be a valuable contribution to accelerating the development and dissemination of alternatives to animal testing, avoiding the limitations of commercial models.",

    "abstract": "Endocrine disruption by environmental chemicals continues to be a concern for human safety. The rat, a widely used model organism in toxicology, is very sensitive to chemical-induced thyroid perturbation, e.g., histopathological alterations in thyroid tissue. Species differences in the susceptibility to thyroid perturbation lead to uncertainty in human safety risk assessments. Hazard identification and characterization of chemically induced thyroid perturbation would therefore benefit from in vitro models addressing different mechanisms of action in a single functional assay, ideally across species. We here introduce a rat thyroid-liver chip that enables simultaneous identification of direct and indirect (liver-mediated) thyroid perturbation on organ-level functions in vitro. A second manuscript describes our work toward a human thyroid-liver chip (Kühnlenz et al., 2022). The presented microfluidic model consisting of primary rat thyroid follicles and liver 3D spheroids maintains a tissue-specific phenotype for up to 21 days. More precisely, the thyroid model exhibits a follicular architecture expressing basolateral and apical markers and secretes T4. Likewise, liver spheroids retain hepatocellular characteristics, e.g., a stable release of albumin and urea, the presence of bile canalicular networks, and the formation of T4-glucuronide. Experiments with reference chemicals demonstrated proficiency to detect direct and indirect mechanisms of thyroid perturbation through decreased thyroid hormone secretion and increased gT4 formation, respectively. Prospectively this rat thyroid-liver chip model, together with its human counterpart, may support a species-specific quantitative in vitro to in vivo extrapolation to improve a data-driven and evidence-based human safety risk assessment with significant contributions to the 3R principles.",

    "abstract": "Many interventions that show promising results in preclinical development do not pass clinical tests.Part of this may be explained by poor animal-to-human translation.Using animal models with low predictability for humans is neither ethical, nor efficient.If translational success shows variation between medical research fields, analyses of common practices in these fields could identify factors contributing to successful translation.We have thus assessed translational success rates in medical research fields using two approaches: through literature and clinical trial registers.Literature: We comprehensively searched PubMed for pharmacology, neuroscience, cancer research, animal models, clinical trials, and translation.After screening, 117 review papers were included in this scoping review.Translational success rates were not different within pharmacology (72%), neuroscience (62%) and cancer research (69%).Clinical trials: The fraction of phase-2 clinical trials with a positive outcome was used as a proxy (i.e., an indirect resemblance measure) for translational success.Trials were retrieved from the WHO trial register and categorized into medical research fields following the international classification of disease (ICD-10).Of the phase-2 trials analyzed, 65.2% were successful.Fields with the highest success rates were disorders of lipoprotein metabolism (86.0%) and epilepsy (85.0%).Fields with the lowest success rates were schizophrenia (45.4%) and pancreatic cancer (46.0%).Our combined analyses suggest relevant differences in success rates between medical research fields.Based on the clinical trials, comparisons of practice between, e.g., epilepsy and schizophrenia might identify factors that could influence translational success.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of skin sensitizing properties of chemicals has moved away from animal methods to new approach methodologies (NAM), guided by qualitative mechanistic understanding operationalized in an adverse outcome pathway (AOP). As with any AOP, the molecular initiating event (MIE) of covalent binding of a chemical to skin proteins is particularly important. This MIE has been modelled by several test methods by measuring the reaction of a test chemical with model peptides in chemico. To better understand the similarities and differences, a data repository with publicly available data for the direct peptide reactivity assay (DPRA), amino acid derivative reactivity assay (ADRA) and kinetic DPRA (kDPRA), as well as the peroxidase peptide reactivity assay (PPRA) was assembled. The repository comprises 260 chemicals with animal and human reference data, data on four relevant physicochemical properties, and between 161 to 242 test chemical results per test method. First, an overview of the experimental conditions of the four test methods was compiled allowing to readily compare them. Second, data analyses demonstrated that the test methods’ predictivity was consistently reduced for poorly watersoluble chemicals and that the DPRA and ADRA can be used interchangeably. It also revealed new categorization thresholds for the DPRA and ADRA that are potentially relevant for strategic uses. In summary, a detailed assessment of reactivity test methods is provided, highlighting their potential and limitations. The results presented are intended to stimulate scientific discussion around test methods modelling the MIE of the skin sensitization AOP.",

The Pavlov sling is thought to be a non-invasive method to restrain dogs for examinations. The aim of our study was to investigate whether laboratory Beagle dogs that had been trained to tolerate restraint by a Pavlov sling are stressed by this procedure and, furthermore, to analyze their behavior during this period. Five male and five female Beagle dogs were used, each three years of age. Animals were restrained in the Pavlov sling for 30 min on six days with an interval of at least two days. The following behaviors were recorded every minute for each session: postures of body, head, and ears, as well as state of eyes, tail, legs, and mouth. Additionally, the animals were observed for the occurrence of particular stress signs, including body shaking, sweating of the paws, increased saliva production, piloerection, blinking of eyes, snout licking, yawning, and panting. As an indicator for stress, salivary cortisol levels were measured before, during, and after each session. Our results show that for most behavioral parameters, e.g., body, leg, head, tail, and ear posture, the frequency of changes between different behavior patterns, as well as cortisol concentration, were not influenced by restraint in the Pavlov sling. Therefore, the Pavlov sling does not seem to be perceived as a stressful situation by the Beagle dogs. Our study demonstrates that under certain conditions the use of the Pavlov sling in trained dogs can substitute for more ordinary methods of immobilization, e.g., the use of narcotics.",

    "abstract": "European Union (EU) legislation on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes requires that alternative methods must be used instead of animal tests wherever they are available. Unfortunately, this provision is not implemented to its full extent when it comes to risk assessment of chemicals and new products prior to their authorization and placing on the market in the EU. In this study, we screened data requirements of relevant EU law regarding chemicals (REACH), biocides, pesticides, and food safety (Novel Food) and found that data requirements as part of the risk assessment do not always reflect state-of-the-art science and technology. Most of the data requirements we investigated still include testing on animals for many toxicological endpoints, even though more than 40 alternative testing methods accepted at the level of the EU or the OECD are available. This may be due to a multitude of reasons, including a shortage of both manpower to implement existing knowledge and expertise in the field of alternative methods, as well as unclear and misleading statements on the applicability and state of validation of alternative methods. In conclusion, we strongly suggest a homogeneous EU-wide approach for all areas involving risk assessment of substances with the goal of better implementing the 3Rs and complying with Directive 2010/63/EU. This also would streamline data requirements, save costs on various levels, and enhance product safety for consumers.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving therapy for critically ill patients, alleviating the work of breathing and sup­porting adequate gas exchange. However, mechanical ventilation can cause ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) by baro/volu- and atelectrauma, lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and substantially increase mortality. There is a need for specific biomarkers and novel research platforms for VILI/ARDS research to study these detrimental disorders and seek ways to avoid or prevent them. Previous in vitro studies on bronchial epithelium, cultured in air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions, have generally utilized static or constant pressure. We have developed a Cyclical Pressure ALI Device (CPAD) that enables cyclical stress on ALI cultured human bronchial cells with the aim of mimicking the effects of mechanical ventilation. Using CPAD we were able to analyze differentially expressed VILI/ARDS and innate immunity associated genes along with increased expression of associated proteins. CPAD provides an easy and accessible way to analyze functional and phenotypic changes that occur during VILI and may provide a platform for future drug testing.",

The distinction between toxic and non-toxic products is difficult to make for producers and product users alike, as there is no clearly described relationship between the chemical composition of the products and induction of toxicity. The currently accepted method for determination of acute inhalation toxicity is based on experiments on animals; it is time-consuming, expensive and causes stress for the animals. Impregnation products are present on the market in large numbers and amounts and exhibit great variety. Therefore, an alternative method to screen for acute inhalation toxicity is needed. The aim of our study was to determine if inhibition of lung surfactant by impregnation products in vitro could accurately predict toxicity in vivo in mice. We tested 21 impregnation products using the constant flow through set-up of the constrained drop surfactometer to determine if the products inhibited surfactant function or not. The same products were tested in a mouse inhalation bioassay to determine their toxicity in vivo. The sensitivity was 100%, i.e., the in vitro method predicted all the products that were toxic for mice to inhale. The specificity of the in vitro test was 63%, i.e., the in vitro method found three false positives in the 21 tested products. Six of the products had been involved in accidental human inhalation where they caused acute inhalation toxicity. All of these six products inhibited lung surfactant function in vitro and were toxic to mice.",

    "abstract": "The willingness of the cephalopod mollusc Octopus vulgaris to attack a live crab is traditionally used as a method to assess the overall health and welfare of octopuses in the laboratory. This method requires placing a crab in the home tank of an animal, measuring the time (latency) taken for the octopus to initiate an attack and withdrawing the crab immediately prior to capture. The same crab is commonly used to assess multiple octopuses as part of daily welfare assessment. Growing concern for the welfare of crustaceans and a review of all laboratory practices for the care and welfare of cephalopods following the inclusion of this taxon in Directive 2010/63/EU prompted a study of the utility of an artificial crab to replace a live crab in the assessment of octopus health. On consecutive days O. vulgaris (N=21) were presented with a live, a dead or an artificial crab, and the latency to attack measured. Despite differences in the predatory performance towards the three different crab alternatives, octopuses readily attacked the artificial (and the dead) crab, showing that they can generalize and respond appropriately towards artificial prey. Researchers should consider using an artificial crab to replace the use of a live crab as part of the routine health assessment of O. vulgaris.",

    "abstract": "Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) consists of two protein chains connected by a disulfide bond: The heavy chain mediates the toxin binding and uptake by neurons, whereas the light chain cleaves synaptobrevin and thus blocks neurotransmitter release. Chemically inactivated TeNT (tetanus toxoid) is utilized for the production of tetanus vaccines. For safety reasons, each toxoid bulk has to be tested for the “absence of toxin and irreversibility of toxoid.” To date, these mandatory toxicity tests are performed in guinea pigs. A replacement by an animal-free method for the detection of TeNT would be desirable.The BINACLE (BINding And CLEavage) assay takes into account the receptor-binding as well as the proteolytic characteristics of TeNT: The toxin is bound to immobilized receptor molecules, the light chains are then released by reduction and transferred to a microplate containing synaptobrevin, and the fragment resulting from TeNT-induced cleavage is detected by an antibody-mediated reaction. This assay offers a higher specificity for discriminating between toxic TeNT and inactivated toxoid molecules than other published assays.Validation studies have shown that the BINACLE assay allows the sensitive and robust detection of TeNT in toxoids and thus may represent a suitable alternative to the prescribed animal safety tests for toxoids from several European vaccine manufacturers. Product-specific validations (and possibly adaptations) of the assay protocol will be required.A European collaborative study is currently being initiated to further examine the applicability of the method for toxoid testing. The final aim is the inclusion of the method in the European Pharmacopoeia.",

The exact definition of the biological activity of bovine tuberculin purified protein derivatives (bovine tuberculin PPDs) is essential for the reliability of a test system. PPDs consist of heterogeneous mixtures of mycobacterial antigens, making it difficult to determine their potency in vitro. The commonly used batch potency test is therefore based on the evaluation of skin reactions in mycobacteria-sensitized guinea pigs. The aim of the present study was to test an alternative in vitro method that reliably quantifies tuberculin PPD potency. This novel approach may prevent animal distress in the future.To this end a flow cytometry-based lymphocyte proliferation assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from sensitized guinea pigs was established. Potency estimates for individual PPD preparations were calculated in comparison to an international standard. The comparison with results obtained from the guinea pig skin test revealed that the lymphocyte proliferation assay is more precise but results in systematically higher potency estimates. However, with a manufacturer specific correction factor a correlation of over 85% was achieved, highlighting the potential of this in vitro method to replace the current guinea pig skin test.",

Endogenous signaling by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an important pathway in developmental processes and toxicities. Employing data extraction methods and advanced literature extraction tools, we assembled a set of candidate reference chemicals with demonstrated activity on ten protein family targets in the retinoid system. The compendium was culled from Protein Data Bank, ChEMBL, ToxCast/Tox21, and the biomedical literature in PubMed. Finally, we performed a case study on one chemical in our collection, citral, an inhibitor of endogenous ATRA production, to determine whether the literature would support an adverse outcome pathway explaining the compound's developmental toxicity initiated by disruption of the retinoid pathway. We also deliver an updated Abstract Sifter tool populated with these reference compounds and complex search terms designed to query the literature for the downstream consequences to support concordance with targeted retinoid pathway disruption.",

    "abstract": "On June 12, 2009, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation concerning the placement on the market and use of biocidal products, which, when it enters into force on January 1, 2013, will repeal and replace Directive 98/8/EC. The main reason for the revision of the current Directive was to promote best practices for environmental and human health protection, along with implementation of current developments in safety testing in order to create safer biocides. Moreover, the proposed Regulation aims to take into consideration the newest legislation on chemicals. This article evaluates the proposed Regulation in comparison to Directive 98/8/EC. Although the new proposal requires the sharing of vertebrate animal test data, both for product authorization and for newly developed active substances, it misses - in contrast to REACH - the opportunity to recognize the accelerating development of alternative approaches to animal testing, most recently with new momentum provided by \"Toxicity Testing for the 21st Century\", and to support the evolution of toxicology towards a new approach to testing. The new methods promise not only to decrease animal pain and suffering, but also to provide faster results and better prediction for human risk assessment compared to traditional methods. Unfortunately, methods mandated for human risk assessment in the proposal are still mainly based on traditional animal study extrapolation. We put forward and discuss possible alternative strategies, such as in vitro testing, integrated testing strategies, toxicokinetics, \"omics\", systems biology, bioinformatics, and computational modeling, all of which could be more encouraged by the proposal. Current opportunities to improve our tools for biocide risk assessment are discussed, delineating advantages, limitations, and development needs. It is suggested to open the proposed Regulation to alternative approaches that are based on human biology more than on extrapolation from animals to humans.",

In vitro test methods being developed for TG use are increasing the use of human based reagents, in combination with, or replacing animal derived reagents, and demand for human reagents is likely to grow in the near future. There are a range of issues associated with the ethical use of human reagents, particularly human serum, in the adaptation and development of in vitro TGs, especially to ensure that there is no human exploitation, legal requirements are adhered to, and that the origin of the reagent is assured. To address these concerns, the OECD has instigated a workshop on ethics, sources, availability and traceability of human based reagents for TG purposes, to be held in March, 2019. The focus is to provide guidance on acceptable sources of human serum for use in in vitro TGs, in terms of donor ethics and informed consent regarding commercial use and Quality Control for safety and consistent performance, with a view to providing guidance to support the adaptation and/or development of in vitro TGs using human reagents, and to ensure that in reporting the test results to regulators, clearly defined ethical and traceability aspects are adequately addressed, for the Mutual Acceptance of Data principle to be accepted in all OECD member countries. This thought-starter provides a discussion basis to achieve those objectives.",

However, the biological effects elicited by machine perfusion are largely unknown, and a sub­stantial number of animal studies are presently focused on this topic. The aim of the present study was to describe a model of DCD based on ex-situ perfusion of liver grafts derived from animals used for food production.Procurement took place within a slaughterhouse facility. After cold storage, the liver grafts were perfused with autologous blood-enriched perfusion fluid in a clinically fashioned closed circuit normothermic MP (NMP). During the rewarming phase, temperature and flows were progressively increased to reach target values. Perfusate and tissue samples were collected to assess NMP functionality. Grafts were classified as transplantable (LT-G) or not (nLT-G) according to clinical criteria, and viability was confirmed by histopathological analysis.Four grafts were classified as LT-G and three as nLT-G at the end of NMP. Histology confirmed the absence of major damage in LT-G, while nLT-G presented diffuse necrosis. Interestingly, an early impairment of the hepatocyte respiratory chain, leading to cell necrosis and graft non-viability, was documented in nLT-G for the first time. These parameters, together with indocyanine-green dye and citrate clearance could contribute to graft evaluation in clinical settings. The model provides a promising and reproducible method to replace dedicated experimental animals in research on machine perfusion of DCD grafts in line with the 3Rs principles",

    "abstract": "There are currently no skin sensitization assays based on T cell activation. We built a novel in vitro test to assess T cell activation and assessed its performance to discriminate skin sensitizers from non-sensitizers using 52 reference chemicals. Jurkat Clone E6-1 human T lymphocytes were exposed to a series of concentrations of test substances for 24 hours and CD69 expression was measured as a marker of early T cell activation by flow cytometry. Most sensitizers tested induced an increased relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of CD69 on the T cells, which was linearly correlated with the tested concentrations, indicating a statistically significant causal link between sensitizer concentration and increase of CD69 expression. CD69 RFI ≥ 1.5 was determined as the positive criterion for skin sensitizer classification when cell viability ≥ 50%. The sensitivity (79.4%), specificity (88.9%) and accuracy (82.7%) of our test for the 52 tested reference chemicals showed a good predictivity for skin sensitizers. Results were reproduced in at least two repeats, and the concurrent positive control, 2 μg/mL 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, was found positive in all 25 independent runs conducted, indicating in-house reproducibility. The EC1.5 value, i.e., the concentration at which a test chemical induces a CD69 RFI of 1.5, may be used to categorize skin sensitization potency of a chemical. This work may contribute to the development of an in vitro assay for skin sensitization based on the activation of T cells.",

Four tests are currently available in the European Pharmacopoeia to monitor pyrogen/endotoxin presence: the rabbit pyrogen test (RPT), the bacterial endotoxin test, the recombinant factor C test, and the monocyte activation test (MAT). Here, we explored the possibility to replace the RPT with the MAT in the quality control of a vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). The testing was carried out using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells as cell source. IL-6 release was selected as readout for the detection of both endotoxin and non-endotoxin contaminants. MAT applicability for pyrogen testing of the TBEV vaccine was assessed through preparatory tests and resulted in the establishment of a very sensitive assay (limit of detection (LOD) = 0.04 EU/mL; sensitivity = 0.1 EU/mL). Both quantitative Method A and semiquantitative Method B were used for data analysis. Our studies revealed that for a vaccine without intrinsic pyrogenicity, such as that against TBEV, sensitivity (the lowest endotoxin value of the standard curve) should be used instead of LOD to define a stable maximum valid dilution of the product. In conclusion, we describe the challenges of MAT implementation for anti-TBEV vaccine following the current Ph. Eur. chapter 2.6.30 and propose a re-evaluation of the validity criteria of Methods A and B in order to set a semi-quantitative or limit test suitable for those products for which a reference lot comparison analysis is not applicable or favorable.",

The recent development of three dimensional (3-D) organotypic nasal epithelial culture models offers a physiologically robust system for studying the effects of exposure through inhalation. Exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) is associated with nasal inflammation; thus, the nasal epithelium is relevant for evaluating the pathophysiological impact of CS exposure. The present study investigated further the application of in vitro human 3-D nasal epithelial culture models for toxicological assessment of inhalation exposure. Aligned with 3Rs strategy, this study aimed to explore the relevance of a human 3-D nasal culture model to assess the toxicological impact of aerosols generated from a candidate modified risk tobacco product (cMRTP), the Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2, as compared with smoke generated from reference cigarette 3R4F. A series of experimental repetitions, where multiple concentrations of THS2.2 aerosol and 3R4F smoke were applied, were conducted to obtain reproducible measurements to understand the cellular/molecular changes that occur following exposure. In agreement with \"Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century – a Vision and a Strategy\", this study implemented a systems toxicology approach and found that for all tested concentrations the impact of 3R4F smoke was substantially greater than that of THS2.2 aerosol in terms of cytotoxicity levels, alterations in tissue morphology, secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, impaired ciliary function, and increased perturbed transcriptomes and miRNA expression profiles.",

Funding programmes promote the development of non-animal test methods, however only in the area of nanotoxicology and also here not sufficiently to “pay full regard” to preventing animal testing, let alone to bring about a paradigm change in toxicology or in biomedical research as such. Ethical deliberations on nanotechnology, which influence future policies, so far do not address animal welfare at all. Considering that risk assessment of nanoproducts is conceived as a key element to protect human dignity, ethical deliberations should address the choice of the underlying testing methods and call for basing nanomaterial safety testing upon the latest scientific – and ethically acceptable – technologies. Finally, public involvement in the debate on nanotechnology should take into account information on resulting animal experiments.",

The hiPSCs obtained are usually implanted in immunodeficient mice, and teratoma formation is analyzed after 4 to 6 weeks to assess the cells’ pluripotency. In this study, an alternative in vivo model based on chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was established to analyze the pluripotency of newly created hiPSCs. 0.5, 1, 2, 4 x 106 hiPSCs gen­erated from urine-derived renal epithelial cells were seeded on CAM and incubated for 9 days. Teratoma formation was detected in 70% of eggs inoculated with 2 x 106 hiPSCs and in 100% of eggs inoculated with 4 x 106 hiPSCs. All teratomas exhibited vascular structures. The robustness of the CAM model was confirmed using two additional hiPSC lines derived from human fibroblasts (NuFFs) or jaw periosteal cells. The presence of all three germ layers within the teratomas was successfully verified by histochemical and immunofluorescence staining and gene expression analysis of germ layer-specific markers. Urine-derived renal epithelial cells were used as negative control and showed no teratoma formation. The CAM-based in vivo model provides an optimal in vivo test environment for the pluripotency evaluation of newly generated hiPSC lines. This simple, fast, inexpensive and reproducible method reduces the suffering of animals and thus implements the principles of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement).",

The approach is demonstrated in a pilot study with ethylbenzene (EB), a mono-constituent petroleum substance using a human alveolar epithelial cell line model. This included the development and validation of a generation facility to obtain EB vapors and the optimization of an exposure system for a negative control (clean air, CA), positive control (nitrogen dioxide), and EB vapors. The optimal settings for the VITROCELL® 24/48 system were defined. Cytotoxicity, cell viability, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed in A549 after exposure to EB vapors. A concentration-dependent significant decrease in mean cell viability was observed after exposure, which was confirmed by a cytotoxicity test. The oxidative stress marker superoxide dismutase 2 was significantly increased, but no concentration-response was observed. A concentration-dependent significant increase in pro-inflammatory markers C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, interleukin (IL)6, and IL8 was observed for EB-exposed A549 cells compared to CA. The data demonstrated consistency between in vivo air concentrations at which adverse respiratory effects were observed and ALI-concentrations affecting cell viability, provided that the actual measured in vitro delivery efficiency of the compound were included. It can be concluded that extrapolating in vitro air concentrations (adjusted for delivery efficiency and absorption characteristics and applied for testing cell viability) to simulate in vivo air concentrations may be a promising method to screen for acute inhalation toxicity.",

This article presents an overview of the historical development of the Preamble from the time it began to take shape in the late 1970s up to and including the most recent update in 2019. Over the years, the IARC Monographs Programme has taken account of scientific and procedural advances in identifying, reviewing, evaluating and integrating evidence to define causes of human cancer. Since the previous edition of the Preamble in 2006, the new developments include a stronger emphasis on mechanistic evidence based on key characteristics of carcinogens; greater consideration of exposure assessment methods in epidemiological studies; and integration of the streams of evidence on cancer in humans, cancer in experimental animals and mechanisms in reaching the overall evaluations. Thus, the Preamble now allows an evaluation process in the absence of data from animal studies, and the evidence on key characteristics of cancer may be contributed by new approach methodologies, thus potentially reducing or avoiding the use of experimental animals.",

Here, we developed an approach for data analysis of the distribution of PMR movement activities along the time axis; differences between treatment and respective controls are expressed by an aggregated value integrating the time-resolved density of the movement parameter as a measure for a chemically elicited PMR effect. Logistic concentration-PMR effect relationships were modeled for neuroactive test compounds with different modes of action (acetylcholinesterase inhibition, activation and inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels); 50% effect concentrations (EC50) were in the low to medium μM range (EC50 < 10 μM for flucythrinate, esfenvalerate, azinphos-methyl, propoxur; EC50 > 10 μM for tricaine). Modulation of movement activities in different phases of the PMR (i.e., “fingerprint”) by neuroactive test compounds varied across concentrations, showing that mode of action-specific PMR fingerprints are also concentration-dependent. Above concentrations causing 10% lethality (LC10; 48 h), 3,4-dichlo­roaniline caused movement inhibition. This substance presumably is not neuroactive; its effect on the PMR therefore is considered a secondary toxic effect. Quantitative morphological examinations of chemically exposed embryos showed that malformations occurred only above PMR effect concentrations, indicating that changes in the PMR were not due to such indirect effects. The PMR assay will provide a useful measure in ecotoxicological risk assessment of neuroactive chemicals with zebrafish embryos and could potentially be used to infer acute fish toxicity levels from PMR effect concen­trations of neurotoxic compounds.",

Then we took into account the potential risk of these ophthalmic solutions adsorbed on contact lenses and released on the ocular surface, highlighting the addition of a rinse step with unpreserved marine solution in the contact lens cleaning procedure to avoid side effects of contact lens care solutions.",

    "abstract": "There is a paucity of information concerning the developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) hazard posed by industrial and environ­mental chemicals. New testing approaches will most likely be based on batteries of alternative and complementary (non-animal) tests. As DNT is assumed to result from the modulation of fundamental neurodevelopmental processes (such as neuronal differen­tiation, precursor cell migration or neuronal network formation) by chemicals, the first generation of alternative DNT tests target these processes. The advantage of such types of assays is that they capture toxicants with multiple targets and modes-of-action. Moreover, the processes modelled by the assays can be linked to toxicity endophenotypes, i.e., alterations in neural connectivity that form the basis for neurofunctional deficits in man. The authors of this review convened in a workshop to define criteria for the selection of positive/negative controls, to prepare recommendations on their use, and to initiate the setup of a directory of reference chemicals. For initial technical optimization of tests, a set of > 50 endpoint-specific control compounds was identified. For further test development, an additional \"test\" set of 33 chemicals considered to act directly as bona fide DNT toxicants is proposed, and each chemical is annotated to the extent it fulfills these criteria. A tabular compilation of the original literature used to select the test set chemicals provides information on statistical procedures, and toxic/non-toxic doses (both for pups and dams). Suggestions are provided on how to use the > 100 compounds (including negative controls) compiled here to address specificity, adversity and use of alternative test systems.",

    "abstract": "In April 2013 the mouse antibody serum neutralization test (SNT) was formally incorporated into European Pharmacopoeia monograph 0451 for potency testing of inactivated veterinary rabies vaccines. The SNT is designed to replace the highly variable and pain and distress causing NIH mouse rabies challenge assay. The adoption of the SNT meets the European ambition (i.e., EC and CoE) to replace, reduce and/or refine laboratory animal testing. However, regulatory acceptance and use of 3R models, such as the SNT, remains challenging. This paper aims at clarifying the process of acceptance and use of the SNT. For this purpose it reconstructs the process and reveals barriers and drivers that have been observed by involved stakeholders to have played a role. In addition it extracts lessons to stimulate regulatory acceptance in similar future processes. The incorporation of the SNT into the monographs went relatively quick due to a thorough test development and pre-validation phase, commitment and cooperation of relevant stakeholders and a strong project coordination of the international validation study. The test was developed by the Paul Ehrlich Institut; a leading European OMCLs. This facilitated its European regulatory use. The use by industry is in a critical phase. At this stage product specific validation and the question whether the SNT will be accepted outside Europe are important influencing factors.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence proteins have been useful as genetic reporters for a wide range of applications in biomedical research and are frequently used for the analysis of transgene activity. Here, we show that expression levels of the ubiquitously expressed fluorescent proteins eGFP, mCherry, and tdTomato can be measured in transgenic mouse lines with random or targeted integrations. We identified the tail of the mouse as the tissue best suited for quantifying fluorescence intensity and show that expression levels in the tail correlate with gene dose. This allows for instant non-invasive determination of the genetic condition at the transgenic locus (hemizygous/heterozygous and homozygous), while simultaneously providing an objective comparison for transgene expression levels among different mouse lines. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that the gene dose of a ubiquitously expressed fluorescence reporter can be reliably quantified and directly linked to the genotype of transgenic mice. Based on this information, animals with the appropriate genotype can be instantly selected without laborious analysis for establishing and breeding of new transgenic lines, reducing the number of \"waste\" animals. Furthermore, no tissue sampling is necessary, which is a significant refinement of genotyping procedures. Both aspects are important improvements for the genotyping of transgenic mice that follow the principles of the 3 Rs (reduction and refinement).",

    "abstract": "Endoscopy of the upper respiratory tract (URT) is one of the minimally invasive techniques used for diagnosis and treatment of diseases in horses. Training in the use of an endoscope follows an apprenticeship approach, with extensive practice needed to help achieve effective skills acquisition. The use of live animals for training presents the risk of injury to both the animal and the trainee. The increased number of students and practitioners, a shortage of facilities and limited time available from expert clinicians add more challenges to the training process. In this work, we focused on the development of a preserved head and neck model that can be used as an effective training tool for training novices in the basics of URT endoscopy. The aim of the training is to become familiar with handling the endoscope and identification of the endoscopic depictions of normal anatomical structures encountered in the URT. Using the model, anatomical structures were clearly visible, recognized by their shape, architecture and topographical location. The model solved many of the aforementioned practical challenges and has great potential as a replacement alternative to the use of live animals. There are opportunities for the application of such models in training other clinical skills and for a variety of species. Erratum: doi:10.14573/altex.1512121",

    "abstract": "The use of pyrogen tests to assess the risk of endotoxin in biological products has increased recently due to concerns of some regulatory authorities about products exhibiting low endotoxin recovery (LER). Manufacturers increasingly seek to reduce the use of animals unless essential to assure patient safety. The current study compares the ability of the monocyte activation test (MAT) and the bacterial endotoxin test (BET) to the rabbit pyrogen test (RPT) to detect endotoxin spikes in samples of products shown to exhibit LER. Product samples or water were spiked with endotoxin and held for three days or tested immediately in the BET, the RPT, and two variations of the MAT at the same time. Results show high sensitivity to endotoxin of both the BET and MAT, and much lower sensitivity of the RPT, indicating that much higher levels of reference standard endotoxin are required to induce pyrogenicity in the RPT than the 5 endotoxin units (EU) per kg common threshold. The results of the BET and MAT correlated well for the detection of endotoxin spike in water. We also show that LER (masking of endotoxin) found in the BET is also seen in the MAT and RPT, suggesting that the products themselves elicit a biological inactivation of spiked endotoxin over time, thereby rendering it less or non-pyrogenic. We conclude that the non-animal MAT option is a suitable replacement for the RPT to measure spiked endotoxin in biopharmaceuticals.",

In vitro intrinsic hepatic clearance (CLint), the fraction unbound in plasma (fup), and the intestinal apparent permeability (Papp) are important parameters as input in a physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model to make first estimates of internal exposure after oral dosing. In the present study we explored the experimental variation in the values for these parameters as reported in the literature. Furthermore, the impact that this experimental variation has on PBK model predictions of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0-24h) was determined. As a result of the experimental variation in CLint, Papp, and fup, the predicted variation in Cmax for individual compounds ranged between 1.4- to 28-fold, and the predicted variation in AUC0-24h ranged between 1.4- and 23-fold. These results indicate that there are still some important steps to take to achieve robust data that can be used in regulatory applications. To gain regulatory acceptance of in vitro kinetic data and PBK models based on in vitro input data, the boundaries in experimental conditions as well as the applicability domain and the use of different in vitro kinetic models need to be described in guidance documents.",

A BMC estimation is derived from concentration-response modelling and results from various statistical decisions, which depend on factors such as experimental design and assay endpoint features. In current data practice, the experimenter is often responsible for the data analysis and therefore relies on statistical software, often without being aware of the software default settings and how they can impact the outputs of data analysis. To provide more insight into how statistical decision-making can influence the outcomes of data analysis and interpretation, we have developed an automated platform that includes statistical methods for BMC estimation, a novel endpoint-specific hazard classification system, and routines that flag data sets that are outside the applicability domain for an automatic data evaluation. We used case studies on a large dataset produced by a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) in vitro battery (DNT IVB). Here we focused on the BMC and its confidence interval (CI) estimation as well as on final hazard classification. We identified five crucial statistical decisions the experimenter must make during data analysis: choice of replicate averaging, response data normalization, regression modelling, BMC and CI estimation, and choice of benchmark response levels. The insights gained are intended to raise more awareness among experimenters on the importance of statistical decisions and methods but also to demonstrate how important fit-for-purpose, internationally harmonized and accepted data evaluation and analysis procedures are for objective hazard classification.",

    "abstract": "In vitro methods provide a key opportunity to model human-relevant exposure scenarios for hazard identification of inhaled toxicants. Compared to in vivo tests, in vitro methods have the advantage of assessing effects of inhaled toxicants caused by differences in dosimetry, e.g., variations in con­centration (exposure intensity), exposure duration, and exposure frequency, in an easier way. Variations in dosimetry can be used to obtain information on adverse effects in human-relevant exposure scenarios that can be used for risk assessment. Based on the published literature of exposure approaches using air-liquid interface models of the respiratory tract, supplemented with additional experimental data from the EU H2020 project “PATROLS” and research funded by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, the advantages and disadvantages of dif­ferent exposure methods and considerations to design an experimental setup are summarized and discussed. As the cell models used are models for the respiratory epithelium, our focus is on the local effects in the airways. In conclusion, in order to generate data from in vitro methods for risk assessment of inhaled toxicants it is recommended that (1) it is considered what information really is needed for hazard or risk assessment; (2) the exposure system that is most suitable for the chemical to be assessed is chosen; (3) a deposited dose that mimics deposition in the human respiratory tract is used, and (4) the post-exposure sampling methodology should be carefully considered and relevant to the testing strategy used.",

Over a period of 135 minutes positive inspiratory pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vein oxygen partial pressure and lung weight were assessed.Results: Stable organ function was maintained over 135 minutes with an amount of 2,500-3,000 ml perfusate without fall in pulmonary arterial pressure. During the time the positive inspiratory pressure and lung weight increased, while pulmonary vein oxygen partial pressure decreased.Conclusions: The present model of isolated hemoperfused slaughterhouse lungs displays a useful new and economic approach to evaluate pulmonary function and toxicity of different substances on an organ level. As a major economic advantage in comparison to models using laboratory animals, the current model might be run using blood and organs obtained from slaughterhouse animals.",

The objective of the analysis was the replacement of in vivo titration of cattle challenge virus by in vitro titration. Using data from 32 in vivo titration experiments together with the in vitro titration results of the same samples obtained by plaque count on primary lamb or pig kidney cells, as well as data from the virus isolation control chart used in the laboratory, we show that the reproducibility of the in vitro titration is much higher than that of the in vivo titration. The titer on primary kidney cells was on average 1.4 log10 higher than the titer determined by titration in cattle tongue (PFU/ml compared to bovine ID50/ml), but the difference varied among different strains. The study also shows that the probability of infection in cattle tongue is high even when a lower challenge dose is used, which makes the variability between strains less important. Based on these results, we propose to change the standard dose for cattle challenge from 104 bovine ID50 to 105.4 PFU, and to replace the in vivo cattle tongue titration method with the in vitro titration method.",

A full ban or total replacement of this in vivo test has been postponed because of the fear that current chemical-based detection methods could miss a new emerging toxin. In order to fully replace the mouse bioassay, more efforts are needed on the search for functional assays with specific endpoints. Gene expression elicited by diarrheic shellfish poisons in Caco-2 cells allowed us to determine three 'DSP profiles', i.e. OA/DTX, AZA-YTX and PTX profiles. Twelve marker genes were selected to envision the three profiles. qRT-PCR is relatively cheap and easy, and although its multiplex capacity is limited to 5 genes, this turned out to be sufficient to show the three expected profiles. The use of the multiplex magnetic bead-based assay turned out to be even a slightly better alternative, allowing the use of all twelve selected marker genes and 2 reference genes, and resulting in clear profiles with for some genes even higher induction factors as obtained by qRT-PCR. When analysing blank and contaminated shellfish samples with this multiplex magnetic bead-based assay, the contaminated samples could easily be distinguished from the blank samples, showing the expected profiles. This work is one step further on the final replacement of the mouse bioassay, e.g. by combining the neuro-2a bioassay for screening and detection with analytical chemical analyses and the multiplex magnetic bead-based assay for confirmation of known and unknown toxins respectively.",

Human relevant in vitro models are needed to study adipose tissue and related diseases. Vasculature plays a central role in the development and inhibition of adipose tissue related diseases. Here, adipocyte culture was established from hASC (human adipose stromal cells), and a vascularized adipose tissue model was established from hASC and HUVEC (human umbilical cord vein endothelial cell) co-culture, utilizing the same differentiation procedure. Using these models together allowed analysis of the effect of vascularization on adipocytes. Adipocyte culture and Vascularized adipose tissue model were characterized on gene (adipocyte and vasculature-related), protein (von Willebrand factor, CollagenIV, CD140b and CD144, secretion of leptin, adiponectin and FABP4) and functional (triglyceride accumulation, glucose uptake and lipolysis) levels. Additionally, vascularized adipose tissue model was exposed to chemicals with known effects on adipogenesis and angiogenesis (rosiglitazone, chlorpyrifos, prochloraz, mancozeb, butylparaben, 15-deoxy-δ12,14-prostaglandin j2, bisphenol a, bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, tributyltin chloride) to compare their effects to the literature. The in vitro vascularized adipose tissue model showed presence of functional adipocytes and extensive vascular network. Adipocytes and the vasculature showed relevant gene and protein markers. Insulin induced glucose uptake, inhibited lipolysis and influenced vasculature-related genes. The results showed that vasculature led to faster insulin response in lipolysis inhibition and modulated responses to chemicals. This novel thoroughly characterized vascularized adipose tissue model is a promising new tool for studying adipose tissue as well as effect of chemicals on adipogenesis and angiogenesis in adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Microcystins (MC) are a group of cyanobacterial toxins that comprises MC-LF and other cyclic heptapeptides, best known as potent hepatotoxicants. Cell culture and epidemiological studies suggest that MC might also affect the nervous system when there is systemic exposure, e.g., via drinking water or food. We asked whether in vitro studies with human neurons could provide estimates on the neurotoxicity hazard of MC-LF. First, we used LUHMES neurons, a well-established test system for neurotoxicants and neuropathological processes. These central nervous system cells express OATP1A2, a presumed carrier of MC-LF, and we observed selective neurite toxicity in the μM range (EC20 = 3.3 μM ≈ 3.3 μg/mL). Transcriptome changes pointed towards attenuated cell maintenance and biosynthetic processes. Prolonged exposure for up to four days did not increase toxicity. As a second model, we used human dorsal root ganglia-like neurons. These peripheral nervous system cells represent parts of the nervous system not protected by the blood-brain barrier in humans. Toxicity was observed in a similar concentration range (EC20 = 7.4 μM). We conclude that MC-LF poses a potential neurotoxic hazard in humans. The adverse effect concentrations observed here were orders of magnitude higher than those presumed to be encountered after normal nutritional or environmental exposure. However, the low μM concentrations found to be toxic are close to levels that may be reached after very excessive algae supplement intake.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of genotoxicity upon exposure to chemical and environmental agents plays an important role in basic research as well as in pharmaceutical, chemical, cosmetic and food industry. Low sensitivity and lack of inter-laboratory comparability are considered problematic issues in genotoxicity testing. Moreover, commonly used mutagenicity assays lack information about early and specific genotoxic events.Previously, we developed an automated version of the \"Fluorimetric detection of Alkaline DNA Unwinding\" (FADU) assay as a high-throughput screening method for the detection of DNA strand breaks in living cells. Here, we report an enzyme-modified version of the cell-based FADU assay (emFADU) for the determination of oxidative and methylation lesions in cellular DNA. Our method is based on the use of formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase or human alkylad­enine DNA glycosylase for the detection of chemically-induced nucleobase modifications in lysates of immortalized cell lines, growing in suspension or as adherent cells, and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We could show that upon treatment with sub-cytotoxic doses of known genotoxins, oxidative and methylation lesions are readily detectable.This fast, inexpensive, and convenient method could be useful as a high-content screening approach for the sensitive and specific assessment of genotoxicity in human cells. Thus, when implemented in the early compound development in an industrial setting, the emFADU assay could help reduce the number of animals used for toxicity testing. Furthermore, as we established the method for different cell types, this new assay may provide an opportunity for population studies and/or mechanistic research into DNA repair pathways.",

The whole inactivated TBE vaccine is highly effective, as proven by high seroconversion rates and near eradication of the disease in countries where vaccination programs have been implemented. TBE vaccine potency testing currently requires the use of in vivo methods that present issues of reproducibility as well as animal discomfort. As an alternative, public and private entities are currently exploring a batch-to-batch consistency approach that would demonstrate conformity of a newly produced vaccine batch with a batch of proven in vivo efficacy with respect to a range of measurable in vitro quality parameters. To identify a suitable cellular platform to be used in a panel of in vitro batch-to-batch assessments for the TBE vaccine, we exposed human cell-based systems, both of primary origin and cell line-derived, to vaccine formulations of high and low quality. Following stimulation, cell responses were evaluated by assessing the expression of selected genes by RT-qPCR. Our findings show that the expression of interferon-stimulated genes differed after treatment with non-adjuvanted vaccine batches of different quality in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, but not in monocyte-free PBMC suspensions nor in cell line-derived immune cells. These results indicate suitable platforms and potential biomarkers for a cell-based assay that, together with other immu­nochemical analyses, could serve for batch-to-batch assessment of the TBE vaccine, reducing, and eventually replacing, in vivo methods for potency testing.",

A workshop was held in October 2019 to discuss developments in the prediction of acute oral lethality for chemicals and mixtures, as well as progress and needs in the understanding and modeling of mechanisms of acute lethality. During the workshop, each speaker led the group through a series of charge questions to determine clear next steps to progress the aims of the workshop. Participants concluded that a variety of approaches will be needed and should be applied in a tiered fashion. Non-testing approaches, including waiving tests, computational models for single chemicals, and calculating the acute lethality of mixtures based on the LD50 values of mixture components, could be used for some assessments now, especially in the very toxic or non-toxic classification ranges. Agencies can develop policies indicating contexts under which mathematical approaches for mixtures assessment are acceptable; to expand applicability, poorly predicted mixtures should be examined to understand discrepancies and adapt the approach. Transparency and an understanding of the variability of in vivo approaches are crucial to facilitate regulatory application of new approaches. In a replacement strategy, mechanistically based in vitro or in silico models will be needed to support non-testing approaches especially for highly acutely toxic chemicals. The workshop discussed approaches that can be used in the immediate or near term for some applications and identified remaining actions needed to implement approaches to fully replace the use of animals for acute systemic toxicity testing.",

    "abstract": "The development of therapies for and preventions against infectious diseases depends on the availability of disease models. Bioengineering of human organoids and organs-on-chips is one extremely promising avenue of research. These miniature, laboratory-grown organ systems have been broadly used during the ongoing, unprecedented coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to show the many effects of the etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on human organs. In contrast, exposure of most animals either did not result in infection or caused mild clinical signs - not the severe course of the infection suffered by many humans. This article illuminates the opportunities of microphysiological systems (MPS) to study COVID-19 in vitro, with a focus on brain cell infection and its translational rel-evance to COVID-19 effects on the human brain. Neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2 has been reproduced in different types of human brain organoids by 10 groups, consistently showing infection of a small portion of brain cells accompanied by limited viral replication. This mirrors increasingly recognized neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients (evidence of virus infection and brain-specific antibody formation in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid). The pathogenesis of neuro-logical signs, their long-term consequences, and possible interventions remain unclear, but future MPS technologies offer prospects to address these open questions.",

    "abstract": "The pharmacopeia mouse neutralization assay (PMNA) is the standard method for determining the potency of phar­maceutical botulinum antitoxins. However, a PMNA requires a large number of mice, and, thus, an alternative in vitro method to replace it is needed. Herein, we developed an in vitro SiMa cell line-based neutralization assay (SBNA), compatible with a PMNA design, for therapeutic antitoxins against type E botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT/E). The SBNA measures the residual cellular activity of BoNT/E following antitoxin neutralization in the SiMa lysate using a specific quantitative sandwich ELISA for its cleaved cellular target protein SNAP-25. The potencies of different pharmaceutical antitoxin preparations were determined by applying two different quantification approaches: (1) a cutoff value, in accor­dance with the pharmacopeia concept, and (2) nonlinear regression of a standard curve generated by serial dilutions of a standard antitoxin. Both approaches achieved accurate potencies compared to the PMNA (average %RE of ~16%). Furthermore, the SBNA was able to determine in vitro, for the first time, the accurate neutralizing activity (%RE ≤ 20) of next-generation equine and rabbit therapeutic antitoxins. Collectively, a high correlation between SBNA and PMNA results was obtained for all antitoxin preparations (r = 0.99, P < 0.0001 for the standard curve approach, and r = 0.97, p < 0.0001 for the cutoff approach). In conclusion, the SBNA can potentially replace the PMNA and markedly reduce the need for laboratory animals for the approval of botulinum antitoxin preparations.",

Whilst many in vitro test guidelines were developed against specific hazard cut-off values, quantitative information is needed in data interpretation procedures for potency assessment purposes or to define points of departure so that assays can fulfill evolving regulatory needs. Utilizing four examples from skin sensitization, phototoxicity, endocrine activity, and non-genotoxic carcinogenicity, we illustrate why a shift in data generation and data interpretation procedures is needed to facilitate the full exploitation of the data that is generated using these assays. This requires the development of a practical approach that uses or expands upon existing guidance. Experience gained with such an approach can then provide a basis for an overarching strategy in test guideline development that should better facilitate combinations of in vitro test guidelines for specific endpoints that will be more transparent, robust, and adaptable for specific regulatory purposes.",

These summaries must include information on the objectives of the project including the predicted harm and benefits and the number and types of animals to be used. Summaries should also demonstrate compliance with the 3Rs. The intention was that NTS would help increase the transparency of animal research in the EU. In this article, we review the status of the publication of NTS across member states and give some general observations on publication speed, identification, accessibility and quality. We also review in more detail the quality of reporting in a selection of NTS from Germany and the UK. We consistently found that NTS from Germany and the UK were deficient in their description of what is being done to the animals and what they might experience as a result. Using examples taken from specific NTS we highlight what we view to be good and bad examples to assist member states and researchers in producing better NTS in the future. The NTS can also be an important tool in sharing of best practice in the 3Rs and the avoidance of duplicative animal testing. For this to happen, however, member states need to publish timely, ensure that NTS are accurate and, ideally, there needs to be some centralisation of the NTS.",

In this context, the identification of molecular target(s) responsible for mechanisms of action is an essential step. Inspired by the recent concept of polypharmacology (the ability of drugs to interact with multiple targets) we argue that whole proteome virtual screening might become a breakthrough tool in toxicology reflecting the real complexity of chemical-biological interactions. Therefore, we investigated the value of performing ligand-protein binding prediction screening across the full proteome to identify new mechanisms of action for food chemicals. We applied the new approach to make a broader comparison between bisphenol A (BPA) (food-packaging chemical) and the endogenous estrogen, 17β-estradiol (EST). Applying a novel high-throughput ligand-protein binding prediction tool (BioGPS) by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud (to speed-up the calculation), we investigated the value of performing in silico screening across the full proteome (all human and rodent x-ray protein structures available in the Protein Data Bank). The strong correlation between in silico predictions and available in vitro data demonstrates the high predictive power of the method used. The most striking results obtained was that BPA was predicted to bind to many more proteins than the ones already known, most of which were common to EST. Our findings provide a new and unprecedented insight on the complexity of chemical-protein interactions, highlighting the binding promiscuity of BPA and its broader similarity compared to the female sex hormone, EST.",

    "abstract": "Undesirable substances in feed can transfer into foods of animal origin after ingestion by livestock animals. These contaminants in food may threaten consumer health. Commonly, feeding trials are conducted with animals to assess the transfer of undesirable substances into animal tissues or milk. Such feeding trials explore the effects of the various physiological systems (e.g., ruminant and non-ruminant gastro-intestinal tracts) as well as different livestock production intensities on transfer. Using alternative methods to mimic the complex physiological processes of several organs is highly challenging. This review proposes a potential cascade of in vitro and ex vivo models to investigate the transfer of contam­inants from feed into foods of animal origin. One distinct challenge regarding the models for ruminants is the simulation of the forestomach system, with the rumen as the anaerobic fermentation chamber and its epithelial surfaces for absorption. Therefore, emphasis is placed on in vitro systems simulating the rumen with its microbial ecosystem as well as on ex vivo systems to replicate epithelial absorption. Further, the transfer from blood into milk must be evaluated by employing a suitable model. Finally, in silico approaches are introduced that can fill knowledge gaps or substitute in vitro and ex vivo models. Physiologically-based toxicokinetics combines the information gained from all alternative methods to simulate the transfer of ingested undesirable substances into foods of animal origin.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of essential or primary hypertension is increasing, especially in the northern hemisphere, but although the disease displays clear symptoms, its aetiology appears very complex, and thus no causal treatment is available yet. In the 1990’s, genetically modified animals (GMO) were considered to be the key to solving this problem of high complexity. However, until now, although a few approaches have shown that old, well-known drugs have a positive effect (decrease of blood pressure) on such animal models of hypertension, no approach has appeared in the literature of this area of research which might indicate a direct connection between GMO and a therapeutic strategy to treat or prevent this type of hypertension in humans. Instead, criticism of the GMO approach has accumulated in the last years, arguing that it is misleading as this disease does not have a monogenic cause and so complementary regulatory mechanisms could prevent the true identification of the function of the modified genes. Furthermore, the technology is best developed in mice, whose physiology of blood pressure is different from that of humans. Because of species specificity, it is not easy to extrapolate the results from animal models of hypertension to human hypertension. Also, in the years 2000 to 2004 a reorientation of the technology and the aims of this kind of research took place. Therefore, although these approaches are without exception deemed “very promising” in the literature, it cannot be expected that research on GMO will make any contribution to a new therapeutic strategy in the near future.",

There, animals languish in featureless rooms or sterile cages without access to daylight and with little opportunity to express their natural behaviors and aptitudes.

    "abstract": "The tuberculin skin test is the method of choice for tuberculosis surveillance in livestock ruminants. The exact definition of the biological activity of bovine tuberculin purified protein derivatives (bovine tuberculin PPDs) is essential for the reliability of a test system. PPDs consist of heterogeneous mixtures of mycobacterial antigens, making it difficult to determine their potency in vitro. The commonly used batch potency test is therefore based on the evaluation of skin reactions in mycobacteria-sensitized guinea pigs. The aim of the present study was to test an alternative in vitro method that reliably quantifies tuberculin PPD potency. This novel approach may prevent animal distress in the future.To this end a flow cytometry-based lymphocyte proliferation assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from sensitized guinea pigs was established. Potency estimates for individual PPD preparations were calculated in comparison to an international standard. The comparison with results obtained from the guinea pig skin test revealed that the lymphocyte proliferation assay is more precise but results in systematically higher potency estimates. However, with a manufacturer specific correction factor a correlation of over 85% was achieved, highlighting the potential of this in vitro method to replace the current guinea pig skin test.",

    "abstract": "Although osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent human joint disease with a large socioeconomic burden, it remains a neglected disease with no clinically approved disease modifying therapies. One of the key reasons for this is that the available disease models poorly recapitulate human OA-like traits, possibly because of the challenge of mimicking the disease in an ECM-rich cartilage tissue. In this study, we report the establishment and validation of a clinically relevant ex vivo OA model using IL1β-treated goat articular cartilage explants. Treatment with IL1β induced OA-like traits in goat cartilage explants and caused a shift in cartilage homeostasis towards enhanced catabolism, resulting in higher matrix degradation, overexpression of degradative and inflammatory mediators, and chondrocyte hypertrophy. We then validated the developed disease model for drug response using the drugs celecoxib, BMP7, and rapamycin, all of which demonstrated concentration-dependent disease amelioration in the model. Finally, we evaluated the translational relevance of the developed ex vivo OA model by comparing it with late-stage OA patient samples and observed a striking resemblance in terms of matrix degradation, expression of degradative enzymes, chondrocyte hypertrophy, and inflammation. Overall, the goat ex vivo OA model elicited a biological response to cytokine treatment that mirrors human OA-like traits and may reduce discordance between preclinical and clinical studies in OA drug development.",

The method is now part of the Tier 1 testing battery in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. The BG1Luc ER TA method uses the BG1 ovarian cell line that endogenously expresses full-length ER (α and β) and is stably transfected with a plasmid containing four estrogen responsive elements upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. To allow increased throughput and testing efficiency, the BG1Luc ER TA (“BG1 manual”) method was adapted for quantitative high-throughput screening (BG1 qHTS) in the U.S. Tox21 testing program. The BG1 qHTS test method was used to test approximately 10,000 chemicals three times each, and concentration-response data (n = 15) were analyzed to evaluate test method performance. The balanced accuracy of the BG1 qHTS test method (97%, i.e., 32/33) was determined by comparing results to ER TA performance standards for the BG1 manual method. Concordance between the BG1 manual and qHTS methods was 92% (57/62) when calculated for a larger set of non-reference chemicals tested in both methods. These data demonstrate that the performance of the BG1 qHTS is similar to the currently accepted BG1 manual method, thereby establishing the utility of the BG1 qHTS method for identifying ER active environmental chemicals.

    "abstract": "Currently two OECD adopted defined approaches (DA) for eye hazard identification of non-surfactant liquids exist (OECD TG467). The purpose of the current study was to develop a DA for eye hazard identification according to the three UN GHS categories (Cat.1, Cat. 2, No Cat.) for solid chemicals: the DAS. The DAS combines two test methods described in OECD TG437 and TG492. The DAS was developed based on in-depth statistical analysis of a database on solids for which in vitro and historically curated in vivo Draize eye test data exist. The performance of the DAS was assessed by comparing the predictions with the classification based on in vivo Draize eye test data, on the one hand, and with the performance criteria established by the OECD expert group, on the other hand. In a first tier of the DAS, the SkinEthic™ HCE EIT method (TG492) is used to distinguish No Cat. from classified substances. For classified substances the BCOP LLBO method (TG437) is used to identify Cat. 1, the remaining solids are predicted Cat. 2. In summary, 77.4% Cat. 1 (N=31), 52.3% Cat. 2 (N=18) and 70.0% of No Cat. (N=60) solids were correctly identified compared to the classification based on the Draize eye test. The percentage of correct predictions met the minimum OECD established performance values of 75% Cat. 1, 50% Cat. 2, and 70% No Cat. and the percentage of mispredictions was below the established maximum values. Therefore, inclusion of the DAS in OECD TG 467 has been achieved. Plain language summaryDefined approaches combine information from different non-animal testing methods in a specific combination and interpret the results according to a fixed procedure. Such defined approaches are already available as full replacements of animal testing to assess the eye hazard of liquid chemicals (OECD Test Guideline 467). This study used two OECD-adopted in vitro methods, based on human cells and corneas from cattle, to create a defined approach that can be used for solid chemicals. The performance of the procedure was assessed against data from previous animal tests for 109 solid chemicals. The results have already led to this defined approach being adopted by the OECD TGs programme for inclusion in TG 467. With the adoption of the new DA, non-animal human relevant strategies are now available for eye hazard assessment of liquids and solids, reducing the need for animal testing.",

Animal MPS may be of value in many areas including the study of zoonotic diseases, assessment of the safety and efficacy of animal therapeutics, and possibly reduction of the use of animals in regulatory submissions for animal therapeutics. In addition, the development of MPS from various animal species enables comparison to animal in vivo data. This comparison, while not always critical for all contexts of use, could help gain confidence in the use and application of human MPS data for regulatory decision-making and for the potential identification of species-specific effects. The use of animal MPS is consistent with the replacement, reduction, and refinement (3Rs) principles of animal use by identifying toxic compounds before conducting in vivo studies and identifying the appropriate species for testing.",

To reduce the likelihood of failure at this late stage, predictive biocompatibility testing using in vitro methods is needed. In this study, we describe a sensitivity analysis of an oral irritation test by evalu­ating changes in the viability, using the MTT assay, of 3-D models with EpiOral constructs as a case study. Experiments that tested sources of variability in the assay led to recommendations regarding the storage of the constructs after arrival, pipetting procedure, use of MTT reagents from different vendors, use of transepithelial electrical resistance measurements, and statistical analyses. A statis­tical model was proposed to evaluate whether test substances yield a positive or negative result and the associated statistical confidence. Testing several test compounds such as the Y-4 polymer, which contains a known irritant, and dentally relevant substances such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at varying concentrations revealed statistically significant results as expected. Lastly, a software app was designed to support a multiwell culture plate layout design. Overall, the findings and sugges­tions documented here will support the further development and potential standardization of this assay system and may be useful for the development of other assays using 3-D constructs.",

The binary \"highly toxic\" / \"low toxicity\" prediction model has an accuracy of 73.8% and 63.1% for EPA and GHS, respectively, with the subsequent hazard categorization offering a protective prediction (correct or higher category) in 90.0% and 93.3% of cases, respectively.

We are now expanding the applicability domain with a new DA for chemicals having surfactant (SF) properties (DASF). It is based on a combination of RhCE test methods (OECD TG492: EpiOcular™ EIT or SkinEthic™ HCE EIT) and a modification of the Short Time Exposure (STE, TG491) method. The aim of the current study was to compare the performance of the DASF with the performance of other NAMs currently included in the OECD TGs and with the classification based on the Draize eye test to identify potential additional DAs. The minimum performance criteria (75% Cat.1, 50% Cat.2, 70% No Cat.) used for the adoption of the DAs currently included in OECD TG467 were used for this purpose. The DASF identified 90.9% of Cat. 1 (N=23), 77.8% of Cat. 2 (N=9) and 76.0% of No Cat. (N=17) surfactants, meeting the minimum performance criteria. Some of the NAMs that are currently included in the OECD TGs seem promising methods to be part of a DA to identify Cat. 1 or No Cat. for eye hazard assessment of surfactants. However, the number of surfactants that have been tested to evaluate reliability and relevance was often too small. To date, the DASF is the only DA that has evaluated a sufficiently large number of surfactants and whose performance met the OECD acceptance criteria.",

    "abstract": "Many companies and global regulatory programs have expressed the intent to move away from in vivo animal testing to new approach methods (NAMs) as part of product safety assessments. NAMs, which include non-animal approaches for testing and assessment – from computer-based modeling to in chemico or in vitro models – allow faster data gener­ation with potentially greater relevance to humans while avoiding animal use. To monitor progress implementing NAMs, each organization first must define what is in scope, starting with the definition of “animal” (e.g., mammals, vertebrates) and applicable studies (e.g., animals used for “in-house” experiments, at contract research organizations, as part of envi­ronmental monitoring). Next, organizations must establish baseline animal use, including defined rules for inclusion/ exclusion of animals that ensure consistency in future assessments. Lastly, organizations must establish metrics for animal savings based on the utility of NAM data. This paper presents one approach to establish “animal use” metrics in a toxi­cology program at The Dow Chemical Company. The premise of our program is that most NAM information has value for animal savings, but the value depends on how data are used (e.g., research and development, screening, or regulatory requirements) and the level of certainty for internal decision-making. This manuscript provides metrics on the impact of NAMs, allowing a quantitative assessment of animal use numbers over time, accountability for resources spent on NAM development, and identification of areas where NAM development is still needed. This approach can be refined for use at other organizations.",

The court decision had claimed the experiments to be ethically justified.

    "abstract": "In April 2013 the mouse antibody serum neutralization test (SNT) was formally incorporated into European Pharmacopoeia monograph 0451 for potency testing of inactivated veterinary rabies vaccines. The SNT is designed to replace the highly variable and pain and distress causing NIH mouse rabies challenge assay. The adoption of the SNT meets the European ambition (i.e., EC and CoE) to replace, reduce and/or refine laboratory animal testing. However, regulatory acceptance and use of 3R models, such as the SNT, remains challenging. This paper aims at clarifying the process of acceptance and use of the SNT. For this purpose it reconstructs the process and reveals barriers and drivers that have been observed by involved stakeholders to have played a role. In addition it extracts lessons to stimulate regulatory acceptance in similar future processes. The incorporation of the SNT into the monographs went relatively quickly due to a thorough test development and pre-validation phase, commitment and cooperation of relevant stakeholders and a strong project coordination of the international validation study. The test was developed by the Paul Ehrlich Institut, a leading European OMCL. This facilitated its European regulatory use. The use by industry is in a critical phase. At this stage product specific validation and the question whether the SNT will be accepted outside Europe are important influencing factors. Erratum: doi:10.14573/altex.1507131",

    "abstract": "At present, quality control of diphtheria vaccines by both manufacturers and national control laboratories relies heavily on in vivo assays to confirm potency. As part of the VAC2VAC project we have developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the relative amount and quality of diphtheria toxoid (DTxd) in diphtheria-tetanus based vaccines and believe this test has the potential to play a key role in a control strategy no longer including an in vivo potency test. The mAb ELISA is highly specific, has good dilutional linearity, and is suitable for detecting DTxd in a range of different human vaccine products. We demonstrate the ability of the assay to discriminate between batches of different content and quality using vaccine batches that were prepared to contain differing amounts of DTxd or were altered by exposure to heat or oxidative stress. We also demonstrate successful transfer of the method to other laboratories and show that different diphtheria antigen materials may be able to serve as a reference antigen for local standardization of the method. The assay is ideally suited for incorporation into a consistency approach for routine diphtheria vaccine quality control testing and may be suitable to serve as the stability indicating test in replacement of the current in vivo potency test.",

    "abstract": "QT prolongation and the potentially fatal arrhythmia Torsades de Pointes are common causes for withdrawing or restricting drugs; however, little is known if environmental chemicals may have similar liabilities. Current in vitro-in silico models for testing proarrhythmic liabilities, using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM), provide an opportunity to address this data gap. These methods are still low- to medium-throughput and not suitable for testing the tens of thousands of chemicals in commerce. We hypothesized that combining high-throughput population-based in vitro testing in hiPSC-CMs with a fully in silico data analysis workflow can offer sensitive and specific predictions of proarrhythmic potential. We calibrated the model with a published hiPSC-CM dataset of drugs known to be positive or negative for proarrhythmia and tested its performance using internal cross-validation and external validation. Additionally, we used computational down-sampling to examine three study designs for hiPSC-CM data: one replicate of one donor, five replicates of one donor, and one replicate of a population of five donors. We found that the population of five donors had the best performance for predicting proarrhythmic potential. The resulting model was then applied to predict the proarrhythmic potential of environmental chemicals, additionally characterizing risk through margin of exposure (MOE) calculations. Out of over 900 environmental chemicals tested, over 150 were predicted to have proarrhythmic potential, but only seven chemicals have MOE &lt; 1. We conclude that a high throughput in vitro-in silico approach using population-based hiPSC-CM testing provides a reasonable approach to screening environmental chemicals for proarrhythmic potential.",

    "abstract": "Multiple non animal-based test methods have never been formally validated. In order to use such new approach methods (NAMs) in a regulatory context, criteria to define their readiness are necessary. The field of developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing is used to exemplify the application of readiness criteria. The costs and number of untested chemicals are overwhelming for in vivo DNT testing. Thus, there is a need for inexpensive, high-throughput NAMs, to obtain initial information on potential hazards, and to allow prioritization for further testing. A background on the regulatory and scientific status of DNT testing is provided showing different types of test readiness levels, depending on the intended use of data from NAMs. Readiness criteria, compiled during a stakeholder workshop, uniting scientists from academia, industry and regulatory authorities are presented. An important step beyond the listing of criteria, was the suggestion for a preliminary scoring scheme. On this basis a (semi)-quantitative analysis process was assembled on test readiness of 17 NAMs with respect to various uses (e.g. prioritization/screening, risk assessment). The scoring results suggest that several assays are currently at high readiness levels. Therefore, suggestions are made on how DNT NAMs may be assembled into an integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA). In parallel, the testing state in these assays was compiled for more than 1000 compounds. Finally, a vision is presented on how further NAM development may be guided by knowledge of signaling pathways necessary for brain development, DNT pathophysiology, and relevant adverse outcome pathways (AOP).",

    "abstract": "Cosmetic ingredients must be toxicologically assessed to determine their skin sensitizing potential. The in vitro human cell line activation test (h-CLAT; OECD TG 442E) addresses the activation of dermal dendritic cells by analyzing specific protein expression after exposure of THP-1 cells to the test chemical. According to the protocol, FITC-labeled antibodies are used for protein detection. However, some chemicals show strong autofluorescence at FITC-specific wavelengths so that antibody-specific signals cannot be distinguished appropriately from autofluorescence background. This leads to inconclusive or false-negative predictions. Alternative fluorochromes can be used if their equivalence with the FITC-labeled antibodies is proven. In the current paper we describe the results of a proficiency exercise, based on the proficiency chemicals listed in the guideline, with FITC-labeled antibodies as the benchmark and APC-labeled anti­bodies as an alternative detection system. APC emits fluorescence at longer wavelengths, thus avoiding interference in the FITC spectrum. Irrespective of the employed fluorochrome, all chemicals were classified correctly, and the EC150 and 200 values were in the same order of magnitude. Hence, the equivalence in performance of FITC- and APC-labeled antibodies was demonstrated, and the respective demand of the guideline was fulfilled. In a case study, we then tested a proprietary oxidative hair dye using both fluorochromes. Using APC-labeled antibodies, the hair dye was unambiguously identified as a sensitizer, whereas no classification could be made with the FITC-labeled antibodies. With APC, fluorescence interference can be circumvented and the applicability domain of the h-CLAT extended to include autofluorescent chemicals.",

The task of the animal welfare bodies (AWB) is to strengthen animal welfare and develop the 3Rs at research animal facilities. In 2016, we surveyed the knowledge on, attitudes towards and implementation of the 3Rs within AWBs at eight major Swedish universities. Based on responses of 34 closed-ended questions from 44 of 90 AWB members, the overall attitude towards the 3Rs was positive. AWB members did not believe that the 3Rs slow down innovation or result in increased costs, and refinement was considered beneficial for research quality. AWB members were particularly positive towards refinement questions in the survey. A majority of the AWB members predicted that alternative methods will never replace animal use. Researchers as a group represented in the AWBs were significantly less positive towards the 3Rs compared to the group of veterinarians. The tasks of the AWBs, e.g., giving advice on the 3Rs and following up on animal use in projects, were often not carried out in the AWB or not known by the respondents. Our results indicate a need for more practical and regulatory guidance and support to the AWBs. To reach the goal of the EU Directive to phase out animal use in research and education, we suggest that technical expertise in replacement techniques is included in the AWBs. We emphasize the need to strengthen the awareness of the 3Rs among researchers at Swedish universities.",

    "abstract": "Chemical risk assessment is currently based on consideration of health effects individually. The present work discusses a method for combining data by characterizing the dose-related sequence of the development of lower- to higher-order toxicological effects or the range of bioactivity observed at genomic level caused by a chemical/mixture. A reference point profile (RPP) is defined as the relation between benchmark doses for considered effects (or bioactivity measures) and a standardized severity or rank score determined for these effects. For a given dose of a chemical/mixture, the probability for exceeding the RPP can be assessed. An overall toxicological response can also be derived at the same dose by integrating contributions across all effects, with a rational for severity weighing. Conversely, dose equivalents corresponding to specified responses can be estimated. The variation in RPPs across chemicals suggests that joint consideration of effects under the proposed concept differentiates the consequence of chemical exposure, both at genomic and apical levels, to a higher extent compared to using a specific effect as a basis. This may help to refine the development of points of departure or sets of such values describing a range of health concerns. Analysis and comparison of apical and genomic RPPs, as well as consideration of functional relations between gene sets within such analyses, may aid in the transition towards a new approach method-based risk assessment paradigm that to a higher degree may require methods for combination of effect data compared to relying on specific outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A 6-week series of seminars addressing replacement of harmful animal use in education and training was held across Latin America in March-April 2008. Organised by InterNICHE and partner organisations in Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, the events built on the experience of previous major outreach in Russia and India. Up to 6 full-day seminars were held at universities and independent venues in each country. Smaller meetings with campaigners, teachers and professional bodies complemented the seminars. All events included spoken presentations, demonstrations and free trials of a wide range of alternatives. Speakers included InterNICHE experts and those from the host countries who are involved in replacement work. Partner organisations were empowered through the process of planning and execution of the seminars, and the tour helped to identify and provide support to others who are progressing humane education initiatives. Further collaboration is now planned. Information on the current situation concerning animal use and alternatives, including laws and regulations, was also gathered from each country. The tour succeeded in raising awareness and generating interest in replacement alternatives, also by national-level interviews and media coverage. Information and freeware alternatives were widely distributed, and further translations of material into Spanish and Portuguese are in progress. To continue the hands-on access to alternatives provided at the seminars, a Mexican/Central American Alternatives loan System has been established, and others are being built in Peru and Brazil. The donation of computers and alternatives to selected universities is also being planned in order to establish multimedia laboratories that will promote alternatives through example.",

    "abstract": "New approach methodologies (NAMs) for hazard identification of skin sensitizing chemicals were adopted as test guidelines by the OECD during the last decade. These alternatives to animal models align to individual key events (KE) in the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) for skin sensitization for which the molecular initiating event (MIE) is covalent binding to proteins. As it currently stands, the AOP does not include mechanistic events of sensitization by metals, and limited information is available on whether NAMs accurately predict the sensitization potential of such molecules, which have been proposed to act via alternative mechanisms to organic chemicals. Methods for assessing the sensitization potential of metals would be valuable tools to support risk management within, e.g., occupational settings during production of new metal salts or within the medical device industry to evaluate leachables from metal alloys. This paper describes a systematic evaluation of the applicability domain of the GARD™skin assay for the assessment of metals. Hazard classifications were supplemented with an extended analysis of gene expression profiles induced by metal sensitizers to compare the induction of toxicity pathways between metals and organic sensitizers. Based on the results of this study, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of GAR­D™skin for the prediction of skin sensitizing hazard were 92% (12/13), 100% (7/7), and 83% (5/6), respectively. Thus, the performance of GARD™skin for the assessment of metals was found to be similar to that observed for conventional organic substances, providing support for inclusion of metals within the applicability domain of the test method.",

Moreover, learning to use and apply one of the large imaging packages can be very time- and/or resource-demanding. Therefore, we developed the free and highly interactive image analysis program SUIKER (program for SUperImposing KEy Regions) that quantifies colocalization of different proteins or other features over an entire image field. The software allows definition of cellular subareas by subtraction (“punching out”) of structures identified in one channel from structures in a second channel. This allows, e.g., definition of neurites without cell bodies. Moreover, normalization to live or total cell numbers is possible. Providing a detailed manual that contains image analysis examples, we demonstrate how the program uses a combination of colocalization information and fluorescence intensity to quantify carbohydrate-specific stains on neurites. SUIKER can import any multichannel histology or cell culture image, builds on user-guided threshold setting, batch processes large image stacks, and exports all data (including the settings, results and metadata) in flexible formats to be used in Excel.",

    "abstract": "An ex vivo aneurysm model that closely resembles the in vivo situation can provide an important tool to test therapeutic approaches while avoiding animal experimentation. The model should mimic a variety of conditions, such as in vivo hemodynamics and native arterial structure and characteristics. The aim of this study was to develop an ex vivo aneurysm model by stiffening vessel walls to be used to assess treatment strategies. Porcine carotid arteries from slaughterhouse animals were used to evaluate the acute effect of different concentrations of Rose Bengal on vessel distensibility. Rose Bengal is a sono-sensitive compound that is activated by several ultrasound frequencies, resulting in stiffening of the treated arteries; the most effective combination of concentration and frequency was determined. In a pulsatile ex vivo vascular bioreactor, treated and control porcine carotid arteries were subjected to physiological conditions for 10 days. Treated arteries showed increased mean pressure and decreased pulsatility compared to controls. Changes in vessel morphology and a significant increase of distal diameter were observed in the treated arteries but not in the controls. His­tology revealed distal dissection-like lesions and proximal aneurysm-like structure in the treated arteries. Finally, a stent graft was deployed and cultured in one treated artery, demonstrating the feasibility of testing endovascular devices in the model. In conclusion, we developed an ex vivo model reproducing the onset of aneurysm formation. This represents a promising tool for early stage device testing, thereby reducing the need for animal studies.",

The aim of this study was to examine seasonal differences in the toxic and transforming potential of PM samples, by using the in vitro cell transformation assay in Bhas 42 cells for the prediction of potential carcinogenic effects. Bhas 42 cells are already initiated, and the v-Ha-ras transfection, together with genetic modification following the immortalization process, makes them a valuable model to study the late steps of cellular transformation leading to the acquisition of the malignant phenotype. Exposure to organic extracts of PM1 and PM2.5 induced dose-related effects. The transforming and cytotoxic properties are related to the amount of PM collected during the sampling campaign and associated with the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the samples. All the samples induced cell transformation following prolonged exposure of 2 weeks. Our results support the utility of the in vitro top-down approach to characterise the toxicity of real mixtures, thereby supporting regulators in the decision-making process. The results also identify the need for appropriate assay selection within the in vitro testing strategy to address the complexity of the final adverse outcomes.",

In order to integrate the advantages of adapted, transgenic animal models with a high-throughput procedure on the one hand and compliance with the 3R principles on the other hand, we have established and evaluated appropriate Drosophila models. To achieve this goal, we ectopically expressed oncogenes representing the most important driver mutations exclusively in the airway system. These oncogenes were either the human oncogenes or the corresponding Drosophila orthologs. We concentrated on two complementary read-out systems, 1) early larval lethality and 2) quantification of concurrently expressed GFP as a proxy for tumor mass. We could show that ectopic expression of EgfrCA, RasV12, Raf, Rolled (MAPK), PI3K92E, Alk, Akt and Arm can induce early lethality. Thus, they can be used in a straight-forward high-throughput screening approach and can replace mouse models to a considerable extent. Moreover, we could also show that measurement of tumor mass by a concurrently expressed marker (GFP) can be used to detect positive treatment results. Our results show that our Drosophila system provides a superb in vivo inver­tebrate screening system amenable to high-throughput approaches and thus effectively complements the toolbox for the development of novel anti-lung cancer treatments, while complying with the 3R principles.",

    "abstract": "Advances in physiologically-based biokinetic (PBK) modelling, in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) methodologies, and development of permeability-limited biokinetic models have allowed predictions of tissue drug concentrations without utilizing in vivo animal or human data. However, there is a lack of in vivo human tissue concentrations to validate these models. Herein, we validated the performance of our previously published bottom-up rosuvastatin (RSV) PBK model with clinical data from a recently published study that made use of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to quantify the hepatic concentrations of [11C]RSV drug-drug interaction (DDI) with cyclosporine A (CsA). Simulated RSV area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0h-t) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) before and after DDI were within 1.5-fold of the observed data. Simulated AUC0-30min and Cmax ratios in the DDI setting matched the observed ratios closely (within 1.1-fold). To predict RSV hepatic concentrations, the model inputs were modified to account for RSV in the bile canaliculi after biliary excretion. The model recapitulated the observed hepatic concentrations before DDI and the decrease in hepatic concentrations after DDI. Simulated area under the liver concentration-time curve (AUC0-30min,liver), maximum liver concentration (Cmax,liver), AUC0-30min,liver ratio and Cmax,liver ratios were predicted within 1.5-fold of the observed data. In summary, we validated the ability of bottom-up PBK modelling to predict RSV hepatic concentrations with and without DDI with CsA. Our findings confirm the importance to account for drug distributed within the bile canaliculi for accurate prediction of hepatic tissue drug levels when compared against in vivo liver PET scan data.",

Many efforts are underway to find improved intracoronary devices to prevent in-stent restenosis. The aim of this study was to produce a new in vitro test platform for restenosis research, suitable for long-term cell proliferation and migration studies in stented vessels. Fresh segments of porcine coronary arteries were obtained for decellularization and were then reseeded with human coronary artery endothelial (HCAEC) and human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC). Subsequently, bare metal stents (BMS) or drug eluting stents (DES) were implanted and the segments were reseeded with HCAEC and HCASMC for up to three months. The stented segments were examined at time zero and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks by histochemical and immunohistochemical characterization and the reseeded areas before and after stent implantation were measured. Cells formed multiple layers after three months and detection of both CD31 and α-smooth muscle actin by specific antibodies showed that HCAEC and HCASMC are adherent and growing in several layers. Furthermore, we could show a significantly smaller proliferation area in DES (70% ± 3.5%) compared to BMS (17% ± 2.3%). These data are similar to animal and human studies. Therefore, this vessel model might be suitable as an initial benchmark for testing new anti-proliferative endovascular therapies and could consequently help to reduce animal experiments in this research area.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present ring trial was to test whether two new methodological approaches for the in vitro classification of eye irritating chemicals can be reliably transferred from the developers' laboratories to other sites. Both test methods are based on the well-established open source reconstructed 3D hemicornea models. In the first approach, the initial depth of injury after chemical treatment in the hemicornea model is derived from the quantitative analysis of histological sections. In the second approach, tissue viability, as a measure for corneal damage after chemical treatment, is analyzed separately for epithelium and stroma of the hemicornea model. The three independent laboratories that participated in the ring trial produced their own hemicornea models according to the test producer's instructions, thus supporting the open source concept. A total of 9 chemicals with different physicochemical and eye-irritating properties were tested to assess the between-laboratory reproducibility (BLR), the predictive performance, as well as possible limitations of the test systems. The BLR was 62.5% for the first and 100% for the second method. Both methods enabled to discriminate Cat. 1 chemicals from all non-Cat. 1 substances, which qualifies them to be used in a top-down approach. However, the selectivity between No Cat. and Cat. 2 chemicals still needs optimization.",

    "abstract": "The approval of plant protection agents requires xenobiotic metabolism and residue studies in rats, farm animals and plants (e.g., EU regulation 1107/2009) performed according to OECD guidelines. The intestinal metabolism of ruminants can produce specific residues, which must be investigated in detail. This is usually done by performing additional in vivo studies. The aim of the present work is to assess whether a modified in vitro rumen simulation system (RUSITEC) can generate this information. Rumen constituents from sheep were incubated over 8 days. The pH (6.70 ± 0.07), the redox potential (301 mV ± 30 mV), the microbial composition, and β-glucosidase activity were monitored. After an equilibration period of four or five days the fermenters were probed with 14C-labelled triazole derivatives, i.e., common metabolites of azole fungicides. Only triazole-alanine was cleaved to 1,2,4-triazole, while triazole-acetic acid and triazole-lactic acid remained stable for up to 96 hours. The two glucosides octyl-β-D-glucopy­ranoside and polydatin, which are common residues found in plants, were both rapidly cleaved in the in vitro rumen system. The data shows that the modified RUSITEC system is stable, viable and maintains metabolic capacity over a longer period of time (at least 8 days). This makes many animal experiments obsolete and represents a significant contribution to the 3Rs (refine, reduce, replace). The modification of the RUSITEC system enables safe use of unlabeled but also of radiolabeled test compounds.",

    "abstract": "The proximal tubule is the primary site for renal solute reabsorption and secretion and thus a main target for drug-induced toxicity. Current nonclinical methods using 2D cell cultures are unable to fully recapitulate clinical drug responses mainly due to limited in vitro functional lifespan. Since extracellular matrices are known to be key regulators of cell development, culturing cells on classic 2D plastic surfaces inevitably results in loss of differentiation. Hence, 3D models of the human proximal tubule that recapitulate the in vivo morphology would allow for improved drug screening and disease modeling. Here, the development and characterization of a 3D proximal tubule model using RPTEC/TERT1 cells is presented. RPTEC/TERT1 cells self-assembled in matrigel to form highly differentiated and stable 3D tubular structures characterized by a branched network of monolayered cells encircling a cell-free lumen, thus mimicking the proximal tubule. In vitro tubuli resembled the polarity of a proximal tubule epithelium as indicated by polar expression of Na+/K+-ATPase and ZO-3. Furthermore, 3D cultured RPTEC/TERT1 cells showed overall increased mRNA expression of xenobiotic transporters, e.g., OCTs and MATEs and de novo expression of OAT3 when compared to cultures on plastics or membrane inserts. Finally, this model was used to assess delayed cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and demonstrated increased sensitivity when compared to 2D culture. Thus, the easy-to-use model described here may prove to be useful for mechanistic investigations, e.g., in discovery of compounds interfering with tubule formation, differentiation and polarization, as well for the detection and understanding of pharmaceutical induced nephrotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Many extracellular matrices (ECM) used for modern cell culture are derived from animals. An alternative approach is the recombinant production of individual matrix protein components. A further development of this strategy uses a constant core protein polymer that is modifiable with functional domains of various ECM proteins. This way, a single, highlydefined ECM system could be used for a large variety of cell types. Self-assembling protein domains from human muscle sarcomeres, termed ZT material (ZT), have been shown to be suitable for this modular approach of generating ECMs. We explored in a proof-of-concept study whether ZT modified with the fibronectin 10 domain (ZTFn10) is able to substitute bovine serum-derived fibronectin as a coating for neural crest cell (NCC)-based toxicity testing. Human NCCs were generated from pluripotent stem cells and used in the automated version of an NCC migration assay (cMINC). ZTFn10, but not the unmodified core material (ZT), allowed high migration activity. The classical cMINC setup, with bovine fibronectin coating, was used as positive control, and detailed analysis of NCC migration by time-lapse recording indicated that the novel ECM fully matched the bioactivity of the traditional ECM. A final set of experiments showed that various positive controls of the cMINC assay (PCB180, LiCl, cytochalasin D) showed nearly identical inhibition curves on the traditional and the novel ECM. Thus, the cMINC, and possibly other bioassays, can be performed with a ZT-based ECM instead of traditional animal-derived protein coatings.",

    "abstract": "delivered a virtual plenary lecture on \"Perspectives of non-animal models\".He stated that while the limitations of animal-based toxicology to predict human health issues are being increasingly recognized, shortcomings of traditional (human) cell culture are also evident.Issues around these include cell identity, differentiation, genetic stability and mycoplasma infection as well as non-homeostatic and non-physiological culture conditions.Large toxicological databases (\"big data\") and data-mining technologies (\"artificial intelligence\") now allow predictive computational approaches on a new scale, for example, using automated read-across (RASAR, i.e., read-across-based structure activity relationships).At the same time, the combination of cell culture with bioengineering has led to more organotypic cell culture technologies, such as 3D culture, human stem cell-derived systems, perfusion, co-cultures, combinations with scaffolds and sensors, etc. Increasingly, these approaches are combined to organ-on-chip or even multi-organ human-on-chip solutions.By recreating organ architecture and functionality and homeostasis of the cell environment, these models mirror the physiological situation more closely.The example of the human iPSC-derived mini-brain developed at CAAT illustrates this claim.Combined with an increased mechanistic base of reasoning (e.g., adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concepts, integrated testing strategies (ITS), and evidence-based methods of data evaluation and integration), these are revolutionary changes in how we can assess the biological effects of substances.Dr Christian Pellevoisin, Scientific Director, EPISKIN Academy, Lyon, France, talked about \"Medical devices: ISO 10993 series moves to alternative methods\".He said that reconstructed human epidermis (RhE) allows validated full or partial replacement of different in vivo assays, is integrated in OECD Test Guidelines, and is used in screening and in support of weight of evidence approaches.Recently, RhE has been adapted to testing biocompatibility of medical devices, monitoring devices, and instruments used in diagnostics.The project conducted under Workgroup 8 (WG8) of the Technical Committee 194 (TC194) for biocompatibility of medical devices aims to replace the in vivo Draize test by an in vitro method using RhE models.The recent outcome of the round robin study with two RhE models in 17 lab-",

    "abstract": "Only few cell-based test methods are described by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guidelines or other regulatory references (e.g., the European Pharmacopoeia). The majority of toxicity tests still falls into the category of non-guideline methods. Data from these tests may nevertheless be used to support regulatory decisions or to guide strategies to assess compounds (e.g., drugs, agrochemicals) during research and development if they fulfill basic requirements concerning their relevance, reproducibility and predictivity. Only a method description of sufficient clarity and detail allows interpretation and use of the data. To guide regulators faced with increasing amounts of data from non-guideline studies, the OECD formulated Guidance Document 211 (GD211) on method documentation for the purpose of safety assessment. As GD211 is targeted mainly at regulators, it leaves scientists less familiar with regulation uncertain as to what level of detail is required and how individual questions should be answered. Moreover, little attention was given to the description of the test system (i.e., cell culture) and the steps leading to it being established in the guidance. To address these issues, an annotated toxicity test method template (ToxTemp) was developed (i) to fulfill all requirements of GD211, (ii) to guide the user concerning the types of answers and detail of information required, (iii) to include acceptance criteria for test elements, and (iv) to define the cells sufficiently and transparently. The fully annotated ToxTemp is provided here, together with reference to a database containing exemplary descriptions of more than 20 cell-based tests.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative adverse outcome pathway network (qAOPN) is gaining momentum due to its predictive nature, alignment with quantitative risk assessment, and great potential as a computational new approach methodology (NAM) to reduce laboratory animal tests. The present work aimed to demonstrate two advanced modeling approaches, piecewise structural equation modeling (PSEM) and Bayesian network (BN), for de novo qAOPN model construction based on routine ecotoxicological data. A previously published AOP network comprised of four linear AOPs linking excessive reactive oxygen species production to mortality in aquatic organisms was employed as a case study. The demonstrative case study intended to answer: Which linear AOP in the network contributed the most to the AO? Can any of the upstream KEs accurately predict the AO? What are the advantages and limitations of PSEM or BN in qAOPN development? The outcomes from the two approaches showed that both PSEM and BN are suitable for constructing a complex qAOPN based on limited experimental data. Besides quantification of response-response relationships, both approaches could identify the most influencing linear AOP in a complex network and evaluate the predictive ability of the AOP, albeit some discrepancies in predictive ability were identified for the two approaches using this specific dataset. The advantages and limitations of the two approaches for qAOPN construction are discussed in detail, and suggestions on optimal workflows of PSEM and BN are provided to guide future qAOPN development.",

    "abstract": "Grouping of substances and utilizing read-across of data within those groups represents an important data gap filling technique for chemical safety assessments. Categories/analogue groups are typically developed based on structural similarity and, increasingly often, also on mechanistic (biological) similarity. While read-across can play a key role in complying with legislation such as the European REACH regulation, the lack of consensus regarding the extent and type of evidence necessary to support it often hampers its successful application and acceptance by regulatory authorities. Despite a potentially broad user community, expertise is still concentrated across a handful of organizations and indi­viduals. In order to facilitate the effective use of read-across, this document presents the state of the art, summarizes insights learned from reviewing ECHA published decisions regarding the relative successes/pitfalls surrounding read-across under REACH, and compiles the relevant activities and guidance documents. Special emphasis is given to the available existing tools and approaches, an analysis of ECHA’s published final decisions associated with all levels of compliance checks and testing proposals, the consideration and expression of uncertainty, the use of biological support data, and the impact of the ECHA Read-Across Assessment Framework (RAAF) published in 2015.",

    "abstract": "Development of reliable cell-based nanotoxicology assays is important for evaluation of potentially hazardous engineered nanomaterials. Challenges to producing a reliable assay protocol include working with nanoparticle dispersions and living cell lines, and the potential for nano-related interference effects. Here we demonstrate the use of a 96-well plate design with several measurement controls and an interlaboratory comparison study involving five laboratories to characterize the robustness of a nanocytotoxicity MTS cell viability assay based on the A549 cell line. The consensus EC50 values were 22.1 mg/L (95% confidence intervals 16.9 mg/L to 27.2 mg/L) and 52.6 mg/L (44.1 mg/L to 62.6 mg/L) for positively charged polystyrene nanoparticles for the serum-free and serum conditions, respectively, and 49.7 μmol/L (47.5 μmol/L to 51.5 μmol/L) and 77.0 μmol/L (54.3 μmol/L to 99.4 μmol/L) for positive chemical control cadmium sulfate for the serum-free and serum conditions, respectively. Results from the measurement controls can be used to evaluate the sources of variability and their relative magnitudes within and between laboratories. This information revealed steps of the protocol that may need to be modified to improve the overall robustness and precision. The results suggest that protocol details such as cell line ID, media exchange, cell handling, and nanoparticle dispersion are critical to ensure protocol robustness and comparability of nanocytotoxicity assay results. The combi­nation of system control measurements and interlaboratory comparison data yielded insights that would not have been available by either approach by itself.",

This model allows the representation of puberty, a critical life period with regard to endocrine disruptors. The cellular modifications were followed for three weeks through transcriptomic and proteomic profiling analysis. A quantitative and comparative method was developed to estimate how known pathways were disturbed by each substance. This pathway-driven analysis revealed a strong alteration of steroidogenesis and an impairment of meiosis in all cases, albeit the initial molecular events were different for both substances. The ex vivo cytogenetic analysis confirmed that both fungicides alter the course of the first meiotic prophase. In addition, the mixture of both substances triggered effects greater than the sum of their cumulative effects and compromised future sperm motility after a shorter time of exposure compared with the fungicides tested separately. The alliance of an ex vivo culture with omics strategies complemented with a physiological examination is a powerful combination of tools for testing substances, separately or in a mixture, for their testicular toxicity. In particular, proteomics allowed the iden­tification of systematically differentially expressed proteins in the secretomes of exposed cultures, such as FUCO and PEBP1, two proteins linked with the motility and fertilizing ability of spermatozoa, respectively. These proteins may be potential biomarkers of testicular dysfunction and infertility.",

    "abstract": "Effective repair of spinal cord injury sites remains a major clinical challenge. One promising strategy is the implantation of multifunctional bioscaffolds to enhance nerve fibre growth, guide regenerating tissue and modulate scarring/inflammation processes. Given their multifunctional nature, such implants require testing in models which replicate the complex neuropathological responses of spinal injury sites. This is often achieved using live, adult animal models of spinal injury. However, these have substantial drawbacks for developmental testing, including the requirement for large numbers of animals, costly infrastructure, high levels of expertise and complex ethical processes. As an alternative, we show that organotypic spinal cord slices can be derived from the E14 chick embryo and cultured with high viability for at least 24 days, with major neural cell types detected. A transecting injury could be reproducibly introduced into the slices and characteristic neuropathological responses similar to those in adult spinal cord injury observed at the lesion margin. This included aligned astrocyte morphologies and upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein in astrocytes, microglial infiltration into the injury cavity and limited nerve fibre outgrowth. Bioimplantation of a clinical grade scaffold biomaterial was able to modulate these responses, disrupting the astrocyte barrier, enhancing nerve fibre growth and supporting immune cell invasion. Chick embryos are inexpensive and simple, requiring facile methods to generate the neurotrauma model. Our data show the chick embryo spinal cord slice system could be a replacement spinal injury model for laboratories developing new tissue engineering solutions.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical animal toxicity studies may not accurately predict human toxicity. In light of this, in vitro systems have been developed that have the potential to supplement or even replace animal use. We examined in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) of gene expression data obtained from The Open Japanese Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation System (Open TG-GATEs) for 131 compounds given to rats for 28 days, and to human or rat hepatocytes for 24 hours. Notably, a pair ranking (PRank) method was developed to assess IVIVE potential with a PRank score based on the preservation of the order of similarity rankings of compound pairs between the platforms using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to measure area under the curve (AUC). A high IVIVE potential was noted for rat primary hepatocytes when compared to rat 28-day studies (PRank score = 0.71) whereas the IVIVE potential for human primary hepatocytes compared to rat 28-day studies was lower (PRank score = 0.58), indicating that species difference plays a critical role in IVIVE. When limiting the analysis to only those drugs causing drug-induced liver injury, the IVIVE potential was slightly improved both for rats (from 0.71 to 0.76) and for humans (from 0.58 to 0.62). Similarly, PRank scores were improved when the analysis focused on specific hepatotoxic endpoints such as hepatocellular injury, or cholestatic injury. In conclusion, toxicogenomic data generated in vitro yields a ranking of drugs regarding their potential to cause toxicity which is comparable to that generated by in vivo analyses.",

    "abstract": "The use of in vitro assays for the biodetection of endocrine active substances (EAS) aims to reduce and replace in vivo studies required for regulatory assessment. However, this approach often fails to take into account the role of biotransformation on the activity of the test substances. A method introducing an S9 metabolic system into the CALUX-reporter gene assays for estrogen receptor α- and anti-androgen receptor-mediated activities was developed. Methoxychlor, which exhibits increased estrogenic and anti-androgenic activities after biotransformation, was used to establish the method in ERα and anti-AR CALUX. For the anti-androgenic assay, stanozolol was used as a competing agonist not metabolized by S9. The method was first applied in both agonist and antagonist modes to methoxychlor and bisphenol A, as positive and negative controls, respectively. Then, benzo(a)pyrene and flutamide were also tested for their bioactivation potential. Co-treatment with S9 successfully increased the ERα agonist and AR antagonist potency of methoxychlor; no change was observed for bisphenol A. Incubation with S9 also enhanced the anti-androgenic activity of flutamide. Interestingly, the metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene by S9 resulted in a greatly increased estrogen receptor-mediated transcriptional activation, while the shift in EC50 was only minor. It is likely that both enzyme kinetics and metabolite stability affect the composition of the final metabolite mixture and thus influence the observed effects. Together these results demonstrate the relevance of including biotransformation in in vitro bioassays for the detection of EAS.",

Existing approaches to derive this value have raised several concerns; thus, it is often chosen case-by-case based on personal experience. To overcome this ambiguity, we propose an approach for choosing the non-toxic concentration (NtC) of a chemical in a rational, tractable way. We developed an algorithm that identifies the highest chemical concentration that causes no more than 10% effect (≤ EC10) including the modeled 95% confidence intervals and considering each of the measured biological replicates; and whose toxicity is not significantly different from no effect. The developed algorithm was validated in two steps: by comparing its results with measured and modeled data for 91 dose-response experiments with fish cell lines and/or zebrafish embryos; and by measuring actual effects caused by NtCs in a separate set of experiments using a fish cell line and zebrafish embryos. The algorithm provided an NtC that is more protective than NOEC (no-observed-effect-concentration), NEC (modeled no-effect concentration), EC10 and BMD (benchmark dose). Despite focusing on small-scale bioassays here, this study indicates that the NtC algorithm could be used in various systems. Its application to the survival of zebrafish embryos and to metabolic activity in cell lines showed that NtCs can be applied to different effect measure&shy;ments, time points, and levels of biological organization. The algorithm is available as Matlab and R source code, and as a free, user-friendly online application.",

    "abstract": "Development of reliable cell-based nanotoxicology assays is important for evaluation of potentially hazardous engineered nanomaterials. Challenges to producing a reliable assay protocol include working with nanoparticle dispersions and living cell lines, and the potential for nano-related interference effects. Here we demonstrate the use of a 96-well plate design with several measurement controls and an interlaboratory comparison study involving five laboratories to characterize the robustness of a nanocytotoxicity MTS cell viability assay based on the A549 cell line. The consensus EC50 values were 22.1 mg/L (95% confidence intervals 16.9 mg/L to 27.2 mg/L) and 52.6 mg/L (44.1 mg/L to 62.6 mg/L) for positively charged polystyrene nanoparticles for the serum-free and serum conditions, respectively, and 49.7 μmol/L (47.5 μmol/L to 51.5 μmol/L) and 77.0 μmol/L (54.3 μmol/L to 99.4 μmol/L) for positive chemical control cadmium sulfate for the serum-free and serum conditions, respectively. Results from the measurement controls can be used to evaluate the sources of variability and their relative magnitudes within and between laboratories. This information revealed steps of the protocol that may need to be modified to improve the overall robustness and precision. The results suggest that protocol details such as cell line ID, media exchange, cell handling, and nanoparticle dispersion are critical to ensure protocol robustness and comparability of nanocytotoxicity assay results. The combi­nation of system control measurements and interlaboratory comparison data yielded insights that would not have been available by either approach by itself.",

    "abstract": "To provide sound scientific advice in support of the European decision-making process in food and feed safety, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has defined the principles for producing “evidence-based scientific assessments” (impartiality, methodological rigor, transparency, and engagement) and, to help fulfil them, has developed cross-cutting methodological approaches. This paper focusses on two of these approaches: conducting scientific assessments in four steps – with an emphasis on developing a protocol for the assessment a priori – and analyzing uncertainty. An overview of the 4-step approach and of the methods for addressing uncertainty is given, and a case study on uncertainty analysis, developed in collaboration with the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, is illustrated. The main advantage related to the implementation of protocols and uncertainty analysis is improvement of the scientific value of the outputs. However, experience and further capacity-building is needed to better incorporate uncertainty analysis into the planning phase (protocol) of the scientific assessment process. The case study is based on exposure in humans. Nonetheless it provides an example of a framework for evidence-based scientific assessments that is applicable also to other types of evidence, including evidence arising from new approach methodologies. Adopting the proposed framework, which covers an analysis of uncertainties in the planning and implementation phase, is expected to foster the integration of multiple evidence sources, including alternative methods and testing strategies, in the regulatory scientific assessment process.",

    "abstract": "The in vivo histamine sensitization test (HIST) has historically been performed to guarantee the safety of acellular per­tussis vaccine batches. Non-compliance of batches is primarily associated with the presence of low levels of pertussis toxin (PTx). Because of ethical, standardization and scientific reasons, a variety of alternative in vitro approaches have been studied to replace the lethal HIST. A broadly applied and partially accepted method is the CHO cell clustering test, which is based on the clustered growth pattern of CHO cells when exposed to minute amounts of PTx. One of the major hurdles for global application of the CHO clustering test is the manual assessment of the clusters, which is associated with suboptimal reproducibility of test outcomes and is time-consuming. Here, various parameters of CHO cell nuclei were evaluated in search for a reliable, objective read-out parameter. We demonstrate that the distance between each nucleus and its nearest neighbor (3N method) is the most suitable parameter to assess clustered cell growth. This method detects 2.8 mIU PTx/mL and thereby complies with the requirement set for the sensitivity of the CHO clustering test based on visual reading. In commercial acellular pertussis vaccines spiked with PTx, the method detects 45 mIU/mL PTx, which is substantially lower than the 181-725 mIU/mL PTx detected by visual interpretation. The 3N method thus allows objective and sensitive assessment of CHO clustering and thereby encourages broad and global implementation of the in vitro test as an alternative to the HIST.",

    "abstract": "Animal testing has long been the cornerstone of chemical safety assessments, but fish embryo assays represent an alter­native. Omics studies allow the examination of early molecular responses of organisms to environmental stressors, but reduction of animal use within this context has been overlooked. For proteomics, there is significant disparity and vari­ability in the organismal pool size used for studies, ranging from 1-1500 embryos per replicate for zebrafish alone. However, it is unknown if varying sample pool size results in differences in protein identifications. To examine whether the detected proteome changes depend on this variable, 3 pool sizes (5, 10 or 20 embryos or larvae per replicate) were compared using the two most common fish models with an appropriate biological replicate number determined by power analysis (n = 7). Data was acquired using MSe, resulting in 1,946 and 3,172 protein groups identified (1% false discovery rate) for fathead minnow and zebrafish, respectively. Proteins were not differentially expressed among pool sizes, and no significant difference was observed among the identified protein groups. However, for the fathead minnow, a decrease in the number of identified proteins was observed with increasing pool size, while a trend towards an increase in protein identifications was observed in zebrafish between the lowest and highest pool size. Taken together, our observations suggest that a proteome characterization experiment using these fish models can achieve comparable protein identifications using pool sizes of less than 5 organisms per replicate, assuming a protein requirement of 50 μg or less.",

    "abstract": "the 3Rs but also energized all the participants to improve their standards of animal welfare, to implement the 3Rs, and to design much more robust experiments to obtain reliable and reproducible results, thus enabling them to perform high-quality research and regulatory testing.The conference was preceded by two pre-conference workshops on \"Experimental Design\" by NC3Rs, UK and \"Hygiene in Laboratory Animal Facilities\" by Tecniplast, Italy.The delegates attending the hands-on workshop on \"Experimental Design\" gained a deeper insight on the key elements of experimental design, analysis of the results, and their reporting in international journals as per the ARRIVE guidelines.They also gathered information about the NC3Rs' experimental design resources and were given a live demonstration of the Experimental Design Assistant (EDA), which is freely available on the NC3Rs website for use by scientists around the globe (see below).The workshop on \"Hygiene in Animal Facilities\" was also of great interest as a good hygiene status is imperative to high quality animal husbandry, which must minimize the introduction and spread of infectious diseases and especially ensure that pathogenic or opportunistic microorganisms are not introduced into specific pathogen-free (SPF) or immune-compromised animals.The event included participation of renowned keynote speakers, as well as oral presentations and poster sessions held by international and national professionals.Invited speakers and more than 300 participants from all over India and 10 different countries such as USA, UK, Australia, Japan, Korea, Sudan, Sri Lanka, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Denmark came together to share and advance knowledge about recent advances in the 3Rs and laboratory animal science at this event.The participants of the conference included scientists, post graduate students, veterinarians, and technical experts representing various research and educational institutes, universities, industry, and various national and international laboratory animal associations.This scientific gathering will certainly help in the implementation of the 3Rs in research, education, and regulatory testing, which in turn will improve the quality of research as well as animal welfare in India.As it is not possible to summarize the entire conference, we have made an attempt to summarize the major presentations and discussions that took place at the pre-conference workshops and the conference for wider dissemination of this knowledge.",

    "abstract": "New approaches, like the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework, have been developed to describe how chem­icals cause toxicity by linking in vitro assays to adverse health outcomes. However, approaches, tools and resources for development of AOPs have not been well described. Here we review information resources for AOP development and define a streamlined process for linking a chemical to an existing AOP. We propose a four-step process to facilitate AOP development: link the uncharacterized chemical directly to molecular initiating events (MIEs), key events (KEs), or adverse outcomes (AOs); identify analogs with toxicological information for the uncharacterized chemical; link the char­acterized chemical (initial chemical if characterized, a characterized analog if initial chemical is not) to MIEs, KEs or AOs; and identify AOPs that contain the MIEs, KEs or AOs that were found in Steps 1 and 3. The process and library of informational resources proposed and tested here served as the foundation for an informational online tool (AOPERA) that helps practitioners identify their current-state knowledge gaps, navigate the four-step process, and connect to rel­evant resources. AOPERA can be found at https://igbb.github.io/AOPERA_HTML. Additionally, we anticipate that by simplifying and standardizing the process of linking a chemical to a known AOP, we will lower the barrier to entry for this objective and increase its accessibility to new practitioners. In turn, this may increase the demand for new or improved AOPs to which practitioners can link chemicals, thereby contributing to the expansion of the library of known AOPs.",

    "abstract": "Regenerative medicine research requires animal experiments to evaluate the treatment effects. According to the 3Rs principles, alternative models have been developed and utilized to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new products. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures have been recognized for their relevant structures and biological functions akin to native tissues. They can better represent in vivo conditions than two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures. Herein, we present a fast and simple technique for the construction of 3D dermal fibroblasts (3D-DFs) without exogenous scaffolds. The 3D-DFs can be obtained within 3 days by seeding DFs at a level that exceeds their confluent density and culturing in the presence of ascorbic acid. The 3D-DFs had a compact multilayer structure, as revealed from their histology. The collagen content of the resulting 3D-DFs drastically increased compared to in a monolayer. The 3D-DF-derived extracellular matrix can serve for the 3D culturing of other cells. A gap closure assay was performed with the 3D-DFs to represent a 3D-wounded dermal model. Interestingly, the multilayered structure of the 3D-DFs could be regenerated after wounding even when cultured in the absence of ascorbic acid. Moreover, skin grafting of the 3D-DFs was demonstrated in vitro using wounded full-thickness skin models as an alternative to animal experiments. The 3D-DFs will potentially be useful for regenerative medicine or as tissue models for in vitro studies.",

Animal-derived sera such as fetal bovine serum (FBS), which are commonly used in these models, are associated with ethical concerns, risk of contaminations and inconsistencies of their composition and impact on cells. In this study, we developed a serum-free, defined co-culture medium and implemented it in an adipocyte/endothelial cell (EC) co-culture model.Human adipose-derived stem cells were differentiated under defined conditions (diffASCs) and, like human microvas­cular ECs (mvECs), cultured in a defined co-culture medium in mono-, indirect or direct co-culture for 14 days. The defined co-culture medium was superior when compared to mono-culture media and facilitated the functional mainte­nance and maturation of diffASCs including perilipin A expression, lipid accumulation, and also glycerol and leptin release. The medium also allowed mvEC maintenance, confirmed by the expression of CD31 and von Willebrand factor (vWF), and by acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acLDL) uptake. Thereby, mvECs showed strong dependence on EC-specific factors. Additionally, mvECs formed vascular structures in direct co-culture with diffASCs.The completely defined co-culture system allows for the serum-free culture of adipocyte/EC co-cultures and thereby represents a valuable and ethically acceptable tool for the culture and study of vascularized adipose tissue models.",

    "abstract": "Experiments with cultured mammalian cells represent an in vitro alternative to animal experiments. Fetal calf serum (FCS) is the most commonly used medium supplement worldwide. FCS contains a variable mixture of growth factors and cyto­kines that support cell proliferation. This undefined nature of FCS is a source of experimental variation, undesired immune responses, possible contaminations and, because of the way it is obtained, an ethical concern. Thus, alternative, defined, valid, and reliable medium supplements should be characterized in a large number of experiments. Human platelet lysate (hPL) is increasingly appreciated as an alternative to FCS. Since it is unclear whether cells respond differentially to clin­ically relevant chemotherapeutics inducing replicative stress and DNA damage (hydroxyurea, irinotecan), induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKi) imatinib, and novel epigenetic modifiers belonging to the group of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), we investigated these issues. Here we show that cancer cells derived from leukemia and colon cancer grow very similarly in culture media supplemented with FCS or outdated hPL. Notably, cells have practically identical proteomes under both culture conditions. Moreover, cells grown with FCS or hPL responded equally to all types of drugs and stress conditions that we tested. In addition, the transfection of blood cells by electroporation can be achieved under both conditions. Furthermore, we reveal that class I HDACs, but not HDAC6, are required for the expression of the pan-leukemic marker WT1 under various culture conditions. Hence, hPL is a moderately priced substitute for FCS in various experimental settings.",

    "abstract": "Pyrogenicity presents a challenge to clinicians, medical device manufacturers, and regulators. A febrile response may be caused by endotoxin contamination, microbial components other than endotoxin, or chemical agents that generate a material-mediated pyrogenic response. While test methods for the assessment of endotoxin contamination and some microbial components other than endotoxin are well-established, material-mediated pyrogens remain elusively undefined. This review presents the findings of literature searches conducted to identify material-mediated pyrogens associated with medical devices. The in vivo rabbit pyrogen test (RPT) is considered to be the “gold standard” for medical device pyrogenicity testing, despite the fact that few medical device-derived material-mediated pyrogens are known. In line with global efforts to reduce the use of research animals, an in vitro monocyte activation test (MAT) has the potential to replace the RPT. The MAT is used to detect substances that activate human monocytes to release cytokines. This review will also describe the potential opportunities and challenges associated with MAT adoption for the detection of material-mediated pyrogens in medical device testing.",

Microcystin congener structural diversity is a challenge for the risk assessment of these toxins, especially as several different PPPs have to be included in the risk assessment. The inhibition of PPP1, PPP2A and PPP5 by 18 structurally different microcystins was determined and demonstrated microcystin congener-dependent inhibition activity and a lower susceptibility of PPP5 to inhibition than PPP1 and PPP2A. The data were employed to train a machine learning algorithm that allows prediction of PPP inhibition (toxicity) based on 2D chemical structure of micro­cystins.

    "abstract": "Lifestyle and genetic factors can lead to the development of atherosclerosis and, ultimately, cardiovascular adverse events. Rodent models are commonly used to investigate mechanism(s) of atherogenesis. However, the 3R principles, aiming to limit animal testing, encourage the scientific community to develop new, physiologically relevant alternatives. Leveraging the 96-chip OrganoPlate®, a microfluidic platform, we have established a three-dimensional (3D) model of endothelial microvessels-on-a-chip under flow using primary human coronary arterial endothelial cells. As functional readout, we have set up an assay to measure the adhesion of monocytes to the lumen of perfused microvessels. For monitoring molecular changes in microvessels, we have established the staining and quantification of specific protein markers of inflammation and oxidative stress using high-content imaging as well as analyzed transcriptome changes using microarrays. To demonstrate its usefulness in systems toxicology, we used our 3D vasculature-on-a-chip model to assess the impact of the Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2, a candidate modified-risk tobacco product, and the 3R4F reference cigarette on the adhesion of monocytic cells to endothelial microvessels. Our results show that THS 2.2 aerosol-conditioned medium had a reduced effect on monocyte-endothelial adhesion compared with that of 3R4F smoke-con­ditioned medium. In conclusion, we have established a relevant 3D vasculature-on-a-chip model for investigating leukocyte-endothelial microvessel adhesion. A case study illustrates how the model can be used for product testing in the context of systems toxicology-based risk assessment. The current model and its potential further development options also open perspectives of applications in vascular disease research and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "A sizeable proportion of drug attrition is due to drug-induced seizures. Currently available animal models frequently fail to predict human seizure liability. Therefore, there is a need for in vitro alternatives, preferably based on human-derived neurons, to circumvent interspecies translation. The increasing number of commercially available human induced plurip­otent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal models holds great promise for replacing rodent primary cultures. We therefore tested three different hiPSC-derived neuronal models for their applicability for in vitro seizure liability assessment. Using immunofluorescent staining and multi-well micro-electrode arrays, we show that all models develop functional neuronal networks that exhibit spontaneous activity and (network) bursting behavior. Development of activity patterns differed between the models, probably due to differences in model composition and seeding density. Neuronal activity and (network) bursting was reproducibly modulated with the seizurogenic compounds strychnine, picrotoxin (PTX) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). However, the sensitivity and degree of chemical-induced effects differed between the models, which can likely be explained by differences in seeding density, maturation and different ratios of inhibitory and excit­atory cell types. Importantly, compared to rat primary cortical neurons, the hiPSC-derived neuronal models were equally, or even better in the case of 4-AP, suited to detect seizurogenicity. Overall, our data indicate that hiPSC-derived neuronal models may be used as a first screening tool for in vitro seizure liability assessment. However, before hiPSC-derived neu­ronal models can fully replace animal experiments, more compounds should be tested and the available models must be further characterized to fully understand their applicability.",

    "abstract": "There is a need for fast, efficient, and cost-effective hazard identification and characterization of chemical hazards. This need is generating increased interest in the use of zebrafish embryos as both a screening tool and an alternative to mammalian test methods. A Collaborative Workshop on Aquatic Models and 21st Century Toxicology identified the lack of appropriate and consistent testing protocols as a challenge to the broader application of the zebrafish embryo model. The National Toxicology Program established the Systematic Evaluation of the Application of Zebrafish in Toxicology (SEAZIT) initiative to address the lack of consistent testing guidelines and identify sources of variability for zebrafish-based assays. This report summarizes initial SEAZIT information-gathering efforts. Investigators in aca­demic, government, and industry laboratories that routinely use zebrafish embryos for chemical toxicity testing were asked about their husbandry practices and standard protocols. Information was collected about protocol components including zebrafish strains, feed, system water, disease surveillance, embryo exposure conditions, and endpoints. Liter­ature was reviewed to assess issues raised by the investigators. Interviews revealed substantial variability across design parameters, data collected, and analysis procedures. The presence of the chorion and renewal of exposure medium (static versus static-renewal) were identified as design parameters that could potentially influence study outcomes and should be investigated further with studies to determine chemical uptake from treatment solution into embryos. The information gathered in this effort provides a basis for future SEAZIT activities to promote more consistent practices among researchers using zebrafish embryos for toxicity evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The replacement of animals in acute systemic toxicity testing remains a considerable challenge. Only animal data are currently accepted by regulators, including data generated by reduction and refinement methods. The development of integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA) is hampered by an insufficient understanding of the numerous toxicity pathways that lead to acute systemic toxicity. Therefore, central to our work has been the collection and evalu­ation of the mechanistic information on eight organs identified as relevant for acute systemic toxicity (nervous system, cardiovascular system, liver, kidney, lung, blood, gastrointestinal system, and immune system). While the nervous and cardiovascular systems are the most frequent targets, no clear relationship emerged between specific mechanisms of target organ toxicity and the level (category) of toxicity. From a list of 114 chemicals with acute oral in vivo and in vitro data, 97 were identified with target organ specific effects, of which 94% (91/97) were predicted as acutely toxic by the 3T3 neutral red uptake cytotoxicity assay and 6% (6/97) as non-toxic. Although specific target organ mechanisms of toxicity could in some cases explain the false negative prediction obtained with the cytotoxicity assay, in general it is difficult to explain in vitro misclassifications only on the basis of mechanistic information. This analysis will help to prioritize the development of adverse outcome pathways for acute oral toxicity, which will support the assessment of chemicals using mechanistically informed IATA.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of high throughput in vitro assays has the potential to significantly improve toxicological evaluations and lead to more efficient, accurate, and less animal-intensive testing. However, directly using all available in vitro assays in a model is usually impractical and inefficient. On the other hand, mechanistic knowledge has always been critical for toxicological evaluations and should not be ignored even with the increasing availability of data. In this paper, we illus­trate a promising approach to integrating mechanistic knowledge with multiple data sources for in vitro assays, using drug-induced liver injury (DILI) as an example. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework was used as a source for mechanistic knowledge and as a selection tool for high throughput predictors. Our results confirm the value of AOPs as a knowledge source for understanding adverse events and show that the majority of drugs classified as most-DILI-concern were mapped to AOPs related to liver toxicity found in AOPwiki. AOPs were also used effectively to select a subset of assays from the Tox21 and L1000 projects as the predictors in predictive modeling of DILI risk. Together with previously published drug properties for daily dose, lipophilicity, and reactive metabolite formation, these assay endpoints were used to build a penalized logistic regression model for assessing DILI risk. This model obtained an accuracy of 0.91, thus confirming the potential power of integrating mechanistic knowledge with high throughput assays for toxicological evalu­ations. The results also provide a roadmap for data integration that could be used for other adverse effects.",

Distinguishing features of MPS, including long-term viability and physiologically relevant expression of functional enzymes, receptors, and pharmacological targets make them attractive tools for nonclinical characterization.

While MPS have limitations, including a lack of globally harmonized guidelines for standardization, they have already proven impactful in certain areas of drug development. Further research and regulatory acceptance of MPS will contribute to making them even more effective tools in the future. This review explores the potential applications of human liver, gut, lung, and cardiac MPS in drug development, focusing on disease modeling, safety assessment, and pharmacokinetic studies. Various technical parameters and relevant endpoints for system assessment are discussed alongside challenges such as cell sourcing, reproducibility, and the integration of multiple tissues or organs. The importance of collaborative efforts between academia, industry, and regulatory agencies to develop standardized protocols and validation criteria is emphasized. With ongoing advancements and cooperative initiatives, MPS are poised to play a significant role in enhancing the predictivity and reliability of nonclinical testing, thereby transforming drug development and regulatory processes.",

    "abstract": "Due to the rapidly increasing development and use of cellular products, there is a rising demand for non-animal-based test platforms to predict, study and treat undesired immunity. Here, we generated human organotypic skin models from human biopsies by isolating and expanding keratinocytes, fibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells and seeding these components on a collagen matrix or a biological vascularized scaffold matrix in a bioreactor. We then were able to induce inflammation-mediated tissue damage by adding pre-stimulated, mismatched allogeneic lymphocytes and/or inflammatory cytokine-containing supernatants histomorphologically mimicking severe graft versus host disease (GvHD) of the skin. This could be prevented by the addition of immunosuppressants to the models. Consequently, these models harbor a promising potential to serve as a test platform for the prediction, prevention and treatment of GvHD. They also allow functional studies of immune effectors and suppressors including but not limited to allodepleted lymphocytes, gamma-delta T cells, regulatory T cells and mesenchymal stromal cells, which would otherwise be limited to animal models. Thus, the current test platform, developed with the limitation that no professional antigen presenting cells are in place, could greatly reduce animal testing for investigation of novel immune therapies.",

In addition, histological and cellular investigations of human tissues continue to serve as keystones in understanding disease and health processes. In recognition of the importance of human tissues in research, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine held a workshop. Working closely with key stakeholders from the research community, regulatory agencies, and organ procurement organizations, the goal was to explore, understand, and address the barriers to increased use of human organs, tissues, and cells in research. Workshop participants were tasked with identifying the challenges of accessing and qualifying tissues for research purposes and creating a strategy to help meet the needs of the research communities to increase the availability and quality of human tissues in biomedical and translational research. Break-out groups identified significant challenges in the areas of policy, scientific development, and public engagement with respect to the provision and application of tissues and cells for scientific advancement. Following working group recommendations, stakeholders concluded that there is a need to facilitate the availability and quality of human tissues for the research community, as well as provide a framework for education of the public, medical professionals, and researchers to foster donation and utilization for research in place of animal models. The success of these new initiatives will facilitate greater access to high-quality human tissues for biomedical and translational research and help ensure the transition away from the dependence on animal models.",

    "abstract": "In the past few years, there has been a substantial increase in research and initiatives towards human-relevant technologies in India, particularly the use and development of microphysiological systems models in India. However, this rise has also been accompanied by significant roadblocks in the availability of infrastructure, training and education programs, supply chain issues, and lack of funding. A recent meeting between technology developers in academia and industry had led to suggestions to address these limitations. To take forward these suggestions, a first-of-its-kind multi-stakeholder meeting was held between participants from the Indian government and regulatory bodies, policy-makers, pharma companies, and academia. Several recommendations were proposed by the government and regulatory bodies to address the current limitations to developing MPS technologies in India. We end with strategies to achieve the proposed recommendations and envision that these initiatives would commence in the coming few months. This would assist in achieving the proposed goal of developing India as a key player in the development and usage of human-relevant technologies.",

    "abstract": "Depending on regulatory requirements, the skin sensitization risk for new chemicals with potential consumer skin contact must be assessed by experimental testing by (i) binary hazard assessment to identify sensitizers, (ii) subclassification of sensitizers according to the Global Harmonized System (GHS), and (iii) derivation of a point of departure (PoD) for risk assessment. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently published a test guideline incorporating the “2 out of 3” defined approach (2o3 DA) for skin sensitization hazard assessment and added the kinetic direct peptide reactivity assay (kDPRA) as a stand-alone test guideline method for GHS subclassification. The 2o3 DA requires that at least two in vitro tests are conducted. The cell-based tests and the kDPRA generate, next to a binary outcome with a fixed threshold, continuous concentration-response data, which can be used in quantitative regression models to derive a PoD. The sequence of testing for the 2o3 DA is flexible. Here we compare different testing sequences and how they can be combined with kDPRA data to provide a PoD in parallel to hazard identification (hazard ID) and GHS subclassification. A set of 188 chemicals with available in vitro data was evaluated for the final PoD using these different testing sequences. The results indicate that testing can start with DPRA / kDPRA and either of the cell-based assays, and that testing can stop after two congruent tests without major impact on the final PoD for chemicals within the applicability domain of the kDPRA.",

    "abstract": "Three guidelines covering key events in the skin sensitization adverse outcome pathway are endorsed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A recent guideline covers defined approaches (DA) to combine data from these tests for regulatory (sub)classification. The guideline methods provide continuous data that could characterize the sensitization potency on a more granular scale beyond (sub)classifications. We assembled a comprehensive database of in vitro and in vivo results from OECD guideline tests. Building on a previous approach using regression models, we provide quantitative models using input data from the kinetic direct peptide reactivity assay (kDPRA), the KeratinoSens™ (KS) assay, and the human cell line activation test (h-CLAT) to calculate a point of departure (PoD) in the form of a predicted local lymph node assay (LLNA) EC3 value for use in risk assessment. Predictive models include results from either two or all three assays. Detailed analysis versus in vivo data estimates redundancy between different tests and helps guide model selection. All models were tested on a set of case studies selected for their availability of multiple LLNA reference data in the OECD database. The predicted PoDs were within or close to the range of the variation of the historical LLNA data for most of these cases studies, and overall, the models predicted the in vivo value with a median fold-misprediction factor of around 2.5. The robustness of the models was characterized by comparing a comprehensive historical database versus the curated dataset provided by the OECD working group on DA.",

    "abstract": "Next generation risk assessment of chemicals revolves around the use of mechanistic information without animal experimentation. In this regard, toxicogenomics has proven to be a useful tool to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of adverse effects of xenobiotics. In the present study, two widely used human in vitro hepatocyte culture systems, namely primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and human hepatoma HepaRG cells, were exposed to liver toxicants known to induce liver cholestasis, steatosis or necrosis. Benchmark concentration-response modelling was applied to transcriptomics gene co-expression networks (modules) to derive benchmark concentrations (BMCs) and to gain mechanistic insight into the hepatotoxic effects. BMCs derived by concentration-response modelling of gene co-expression modules recapitulated concentration-response modelling of individual genes. Although PHH and HepaRG cells showed overlap in deregulated genes and modules by the liver toxicants, PHH demonstrated a higher responsiveness, based on the lower BMCs of co-regulated gene modules. Such BMCs can be used as transcriptomics point of departure (tPOD) for assessing module-associated cellular (stress) pathways/processes. This approach identified clear tPODs of around maximum systemic concentration (Cmax) levels for the tested drugs, while for cosmetics ingredients the BMCs were 10-100-fold higher than the estimated plasma concentrations. This approach could serve next generation risk assessment practice to identify early responsive modules at low BMCs, that could be linked to key events in liver adverse outcome pathways. In turn, this can assist in delineating potential hazards of new test chemicals using in vitro systems and used in a risk assessment when BMCs are paired with chemical exposure assessment.

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR) contributes to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD), making it a potential target for CVD risk assessment. High throughput screening (HTS) approaches have resulted in large-scale in vitro data, providing mechanistic information that can help assess chemical toxicity and identify molecular-initiating events (MIEs) of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). AOPs represent a logical sequence of biological responses contributing to toxicity and are valuable tools to inform chemical risk assessments. Here, we used HTS data to formulate an AOP relating VEGF signaling perturbation to atherosclerosis. ToxCast, Tox21, and PubChem data were evaluated to obtain bio-profiles of 4165 compounds active in assays targeting VEGFR. Cheminformatics analysis identified 109 enriched structural fingerprints. Applying a subspace clustering approach based on chemical structure bioactivity yielded 12 primary targets, whose relevance to CVD was confirmed by an AI-assisted literature review. An AOP was hypothesized by coupling mechanistic relationships highlighted by HTS data with literature review findings, linking Serotonin Receptor (HTR), Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα), and Vasopressin Receptor (AVPR) targets with VEGFR activity, angiogenic signaling, and atherosclerosis. Several endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), e.g., bisphenols, triclosan, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were identified as relevant chemical stressors. Subspace clustering of these chemicals evaluated potential MIEs and highlighted associations with use-case classes. By applying computational methods to profile HTS data and hypothesize a mechanistic AOP, this study proposes a data-driven approach to evaluating environmental cardiotoxicity, which could eventually supplement and reduce the need for animal testing in toxicological assessments. Plain language summaryThis study explores how disruptions in VEGFR contribute to atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaques in arteries that can lead to CVD. By analyzing data from HTS relevant to CV health, researchers identify how different chemicals affect VEGFR and potentially cause CVD. Using these screening methods, which quickly test many chemicals, the study identifies specific biological changes leading to adverse health outcomes. This research aims to develop methods to assess chemical toxicity without relying on animal testing, making it relevant to human health. The findings link certain chemicals e.g., bisphenols and DDT, changing VEGRF activity and the development of atherosclerosis. An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework maps the sequence of biological events from molecular perturbations to disease, providing mechanistic insight and identifying chemicals impacting the AOP targets. This approach helps understand the risks posed by environmental chemicals and protects public health while reducing animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "Impregnation spray products are used for making surfaces water and dirt repellent. The products are composed of one or more active film-forming components dissolved or suspended in an appropriate solvent mixture. Exposure to impregnation spray products may cause respiratory distress and new cases are reported frequently. The toxicity appears to be driven by a disruption of the pulmonary surfactant film, which coats the inside of the lungs. Due to the complex chemistry of impregnation spray products, it is impossible to predict if inhalation of an aerosolized product is toxic in vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether disruption of the pulmonary surfactant film can be used as a predictor of the toxic effects in vivo. Nine impregnation products with various chemical compositions were selected for testing and the main constituents of each product, e.g., solvents, co-solvents and film-forming compounds, were identified by mass spectrometry. We used a capillary surfactometry method to assess disruption of pulmonary surfactant function in vitro and a mouse model to evaluate acute respiratory toxicity during inhalation. Concentration-response relationships were successfully determined both in vitro and in vivo. The true positive rate of the in vitro method was 100%, i.e., the test could correctly identify all products with toxic effects in vivo, the true negative rate was 40%. Investigation of inhibition of the pulmonary surfactant system, e.g., by capillary surfactometry, was found useful for evaluation of the inhalation toxicity of impregnation spray products and thus may reduce the need for animal testing.",

    "abstract": "During the past decades, many epidemiological, toxicological and biological studies have been performed to assess the role of environmental chemicals as potential toxicants associated with diverse human disorders. However, the relationships between diseases based on chemical exposure rarely have been studied by computational biology. We developed a human environmental disease network (EDN) to explore and suggest novel disease-disease and chemical-disease relationships. The presented scored EDN model is built upon the integration of systems biology and chemical toxicology using information on chemical contaminants and their disease relationships reported in the TDDB database. The resulting human EDN takes into consideration the level of evidence of the toxicant-disease relationships, allowing inclusion of some degrees of significance in the disease-disease associations. Such a network can be used to identify uncharacterized connections between diseases. Examples are discussed for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Addi­tionally, this computational model allows confirmation of already known links between chemicals and diseases (e.g., between bisphenol A and behavioral disorders) and also reveals unexpected associations between chemicals and diseases (e.g., between chlordane and olfactory alteration), thus predicting which chemicals may be risk factors to human health. The proposed human EDN model allows exploration of common biological mechanisms of diseases associated with chemical exposure, helping us to gain insight into disease etiology and comorbidity. This computational approach is an alternative to animal testing supporting the 3R concept.",

    "abstract": "Migration of neural crest cells (NCCs) is one of the pivotal processes of human fetal development. Malformations arise if NCC migration and differentiation are impaired genetically or by toxicants. In the currently available test systems for migration inhibition of NCC (MINC), the manual generation of a cell-free space results in extreme operator dependencies, and limits throughput. Here a new test format was established. The assay avoids scratching by plating cells around a commercially available circular stopper. Removal of the stopper barrier after cell attachment initiates migration. This microwell-based circular migration zone NCC function assay (cMINC) was further optimized for tox­icological testing of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived NCCs. The challenge of obtaining data on viability and migration by automated image processing was addressed by developing a freeware. Data on cell proliferation were obtained by labelling replicating cells, and by careful assessment of cell viability for each experimental sample. The role of cell proliferation as an experimental confounder was tested experimentally by performing the cMINC in the presence of the proliferation-inhibiting drug cytosine arabinoside (AraC), and by a careful evaluation of mitotic events over time. Data from these studies led to an adaptation of the test protocol, so that toxicant exposure was limited to 24 h. Under these conditions, a prediction model was developed that allows classification of toxicants as either inactive, leading to unspecific cytotoxicity, or specifically inhibiting NC migration at non-cytotoxic concentrations.",

    "abstract": "To measure the testicular toxicity of two fungicides (carbendazim and iprodione), alone or in a mixture, we used a rat ex vivo model of seminiferous tubules, greatly reducing the number of rodents used, in accordance with the 3R rule (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement). This model allows the representation of puberty, a critical life period with regard to endocrine disruptors. The cellular modifications were followed for three weeks through transcriptomic and proteomic profiling analysis. A quantitative and comparative method was developed to estimate how known pathways were disturbed by each substance. This pathway-driven analysis revealed a strong alteration of steroidogenesis and an impairment of meiosis in all cases, albeit the initial molecular events were different for both substances. The ex vivo cytogenetic analysis confirmed that both fungicides alter the course of the first meiotic prophase. In addition, the mixture of both substances triggered effects greater than the sum of their cumulative effects and compromised future sperm motility after a shorter time of exposure compared with the fungicides tested separately. The alliance of an ex vivo culture with omics strategies complemented with a physiological examination is a powerful combination of tools for testing substances, separately or in a mixture, for their testicular toxicity. In particular, proteomics allowed the iden­tification of systematically differentially expressed proteins in the secretomes of exposed cultures, such as FUCO and PEBP1, two proteins linked with the motility and fertilizing ability of spermatozoa, respectively. These proteins may be potential biomarkers of testicular dysfunction and infertility.",

    "abstract": "Treatment compliance is reduced when pharmaceutical compounds have a bitter taste and this is particularly marked for pediatric medications. Identification of bitter taste liability during drug discovery utilizes the rat in vivo brief access taste aversion (BATA) test which, apart from animal use, is time consuming with limited throughput. We investigated the suitability of using a simple, non-animal model, the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, to investigate taste-related responses and particularly identification of compounds with a bitter taste liability. The effect of taste-related compounds on Dictyostelium behavior following acute exposure (15 minutes) was monitored. Dictyostelium did not respond to salty, sour, umami or sweet tasting compounds, however, cells rapidly responded to bitter tastants. Using time-lapse photog­raphy and computer-generated quantification to monitor changes in cell membrane movement, we developed an assay to assess the response of Dictyostelium to a wide range of structurally diverse known bitter compounds and blinded compounds. Dictyostelium showed varying responses to the bitter tastants, with IC50 values providing a rank order of potency. Comparison of Dictyostelium IC50 values to those observed in response to a similar range of compounds in the rat in vivo BATA test showed a significant (p = 0.0132) positive correlation between the two models and, additionally, a similar response to that provided by a human sensory panel assessment test. These experiments demonstrate that Dictyostelium may provide a suitable model for early prediction of bitterness for novel tastants and drugs. Interestingly, a response to bitter tastants appears conserved from single-celled amoebae to humans.",

On May 15-16, 2013, the In Vitro Testing Industrial Platform (IVTIP) held an open meeting to discuss the state of the art in alternative methods, how companies have, can and will need to adapt and what drives and hinders regulatory acceptance and use. Several important points arose from the meeting. First, industry and regulatory bodies should not wait for complete suites of alternative tests to become available, but should begin working with methods available right now (e.g., mining of existing animal data to direct future studies, implementation of alternative tests wherever scientifically valid rather than continuing to rely on animal tests) in non-animal and animal integrated strategies to reduce the numbers of animals tested. Second, sharing of information (communication), harmonization and standardization (coordination), commitment and collaboration are all required to improve the quality and speed of validation, acceptance and implementation of tests. Finally, how alternative methods can be used in research and development before formal implementation in regulations should be considered. Here we present the conclusions on what can be done already and suggest some solutions and strategies for the future.",

Animal-based research has been used to investigate ADHD etiology, pathogenesis and treatment, but the efficacy of this research for patients has not yet been systematically evaluated. Such evaluation is important given the resource consumption and ethical concerns incurred by animal use.We used the citation tracking facility within Web of Science to locate citations of original research papers on animal models related to ADHD published prior to 2010 identified in PubMed by relevant search terms. Human medical papers citing those animal studies were carefully analyzed by two independent raters to evaluate the contribution of the animal data to the human studies.211 publications describing relevant animal studies were located. Approximately half (3,342) of their 6,406 citations were by other animal studies. 446 human medical papers cited 121 of these 211 animal studies, a total of 500 times. 254 of these 446 papers were human studies of ADHD. However, only eight of the cited animal papers (cited 10 times) were relevant to the hypothesis of the human medical study in question. Three of these eight papers described results from both human and animal studies, but their citations solely referred to the human data. Five animal research papers were relevant to the hypotheses of the applicable human medical papers.Citation analysis indicates that animal research has contributed very little to contemporary understanding of ADHD. To ensure optimal allocation of Research &amp; Development funds targeting this disorder the contribution of other research methods should be similarly evaluated.",

We have developed a reproducible iPSC-derived human 3D brain microphysiological system (BMPS), comprised of differentiated mature neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) that reproduce neuronal-glial interactions and connectivity. BMPS mature over eight weeks and show the critical elements of neuronal function: synaptogenesis and neuron-to-neuron (e.g., spontaneous electric field potentials) and neuronal-glial interactions (e.g., myelination), which mimic the microenvironment of the central nervous system, rarely seen in vitro before. The BMPS shows 40% overall myelination after 8 weeks of differentiation. Myelin was observed by immunohistochemistry and confirmed by confocal microscopy 3D reconstruction and electron microscopy. These findings are of particular relevance since myelin is crucial for proper neuronal function and development. The ability to assess oligodendroglial function and mechanisms associated with myelination in this BMPS model provide an excellent tool for future studies of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases. The BMPS provides a suitable and reliable model to investigate neuron-neuroglia function as well as pathogenic mechanisms in neurotoxicology.",

Therefore, the European Chemicals Agency examined whether alternative ways exist to generate information on acute oral toxicity. The starting hypothesis was that low acute oral toxicity can be predicted from the results of low toxicity in oral sub-acute toxicity studies. Proving this hypothesis would allow avoiding acute toxicity oral testing whenever a sub-acute oral toxicity study is required or available and indicates low toxicity. ECHA conducted an analysis of the REACH database and found suitable studies on both acute oral and sub-acute oral toxicities for 1,256 substances. 415 of these substances had low toxicity in the sub-acute toxicity study (i.e., NO(A)EL at or above the limit test threshold of 1,000 mg/kg). For 98% of these substances, low acute oral toxicity was also reported (i.e., LD50 above the classification threshold of 2,000 mg/kg). On the other hand, no correlation was found between lower NO(A)ELs and LD50. According to the REACH Regulation, this approach for predicting acute oral toxicity needs to be considered as part of a weight of evidence analysis. Therefore, additional sources of information to support this approach are presented. Ahead of the last REACH registration deadline, in 2018, ECHA estimates that registrants of about 550 substances can omit the in vivo acute oral toxicity study by using this adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing human variability in susceptibility to chemical toxicity is a critical issue in regulatory decision-making, but is usually addressed by a default 10-fold safety/uncertainty factor. Feasibility of population-based in vitro experimental approaches to more accurately estimate human variability was demonstrated recently using a large (~1000) panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines. However, routine use of such a large population-based model poses cost and logistical challenges. We hypothesize that a Bayesian approach embedded in a tiered workflow provides efficient estimation of variability and enables a tailored and sensible approach to selection of appropriate sample size. We used the previously collected lymphoblastoid cell line in vitro toxicity data to develop a data-derived prior distribution for the uncertainty in the degree of population variability. The resulting prior for the toxicodynamic variability factor (the ratio between the median and 1% most sensitive individuals) has a median (90% CI) of 2.5 (1.4-9.6). We then performed computational experiments using a hierarchical Bayesian population model with lognormal population variability with samples sizes of n = 5 to 100 to determine the change in precision and accuracy with increasing sample size. We propose a tiered Bayesian strategy for fit-for-purpose population variability estimates: (1) a default using the data-derived prior distribution; (2) a pilot experiment using samples sizes of ~20 individuals that reduces prior uncertainty by &gt; 50% with &gt; 80% balanced accuracy for classification; and (3) a high confidence experiment using sample sizes of ~50-100. This approach efficiently uses in vitro data on population variability to inform decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision loss and one of the most common and debilitating complications of diabetes. Research to prevent DR is hindered by a lack of experimental model systems that faithfully reproduce the disease pathology, in particular for type 2 diabetes, which requires prolonged disease progression in animals to develop some hallmarks of DR. Here, we introduce an alternative in vitro model system for DR, based on serum-free, organotypic rodent retinal explant cultures, which allow physiological and pharmacological manipulation of the retina for up to two weeks under tightly controlled conditions. Retinal explant cultures have the advantage of isolating direct neuronal consequences of diabetic conditions from indirect systemic effects mediated via the retinal vasculature or the immune system. Exposed to conditions emulating type 1 or type 2 diabetes, retinal explants displayed elevated cell death rates among inner retinal neurons as well as photoreceptors, with a particularly strong loss of cone photo­receptors. Our results support a direct impact of diabetic conditions on retinal neurons and may help explain color vision defects observed in DR patients. This serum-free in vitro DR model avoids the animal suffering of established DR models and reduces the overall number of animals needed for such research. It should prove useful to study the mechanisms of neuronal cell death caused by DR and to screen for potential future DR treatments.",

Some important aspects are highlighted here, using methyl-phenyl-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), ferrous sulfate (FeSO4·xH2O) and ciguatoxin as example compounds. These are used to provide some background on aspects of acid-base equilibria, redox state, crystal water, natural compound mixtures, and chemical naming systems. Also, solvents and impurities are addressed, for instance concerning their often high (millimolar range) concentrations in assay buffers and cell culture media. The discussion of these aspects calls for a more standardized preparation of test solutions and a more extensive disclosure of the procedure in publications; it also suggests more flexibility in data mining, as compounds with clearly different identifiers may have been used to produce highly similar or fully identical test conditions. While this short overview is not intended as definitive guidance, it does demand more active involvement of all test developers and performers with these issues, and it calls for more transparent information disclosure concerning the preparation and use of test and control chemical solutions.",

It allows us to discern how our behavior might be perceived by future generations, and this perspective can help us understand how to improve our behavior. While it is easy to be appalled by what has been done in the past, it is more challenging to uncover the actions taking place today that will be regarded with horror in the future and, most important by far, to be a part of the necessary change.

I argue that both his analysis of the dangers involved in performing vivisection on a wide scale and the guidelines he suggested in order to limit this cruel practice remain theoretically relevant in the context of today's debate on animal rights. Schopenhauer responded to the rapid increase in the use of animals at universities by calling for a philosophical system able to address the problems of animal ethics and treating vivisection as an important moral issue. This essay is divided into three sections: first, I reconstruct the historical background of Schopenhauer's reflections on vivisection; then I present the philosophical basis of Schopenhauer's guidelines for an ethical treatment of animals in university laboratories; finally I underline the modernity of Schopenhauer's position, focussing on a few specific examples (such as the problem of performing vivisection on apes).",

Animal ethics according to Regan defines the non-human individual as an inherent value, but concedes that humans should be given precedence over animals if a situation involves a decision between life and death. Such life and death decisions relate to the fundamental structures of biological nature. To individuals these fundamental structures (the paradox of life and death) will necessarily appear absurd. The metaphysical dimension of animal ethics tries to shed light on the connections between life and death, body and mind that underly ethical discussions and searches for alternatives to the natural organisation of life.",

    "abstract": "Chemical hypersensitivity is an immunological response towards foreign substances, commonly referred to as sensitizers, which gives rise primarily to the clinical symptoms known as allergic contact dermatitis. For the purpose of mitigating risks associated with consumer products, chemicals are screened for sensitizing effects. Historically, such predictive screenings have been performed using animal models. However, due to industrial and regulatory demand, animal models for the purpose of sensitization assessment are being replaced by non-animal testing methods, a global trend that is spreading across industries and market segments. To meet this demand, the Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection (GARD) assay was developed. GARD is a novel, cell-based assay that utilizes the innate recognition of xenobiotic substances by dendritic cells, as measured by a multivariate readout of genomic biomarkers. Following cellular stimulation, chemicals are classified as sensitizers or non-sensitizers based on induced transcriptional profiles. Recently, a number of non-animal methods were comparatively evaluated by Cosmetics Europe, using a coherent and blinded test panel of reference chemicals with human and local lymph node assay data, comprising a wide range of sensitizers and non-sensitizers. The outcome of the GARD assay is presented in this paper. It was demonstrated that GARD is a highly functional assay with a predictive performance of 83% in this Cosmetics Europe dataset. The average accumulated predictive accuracy of GARD across independent datasets was 86% for skin sensitization hazard.",

    "abstract": "Contact allergy induced by certain chemicals is a common health concern, and several alternative methods have been developed to fulfill the requirements of European legislation with regard to hazard assessment of potential skin sensi&shy;tizers. However, validated methods, which provide information about the potency of skin sensitizers, are still lacking. The cell-based assay Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection (GARD), targeting key event 3, dendritic cell activation, of the skin sensitization AOP, uses gene expression profiling and a machine learning approach for the prediction of chemicals as sensitizers or non-sensitizers. Based on the GARD platform, we here expanded the assay to predict three sensitizer potency classes according to the European Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation, targeting cate&shy;gories 1A (strong), 1B (weak) and no cat (non-sensitizer). Using a random forest approach and 70 training samples, a potential biomarker signature of 52 transcripts was identified. The resulting model could predict an independent test set consisting of 18 chemicals, six from each CLP category and all previously unseen to the model, with an overall accuracy of 78%. Importantly, the model was shown to be conservative and only underestimated the class label of one chemical. Furthermore, an association of defined chemical protein reactivity with distinct biological pathways illustrates that our transcriptional approach can reveal information contributing to the understanding of underlying mechanisms in sensitization.",

    "abstract": "Food contamination due to unintentional leakage of chemicals from food contact materials (FCM) is a source of increasing concern. Since for many of these substances only limited or no toxicological data are available, the devel­opment of alternative methodologies to rapidly and cost-efficiently establish the level of safety concern is critical to ensure adequate consumer protection. Computational toxicology methods are considered the most promising solutions to cope with this data gap. In particular, mutagenicity assessment has a particular relevance and is a mandatory requirement for all substances released from plastic FCM, regardless how low migration and exposure are. In the present work, a strategy integrating a number of (Quantitative) Structure Activity Relationship ((Q)SAR) models for Ames mutagenicity predictions is proposed. A list of chemicals representing moieties likely migrating from FCM was selected to test the value of the newly defined strategy and the possibility to combine predictions given by the different algorithms was evaluated. In particular, a scheme to integrate mutagenicity estimations into a single final assessment was developed, resulting in an increased domain of applicability. In most cases, a deeper analysis of experimental data, where available, allowed fixing misclassification errors, highlighting the importance of data curation in the devel­opment, validation and application of in silico methods. The high accuracy of the strategy provided the rationale for its application for toxicologically uncharacterized chemicals. Finally, the overall strategy of integration will be automated through its implementation into a freely available software application.",

    "abstract": "The air-blood barrier is mainly composed of alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. Whereas the epithelium acts as a diffusional barrier, macrophages represent an immunological barrier, in particular for larger molecules and nanoparticles. This paper describes a new co-culture of human cell lines representing both cell types. Acquiring, culturing and maintaining primary alveolar epithelial cells presents significant logistical and technical difficulties. The recently established human alveolar epithelial lentivirus immortalized cell line, hAELVi, when grown on permeable filters, form monolayers with high functional and morphological resemblance to alveolar type I cells. To model alveolar macrophages, the human cell line THP-1 was seeded on pre-formed hAELVi monolayers. The co-culture was characterized regarding cellular morphology, viability and barrier function. Macrophages were homogenously distributed on the epithelium and could be kept in co-culture for up to 7 days. Transmission electron microscopy showed loose contact between THP-1 and hAELVi cells. When grown at air liquid interface, both cells were covered with extracellular matrix-like structure, which was absent in THP-1 mono‑culture. In co-culture with macrophages, hAELVi cells displayed similar, sometimes even higher, trans-epithelial electrical resistance than in mono-cultures. When exposed to silver and starch NPs, hAELVi mono-cultures were more tolerant to the particles than THP-1 mono-cultures. The viability in the co-culture was similar to that of hAELVi monocultures. Transport studies with sodium fluorescein in presence/absence of EDTA proved that the co‑culture acts as functional diffusion barrier. These data demonstrate that hAELVi-/THP-1 co-cultures represent a promising model for safety and permeability studies of inhaled chemicals, drugs and nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "Test methods to assess the skin sensitization potential of a substance usually use threshold criteria to dichotomize continuous experimental read-outs into yes/no conclusions. The threshold criteria are prescribed in the respective OECD test guidelines and the conclusion is used for regulatory hazard assessment, i.e., classification and labelling of the substance. We can identify a borderline range (BR) around the classification threshold within which test results are inconclusive due to a test method’s biological and technical variability. We quantified BRs in the prediction models of the non-animal test methods DPRA, LuSens and h-CLAT, and of the animal test LLNA, respectively. Depending on the size of the BR, we found that between 6% and 28% of the substances in the sets tested with these methods were considered borderline. When the results of individual non-animal test methods were combined into integrated testing strategies (ITS), borderline test results of individual tests also affected the overall assessment of the skin sensitization potential of the testing strategy. This was analyzed for the 2-out-of-3 ITS: Four out of 40 substances (10%) were con&shy;sidered borderline. Based on our findings we propose expanding the standard binary classification of substances into “positive”/“negative” or “hazardous”/“non-hazardous” by adding a “borderline” or “inconclusive” alert for cases where test results fall within the borderline range.",

    "abstract": "Under the new Directive 2010/63/EU, member states have to publish non-technical summaries (NTS) of the projects involving animals that they authorise. These summaries must include information on the objectives of the project including the predicted harm and benefits and the number and types of animals to be used. Summaries should also demonstrate compliance with the 3Rs. The intention was that NTS would help increase the transparency of animal research in the EU. In this article, we review the status of the publication of NTS across member states and give some general observations on publication speed, identification, accessibility and quality. We also review in more detail the quality of reporting in a selection of NTS from Germany and the UK. We consistently found that NTS from Germany and the UK were deficient in their description of what is being done to the animals and what they might experience as a result. Using examples taken from specific NTS we highlight what we view to be good and bad examples to assist member states and researchers in producing better NTS in the future. The NTS can also be an important tool in sharing of best practice in the 3Rs and the avoidance of duplicative animal testing. For this to happen, however, member states need to publish timely, ensure that NTS are accurate and, ideally, there needs to be some centralisation of the NTS.",

    "abstract": "In vitro approaches to address key steps of chemical-induced skin sensitization have been developed, but there is uncertainty how keratinocytes, which play a crucial role not only regarding xenobiotic metabolism but also skin inflammation, impact on a chemical’s potential and potency to activate dendritic cells. We investigated these aspects by coculturing THP-1 cells, as surrogate dendritic cells, with HaCaT keratinocytes. We tested our HaCaT/THP-1 model with a set of 14 sensitizers, containing 7 prohaptens, and 10 non-sensitizers. Compared to exposing THP-1 alone, coculturing resulted in up to 3.1-fold enhanced maximal CD86 and/or CD54 upregulation on THP-1, and improved concentration-dependency. All 14 sensitizers were found positive for CD86 and/or CD54 upregulation based on Δ mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ≥ 10 for CD86 and ΔMFI ≥ 50 for CD54. Only 1 of 10 non-sensitizers was false-positive. Remarkably, coculture with HaCaT keratinocytes improved the rank correlation of the estimated minimum chemical concentrations inducing a positive response in vitro with in vivo data on sensitization potency, especially for CD54 (Spearman: r = 0.739, p = 0.006; CD86: r = 0.571, p = 0.041). These promising data suggest that the coculture model has the potential to support the prediction of sensitization potency based on in vitro data.",

    "abstract": "The maximal chemical concentration that causes an acceptably small or no effect in an organism or isolated cells is an often-sought-after value in toxicology. Existing approaches to derive this value have raised several concerns; thus, it is often chosen case-by-case based on personal experience. To overcome this ambiguity, we propose an approach for choosing the non-toxic concentration (NtC) of a chemical in a rational, tractable way. We developed an algorithm that identifies the highest chemical concentration that causes no more than 10% effect (≤ EC10) including the modeled 95% confidence intervals and considering each of the measured biological replicates; and whose toxicity is not significantly different from no effect. The developed algorithm was validated in two steps: by comparing its results with measured and modeled data for 91 dose-response experiments with fish cell lines and/or zebrafish embryos; and by measuring actual effects caused by NtCs in a separate set of experiments using a fish cell line and zebrafish embryos. The algorithm provided an NtC that is more protective than NOEC (no-observed-effect-concentration), NEC (modeled no-effect concentration), EC10 and BMD (benchmark dose). Despite focusing on small-scale bioassays here, this study indicates that the NtC algorithm could be used in various systems. Its application to the survival of zebrafish embryos and to metabolic activity in cell lines showed that NtCs can be applied to different effect measure&shy;ments, time points, and levels of biological organization. The algorithm is available as Matlab and R source code, and as a free, user-friendly online application.",

    "abstract": "The implantation of chondrocyte-laden hydrogels is a promising cartilage repair strategy. Chondrocytes can be spa&shy;tially positioned in hydrogels and thus in defects, while current clinical cell therapies introduce chondrocytes in the defect depth. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of spatial chondrocyte distribution on the reparative process. To reduce animal experiments, an ex vivo osteochondral plug model was used and evaluated. The role of the delivered and endogenous cells in the repair process was investigated.Full thickness cartilage defects were created in equine osteochondral plugs. Defects were filled with (A) chondrocytes at the bottom of the defect, covered with a cell-free hydrogel, (B) chondrocytes homogeneously encapsulated in a hydrogel, and (C, D) combinations of A and B with different cell densities. Plugs were cultured for up to 57 days, after which the cartilage and repair tissues were characterized and compared to baseline samples. Additionally, at day 21, the origin of cells in the repair tissue was evaluated.Best outcomes were obtained with conditions C and D, which resulted in well-integrated cartilage-like tissue that com&shy;pletely filled the defect, regardless of the initial cell density. A critical role of the spatial chondrocyte distribution in the repair process was observed. Moreover, the osteochondral plugs stimulated cartilage formation in the hydrogels when cultured in the defects. The resulting repair tissue originated from the delivered cells.These findings confirm the potential of the osteochondral plug model for the optimization of the composition of cartilage implants and for studying repair mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Although the rehoming of laboratory dogs has gained popularity, a scientific evaluation of the process is lacking. The behavior of 145 laboratory beagles was tested before leaving a research facility (Test 1). The new owners were then surveyed using a standardized telephone interview 1 week (n = 143) and 12 weeks (n = 126) after adoption. The behavior test was repeated with 68 dogs in their new homes 6 weeks after adoption (Test 2). The predictive power of Test 1 or Interview 1 on Test 2 or Interview 2, respectively, as well as the relevance of various factors was analyzed. We found no significant differences between Tests 1 and 2 regarding the behavior reactions. However, body language scores and heart rates changed significantly, indicating a more relaxed state of the dogs in their new homes. The interviews revealed a significant change toward desired behavior in most dogs within the 11 week period (p &lt; 0.0001). The main behavior problems included separation problems (28%; n = 126), destroying objects (24%), and not being housebroken (39%). Owners of 9 dogs returned the animals, resulting in a rehoming success rate of 94%. Test 1 revealed a significant age effect (p = 0.0066), with younger and older dogs reaching higher scores than dogs who were approximately 2 years old. Dogs that had been born and reared in the research facility scored higher than dogs that had originally been acquired from a commercial breeder (p = 0.0257). The predictive power of Test 1 on Test 2 or Interview 1 on Interview 2 was moderate to low, respectively. Altogether, rehoming of laboratory dogs is a valuable alternative to euthanasia.",

Here, we explored the use of cardinal ethical weights for clinical signs and symptoms in rodents by conducting trade-off interviews with members of Swedish Animal Ethics Committees in order to derive such weights for nine typical clinical signs of toxicity. The participants interviewed represent researchers, politically nominated political nominees and representatives of animal welfare organizations. We observed no statistically significant differences between these groups with respect to the magnitude of the ethical weights assigned, though the political nominees tended to assign lower weights. Overall, hunched posture was considered the most severe clinical sign and body weight loss the least severe. The ethical weights assigned varied considerably between individuals, from zero to infinite value, indicating discrepancies in prioritization of reduction and refinement. Cardinal ethical weights may be utilized to include both animal welfare refinement and reduction of animal use in designing as well as in retrospective assessment of animal experiments. Such weights may also be used to estimate ethical costs of animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present ring trial was to test whether two new methodological approaches for the in vitro classification of eye irritating chemicals can be reliably transferred from the developers’ laboratories to other sites. Both test methods are based on the well-established open source reconstructed 3D hemicornea models. In the first approach, the initial depth of injury after chemical treatment in the hemicornea model is derived from the quantitative analysis of histological sections. In the second approach, tissue viability, as a measure for corneal damage after chemical treatment, is analyzed separately for epithelium and stroma of the hemicornea model. The three independent laboratories that participated in the ring trial produced their own hemicornea models according to the test producer’s instructions, thus supporting the open source concept. A total of 9 chemicals with different physicochemical and eye-irritating properties were tested to assess the between-laboratory reproducibility (BLR), the predictive performance, as well as possible limitations of the test systems. The BLR was 62.5% for the first and 100% for the second method. Both methods enabled to discriminate Cat. 1 chemicals from all non-Cat. 1 substances, which qualifies them to be used in a top-down approach. However, the selectivity between No Cat. and Cat. 2 chemicals still needs optimization.",

    "abstract": "Progress in developing new tools, assays, and approaches to assess human hazard and health risk provides an opportunity to re-evaluate the necessity of dog studies for the safety evaluation of agrochemicals. A workshop was held where participants discussed the strengths and limitations of past use of dogs for pesticide evaluations and registrations. Opportunities were identified to support alternative approaches to answer human safety questions without performing the required 90-day dog study. Development of a decision tree for determining when the dog study might not be necessary to inform pesticide safety and risk assessment was proposed. Such a process will require global regulatory authority participation to lead to its acceptance. The identification of unique effects in dogs that are not identified in rodents will need further evaluation and determination of their relevance to humans. The establishment of in vitro and in silico approaches that can provide critical data on relative species sensitivity and human relevance will be an important tool to advance the decision process. Promising novel tools including in vitro comparative metabolism studies, in silico models, and high-throughput assays able to identify metabolites and mechanisms of action leading to development of adverse outcome pathways will need further development. To replace or eliminate the 90-day dog study, a collaborative, multidisciplinary, international effort that transcends organizations and regulatory agencies will be needed in order to develop guidance on when the study would not be necessary for human safety and risk assessment.",

Current in vitro-in silico models for testing proarrhythmic liabilities, using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM), provide an opportunity to address this data gap. These methods are still low- to medium-throughput and not suitable for testing the tens of thousands of chemicals in commerce. We hypothesized that combining high-throughput population-based in vitro testing in hiPSC-CMs with a fully in silico data analysis workflow can offer sensitive and specific predictions of proarrhythmic potential. We calibrated the model with a published hiPSC-CM dataset of drugs known to be positive or negative for proarrhythmia and tested its performance using internal cross-validation and external validation. Additionally, we used computational down-sampling to examine three study designs for hiPSC-CM data: one replicate of one donor, five replicates of one donor, and one replicate of a population of five donors. We found that the population of five donors had the best performance for predicting proarrhythmic potential. The resulting model was then applied to predict the proarrhythmic potential of environmental chemicals, additionally characterizing risk through margin of exposure (MOE) calculations. Out of over 900 environmental chemicals tested, over 150 were predicted to have proarrhythmic potential, but only seven chemicals have MOE &lt; 1.

To comprehensively describe and understand the pathways through which pollutant exposure leads to cardiotoxicity, a systematic mapping review of the available toxicological evidence is needed. This protocol outlines a step-by-step framework for conducting this review. Using the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Health Assessment and Translation (HAT) approach for conducting toxicological systematic reviews, we selected 362 out of 8111 in vitro (17%), in vivo (67%), and combined (16%) studies for 129 potential cardiotoxic environmental pollutants, including heavy metals (29%), air pollutants (16%), pesticides (27%), and other chemicals (28%). The internal validity of included studies is being assessed with HAT and SYRCLE Risk of Bias tools. Tabular templates are being used to extract key study elements regarding study setup, methodology, techniques, and (qualitative and quantitative) outcomes. Subsequent synthesis will consist of an explorative meta-analysis of possible pollutant-related cardiotoxicity. Evidence maps and interactive knowledge graphs will illustrate evidence streams, cardiotoxic effects and associated quality of evidence, helping researchers and regulators to efficiently identify pollutants of interest. The evidence will be integrated in novel Adverse Outcome Pathways to facilitate regulatory acceptance of non-animal methods for cardiotoxicity testing. The current article describes the progress of the steps made in the systematic mapping review process. Plain language summaryHeart disease is a leading global cause of death. Recent research indicates that certain environmental chemicals can worsen heart problems. We’re conducting a rigorous review of scientific studies to understand how these chemicals affect the heart. This will inform policymakers and promote non-animal testing methods for cardiotoxicity by providing a clear overview of the toxicological evidence. We have reviewed over 8,000 articles and focused on 362 studies about 129 chemicals, including heavy metals, air pollutants and pesticides, and their effects on the heart. The current manuscript describes the used methods and steps made in this process. The outcome of our systematic review of these 362 articles will be a comprehensive database that will aid the development of alternative testing methods for cardiotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Besides being an energy store, adipose tissue is an endocrine organ closely associated with the vascular system. Human relevant in vitro models are needed to study adipose tissue and related diseases. Vasculature plays a central role in the development and inhibition of adipose tissue-related diseases. Here, an adipocyte culture was established from hASC (human adipose stromal cells), and a vascularized adipose tissue model was established from hASC and HUVEC (human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells) co-culture, utilizing the same differentiation procedure. Comparing these models allowed analysis of the effect of vascularization on adipocytes. Both models were characterized on gene (adipocyte and vasculature-related), protein (von Willebrand factor, collagen IV, CD140b and CD144, secretion of leptin, adiponectin and FABP4), and functional (triglyceride accumulation, glucose uptake, and lipolysis) levels. Additionally, the vascularized adipose tissue model was exposed to chemicals with known effects on adipogenesis and angiogenesis (rosiglitazone, chlorpyrifos, prochloraz, mancozeb, butylparaben, 15-deoxy- Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2, bisphenol A, bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, tributyltin chloride) to compare their effects to the literature. The in vitro vascularized adipose tissue model demonstrated the presence of functional adipocytes and an extensive vascular network, displaying relevant gene and protein markers. Insulin induced glucose uptake, inhibited lipolysis, and influenced vasculature-related genes. The presence of vasculature led to a faster lipolysis inhibition by insulin and modulated responses to chemicals. This novel, thoroughly characterized, vascularized adipose tissue model is a promising new tool for studying adipose tissue as well as the effects of chemicals on adipogenesis and angiogenesis in adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Testing chemicals for fish acute toxicity is a legal requirement in many countries as part of environmental risk assessment. To reduce the number of fish used, substantial efforts have been focused on alternative approaches. Prominently, the cell viability assay with the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) gill cell line, RTgill-W1, has proven to be highly predictive and robust. Like the gills, the intestine is considered a major site of chemical uptake and biotransformation, but, in contrast to the gills, it is expected to be exposed to more hydrophobic chemicals, which enter the fish via food. In the present study, we therefore aimed to extend the cell bioassay to the rainbow trout epithelial cell line from intestine, RTgutGC. Using 16 hydrophobic and volatile chemicals from the fragrance palette, we show that also the RTgutGC cell line can be used to predict fish acute toxicity of chemicals and yields intra-laboratory variability in line with other bioassays. By comparing the RTgutGC toxicity to a study employing the RTgill-W1 assay on the same group of chemicals, a fragrance-specific rela­tionship was established that reflects an almost perfect 1:1 relationship between in vitro and in vivo toxicity results. Thus, both cell lines can be used to predict fish acute toxicity, either by extrapolating based on the in vivo-in vitro relationship or by taking the in vitro results at face value. We moreover demonstrate the derivation of non-toxic concentrations for down­stream applications that rely on a healthy cell state, such as the assessment of biotransformation or chemical transfer.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving therapy for critically ill patients, alleviating the work of breathing and sup­porting adequate gas exchange. However, mechanical ventilation can cause ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) by baro/volu- and atelectrauma, lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and substantially increase mortality. There is a need for specific biomarkers and novel research platforms for VILI/ARDS research to study these detrimental disorders and seek ways to avoid or prevent them. Previous in vitro studies on bronchial epithelium, cultured in air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions, have generally utilized static or constant pressure. We have developed a Cyclical Pressure ALI Device (CPAD) that enables cyclical stress on ALI cultured human bronchial cells with the aim of mimicking the effects of mechanical ventilation. Using CPAD we were able to analyze differentially expressed VILI/ARDS and innate immunity associated genes along with increased expression of associated proteins. CPAD provides an easy and accessible way to analyze functional and phenotypic changes that occur during VILI and may provide a platform for future drug testing.",

    "abstract": "The ability of non-animal methods to correctly predict the outcome of in vivo testing in repeated applications is referred to as precision. Due to dichotomizing continuous read-outs into discrete “positive/negative” hazard data, non-animal methods can reveal discordant classifications if results are sufficiently close to a defined classification threshold. This paper explores the impact of precision uncertainty on the predictive accuracy of non-animal methods. Using selected non-animal methods for assessing skin sensitization hazard as case study examples, we explore the impact of precision uncertainty separately and in combination with uncertainty due to varying composition and size of experimental samples. Our results underline that discrete numbers on a non-animal method’s sensitivity, specificity, and concordance are of limited value for evaluation of its predictivity. Instead, information on the variability and the upper and lower limits of accuracy metrics should be provided to ensure a transparent assessment of a testing method’s predictivity, and to allow for a meaningful comparison of the predictivity of a non-animal method with that of an animal test.",

However, the biological effects elicited by machine perfusion are largely unknown, and a sub­stantial number of animal studies are presently focused on this topic. The aim of the present study was to describe a model of DCD based on ex-situ perfusion of liver grafts derived from animals used for food production.Procurement took place within a slaughterhouse facility. After cold storage, the liver grafts were perfused with autologous blood-enriched perfusion fluid in a clinically fashioned closed circuit normothermic MP (NMP). During the rewarming phase, temperature and flows were progressively increased to reach target values. Perfusate and tissue samples were collected to assess NMP functionality. Grafts were classified as transplantable (LT-G) or not (nLT-G) according to clinical criteria, and viability was confirmed by histopathological analysis.Four grafts were classified as LT-G and three as nLT-G at the end of NMP. Histology confirmed the absence of major damage in LT-G, while nLT-G presented diffuse necrosis. Interestingly, an early impairment of the hepatocyte respiratory chain, leading to cell necrosis and graft non-viability, was documented in nLT-G for the first time. These parameters, together with indocyanine-green dye and citrate clearance could contribute to graft evaluation in clinical settings. The model provides a promising and reproducible method to replace dedicated experimental animals in research on machine perfusion of DCD grafts in line with the 3Rs principles",

Therefore, six compounds with presumably narcotic or unknown mode of action, and for which a previous meta-analysis had indicated weaker sensitivity, were experimentally analyzed for their fish embryo acute toxicity and exposure concentrations were monitored. The data indicated that ZFET and AFT for the selected compounds had similar sensitivity and differences were in the range of species differences of the AFT.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing need to develop alternatives to animal testing to derive biokinetic data for evaluating both efficacy and safety of chemicals. One such alternative is bottom-up physiologically-based biokinetic (PBK) modeling, which requires only in vitro data. The primary objective of this study was to develop and validate bottom-up PBK models of 3 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, and pitavastatin. Bottom-up PBK models were built using the Simcyp® sim­ulator by incorporating in vitro transporter and metabolism data (Vmax, Jmax, Km, CLint) obtained from the literature and proteomics-based scaling factors to account for differences in transporter expression between in vitro systems and in vivo organs. Simulations were performed for single intravenous, single oral, and multiple oral doses of these chemicals. The results showed that our bottom-up models predicted systemic exposure (AUC0h-t), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), plasma clearance, and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) within two-fold of the observed data, with the exception of parameters associated with multiple oral pitavastatin dosing and single oral fluvastatin dosing. Additional middle-out simulations were performed using animal distribution data to inform tissue-to-plasma equilibrium distribution ratios for rosuvastatin and pitavastatin. This improved the predicted plasma-concentration time profiles but did not significantly alter the predicted biokinetic parameters. Our study demonstrates that quantitative proteomics-based mechanistic in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) can account for downregulation of transporters in culture and predict whole organ clearance without empirical scaling. Hence, bottom-up PBK modeling incorporating mechanistic IVIVE could be a viable alternative to animal testing in predicting human biokinetics.",

GenRA assists researchers in identifying source analogues, evaluating their validity and making predictions of in vivo toxicity effects for a target substance. Predictions are presented as binary outcomes reflecting the presence or absence of toxicity together with quantitative measures of uncertainty. The approach allows users to identify analogues in different ways, quickly assess the availability of relevant in vivo data for those analogues, and visualize these in a data matrix to evaluate the consistency and concordance of the available experimental data for those analogues before making a GenRA prediction. Predic­tions can be exported into a tab-separated value (TSV) or Excel file for additional review and analysis (e.g., doses of analogues associated with production of toxic effects).

Reproducibility of phenotypic responses was evaluated across batches and time. iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes exhibited reproducible donor-specific differences in baseline function and drug-induced effects.

Herein, we present a fast and simple technique for the construction of 3D dermal fibroblasts (3D-DFs) without exogenous scaffolds.

The 3D-DF-derived extracellular matrix can serve for 3D culturing of other cells. A gap closure assay was performed with the 3D-DFs to represent a 3D-wounded dermal model. Interestingly, the multilayered structure of the 3D-DFs could be regenerated after wounding even when cultured in the absence of ascorbic acid. Moreover, skin grafting using the 3D-DFs was demonstrated in vitro using wounded in vitro human full-thickness skin models.

In the present study, a strategy based on non-animal approaches was developed to prioritize non-evaluated printed paper and board food contact material (FCM) substances for further in-depth safety evaluation. Within the strategy, focus was put on genotoxicity, a key toxicological endpoint when evaluating safety. By combining in silico predictions with existing in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity data from publicly available literature sources and results from in vitro gene mutation experiments, the 106 study substances could all be assigned to one of the four priority classes (ranging from low to very high concern). Importantly, 19 substances were considered of very high concern due to in vivo genotoxicity. Five of these are furthermore listed as a Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), in addition to demonstrating physicochemical properties linked to a high migration potential as well as oral bioavailability and being used in primary food packaging materials. The current animal-free strategy proved useful for the priority ranking of printed paper and board FCM substances, but it can also be considered to prioritize other substances of emerging concern.",

Current in vivo test methods for assessing DNT require the use of large numbers of laboratory animals. Most alternative testing methods monitor readily quantifiable toxicological endpoints in cell culture, whereas the formation of a functional brain requires precisely timed navigation of axons within a complex tissue environment. We address this complexity by monitoring defects in axonal navigation of pioneer axons of intact locust embryos after exposure to chemicals. Embryos develop in serum-free culture with test chemicals, followed by immunolabeling of pioneer neurons. Defects in axon elongation of pioneer axons are quantified in concentration-response curves and compared to the general viability of the embryo, as measured by a resazurin assay. We show that selected chemical compounds interfering with calcium signaling or cytoskeletal organization, and the ref­erence developmental neurotoxicant rotenone, can be classified as DNT positive. The pesticide rotenone inhibits pioneer neuron elongation with a lower IC50 than viability. The rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 can partially rescue outgrowth inhi­bition, supporting the classification of rotenone as a specific DNT positive compound. Since mechanisms of axonal guidance, such as growth cone navigation along molecular semaphorin gradients are conserved between locust and mammalian nervous systems, we will further explore the potential of this invertebrate preparation as an assay, including a prediction model, for testing the DNT potential of chemicals in humans.",

    "abstract": "Chemical UV filters are frequently applied as active ingredients in sunscreens to protect from detrimental effects of UV radiation. Regardless, many of these compounds are not well characterized concerning their capacity to counteract UV induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intracellular ROS release is an early event upon UV exposure and a crucial trigger of reaction cascades that may provoke adverse effects both in the short- and long-term. We report a strategy to assess the capacity of UV filters (ecamsule, oxybenzone, and menthyl anthranilate) to counteract UVA/UVB stress in the human keratinocyte HaCaT and the wildtype Fibs E6/E7 fibroblast cell lines. The reduction of ROS levels was taken as primary endpoint. The effect of treatment on the cells’ metabolic activity was analyzed as an indicator of viability post-treatment to investigate potential immediate and late (photo)toxicity. Additionally, the compounds’ antioxidative capacity was investigated using an azo-based radical generator. Established antioxidants, quercetin and N-acetylcysteine, were used as controls. Data showed remarkable differences in the mode of action of the chemical UV filters, ranging from protective to pro-oxidative properties, indicating the need for more detailed mode of action-based investigations. Cer­tainly, additional consideration and evaluation will be necessary to further extrapolate these in vitro data for the assessment of in vivo exposure situations. However, the presented approach enables parallel investigations of photoprotective and phototoxic effects of UV filters, and thus can complement and extend existing in vitro testing strategies.",

A full ban or total replacement of this in vivo test has been postponed because of the fear that current chemical-based detection methods could miss a new emerging toxin. In order to fully replace the mouse bioassay, more efforts are needed in the search for functional assays with specific endpoints. Gene expression elicited by diarrheic shellfish poisons (DSP) in Caco-2 cells allowed us to determine three “DSP profiles”, i.e., OA/DTX, AZA-YTX, and PTX profiles. Twelve marker genes were selected to represent the three profiles. qRT-PCR is relatively cheap and easy, and although its multiplex capacity is limited to 5 genes, this was sufficient to show the three expected profiles. The use of the multiplex mag­netic bead-based assay was an even better alternative, allowing the detection of all 12 selected marker genes and 2 reference genes, and resulting in clear profiles with for some genes even higher induction factors than obtained by qRT-PCR. When analyzing blank and contaminated shellfish samples with the multiplex magnetic bead-based assay, the contaminated samples could easily be distinguished from the blank samples, and showed the expected profiles. This work is one step further towards the final replacement of the mouse bioassay. We suggest to combine the neuro-2a bioassay for screening with detection by analytical chemical analyses and with the multiplex magnetic bead-based assay for con­firmation of known and unknown toxins.",

In spite of the 550 tons produced each year in Europe alone, no effective dose limit recommendations are established and the overall risks connected to IONs are still debated. The incorporation of IONs in daily life raises a concern about their effects on the environment, on living organisms, and on human health. In this study, we used freshwater planarians to assess the nanoecotoxicity of IONs. Planarians are free-living invertebrates known for their astonishing regenerative ability. Because of their sensitivity to toxicants, they are often used to determine the effects of toxic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic environmental compounds with an approach in line with the 3Rs (Reduce, Refine, Replace) principle. Planarians were exposed to IONs at concentrations up to 1 mg/ml and their effects were evaluated at the behavioral, morphofunctional, and molecular levels, with a special emphasis on the regeneration process. Our results indicate that IONs did not affect the stem cell population dynamics, nor did they induce substantial changes in either homeostatic or regenerating planarians. As positive controls, gold nanoparticles coated with the pro-apoptotic anti-cancer drug hexadecylmethylammonium bromide and highly concentrated polystyrene nanoparticles were used; these all elicited toxic effects. Therefore, we conclude that IONs at environmental concen­trations are safe for planarians, and that the planarian is a powerful model system that can replace vertebrate animal models in nanoecotoxicology research and for nanoecotoxicology studies.",

The model should mimic a variety of conditions, such as in vivo hemodynamics and native arterial structure and characteristics. The aim of this study was to develop an ex vivo aneurysm model by stiffening vessel walls to be used to assess treatment strategies. Porcine carotid arteries from slaughterhouse animals were used to evaluate the acute effect of different concentrations of Rose Bengal on vessel distensibility. Rose Bengal is a sono-sensitive compound that is activated by several ultrasound frequencies, resulting in stiffening of the treated arteries; the most effective combination of concentration and frequency was determined. In a pulsatile ex vivo vascular bioreactor, treated and control porcine carotid arteries were subjected to physiological conditions for 10 days. Treated arteries showed increased mean pressure and decreased pulsatility compared to controls. Changes in vessel morphology and a significant increase of distal diameter were observed in the treated arteries but not in the controls. His­tology revealed distal dissection-like lesions and proximal aneurysm-like structure in the treated arteries. Finally, a stent graft was deployed and cultured in one treated artery, demonstrating the feasibility of testing endovascular devices in the model. In conclusion, we developed an ex vivo model reproducing the onset of aneurysm formation. This represents a promising tool for early stage device testing, thereby reducing the need for animal studies.",

In this study, we developed a 3-dimensional synovial membrane model made of either human primary synovial cell suspensions or a mix of primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes and CD14+ mononuclear cells. We analyzed the composition of the mature micromasses by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry and showed that the outer surface forms a lining layer consisting of fibroblast-like and macrophage-like cells, reflecting the in vivo naïve synovial membrane. To model the affected synovial membrane in rheu­matoid arthritis (RA), micromasses were exposed to the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which led to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and production, and to hyperplasia of the membrane. To recreate the synovial membrane in osteoarthritis (OA), the micromasses were exposed to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which led to fibrosis-like changes of the membrane, including increased alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and increased expression of fibrosis-related genes PLOD2 and COL1A1. Interestingly, the macrophages in the micromasses showed phenotypic plasticity, as prolonged TNF-α or TGF-β stimulation strongly reduced the occurrence of CD163+ M2-like macrophages. We show the plasticity of the micromasses as a synovial model for studying RA and OA pathology and propose that the synovial lining micromass system can be a good alternative for drug testing.",

The 3D in vitro model cultured at the air liquid interface consists of alveolar type II epithelial cells (A549), endothelial cells (EA.hy926), macrophage-like cells (PMA-differentiated THP-1), and dendritic-like cells (non-differentiated THP-1). This alveolar model was exposed apically to nebulized chemical respiratory sensitizers (phthalic anhydride (PA) and trimellitic anhydride (TMA)) or to irritants (methyl salicylate (MeSa) and acrolein (Acr)) at concentrations inducing 25% cytotoxicity. The exposure to respiratory sensitizers induced den­dritic-like cell activation and a specific cytokine release pattern, while exposure to irritants did not. In addition, the cell surface marker OX40L was found to identify dendritic-like cell activation by high molecular weight allergens. With this in vitro model we can postulate a set of promising markers that allow the discrimination of chemical respiratory sensitizers from irritants.",

Individually, these cell lines are used to address key events 2 and 3 of the skin sensitization adverse outcome pathway (AOP). Their exposure in coculture was found to have the potential to increase their response to sensitizing chemicals, enable the detection of pro-haptens, and support the identification of skin sensi­tization potency. The present study was undertaken to assess the predictive capacity of COCAT of both skin sensitization hazard and potency and to assess the intra-laboratory reproducibility of COCAT based on the blind testing of chem­icals. Results showed a reproducibility between runs of 80% for 15 coded chemicals. Skin sensitization hazard prediction had 100% sensitivity (9/9), 75% specificity (3/4), and 92.3% accuracy (12/13), while the tests of two chemicals were inconclusive. Including additional chemicals tested during the optimization phase in addition to the blind tested chemicals, the skin sensitization UN GHS sub-categories were correctly predicted for 85.7% (12/14) sub-category 1A chemicals, 83.3% (10/12) sub-category 1B chemicals, and 92.3% (12/13) no category chemicals, resulting in an overall accuracy of 87.4% (34/39). The present study shows the COCAT to be a promising method for the identification of skin sensiti­zation hazard and potency sub-categorization according to the UN GHS classification.",

However, systematic and quantitative studies of the absorption of molecules are quite limited due to a lack of reliable experimental models able to mimic human in vivo responses. In this work, we present an in vitro perfused model of the small intestinal barrier using a 3D reconstructed intestinal epithelium integrated into a fluid-dynamic biore­actor (MIVO®) resembling the physiological stimuli of the intestinal environment. This platform was investigated in both healthy and induced pathological conditions by monitoring the absorption of two non-metabolized sugars, lactulose and mannitol, frequently used as indicators of intestinal barrier dysfunctions. In healthy conditions, an in vivo-like plateau of the percentage of absorbed sugars was reached, where mannitol absorption was much greater than lactulose absorption. Moreover, a model of pathologically altered intestinal permeability was generated by depleting extracellular Ca2+, using a calcium-specific chelator. After calcium depletion, the pattern of sugar passage observed under pathological conditions was reversed only in dynamic conditions in the MIVO® chamber, due to the dynamic fluid flow beneath the membrane, but not in static conditions. Therefore, the combination of the MIVO® with the EpiIntestinal™ platform can rep­resent a reliable in vitro model to study the passage of molecules across the healthy or pathological small intestinal barrier by discriminating the two main mechanisms of intestinal absorption.",

    "abstract": "The (developmental) neurotoxicity hazard is still unknown for most chemicals. Establishing a test battery covering most of the relevant adverse outcome pathways may close this gap without requiring a huge animal experimentation program. Ideally, each of the assays would cover multiple mechanisms of toxicity. One candidate test is the human LUHMES cell-based NeuriTox test. To evaluate its readiness for larger-scale testing, a proof of concept library, assembled by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP), was screened. Out of the 75 unique compounds, seven were defined as specifically neurotoxic after the hit-confirmation phase and ten further compounds were generally cytotoxic within the concentration range of up to 20 μM. As complementary approach, the library was screened in the PeriTox test, which identifies toxicants affecting the human peripheral nervous system. Of the eight PeriTox hits, five were similar to the NeuriTox hits: rotenone, colchicine, diethylstilbestrol, berberine chloride, and valinomycin. The unique NeuriTox hit, methyl-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), is known from in vivo studies to affect only dopaminergic neurons (which LUHMES cells are). Conversely, the known peripheral neurotoxicant acrylamide was picked up in the PeriTox, but not in the NeuriTox assay. All of the five common hits had also been identified in the published neural crest migration (cMINC) assay, while none of them emerged as a cardiotoxicant in a previous screen using the same library. These comparative data suggest that complementary in vitro tests can pick up a broad range of toxicants, and that multiple test results might help to predict organ specificity patterns.",

The objective of the analysis was the replacement of in vivo titration of cattle challenge virus by in vitro titration. Using data from 32 in vivo titration experiments together with the in vitro titration results of the same samples obtained by plaque count on primary lamb or pig kidney cells, as well as data from the virus isolation control chart used in the laboratory, we show that the reproducibility of the in vitro titration is much higher than that of the in vivo titration. The titer on primary kidney cells was on average 1.4 log10 higher than the titer determined by titration in cattle tongue (PFU/ml compared to bovine ID50/ml), but the difference varied among different strains. The study also shows that the probability of infection in cattle tongue is high even when a lower challenge dose is used, which makes the variability between strains less important. Based on these results, we propose to change the standard dose for cattle challenge from 104 bovine ID50 to 105.4 PFU, and to replace the in vivo cattle tongue titration method with the in vitro titration method.",

All PS extracts induced concentration-dependent PDT as quantified in the ZET and this potency is associated with their 3-5 ring PAH content. In contrast and as expected, GTL products did not induce any effect in the ZET. The potencies obtained in the ZET correlated with those previously reported for the embryonic stem cell test (EST) (R2 = 0.61), while the correlation with potencies reported in in vivo studies was higher for the EST (R2 = 0.85) than the ZET (R2 = 0.69). Combining the results of the ZET with those previously reported for the EST (Kamelia et al., 2017), the aryl hydrocarbon (AhR) CALUX assay (Kamelia et al., 2018), and the PAH content, ranked and clustered the test compounds in line with their in vivo potencies and chemical characteristics. Our findings indicate that the ZET does not outperform the EST as a stand-alone assay for testing PDT of PS, but confirm the hypothesis that PAHs are the major inducers of PDT by some PS, while they also indicate that the ZET is a useful addition to a battery of in vitro tests able to predict the in vivo PDT of PS.",

However, most studies do not evaluate the plausibility of score sheets and do not attempt to reduce the suffering of animals by determining earlier and, therefore, more humane endpoints. The present study uses data from BALB/cANCrl mice after bile duct ligation to retrospectively analyze which score sheet criteria are informative to determine humane endpoints. The performance of each single as well as com­binations of multiple animal welfare parameters was analyzed by a Cox proportional-hazards model followed by Harrell’s concordance index. The addition of behavioral parameters, such as burrowing activity, helped to define a more humane early endpoint for euthanizing these animals. Using this approach, we determined that a body weight loss of 10-20% combined with a reduction of burrowing activity by more than 79.4% was able to predict that these animals would die within two days. Thus, this approach successfully determined an earlier humane endpoint and will reduce the suffering of animals in future experiments. Application of such an approach or similar methods can contribute to the refinement of various animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "Significant efforts are currently being made to move toxicity testing from animal experimentation towards human-relevant, mechanism-based approaches. In this context, the identification of the molecular target(s) responsible for mechanisms of action is an essential step. Inspired by the recent concept of polypharmacology (the ability of drugs to interact with mul­tiple targets), we argue that whole proteome virtual screening may become a breakthrough tool in toxicology as it reflects the true complexity of chemical-biological interactions. We investigated the value of performing ligand-protein binding prediction screening across the full proteome to identify new mechanisms of action for food chemicals. We applied the new approach to make a broader comparison between bisphenol A (BPA) (food-packaging chemical) and the endog­enous estrogen 17β-estradiol (EST). Applying a novel, high-throughput ligand-protein binding prediction tool (BioGPS) using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud (to speed-up the calculation), we investigated the value of performing in silico screening across the full proteome (all human and rodent x-ray protein structures available in the Protein Data Bank). The strong correlation between in silico predictions and available in vitro data demonstrated the high predictive power of the method. The most striking result was that BPA was predicted to bind to many more proteins than previously described, most of which also appear to bind EST. Our findings provide a new and unprecedented insight into the complexity of chemical-protein interactions, highlighting the binding promiscuity of BPA and its broad binding similarity to the female sex hormone, EST.",

    "abstract": "Since the EU banned animal testing for cosmetic products and ingredients in 2013, many defined approaches (DA) for skin sensitization assessment have been developed. Machine learning models were shown to be effective in DAs, but the predictivity might be affected by data imbalance (i.e., more sensitizers than non-sensitizers) and limited information in the databases. To improve the predictivity of DAs, we attempted to apply data-rebalancing ensemble learning (bagging with support vector machine (SVM)) and a novel and comprehensive Cosmetics Europe database. For predicting human hazard and three-class potency, 12 models were built for each using a training set of 96 sub­stances and a test set of 32 substances from the database. The model that predicted hazard with the highest accuracy (90.63% for the test set and 88.54% for the training set, named hazard-DA) used SVM-bagging with combinations of all variables (V6), while the model that predicted potency with the highest accuracy (68.75% for the test set and 82.29% for the training set, named potency-DA) used SVM alone. Both DAs showed better performance than LLNA and other machine learning-based DAs, and the potency-DA provided more in-depth assessment. These findings indicate that SVM-bagging-based DAs provide enhanced predictivity for hazard assessment by further data rebalancing. Meanwhile, the effect of imbalanced data might be offset by more detailed categorization of sensitizers for potency assessment, thus SVM-based DA without bagging could provide sufficient predictivity. The improved DAs in this study could be promising tools for skin sensitization assessment without animal testing.",

    "abstract": "Current efforts in chemical safety are focused on utilizing human in vitro or alternatives to animal data in a bio­logical pathway context. However, it remains unclear how biological pathways, and toxicology data developed in that context, can be used to quantitatively facilitate decision-making. The objective of this work is to determine if hypothesis testing using adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) can provide quantitative chemical hazard predictions. Current methods for predicting hazards of chemicals in a biological pathway context were extensively reviewed, spe­cific case studies examined, and computational modeling used to demonstrate quantitative hazard prediction based on an AOP. Since AOPs are chemically agnostic, we propose that AOPs function as hypotheses for how specific chemicals may cause adverse effects via specific pathways. Three broad approaches were identified for testing the hypothesis with AOPs, semi-quantitative weight of evidence, probabilistic, and mechanistic modeling. We then demonstrate how these approaches could be used to test hypotheses using high throughput in vitro data and data from alternatives to animal testing. Finally, we discuss standards in development and documentation that would facilitate use in a regu­latory context. We conclude that quantitative AOPs provide a flexible hypothesis framework for predicting chemical hazards, which accommodates a wide range of approaches that are useful at many stages and build upon one another to become increasingly quantitative.",

We revisited these hypotheses that were previously tested solely in rodent models, this time using a 3-dimensional proximal tubule microphysiological system incorporating primary human proximal tubule epithelial cells. Using this human cell-derived model, we confirmed that 25OHD3 is transported into the human proximal tubule epithelium via megalin-mediated endocytosis while bound to vitamin D binding protein. Building upon these findings, we then evaluated the role of megalin in modulating the cellular uptake and biological activity of 1α,25(OH)2D3. Inhibition of megalin function decreased the 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated induction of both cytochrome P450 24A1 protein levels and 24-hydroxylation activity following perfusion with vitamin D binding protein and 1α,25(OH)2D3. The potential for reciprocal effects from 1α,25(OH)2D3 on megalin expression were also tested. Contrary to previously published observations from rat proximal tubule epithelial cells, 1α,25(OH)2D3 did not induce megalin gene expression, thus highlighting the potential for meaningful interspecies differences in the homeostatic regulation of megalin in rodents and humans. These findings challenge a recently promoted hypothesis, predicated on the rodent cell data, that attempts to connect 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated regulation of renal megalin expression and the pathology of chronic kidney disease in humans. In addition to providing specific insights related to the importance of renal megalin in vitamin D homeostasis, these results constitute a proof-of-concept that human-derived microphysio­logical systems are a suitable replacement for animal models for quantitative pharmacology and physiology research.",

Porcine spleens were harvested from adult pigs and connected to a normothermic extracorporeal perfusion circuit. Constant perfusion of heparinized blood was performed for 6 hours. After injection of Streptococcus pneumoniae to the circuit, serial samples of both blood and spleen biopsies were collected and analyzed. Functionality of the perfused organs was assessed by monitoring the blood-gas parameters, flow rate and filtering capability of the organ. Interestingly, we observed full clearance of bacteria from the blood and an increase in bacterial counts in the spleen. Classical histology and immunohistochemistry on biopsies also confirmed no major damage in the organ architecture and no changes in the immune cell distribution other than the presence of clusters of pneumococci. A time-course study confirmed that each focus of infection derived from the replication of single pneumococcal cells within splenic macrophages. The model proposed – in line with the 3Rs principles – has utility in the replacement of experimental animals in infection research. Murine models are prevalently used to study pneumococcal infections but are often not predictive for humans due to substantial differences in the immune systems of the two species. This model is designed to overcome these limitations, since porcine immunology, and splenic architecture in particular, closely resemble those of humans.",

We characterized the influence of the added complexity using network perturbation analysis and gene expression data. This allowed us to gain insight into the steady-state profile of the assembled, complete three-dimensional model using all four cell types, and of simpler models of one, two, or three cell types. Gene expression data were analyzed using cause-and-effect biological network models, together with a quantitative network-scoring algorithm, to determine the biological impact of co-culturing the various cell types. In the tetra-culture, macrophages appeared to be the largest contributors to overall network perturbations, promoting high basal levels of oxidative stress and inflammation. This finding led to further optimization of the model using rested macrophages, which decreased the basal inflammatory and cell stress status of the co-culture. We compared transcriptional profiles from publicly available datasets of other in vitro models representing the airways and of healthy human lung tissue with those of our model. We found an increasing correlation between airway models and normal human lung tissue as cell types became more physiologically relevant and the complexity of the system increased. This indicates that the combination of multiple lung-relevant cell types in vitro does indeed increase similarity to the physiological counterpart.",

    "abstract": "Instilling confidence in use of in vitro assays for predictive toxicology requires evaluation of assay performance. Per­formance is typically assessed using reference chemicals – compounds with defined activity against the test system target. However, developing reference chemical lists has historically been very resource-intensive. We developed a semi-automated process for selecting and annotating reference chemicals across many targets in a standardized format and demonstrate the workflow here. A series of required fields defines the potential reference chemical: the in vitro molecular target, pathway, or phenotype affected; and the chemical’s mode (e.g. agonist, antagonist, inhibitor). Activity information was computationally extracted into a database from multiple public sources including non-curated scientific literature and curated chemical-biological databases, resulting in the identification of chemical activity in 2995 biological targets. Sample data from literature sources covering 54 molecular targets ranging from data-poor to data-rich was manually checked for accuracy. Precision rates were 82.7% from curated data sources and 39.5% from automated literature extraction. We applied the final reference chemical lists to evaluating performance of EPA’s ToxCast program in vitro bioassays. The level of support, i.e., the number of independent reports in the database linking a chemical to a target, was found to strongly correlate with likelihood of positive results in the ToxCast assays, although individual assay performance had considerable variation. This overall approach allows rapid development of can­didate reference chemical lists for a wide variety of targets that can facilitate performance evaluation of in vitro assays as a critical step in imparting confidence in alternative approaches.",

    "abstract": "Being able to assess pain in nonhuman primates undergoing biomedical procedures is important for preventing and alleviating pain, and for developing better guidelines to minimize the impacts of research on welfare in line with the 3Rs principle of Refinement. Nonhuman primates are routinely used biomedical models; however, it remains challenging to recognize negative states, including pain, in these animals. This study aimed to identify behavioral and facial changes that could be used as pain or general wellness indicators in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). Thirty-six macaques scheduled for planned neuroscience procedures were opportunistically monitored at four times: Pre-Operative (PreOp), Post-Operative (PostOp) once the effects of anesthesia had dissipated, Pre-Analgesia (PreAn) on the subsequent morning prior to repeating routine analgesic treatment, and Post-Analgesia (PostAn) following administration of analgesia. Pain states were expected to be absent in PreOp, moderate in PreAn, and mild or absent in PostOp and PostAn when analgesia had been administered. Three potential pain indicators were identified: lip tightening and chewing, which were most likely to occur in PreAn, and running, which was least likely in PreAn. Arboreal behavior indicated general wellness, while half-closed eyes, leaning of the head, or body shaking indicated the opposite. Despite considerable individual variation, behavior and facial expressions could offer important indicators of pain and wellness. They should be routinely quantified and appropriate interventions applied to prevent or alleviate pain and promote positive welfare.",

    "abstract": "The use of in vitro alternative methods is a promising approach to characterize the hazardous properties of environmental chemical mixtures, including urban airborne particulate matter (PM). The aim of this study was to examine seasonal differences in the toxic and transforming potential of PM samples by using the in vitro cell transformation assay in Bhas 42 cells for the prediction of potential carcinogenic effects. Bhas 42 cells are already initiated, and the v-Ha-ras transfection, together with genetic modification following the immortalization process, makes them a valuable model to study the late steps of cellular transformation leading to the acquisition of the malignant phenotype. Exposure to organic extracts of PM1 and PM2.5 induced dose-related effects. The transforming and cytotoxic properties were related to the amount of PM collected during the sampling campaign and associated with the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the samples. All the samples induced cell transformation following prolonged exposure over 2 weeks. Our results support the utility of the in vitro top-down approach to characterize the toxicity of real mixtures, thereby supporting regulators in the decision-making process. The results also identify the need for appropriate assay selection within the in vitro testing strategy to address the complexity of adverse outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Instilling confidence in use of in vitro assays for predictive toxicology requires evaluation of assay performance. Per­formance is typically assessed using reference chemicals – compounds with defined activity against the test system target. However, developing reference chemical lists has historically been very resource-intensive. We developed a semi-automated process for selecting and annotating reference chemicals across many targets in a standardized format and demonstrate the workflow here. A series of required fields defines the potential reference chemical: the in vitro molecular target, pathway, or phenotype affected; and the chemical’s mode (e.g. agonist, antagonist, inhibitor). Activity information was computationally extracted into a database from multiple public sources including non-curated scientific literature and curated chemical-biological databases, resulting in the identification of chemical activity in 2995 biological targets. Sample data from literature sources covering 54 molecular targets ranging from data-poor to data-rich was manually checked for accuracy. Precision rates were 82.7% from curated data sources and 39.5% from automated literature extraction. We applied the final reference chemical lists to evaluating performance of EPA’s ToxCast program in vitro bioassays. The level of support, i.e., the number of independent reports in the database linking a chemical to a target, was found to strongly correlate with likelihood of positive results in the ToxCast assays, although individual assay performance had considerable variation. This overall approach allows rapid development of can­didate reference chemical lists for a wide variety of targets that can facilitate performance evaluation of in vitro assays as a critical step in imparting confidence in alternative approaches.",

Moreover, learning to use and apply one of the large imaging packages can be very time- and/or resource-demanding. Therefore, we developed the free and highly interactive image analysis program SUIKER (program for SUperImposing KEy Regions) that quantifies colocalization of different proteins or other features over an entire image field. The software allows definition of cellular subareas by subtraction (“punching out”) of structures identified in one channel from structures in a second channel. This allows, e.g., definition of neurites without cell bodies. Moreover, normalization to live or total cell numbers is possible. Providing a detailed manual that contains image analysis examples, we demonstrate how the program uses a combination of colocalization information and fluorescence intensity to quantify carbohydrate-specific stains on neurites. SUIKER can import any multichannel histology or cell culture image, builds on user-guided threshold setting, batch processes large image stacks, and exports all data (including the settings, results and metadata) in flexible formats to be used in Excel.",

    "abstract": "The replacement of animals in acute systemic toxicity testing remains a considerable challenge. Only animal data are currently accepted by regulators, including data generated by reduction and refinement methods. The development of integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA) is hampered by an insufficient understanding of the numerous toxicity pathways that lead to acute systemic toxicity. Therefore, central to our work has been the collection and evalu­ation of the mechanistic information on eight organs identified as relevant for acute systemic toxicity (nervous system, cardiovascular system, liver, kidney, lung, blood, gastrointestinal system, and immune system). While the nervous and cardiovascular systems are the most frequent targets, no clear relationship emerged between specific mechanisms of target organ toxicity and the level (category) of toxicity. From a list of 114 chemicals with acute oral in vivo and in vitro data, 97 were identified with target organ specific effects, of which 94% (91/97) were predicted as acutely toxic by the 3T3 neutral red uptake cytotoxicity assay and 6% (6/97) as non-toxic. Although specific target organ mechanisms of toxicity could in some cases explain the false negative prediction obtained with the cytotoxicity assay, in general it is difficult to explain in vitro misclassifications only on the basis of mechanistic information. This analysis will help to prioritize the development of adverse outcome pathways for acute oral toxicity, which will support the assessment of chemicals using mechanistically informed IATA.",

    "abstract": "Due to the rapidly increasing development and use of cellular products, there is a rising demand for non-animal-based test platforms to predict, study and treat undesired immunity. Here, we generated human organotypic skin models from human biopsies by isolating and expanding keratinocytes, fibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells and seeding these components on a collagen matrix or a biological vascularized scaffold matrix in a bioreactor. We then were able to induce inflammation-mediated tissue damage by adding pre-stimulated, mismatched allogeneic lymphocytes and/or inflammatory cytokine-containing supernatants histomorphologically mimicking severe graft versus host disease (GvHD) of the skin. This could be prevented by the addition of immunosuppressants to the models. Consequently, these models harbor a promising potential to serve as a test platform for the prediction, prevention and treatment of GvHD. They also allow functional studies of immune effectors and suppressors including but not limited to allodepleted lymphocytes, gamma-delta T cells, regulatory T cells and mesenchymal stromal cells, which would otherwise be limited to animal models. Thus, the current test platform, developed with the limitation that no professional antigen presenting cells are in place, could greatly reduce animal testing for investigation of novel immune therapies.",

Self-assembling protein domains from human muscle sarcomeres, termed ZT material (ZT), have been shown to be suitable for this modular approach of generating ECMs. We explored in a proof-of-concept study whether ZT modified with the fibronectin 10 domain (ZTFn10) is able to substitute bovine serum-derived fibronectin as a coating for neural crest cell (NCC)-based toxicity testing. Human NCCs were generated from pluripotent stem cells and used in the automated version of an NCC migration assay (cMINC). ZTFn10, but not the unmodified core material (ZT), allowed high migration activity. The classical cMINC setup, with bovine fibronectin coating, was used as positive control, and detailed analysis of NCC migration by time-lapse recording indicated that the novel ECM fully matched the bioactivity of the traditional ECM. A final set of experiments showed that various positive controls of the cMINC assay (PCB180, LiCl, cytochalasin D) showed nearly identical inhibition curves on the traditional and the novel ECM.

First, the model was established with sterile implants to evaluate biocompatibility. Titanium or stainless steel implants were implanted without adverse effects over the entire observation period of 5 days compared to controls and even up to the pupae and moth stage. Then, stainless steel and titanium implants contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus were implanted into larvae to mimic biofilm-associated infection. For both materials, pre-incubation of the implant with S. aureus led to significantly reduced survival of the larvae compared to sterile implants. Larvae could not be rescued by gentamicin, whereas gentamicin significantly improved the survival of the larvae in case of planktonic infection with S. aureus without an implant, confirming the typical character­istics of reduced antibiotic susceptibility of biofilm infections. Biofilm formation and various stages of biofilm maturation were confirmed by surface electron microscopy and by measuring bacterial gene expression of biofilm-related genes on contaminated implants, which confirmed biofilm formation and upregulation of autolysin (atl ) and sarA genes. In con­clusion, G. mellonella can be used as an alternative in vivo model to study biofilm-associated infections on stainless steel and titanium implants, which may help to reduce animal infection experiments with vertebrates in the future.",

    "abstract": "The development of new orally inhaled drug products requires their demonstration of safety, which must be proven in animal experiments. New in vitro methods may replace, or at least reduce, these animal experiments, provided they are able to correctly predict safety or possible toxicity in humans. However, the challenge is to link in vitro data obtained in human cells to human in vivo data. We here present a new approach to the safety assessment of excipients (SAFE) for pulmonary drug delivery. The SAFE model is based on a dose response curve of 23 excipients tested on the human pulmonary epithelial cell lines A549 and Calu-3. The resulting in vitro IC50 values were correlated with the FDA-approved concentrations in pharmaceutical products for either pulmonary (if available) or parenteral administration. Setting a threshold of 0.1% (1 mg/mL) for either value yielded four safety classes and allowed to link IC50 data as measured in human cell cultures in vitro with the concentrations of the same compounds in FDA-approved drug products. The necessary in vitro data for novel excipients can be easily generated, and the SAFE approach allows putting them into context for eventual use in human pulmonary drug products. Excipients that are most likely not safe for use in humans can be excluded early on from further pharmaceutical development. The SAFE approach thus helps to avoid unnecessary animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "In biological systems (cell culture media, cells, body fluids), drugs/toxicants are usually not freely dissolved but partially bound to biomolecules; only a fraction of the chemical is free/unbound (fu). To predict pharmacological effects and toxicity, it is important that the fu of the drug is known. As the differences between free and nominal concentrations are determined by test system parameters (e.g., the protein and lipid content, and the type of surface material), comparison of nominal concentrations between two different new approach methods (NAM) may lead to faulty conclusions. The same problem exists when in vitro concentrations are compared to those in human subjects. Therefore, the respective fu of a chemical in a test system needs to be determined for in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolations (IVIVE). Besides direct measurements, prediction models can help to obtain fu. Here we describe a simplified approach to approximate fu and provide background information on the underlying assumptions. Comparative predictions and measurements of fu of various drugs are shown to exemplify the approach. Basic input data, like protein and lipid concentrations, are also provided. Beyond such test systems data, the only required chemical-specific inputs are the lipophilicity of the candidate drug and its ionization state, as determined by the dissociation constants of its acidic or basic groups. This overview is intended to be used by any lab scientist without specific toxicokinetics training to obtain an estimate of fu in a given cell culture medium.",

    "abstract": "Several in vitro OECD test guidelines address key events 1-3 of the adverse outcome pathway for skin sensitization, but none are validated for sensitizer potency assessment. The reaction of sensitizing molecules with skin proteins is the molecular initiating event and appears to be rate-limiting, as chemical reactivity strongly correlates with sensitizer potency. The kinetic direct peptide reactivity assay (kDPRA), a modification of the DPRA (OECD TG 442C), allows derivation of rate constants of the depletion of the cysteine-containing model peptide upon reaction with the test item. Its reproducibility was demonstrated in an inter-laboratory study. Here, we present a database of rate constants, expressed as log kmax, for 180 chemicals to define the prediction threshold to identify strong sensitizers (classified as GHS 1A). A threshold of log kmax -2 offers a balanced accuracy of 85% for predicting GHS 1A sensitizers according to the local lymph node assay. The kDPRA is proposed as a stand-alone assay for identification of GHS 1A sensitizers among chemicals identified as sensitizers by other tests or defined approaches. It may also be used for the prediction of sensitizer potency on a continuous scale, ideally in combination with continuous parameters from other in vitro assays. We show how the rate constant could be combined with read-outs of other in vitro assays in a defined approach. A decision model based on log kmax alone has, however, a high predictivity and can be used as stand-alone model for identification of GHS 1A sensitizers among chemicals predicted as sensitizers.",

In total, 125 animal models for translational and applied research from 110 project applications were assessed. Explanations to select a specific model included: the model’s availability (79%); the availability of expertise (62%); and the model showing similar disease pathology/symptoms (59%) to humans. Therefore, current selection of a specific animal model seems to be based on tradition rather than its potential predictive value for clinical outcome. The applicants’ explanations for the implementation of the 3R prin­ciples (replacement, reduction and refinement) as to the animal model were unspecific. Replacement was achieved by using data from prior in vitro studies, reduction by optimal experimental design and statistics, and refinement by reducing discomfort. Additionally, due to the stated need for a test model with high complexity (47%) and intactness (30%), the full replacement of animal models with alternative (non-live animal) approaches was thought unachievable. Without a clear, systematic and transparent justification for the selection of a specific animal model, the likelihood of poorly trans­latable research remains. It is not only up to the researcher to demonstrate this, as ethical committees and funding bodies can provide positive stimuli to drive this change.",

    "abstract": "Organ-on-a-chip devices that mimic in vivo physiology have the potential to identify effects of chemical and drug exposure in early preclinical stages of drug development while relying less heavily on animal models. We designed a hydrogel rat nerve-on-a-chip (RNoaC) construct that promotes axon growth analogous to mature nerve anatomy and is the first 3D in vitro model to collect electrophysiological and histomorphic metrics to assess in vivo pathophysiology. Here we culture embryonic rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in the construct to demonstrate its potential to screen for implications of nerve dysfunction in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). RNoaC constructs containing DRG explants from E15 rat pups were exposed to the chemotherapeutics bortezomib, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel or vincristine for 7 days. Then, axons were electrically stimulated to collect nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and peak amplitude (AMP), which are clinical electrophysiological metrics indicative of healthy or diseased populations. All chemotherapeutics decreased NCV and AMP in a concentration-dependent manner. At high drug concentrations, NCV and AMP were 10-60% lower than control values. Histopathological analysis revealed hallmarks of peripheral neuropathy. IC50 values calculated from concentration-response curves indicate that the significant decrease in function occurred before a decrease in viability. Our data suggest that electrophysiology recordings collected from our RNoaC platform can closely track subtle pathological changes in nerve function. The ability to collect clinically relevant data from RNoaC suggests it can be an effective tool for in vitro preclinical screening for peripheral neuropathy.",

    "abstract": "Read-across (RAX) is a popular data gap-filling technique that uses category and analogue approaches to predict toxicological endpoints for a target. Despite its increasing relevance, RAX relies on human expert judgement and lacks a reproducible and automated protocol. It also relies only on structural similarity for identifying the analogues, while other aspects are often neglected. In this paper, we propose an automated procedure for the selection of analogues for data gap-filling. Analogues were identified by a decision algorithm that integrates three similarity metrics, each considering different toxicologically relevant aspects (i.e., structural, biological and metabolic similarity). Structural filters based on the presence of maximum common substructures (MCS) and common functional groups (FGs) were applied to narrow the chemical space for the analogue search. The procedure has been implemented as a workflow in KNIME and is freely available. The workflow provides informative tabular and graphical outputs to support toxicologists and risk assessors in drawing conclusions based on the RAX approach. The procedure has been validated for its predictive power on two datasets related to high-tier in vivo toxicological endpoints, i.e., human hepatotoxicity and druginduced liver injury (DILI). The validation results gave good accuracy values (i.e., up to 0.79 for the binary hepatotoxicity classification and up to 0.67 for the three-class DILI classification) that were higher than those returned by RAX based on the sole use of structural similarity. Results confirmed the suitability of the procedure as a source of data to support regulatory decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Several in vitro OECD test guidelines address key events 1-3 of the adverse outcome pathway for skin sensitization, but none are validated for sensitizer potency assessment. The reaction of sensitizing molecules with skin proteins is the molecular initiating event and appears to be rate-limiting, as chemical reactivity strongly correlates with sensitizer potency. The kinetic direct peptide reactivity assay (kDPRA), a modification of the DPRA (OECD TG 442C), allows derivation of rate constants of the depletion of the cysteine-containing model peptide upon reaction with the test item. Its reproducibility was demonstrated in an inter-laboratory study. Here, we present a database of rate constants, expressed as log kmax, for 180 chemicals to define the prediction threshold to identify strong sensitizers (classified as GHS 1A). A threshold of log kmax -2 offers a balanced accuracy of 85% for predicting GHS 1A sensitizers according to the local lymph node assay. The kDPRA is proposed as a stand-alone assay for identification of GHS 1A sensitizers among chemicals identified as sensitizers by other tests or defined approaches. It may also be used for the prediction of sensitizer potency on a continuous scale, ideally in combination with continuous parameters from other in vitro assays. We show how the rate constant could be combined with read-outs of other in vitro assays in a defined approach. A decision model based on log kmax alone has, however, a high predictivity and can be used as stand-alone model for identification of GHS 1A sensitizers among chemicals predicted as sensitizers.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to establish an in vitro fracture hematoma (FH) model that mimics the in vivo situation of the human fracture gap in order to assess drug efficacy and effectiveness for the treatment of fracture healing disorders. Human peripheral blood and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were coagulated to produce in vitro FH models, which were incubated in osteogenic medium under normoxia/hypoxia and analyzed for cell composition, gene expression and cytokine/chemokine secretion. To evaluate the model, we studied the impact of dexamethasone (impairing fracture healing) and deferoxamine (promoting fracture healing). Under hypoxic conditions, MSCs represented the predominant cell population, while the frequencies of leukocyte populations decreased. Marker gene expression of osteogenesis, angiogenesis, inflammation, migration and hypoxic adaptation increased significantly over time and compared to normoxia, while cytokine/chemokine secretion remained unchanged. Dexamethasone favored the frequency of immune cells compared to MSCs, suppressed osteogenic and pro-angiogenic gene expression, and enhanced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, deferoxamine favored the frequency of MSCs over that of immune cells and enhanced the expression of the osteogenic marker RUNX2 and markers of hypoxic adaptation. In summary, we demonstrate that hypoxia is an important factor for modeling the initial phase of fracture healing in vitro and that both fracture-healing disrupting and promoting substances can influence the in vitro model comparable to the in vivo situation. Therefore, we conclude that our model is able to mimic in part the human FH and could reduce the number of animal experiments in early preclinical studies.",

The whole inactivated TBE vaccine is highly effective, as proven by high seroconversion rates and near eradication of the disease in countries where vaccination programs have been implemented. TBE vaccine potency testing currently requires the use of in vivo methods that present issues of reproducibility as well as animal discomfort. As an alternative, public and private entities are currently exploring a batch-to-batch consistency approach which would demonstrate conformity of a newly produced vaccine batch with a batch with proven in vivo efficacy with respect to a range of in vitro measurable quality parameters. For the identification of a suitable cellular platform to be used in a panel of in vitro batch-to-batch assessments for the TBE vaccine, we exposed human cell-based systems, both of primary origin and cell line-derived, to vaccine formulations of high and low quality. Following stimulation, cell responses were evaluated by assessing the expression of selected genes by qPCR. Our findings show that the expression of interferon-stimulated genes differed after treatment with non-adjuvanted vaccine batches of different quality in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, but not in monocyte-free PBMC suspensions nor in cell line-derived immune cells. These results indicate suitable platforms and potential biomarkers for a cell-based assay that, together with other immunochemical analyses, could serve for batch-to-batch assessment of the TBE vaccine, reducing (and eventually replacing) in vivo methods for potency testing.",

Computational studies appear to be a relevant approach to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms triggered by POPs. We investigated the use of a systems toxicology approach to explore the effects of POPs on human health. A protein-protein association network (PPAN) was developed based on known POP-protein interactions. This model was used to predict protein complexes for several candidate POPs, including dicofol, methoxychlor, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), that are listed or proposed to be listed as POPs by the Stockholm Convention. Integration of multiple data sources (pathways, disease annotations, adverse outcome pathways) involving the identified protein complexes was performed independently in order to reveal putative risk factors for human health. This approach revealed that several systems may be disturbed by these candidate POPs, mainly the reproductive, metabolic and nervous systems.This study highlights that a computational systems toxicology approach may help to decipher putative biological mecha­nisms of poorly studied chemicals and link them to possible adverse effects with the aim to support regulatory assessment and trigger new epidemiological and experimental studies. In order to develop more accurate computational models as alternative methods to animal testing, the next challenge will be to integrate more data according to the findable, acces­sible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data principles.",

    "abstract": "Many extracellular matrices (ECM) used for modern cell culture are derived from animals. An alternative approach is the recombinant production of individual matrix protein components. A further development of this strategy uses a constant core protein polymer that is modifiable with functional domains of various ECM proteins. This way, a single, highlydefined ECM system could be used for a large variety of cell types. Self-assembling protein domains from human muscle sarcomeres, termed ZT material (ZT), have been shown to be suitable for this modular approach of generating ECMs. We explored in a proof-of-concept study whether ZT modified with the fibronectin 10 domain (ZTFn10) is able to substitute bovine serum-derived fibronectin as a coating for neural crest cell (NCC)-based toxicity testing. Human NCCs were generated from pluripotent stem cells and used in the automated version of an NCC migration assay (cMINC). ZTFn10, but not the unmodified core material (ZT), allowed high migration activity. The classical cMINC setup, with bovine fibronectin coating, was used as positive control, and detailed analysis of NCC migration by time-lapse recording indicated that the novel ECM fully matched the bioactivity of the traditional ECM. A final set of experiments showed that various positive controls of the cMINC assay (PCB180, LiCl, cytochalasin D) showed nearly identical inhibition curves on the traditional and the novel ECM. Thus, the cMINC, and possibly other bioassays, can be performed with a ZT-based ECM instead of traditional animal-derived protein coatings.",

    "abstract": "Azithromycin (AZM) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic widely used to treat infections. AZM also has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions unrelated to its antibacterial activity that contribute to the effectiveness of this drug in chronic respiratory diseases. The mechanisms behind these beneficial effects are not yet fully elucidated. We have previously shown that AZM enhances barrier integrity of bronchial epithelial cells and directs them towards epidermal differentiation.In this study, we analyzed the effect of AZM pre-treatment of human bronchial and alveolar derived cell lines on mechanical stress in a cyclical pressure air-liquid interface device (CPAD) that models the disruption of the epithelial barrier with increased inflammatory response in lung tissue, which is associated with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Immunostaining and electron microscopy showed that barrier integrity of the epithelium was compromised by cyclically stressing the cells but maintained when cells had been pre-treated with AZM. Lamellar body formation was revealed in AZM pre-treated cells, possibly further supporting the barrier-enhancing effects. RNA sequencing showed that the inflammatory response was attenuated by AZM treatment before cyclical stress. YKL-40, an emerging inflammatory marker, increased both due to cyclical stress and upon AZM treatment. These data confirm the usefulness of the CPAD to model ventilator-induced lung injury and suggest that AZM has barrier protective and immunomodulatory effects, attenuating the inflammatory response during mechanical stress, and might therefore be lung protective during mechanical ventilation. The model could be used to assess further drug candidates that influence barrier integrity and modulate inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "Allergic contact dermatitis, or the clinical manifestation of skin sensitization, is a leading occupational hazard. Several testing approaches exist to assess skin sensitization, but in silico models are perhaps the most advantageous due to their high speed and low-cost results. Many in silico skin sensitization models exist, though many have only been tested against results from animal studies (e.g., LLNA); this creates uncertainty in human skin sensitization assessments in both a screening and regulatory context. This project’s aim was to evaluate the accuracy of eight in silico skin sensitization models against two human data sets: one highly curated (Basketter et al., 2014) and one screening level (HSDB). The binary skin sen­sitization status of each chemical in each of the two data sets was compared to the prediction from eight in silico skin sensitization tools (Toxtree, PredSkin, OECD’s QSAR Toolbox, UL’s REACHAcross™, Danish QSAR Database, TIMES-SS, and Lhasa Limited’s Derek Nexus). Models were assessed for coverage, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as optimization features (e.g., probability of accuracy, applicability domain, etc.), if available. While there was a wide range of sensitivity and specificity, the models generally performed comparably to the LLNA in predicting human skin sensitization status (i.e., approximately 70-80% accuracy). Additionally, the models did not mispredict the same com­pounds, suggesting there might be an advantage in combining models. In silico skin sensitization models offer accurate and useful insights in a screening context; however, further improvements are necessary so these models may be con­sidered fully reliable for regulatory applications.",

There are, however, numerous methods to measure glucocorticoids with differences in sample matrix (e.g., plasma, urine) and quantification techniques (e.g., enzyme immunoassay or radioimmunoassay). Here, the authors present a mapping review and a searchable database, giving a complete overview of all studies mea­suring endogenous corticosterone in mice up to February 2018. For each study, information was recorded regarding mouse strain and sex; corticosterone sample matrix and quantification technique; and whether the study covered the research theme animal welfare, neuroscience, stress, inflammation, or pain (the themes of specific interest in our con­sortium). Using all database entries for the year 2012, an exploratory meta-regression was performed to determine the effect of predictors on basal corticosterone concentrations. Seventy-five studies were included using the predictors sex, time-since-lights-on, sample matrix, quantification technique, age of the mice, and type of control. Sex, time-since-lights-on, and type of control significantly affected basal corticosterone concentrations. The resulting database can be used, inter alia, for preventing unnecessary duplication of experiments, identifying knowledge gaps, and standardizing or heterogenizing methodologies. These results will help plan more efficient and valid experiments in the future and can answer new questions in silico using meta-analyses.",

Here, we present a fast and robust method to generate 3D cultured human dopaminergic neurons (LUHMES) for toxicity testing and long-term culture. Moreover, a plating step was introduced to allow generation of neurite networks with a defined 2D orientation and several mm length while all cell bodies (somata) remained in a 3D, dome-like structure. These cultures, named 2.5D (for 2.5 dimensional), offer new approaches to quantify toxicant effects on organoids by standard technology and in high throughput. For instance, the system reacted to the parkinsonian model toxicants MPP+, rotenone and MG-132, and to the ferroptosis-inducer erastin. Moreover, stable incorporation of human stem cell-derived astrocytes or microglia was possible. Addition of astrocytes stabilized the post mitotic state of the LUHMES neurons and thereby allowed formation of a stable microphysiological system. Neuroprotection against the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and the ferroptosis-inducer erastin was mediated by such glia, exemplifying the crucial protective role of astrocytes in neurodegeneration. The modularity of the system was further employed to incorporate microglia together with astrocytes into the organoids. Such ratio-defined, three cell type-based organoids will allow new approaches to study human pathophysiology and toxicology of the nervous system.",

Cell culture and epidemiological studies suggest that MC might also affect the nervous system when there is systemic exposure, e.g., via drinking water or food. We asked whether in vitro studies with human neurons could provide estimates on the neurotoxicity hazard of MC-LF. First, we used LUHMES neurons, a well-established test system for neurotoxicants and neuropathological processes. These central nervous system cells express OATP1A2, a presumed carrier of MC-LF, and we observed selective neurite toxicity in the μM range (EC20 = 3.3 μM ≈ 3.3 μg/mL). Transcriptome changes pointed towards attenuated cell maintenance and biosynthetic processes. Prolonged exposure for up to four days did not increase toxicity. As a second model, we used human dorsal root ganglia-like neurons. These peripheral nervous system cells represent parts of the nervous system not protected by the blood-brain barrier in humans. Toxicity was observed in a similar concentration range (EC20 = 7.4 μM). We conclude that MC-LF poses a potential neurotoxic hazard in humans. The adverse effect concentrations observed here were orders of magnitude higher than those presumed to be encountered after normal nutritional or environmental exposure. However, the low μM concentrations found to be toxic are close to levels that may be reached after very excessive algae supplement intake.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to establish an infection model of Galleria mellonella larvae as an alternative in vivo model for biofilm-associated infections on stainless steel and titanium implants. First, the model was established with sterile implants to evaluate biocompatibility. Titanium or stainless steel implants were implanted without adverse effects over the entire observation period of 5 days compared to controls and even up to the pupae and moth stage. Then, stainless steel and titanium implants contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus were implanted into larvae to mimic biofilm-associated infection. For both materials, pre-incubation of the implant with S. aureus led to significantly reduced survival of the larvae compared to sterile implants. Larvae could not be rescued by gentamicin, whereas gentamicin significantly improved the survival of the larvae in case of planktonic infection with S. aureus without an implant, confirming the typical character­istics of reduced antibiotic susceptibility of biofilm infections. Biofilm formation and various stages of biofilm maturation were confirmed by surface electron microscopy and by measuring bacterial gene expression of biofilm-related genes on contaminated implants, which confirmed biofilm formation and upregulation of autolysin (atl ) and sarA genes. In con­clusion, G. mellonella can be used as an alternative in vivo model to study biofilm-associated infections on stainless steel and titanium implants, which may help to reduce animal infection experiments with vertebrates in the future.",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D in vitro cancer models have become important alternatives to animal tests for establishing the efficacy of anticancer treatments. In this work, 3D SKOV-3 cell-laden alginate hydrogels were established as ovarian tumor models and cultured within a fluid-dynamic bioreactor (MIVO®) device able to mimic the capillary flow dynamics feeding the tumor. Cisplatin efficacy tests were performed within the device over time and compared with (i) the in vitro culture under static conditions and (ii) a xenograft mouse model with SKOV-3 cells, by monitoring and measuring cell proliferation or tumor regression, respectively, over time. After one week of treatment with 10 μM cisplatin, viability of cells within the 3D hydrogels cultured under static conditions remained above 80%. In contrast, the viability of cells within the 3D hydrogels cultured within dynamic MIVO® decreased by up to 50%, and very few proliferating Ki67-positive cells were observed through immunostaining. Analysis of drug diffusion, confirmed by computational analysis, explained that these results are due to different cisplatin diffusion mechanisms in the two culture conditions. Interestingly, the outcome of the drug efficacy test in the xenograft model was about 44% of tumor regression after 5 weeks, as predicted in a shorter time in the fluid-dynamic in vitro tests carried out in the MIVO® device. These results indicate that the in vivo-like dynamic environment provided by the MIVO® device allows to better model the 3D tumor environment and predict in vivo drug efficacy than a static in vitro model.",

    "abstract": "One of the most challenging areas in regulatory science is assessment of the substances known as UVCB (unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products and biological materials). Because the inherent complexity and variability of UVCBs present considerable challenges for establishing sufficient substance similarity based on chemical characteristics or other data, we hypothesized that new approach methodologies (NAMs), including in vitro test-derived biological activity signatures to characterize substance similarity, could be used to support grouping of UVCBs. We tested 141 petroleum substances as representative UVCBs in a compendium of 15 human cell types representing a variety of tissues. Petroleum substances were assayed in dilution series to derive point of departure estimates for each cell type and phenotype. Extensive quality control measures were taken to ensure that only high-confidence in vitro data were used to determine whether current groupings of these petroleum substances, based largely on the manufacturing process and physico-chemical properties, are justifiable. We found that bioactivity data-based groupings of petroleum substances were generally consistent with the manufacturing class-based categories. We also showed that these data, especially bioactivity from human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived and primary cells, can be used to rank substances in a manner highly concordant with their expected in vivo hazard potential based on their chemical compositional profile. Overall, this study demonstrates that NAMs can be used to inform groupings of UVCBs, to assist in identification of repre­sentative substances in each group for testing when needed, and to fill data gaps by read-across.",

    "abstract": "The lack of adequate toxicity data for the vast majority of chemicals in the environment has spurred the development of new approach methodologies (NAMs). This study aimed to develop a practical high-throughput in vitro model for rapidly evaluating potential hazards of chemicals using a small number of human cells. Forty-two compounds were tested using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells (hepatocytes, neurons, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells), and a primary endothelial cell line. Both functional and cytotoxicity endpoints were evaluated using high-content imaging. Concentration-response was used to derive points-of-departure (POD). PODs were integrated with ToxPi and used as surrogate NAM-based PODs for risk characterization. We found chemical class-specific similarity among the chemicals tested; metal salts exhibited the highest overall bioactivity. We also observed cell type-specific patterns among classes of chemicals, indicating the ability of the proposed in vitro model to recognize effects on different cell types. Compared to available NAM datasets, such as ToxCast/Tox21 and chemical structure-based descriptors, we found that the data from the five-cell-type model was as good or even better in assigning compounds to chemical classes. Additionally, the PODs from this model performed well as a conservative surrogate for regulatory in vivo PODs and were less likely to underestimate in vivo potency and potential risk compared to other NAM-based PODs. In summary, we demonstrate the potential of this in vitro screening model to inform rapid risk-based decision-making through ranking, clustering, and assessment of both hazard and risks of diverse environmental chemicals.",

    "abstract": "Pyrogen content is a key quality feature that must be checked in all injectable products, including vaccines. Four tests are currently available in the European Pharmacopoeia to monitor pyrogen/endotoxin presence: the rabbit pyrogen test (RPT), the bacterial endotoxin test, the recombinant factor C test, and the monocyte activation test (MAT). Here, we explored the possibility to replace the RPT with the MAT in the quality control of a vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). The testing was carried out using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells as cell source. IL-6 release was selected as readout for the detection of both endotoxin and non-endotoxin contaminants. MAT applicability for pyrogen testing of the TBEV vaccine was assessed through preparatory tests and resulted in the establishment of a very sensitive assay (limit of detection (LOD) = 0.04 EU/mL; sensitivity = 0.1 EU/mL). Both quantitative Method A and semiquantitative Method B were used for data analysis. Our studies revealed that for a vaccine without intrinsic pyrogenicity, such as that against TBEV, sensitivity (the lowest endotoxin value of the standard curve) should be used instead of LOD to define a stable maximum valid dilution of the product. In conclusion, we describe the challenges of MAT implementation for anti-TBEV vaccine following the current Ph. Eur. chapter 2.6.30 and propose a re-evaluation of the validity criteria of Methods A and B in order to set a semi-quantitative or limit test suitable for those products for which a reference lot comparison analysis is not applicable or favorable.",

Cell culture and epidemiological studies suggest that MC might also affect the nervous system when there is systemic exposure, e.g., via drinking water or food. We asked whether in vitro studies with human neurons could provide estimates on the neurotoxicity hazard of MC-LF. First, we used LUHMES neurons, a well-established test system for neurotoxicants and neuropathological processes. These central nervous system cells express OATP1A2, a presumed carrier of MC-LF, and we observed selective neurite toxicity in the μM range (EC20 = 3.3 μM ≈ 3.3 μg/mL). Transcriptome changes pointed towards attenuated cell maintenance and biosynthetic processes. Prolonged exposure for up to four days did not increase toxicity. As a second model, we used human dorsal root ganglia-like neurons. These peripheral nervous system cells represent parts of the nervous system not protected by the blood-brain barrier in humans. Toxicity was observed in a similar concentration range (EC20 = 7.4 μM). We conclude that MC-LF poses a potential neurotoxic hazard in humans. The adverse effect concentrations observed here were orders of magnitude higher than those presumed to be encountered after normal nutritional or environmental exposure. However, the low μM concentrations found to be toxic are close to levels that may be reached after very excessive algae supplement intake.",

    "abstract": "Read-across (RAX) is a popular data gap-filling technique that uses category and analogue approaches to predict toxicological endpoints for a target. Despite its increasing relevance, RAX relies on human expert judgement and lacks a reproducible and automated protocol. It also relies only on structural similarity for identifying the analogues, while other aspects are often neglected. In this paper, we propose an automated procedure for the selection of analogues for data gap-filling. Analogues were identified by a decision algorithm that integrates three similarity metrics, each considering different toxicologically relevant aspects (i.e., structural, biological and metabolic similarity). Structural filters based on the presence of maximum common substructures (MCS) and common functional groups (FGs) were applied to narrow the chemical space for the analogue search. The procedure has been implemented as a workflow in KNIME and is freely available. The workflow provides informative tabular and graphical outputs to support toxicologists and risk assessors in drawing conclusions based on the RAX approach. The procedure has been validated for its predictive power on two datasets related to high-tier in vivo toxicological endpoints, i.e., human hepatotoxicity and druginduced liver injury (DILI). The validation results gave good accuracy values (i.e., up to 0.79 for the binary hepatotoxicity classification and up to 0.67 for the three-class DILI classification) that were higher than those returned by RAX based on the sole use of structural similarity. Results confirmed the suitability of the procedure as a source of data to support regulatory decision-making.",

There are, however, numerous methods to measure glucocorticoids with differences in sample matrix (e.g., plasma, urine) and quantification techniques (e.g., enzyme immunoassay or radioimmunoassay). Here, the authors present a mapping review and a searchable database, giving a complete overview of all studies mea­suring endogenous corticosterone in mice up to February 2018. For each study, information was recorded regarding mouse strain and sex; corticosterone sample matrix and quantification technique; and whether the study covered the research theme animal welfare, neuroscience, stress, inflammation, or pain (the themes of specific interest in our con­sortium). Using all database entries for the year 2012, an exploratory meta-regression was performed to determine the effect of predictors on basal corticosterone concentrations. Seventy-five studies were included using the predictors sex, time-since-lights-on, sample matrix, quantification technique, age of the mice, and type of control. Sex, time-since-lights-on, and type of control significantly affected basal corticosterone concentrations. The resulting database can be used, inter alia, for preventing unnecessary duplication of experiments, identifying knowledge gaps, and standardizing or heterogenizing methodologies. These results will help plan more efficient and valid experiments in the future and can answer new questions in silico using meta-analyses.",

    "abstract": "National and international laws and regulations exist to protect animals used for scientific purposes in translational and applied research, which includes drug development. However, multiple animal models are available for each disease. We evaluated the argumentation behind the selection of a specific animal model using thematic content analysis in project applications issued in 2017-2019 in the Netherlands. In total, 125 animal models for translational and applied research from 110 project applications were assessed. Explanations to select a specific model included: the model’s availability (79%); the availability of expertise (62%); and the model showing similar disease pathology/symptoms (59%) to humans. Therefore, current selection of a specific animal model seems to be based on tradition rather than its potential predictive value for clinical outcome. The applicants’ explanations for the implementation of the 3R prin­ciples (replacement, reduction and refinement) as to the animal model were unspecific. Replacement was achieved by using data from prior in vitro studies, reduction by optimal experimental design and statistics, and refinement by reducing discomfort. Additionally, due to the stated need for a test model with high complexity (47%) and intactness (30%), the full replacement of animal models with alternative (non-live animal) approaches was thought unachievable. Without a clear, systematic and transparent justification for the selection of a specific animal model, the likelihood of poorly trans­latable research remains. It is not only up to the researcher to demonstrate this, as ethical committees and funding bodies can provide positive stimuli to drive this change.",

An in-depth analysis confirms a slight decrease in animal use from 2015 to 2017, but also compared to the 2005, 2008 and 2011 reports, though the new reporting scheme makes this comparison difficult. Notable success is evident for replacing rabbit pyrogen testing but, in general, the implementation of accepted alternative methods lags behind expec­tations. Beside the roughly 10 million animals per year covered in the report, about 8 million animals were identified that fall under the Directive but are not included in this number.

The in vitro human cell line activation test (h-CLAT; OECD TG 442E) addresses the activation of dermal dendritic cells by analyzing specific protein expression after exposure of THP-1 cells to the test chemical. According to the protocol, FITC-labeled antibodies are used for protein detection. However, some chemicals show strong autofluorescence at FITC-specific wavelengths so that antibody-specific signals cannot be distinguished appropriately from autofluorescence background. This leads to inconclusive or false-negative predictions. Alternative fluorochromes can be used if their equivalence with the FITC-labeled antibodies is proven. In the current paper we describe the results of a proficiency exercise, based on the proficiency chemicals listed in the guideline, with FITC-labeled antibodies as the benchmark and APC-labeled anti­bodies as an alternative detection system. APC emits fluorescence at longer wavelengths, thus avoiding interference in the FITC spectrum. Irrespective of the employed fluorochrome, all chemicals were classified correctly, and the EC150 and 200 values were in the same order of magnitude. Hence, the equivalence in performance of FITC- and APC-labeled antibodies was demonstrated, and the respective demand of the guideline was fulfilled. In a case study, we then tested a proprietary oxidative hair dye using both fluorochromes. Using APC-labeled antibodies, the hair dye was unambiguously identified as a sensitizer, whereas no classification could be made with the FITC-labeled antibodies. With APC, fluorescence interference can be circumvented and the applicability domain of the h-CLAT extended to include autofluorescent chemicals.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of genotoxicity upon exposure to chemical and environmental agents plays an important role in basic research as well as in pharmaceutical, chemical, cosmetic and food industry. Low sensitivity and lack of inter-laboratory comparability are considered problematic issues in genotoxicity testing. Moreover, commonly used mutagenicity assays lack information about early and specific genotoxic events.Previously, we developed an automated version of the “Fluorimetric detection of Alkaline DNA Unwinding” (FADU) assay as a high-throughput screening method for the detection of DNA strand breaks in living cells. Here, we report an enzyme-modified version of the cell-based FADU assay (emFADU) for the determination of oxidative and methylation lesions in cellular DNA. Our method is based on the use of formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase or human alkylad­enine DNA glycosylase for the detection of chemically-induced nucleobase modifications in lysates of immortalized cell lines, growing in suspension or as adherent cells, and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We could show that upon treatment with sub-cytotoxic doses of known genotoxins, oxidative and methylation lesions are readily detectable.This fast, inexpensive, and convenient method could be useful as a high-content screening approach for the sensitive and specific assessment of genotoxicity in human cells. Thus, when implemented in the early compound development in an industrial setting, the emFADU assay could help reduce the number of animals used for toxicity testing. Furthermore, as we established the method for different cell types, this new assay may provide an opportunity for population studies and/or mechanistic research into DNA repair pathways.",

The CIAO project “Modelling the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 using the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework” aims at building a holistic assembly of the available scientific knowledge on COVID-19 using the AOP framework. An individual AOP depicts the disease progression from the initial contact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus through biological key events (KE) toward an adverse outcome such as respiratory distress, anosmia or multiorgan failure. Assembling the individual AOPs into a network highlights shared KEs as central biological nodes involved in multiple outcomes observed in COVID-19 patients. During the workshop, the KEs and AOPs established so far by the CIAO members were presented and posi­tioned on a timeline of the disease course. Modulating factors influencing the progression and severity of the disease were also addressed as well as factors beyond purely biological phenomena. CIAO relies on an interdisciplinary crowd­sourcing effort, therefore, approaches to expand the CIAO network by widening the crowd and reaching stakeholders were also discussed. To conclude the workshop, it was decided that the AOPs/KEs will be further consolidated, inte­grating virus variants and long COVID when relevant, while an outreach campaign will be launched to broaden the CIAO scientific crowd.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in microphysiological systems (MPS) promise a global paradigm shift in drug development, diagnostics, disease prevention, and therapy. The expectation is that these systems will model healthy and various diseased stages and disease progression to predict toxicity, immunogenicity, ADME profiles, and treatment efficacies. MPS will provide unprecedented human-like physiological properties of in vitro models, enabling their routine application in the pharma industry and thus reducing drug development costs by lowering the attrition rate of compounds. We showcased MPS application diversity across different industries during the TEDD Annual Meeting on 14th October 2021 in Wädenswil, Switzerland. The goal was to promote cross-sectoral collaboration of academia and industry to further pave the way for developing next-generation MPS based on 3D cell culture, organoid, and organ-on-chip technology and their widespread exploitation. To enable visionary projects and radical innovations, we covered multidisciplinary fields and connected different industry sectors, like pharma, medtech, biotech, cosmetics, diagnostics, fragrances, and food, with each other.",

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently published a test guideline incorporating the “2 out of 3” defined approach (2o3 DA) for skin sensitization hazard assessment and added the kinetic direct peptide reactivity assay (kDPRA) as a stand-alone test guideline method for GHS subclassification. The 2o3 DA requires that at least two in vitro tests are conducted. The cell-based tests and the kDPRA generate, next to a binary outcome with a fixed threshold, continuous concentration-response data, which can be used in quantitative regression models to derive a PoD. The sequence of testing for the 2o3 DA is flexible. Here we compare different testing sequences and how they can be combined with kDPRA data to provide a PoD in parallel to hazard identification (hazard ID) and GHS subclassification. A set of 188 chemicals with available in vitro data was evaluated for the final PoD using these different testing sequences. The results indicate that testing can start with DPRA / kDPRA and either of the cell-based assays, and that testing can stop after two congruent tests without major impact on the final PoD for chemicals within the applicability domain of the kDPRA.",

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) offer great opportunities within the 3R framework. In the field of toxicology, they may contribute greatly to the reduction and eventually replacement of animal models. However, culturing hiPSC as well as the differentiation of hiPSC into target cells that are used for toxicity testing, mainly depend on the presence of extracellular matrix (ECM) coatings. The most widely used ECM coating is Matrigel, an animal product that is derived from mice sarcomas. Drawbacks of Matrigel are widely recognized and include batch-to batch variations, usage of animal rather than human material and ethical concerns for its production. While alternative coatings exist, factors such as higher cost and limited characterizations may hinder a broader uptake by the scientific community. Here, we report an extensive comparison of three commercial human ECM coatings, vitronectin, laminin-511 and laminin-521, to Matrigel in three different hiPSC lines in long term culture (&lt; 9 passages). Characterization included expression of pluripotent markers in a genome-wide transcriptomics study (TempO-Seq), capacity to differentiate into embryoid bodies and karyotype stability by analyzing copy number variations by shallow DNA sequencing. Furthermore, a low-cost alternative, decellularized ECM produced by human neonatal dermal fibroblasts was analyzed. In addition, all alternative coatings were tested for hiPSC differentiation into renal podocyte-like cells in a genome-wide transcriptomics screen. Our results showed that all tested coatings were highly comparable to the animal-derived Matrigel for both hiPSC maintenance and differentiation into renal podocyte-like cells. Furthermore, decellularized fibroblast ECM could be a novel attractive low-cost coating.",

    "abstract": "In vitro toxicokinetic data are critical in meeting an increased regulatory need to improve chemical safety evaluations towards a better understanding of internal human chemical exposure and toxicity. In vitro intrinsic hepatic clearance (CLint), the fraction unbound in plasma (Fup), and the intestinal apparent permeability (Papp) are important parameters as input in a physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model to make first estimates of internal exposure after oral dosing. In the present study we explored the experimental variation in the values for these parameters as reported in the literature. Furthermore, the impact that this experimental variation has on PBK model predictions of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0-24h) was determined. As a result of the experimental variation in CLint, Papp, and Fup, the predicted variation in Cmax for individual compounds ranged between 1.4- to 28-fold and the predicted variation in AUC0-24h ranged between 1.4- and 23-fold. These results indicate that there are still some important steps to take to achieve robust data that can be used in regulatory applications. To gain regulatory acceptance of in vitro kinetic data and PBK models based on in vitro input data, the boundaries in experimental conditions as well as the applicability domain and the use of different in vitro kinetic models need to be described in guidance documents.",

    "abstract": "Systematic reviews provide a structured framework for summarizing the available evidence in a comprehensive, objective, and transparent manner. They inform evidence-based guidelines in medicine, public policy, and more recently, in environmental health and toxicology. Many regulatory agencies have extended and adapted the well-established systematic review methods, initially developed for clinical studies, for their assessment needs. The use of systematic reviews to summarize evidence from existing human, animal, and mechanistic studies can reduce reliance on animal test data in risk assessment and can help avoid unnecessary duplication of animal experiments that have already been conducted. As alternative test methods can be expected to play an increasing role in human health risk assessment in the future, systematic reviews can be particularly helpful in validating these alternatives. The field of evidence-based toxicology has undergone extensive development since its first meeting in 2007 as a result of collaborative efforts among international experts and public health agencies, particularly with respect to the use of mechanistic data and evidence integration. The continued development and wider adoption of systematic review methodology can lead to better 3R implementation. As undertaking a systematic review can be a complex and lengthy process, it is important to understand the main steps involved. Key steps, along with current best practices, are described with references to guidance from organizations with expertise in evidence synthesis. Applications of systematic reviews in clinical, observational, and experimental studies are presented. Finally, software tools available to facilitate and increase the efficiency of completing a systematic review are described.",

Increases in omics studies offers unparalleled access to examine early molecular responses in organisms in response to environmental stressors and yet reduction in animal usage within this context has been overlooked. For proteomics, there is significant disparity and variability in organismal pool size ranging from 1-2000 embryos per replicate for zebrafish alone. However, it is unknown if varying sample pool size results in higher protein identifications. To examine whether the proteome changes are dependent on this variable, 3 pool sizes (5, 10 or 20 embryos per replicate) were examined using the two most common fish models with appropriate biological replicate number determined based on statistical power analysis (n=7). Samples were analysed by data-independent acquisition (DIA), resulted in 1,946 and 2,770 protein groups identified (1 % FDR) for the fathead minnow and zebrafish, respectively. Proteins were not differentially expressed among pool sizes, and no significant difference was observed among the protein groups identified. However, for the fathead minnow, a decrease in the number of proteins identified was observed with increasing pool size, while only a modest increase of 110 protein identifications was observed in zebrafish between the lowest and highest pool size. Taken together, our observations suggests that a proteome characterization experiment using these fish models can achieve comparable protein identifications using pool sizes of less than 5 per replicate assuming a protein requirement of 50µg or less.",

    "abstract": "International chemical regulatory activities are moving towards new approach methodology and away from traditional animal-based models, shifting and expanding from one single in vivo assay towards combined use of different in vitro assays within integrated approaches for testing and assessment and defined approaches to serve hazard identification, classification and selection of points of departure for risk assessment. Whilst many in vitro test guidelines were developed against specific hazard cut-off values, quantitative information is needed in data interpretation procedures for potency assessment purposes or to define points of departure so that assays can fulfill evolving regulatory needs. Utilizing four examples from skin sensitization, phototoxicity, endocrine activity, and non-genotoxic carcinogenicity, we illustrate why a shift in data generation and data interpretation procedures is needed to facilitate the full exploitation of the data that is generated using these assays. This requires the development of a practical approach that uses or expands upon existing guidance. Experience gained with such an approach can then provide a basis for an overarching strategy in test guideline development that should better facilitate combinations of in vitro test guidelines for specific endpoints that will be more transparent, robust, and adaptable for specific regulatory purposes.",

Here, we developed an approach for data analysis of the distribution of PMR movement activities along the time axis; differences between treatment and respective controls are expressed by an aggregated value integrating the time-resolved density of the movement parameter as a measure for a chemically elicited PMR effect. Logistic concentration-PMR effect relationships were modeled for neuroactive test compounds with different modes of action (acetylcholinesterase inhibition, activation and inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels); 50% effect concentrations (EC50) were in the low to medium µM range (EC50 &lt; 10 µM for flucythrinate, esfenvalerate, azinphos-methyl, propoxur; EC50 &gt; 10 µM for tricaine). Modulation of movement activities in different phases of the PMR (i.e., “fingerprint”) by neuroactive test compounds varied across concentrations showing that mode of action-specific PMR fingerprints are also concentration-dependent. Above 10% lethal concentrations causing 10% lethality (LC10; 48h) 3,4-dichloroaniline caused movement inhibition. This substance presumably is not neuroactive, its effect on the PMR therefore was considered as a secondary toxic effect. Quantitative morphological examinations of chemically exposed embryos showed that malformations occurred only above PMR effect concentrations, indicating that changes in the PMR were not due to such indirect effects. The PMR assay will provide useful measures in ecotoxicological risk assessment of neuroactive chemicals with zebrafish embryos and could potentially be used to infer acute fish toxicity levels from PMR effect concentrations of neurotoxic compounds.",

The hiPSCs obtained are usually implanted in immunodeficient mice, and teratoma formation is analyzed after 4 to 6 weeks to assess the cells’ pluripotency. In this study, an alternative in vivo model based on chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was established to analyze the pluripotency of newly created hiPSCs. 0.5, 1, 2, 4 x 106 hiPSCs gen­erated from urine-derived renal epithelial cells were seeded on CAM and incubated for 9 days. Teratoma formation was detected in 70% of eggs inoculated with 2 x 106 hiPSCs and in 100% of eggs inoculated with 4 x 106 hiPSCs. All teratomas exhibited vascular structures. The robustness of the CAM model was confirmed using two additional hiPSC lines derived from human fibroblasts (NuFFs) or jaw periosteal cells. The presence of all three germ layers within the teratomas was successfully verified by histochemical and immunofluorescence staining and gene expression analysis of germ layer-specific markers. Urine-derived renal epithelial cells were used as negative control and showed no teratoma formation. The CAM-based in vivo model provides an optimal in vivo test environment for the pluripotency evaluation of newly generated hiPSC lines. This simple, fast, inexpensive and reproducible method reduces the suffering of animals and thus implements the principles of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement).",

Interventions were explored along four themes: setting standards; reviewing protocols; optimizing editorial workflows; and measuring the effectiveness of editorial interventions. In total, 58 editorial interventions were proposed. Of these, 26 were shortlisted for being potentially effective, and 5 were prioritized as short-term actions that editors could relatively easily take to improve the quality of published systematic reviews.

The approach is demonstrated in a pilot study with ethylbenzene (EB), a mono-constituent petroleum substance using a human alveolar epithelial cell line model. This included the development and validation of a generation facility to obtain EB vapors and the optimization of an exposure system for a negative control (clean air, CA), positive control (nitrogen dioxide), and EB vapors. The optimal settings for the VITROCELL® 24/48 system were defined. Cytotoxicity, cell viability, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed in A549 after exposure to EB vapors. A concentration-dependent significant decrease in mean cell viability was observed after exposure, which was confirmed by a cytotoxicity test. The oxidative stress marker superoxide dismutase 2 was significantly increased, but no concentration-response was observed. A concentration-dependent significant increase in pro-inflammatory markers C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, interleukin (IL)6, and IL8 was observed for EB-exposed A549 cells compared to CA. The data demonstrated consistency between in vivo air concentrations at which adverse respiratory effects were observed and ALI-concentrations affecting cell viability, provided that the actual measured in vitro delivery efficiency of the compound were included. It can be concluded that extrapolating in vitro air concentrations (adjusted for delivery efficiency and absorption characteristics and applied for testing cell viability) to simulate in vivo air concentrations may be a promising method to screen for acute inhalation toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The in vivo histamine sensitization test (HIST) has historically been applied to guarantee the safety of acellular pertussis vaccine batches. Non-compliance of batches is primarily associated with the presence of low levels of pertussis toxin (PTx). Because of ethical, standardization and scientific reasons, a variety of alternative in vitro approaches have been studied to replace this lethal HIST. A broadly applied and partially accepted method is the CHO cell clustering test, which is based on the clustered growth pattern of CHO cells when exposed to minute amounts of PTx. One of the major hurdles for global application of CHO clustering test is the manual assessment of the clusters, which is negatively associated with the reproducibility of test outcomes and time consuming. Here, various parameters of CHO cell nuclei were evaluated, in search for a reliable, objective read-out parameter. We demonstrate that the distance between each nucleus and its nearest neighbor (3N method) is the most suitable parameter to assess clustered cell growth. This method detects 2.8 mIU PTx/mL and thereby complies with the requirement set for the sensitivity of the CHO clustering test based on visual reading. In commercial acellular pertussis vaccines spiked with PTx, the method detects 45 mIU/mL PTx, which is substantially lower than the 181-725 mIU/mL PTx detected by visual interpretation. The 3N method thus allows for objective and sensitive assessment of CHO clustering and thereby encourages broad and global implementation of the test as an alternative to the HIST.",

The software allows an overall toxicological evaluation of cosmetic ingredients without the need for additional testing and, depending on the product type, it applies defined exposure scenarios to derive risk for consumers. It takes regulatory thresholds into account and uses either experimental values, if available, or predictions. Based on the exper­imental or predicted no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL), the software can define a point of departure (POD), which is used to calculate the margin of safety (MoS) of the query chemicals. The software also provides other toxico­logical properties, such as mutagenicity, skin sensitization, and the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) to provide an overall evaluation of the potential chemical hazard. Predictions are calculated using in silico models implemented within the VEGA software. The full list of ingredients of a cosmetic product can be processed at the same time, at the effective concentrations in the product as given by the user. SpheraCosmolife is designed as a support tool for safety assessors of cosmetic products and can be used to prioritize the cosmetic ingredients or formulations according to their potential risk to consumers. The major novelty of the tool is that it wraps a series of models (some of them new) into a single, user-friendly software system.",

To warrant data reproducibility, quality-controlled research material is recommended. While the need for global harmonization of quality standards for stem cell banking centers, commercial providers, pre-clinical and clinical use of cells is well doc­umented, there are no recommendations available for quality control of hiPSC in an academic research environment to date. To fill this gap, we here give an example of a quality-controlled, two-tiered banking process producing a fully characterized master cell bank (MCB) and partially characterized respective working cell banks (WCB). Characteri­zation includes the study of morphology, mycoplasma contamination, cell line identity, karyotype stability, cell antigen expression and viability, gene expression, pluripotency, and post-thaw recovery. Costs of these procedures are cal­culated. We present the results of the proposed testing panel of two hiPSC MCBs and show that both fulfil the defined specifications regarding the above-mentioned characterization assays during and upon banking. In conclusion, we propose a panel of eight assays, which are practical and useful for an academic research laboratory working with hiPSCs. Meeting these proposed specifications ensures the quality of pluripotent stem cells throughout diverse experi­ments at moderate costs.",
