This connection is based on the linear correlation betweenRG and the logarithm of the multiplicative version of the Randić index.",

    "abstract": "For a (molecular) graph, the first Zagreb index M1 is equal to the sum of squares of the degrees of vertices, and the second Zagreb index M2 is equal to the sum of the products of the degrees of pairs of adjacent vertices. The F-index of a graph G denoted by F(G) or M3(G) is defined as the sum of cubes of the degrees of vertices of the graph. The total π-electron energy depends on the degree based sum M1(G)=∑v∈VdegG(v)2 and F(G)=∑v∈VdegG(v)3, it was shown in the study of structure-dependency of total π-electron energy in 1972. The first index was named first Zagreb index and the second sum ∑v∈VdegG(v)3 has been never further studied. Recently, this sum was named Forgotten index or the F-index by Furtula and Gutman and it was shown to have an exceptional applicative potential.The first and second Zagreb indices for the four operations on graphs were studied by Deng et al. (2016). In this paper, we extend this study to the F-index of graphs and determine the closed formulas for the F-index of four operations on graphs.",

Hedetniemi and M.A. Henning. We recall that a function f:V→{0,1,2} is a Roman dominating function (or just RDF) if every vertex u for which f(u) = 0 is adjacent to at least one vertex v for which f(v) = 2. The Roman domination number of a graph G, denoted by γR(G), is the minimum weight of an RDF on G.",

    "abstract": "Algebraic graph theory is the study of the interplay between algebraic structures (both abstract as well as linear structures) and graph theory. Many concepts of abstract algebra have facilitated through the construction of graphs which are used as tools in computer science. Conversely, graph theory has also helped to characterize certain algebraic properties of abstract algebraic structures. In this survey, we highlight the rich interplay between the two topics viz groups and power graphs from groups. In the last decade, extensive contribution has been made towards the investigation of power graphs. Our main motive is to provide a complete survey on the connectedness of power graphs and proper power graphs, the Laplacian and adjacency spectrum of power graph, isomorphism, and automorphism of power graphs, characterization of power graphs in terms of groups. Apart from the survey of results, this paper also contains some new material such as the contents of Section 2 (which describes the interesting case of the power graph of the Mathieu group M11) and Section 6.1 (where conditions are discussed for the reduced power graph to be not connected). We conclude this paper by presenting a set of open problems and conjectures on power graphs.",

The efficiency between two vertices i and j is defined to be ∈i,j=1d(i,j) for all i≠j. The global efficiency of a graph is the average efficiency over all i≠j. The concept of global efficiency has been applied to optimization of transportation systems and brain connectivity. In this paper we determine the global efficiency for complete multipartite graphs Km,n, star and subdivided star graphs, and the Cartesian Products Kn×Pnm, Kn×Cnm, Km×Kn, and Pm×Pn.",

To provide more accurate measures for the fault-tolerance of networks than the connectivity, some generalizations of connectivity have been introduced. Let H be a connected subgraph of a graph G.

If further, each member of F is isomorphic to H, then F is called an H-structure cut of G. The H-structure connectivity κ(G;H) of G is the minimum cardinality of an H-structure cut of G.

The notion of betweenness has a profound history and many pioneers like Euclid, Pasch, Hilbert have studied betweenness axiomatically. In discrete mathematics too, betweenness is present and several authors have worked on this concept from an axiomatic view. In graph theory, betweenness is developed mainly as metric betweenness, studied using the shortest path metric in a connected graph, thus resulting in the notion of the interval function. Many interesting results are available in graph theory using the interval function. The interval function is generalized to induced path function by replacing shortest paths by induced paths. The induced path betweenness also captured attention among graph theorists with several interesting results to date. From an axiomatic point of view, two pertinent questions can be framed on these functions. Is it possible to axiomatically characterize the interval function of some special graphs using some set of first order axioms defined on an arbitrary transit function? Is it possible to characterize the graphs with the help of their interval functions? In this paper, we survey the results as answers to these questions available from the research papers.",

So, finding and introducing any class of graphs which are determined by their spectra can be an interesting and important problem. A graph is said to be DQS if there is no other non-isomorphic graph with the same signless Laplacian spectrum. For a DQS graph G, we show that G∪rK1∪sK2 is DQS under certain conditions, where r, s are natural numbers and K1 andK2 denote the complete graphs on one vertex and two vertices, respectively.

A powerful k-alliance is both defensive k-alliance and offensive (k+2)-alliance. During the last decade there has been a remarkable development on these three kinds of alliances. Due to their variety of applications, the alliances in its broad sense have received a special attention from many scientists and researchers. There have been applications of alliances in several areas such as bioinformatics, distributed computing, web communities, social networks, data clustering, business, etc. Several k-alliance numbers have been defined and a huge number of theoretical (algorithmic and computational) results are obtained for various graph classes. In this paper, we present a survey which covers a number of practical applications of alliances and the vast mathematical properties of the three types of k-alliances by giving a special attention to the study of the associated k-alliance (partition) numbers for different graph classes.",

A semipaired dominating set D⊆V of G, is a dominating set of G, if D can be partitioned into cardinality 2 subsets such that the vertices in each of these subsets are at distance at most two from each other. The Min-Semi-PD problem is to compute a minimum cardinality semipaired dominating set of a given graph G. It is known that the decision version of the problem is NP-complete for bipartite graphs and split graphs. In this article, we resolve the complexity of the problem in two well studied graph classes, namely, AT-free graphs and planar graphs. We show that the decision version of the Min-Semi-PD problem remains NP-complete for planar graphs. On the positive side, we propose a polynomial-time exact algorithm for the Min-Semi-PD problem in AT-free graphs, but the complexity of the algorithm is quite high. So, in addition, we also give a linear-time constant factor approximation algorithm for the problem in AT-free graphs.",

For each civil x∈W, there must be an official v∈D that can serve x, and whenever any such v is serving x, there must also be another civil w∈W that observes v, that is, w may act as a kind of witness, to avoid any abuse from v. What is the minimum number of officials to guarantee such a service, assuming a given social network?In this paper, we introduce the concept of certified domination that models the aforementioned problem. Specifically, a dominating set D of a graph G=(VG,EG) is said to be certified if every vertex in D has either zero or at least two neighbours in VG∖D. The cardinality of a minimum certified dominating set in G is called the certified domination number of G. Herein, we present the exact values of the certified domination number for some classes of graphs as well as provide some upper bounds on this parameter for arbitrary graphs. We then characterise a wide class of graphs with equal domination and certified domination numbers and characterise graphs with large values of certified domination numbers. Next, we examine the effects on the certified domination number when the graph is modified by deleting/adding an edge or a vertex. We also provide Nordhaus–Gaddum type inequalities for the certified domination number.",

The weight of an R2DF is the sum f(V)=∑v∈Vf(v). The minimum weight of an R2DF is called the Roman {2}-domination number and is denoted by γ{R2}(G). A double Roman dominating function (DRDF) on G is a function f:V→{0,1,2,3} such that for every vertex v∈V if f(v) = 0, then v has at least two neighbors x,y∈N(v) with f(x)=f(y)=2 or one neighbor w with f(w) = 3, and if f(v) = 1, then v must have at least one neighbor w with f(w)≥2. The weight of a DRDF is the value f(V)=∑v∈Vf(v). The minimum weight of a DRDF is called the double Roman domination number and is denoted by γdR(G). Given an graph G and a positive integer k, the R2DP (DRDP) problem is to check whether G has an R2DF (DRDF) of weight at most k. In this article, we first show that the R2DP problem is NP-complete for star convex bipartite graphs, comb convex bipartite graphs and bisplit graphs. We also show that the DRDP problem is NP-complete for star convex bipartite graphs and comb convex bipartite graphs. Next, we show that γ{R2}(G), and γdR(G) are obtained in linear time for bounded tree-width graphs, chain graphs and threshold graphs, a subclass of split graphs. Finally, we propose a 2(1+ ln (Δ+1))-approximation algorithm for the minimum Roman {2}-domination problem and 3(1+ ln (Δ+1))-approximation algorithm for the minimum double Roman domination problem, where Δ is the maximum degree of G.",

    "abstract": "Graph partitioning problem, which is one of the most important topics in graph theory, usually asks for a partition of the vertex set of a graph into pairwise disjoint subsets with various requirements. It comes from the well-known Max-Cut Problem: Given a graph G, find the maximum bipartite subgraph of G. In practice, one often needs to find a partition of a given graph to optimize several quantities simultaneously. Such problems are called judicious partition problems by Bollobás and Scott. In this survey, we present some new results and problems on graph partitioning.",

    "abstract": "The study of topological descriptors is essential for understanding the underlying structures of graphs and networks. Numerous numerical descriptors associated with graphs have been used to analyze their overall structure. In this analysis, degree-based topological descriptors hold a significant place. The Euler Sombor index of a graph Γ is a significant vertex degree-based topological index related to the Sombor index, showing a strong correlation with the physicochemical properties of octanes. It represents the perimeter of an ellipse, with focal points recognized as the degree-point and the dual-point of a pair of connected vertices in Γ. Nowadays, finding extremal results with respect to various graph indices for fixed graph parameters has become an important and engaging area of research in extremal graph theory. In this article, we explore the first and second maximum Euler Sombor index of a tree with a fixed diameter d≥4. The extremal trees are also identified. Furthermore, we provide the ordering of trees for d=3. In addition, we identify the maximal unicyclic graph when the graph order and diameter are given.",

    "abstract": "Traditional basketball tactical analysis methods rely on manual observation and statistics, which are inefficient and highly subjective. In order to achieve intelligent analysis of basketball games, improve training efficiency and tactical decision-making level, a system that can automatically and accurately identify player behavior and tactical intentions is needed. In response to the challenges of rhythm regulation and tactical intention recognition in basketball, this paper proposes a basketball rhythm regulation and tactical intention recognition system based on graph convolutional network and spatiotemporal attention mechanism. This article proposes a spatiotemporal graph convolutional attention behavior recognition algorithm, which first uses graph convolutional networks to extract spatial relationship features between players, and then introduces spatiotemporal attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies and keyframe information of behavior. In order to improve algorithm efficiency, the model has undergone lightweight improvements. On this basis, a basketball rhythm regulation and tactical intention recognition training system was developed, which includes an athlete tactical behavior recognition module. System testing shows that the proposed recognition algorithm performs well in tactical behavior recognition accuracy, and the system performance meets real-time requirements. Therefore, the system can effectively identify tactical intentions and rhythm changes in basketball games, providing data support for coaches and athletes.",

We then proceed to determine many properties of generalized totient graphs such as their clique numbers, chromatic numbers, chromatic indices, clique domination numbers, and (in many, but not all cases) girths. We also determine the diameter of each component of a generalized totient graph. We correct one erroneous claim about the clique domination numbers of Euler totient Cayley graphs that has appeared in the literature and provide a counterexample to a second claim about the strong domination numbers of these graphs.",

In this paper, we study the super gracefulness of complete graph, the disjoint union of certain star graphs, the complete tripartite graphs , and certain families of trees. We also present four methods of constructing new super graceful graphs. In particular, all trees of order at most 7 are super graceful. We conjecture that all trees are super graceful.",

The total k-labeling φ is called an edge irregular reflexive k-labeling of G if every two different edges has distinct edge weights, where the edge weight is defined as the summation of the edge label itself and its two vertex labels. Thus, the smallest value of k for which the graph G has the edge irregular reflexive k-labeling is called the reflexive edge strength of G.

The set W is called a resolving set of G if r(u|W)≠r(v|W), for every pair u,v∈V(G). The minimum positive integer k for which G has a resolving set of cardinality k is the metric dimension of G, denoted as dim(G). A resolving set of G of cardinality dim(G) is a metric basis of G. For a bipartite graph G, projection is defined as a graph with the vertices of one of the partite sets, where two vertices are adjacent if they have at least one common neighbor in the other partite set. In this paper, we investigate the relation between the metric dimension of a bipartite graph and its projections. Furthermore, we present some realization results for the bounds on the metric dimension of a bipartite graph.",

I am mainly concerned with graphs on groups, and will give three types of interaction between graphs and groups, with examples of each taken from recent research.

The elements of P and L are called points and lines, respectively, and the linear system is called intersecting if any pair of lines intersect in exactly one point. A subset T of points of P is a transversal of (P,L) if T intersects any line, and the transversal number, τ(P,L), is the minimum order of a transversal. On the other hand, a 2-packing set of a linear system (P,L) is a set R of lines, such that any three of them have a common point, then the 2-packing number of (P,L), ν2(P,L), is the size of a maximum 2-packing set. It is known that the transversal number τ(P,L) is bounded above by a quadratic function of ν2(P,L). An open problem is to characterize the families of linear systems which satisfies τ(P,L)≤λν2(P,L), for some λ≥1. In this paper, we give an infinite family of linear systems (P,L) which satisfies τ(P,L)=ν2(P,L) with smallest possible cardinality of L, as well as some properties of r-uniform intersecting linear systems (P,L), such that τ(P,L)=ν2(P,L)=r. Moreover, we state a characterization of 4-uniform intersecting linear systems (P,L) with τ(P,L)=ν2(P,L)=4.",

In recent years, many applications emerged that require the processing of large dynamic graphs where the graph's structure and properties change constantly over time. Examples include social networks, communication networks, transportation networks, etc. One of the most challenging problems in large scale dynamic graphs is the single-source shortest path (SSSP) problem. Traditional solutions (based on Dijkstra's algorithms) to the SSSP problem do not scale to large dynamic graphs with a high change frequency. In this paper, we propose an efficient SSSP algorithm for large dynamic graphs. We first present our algorithm and give a formal proof of its correctness. Then, we give an analytical evaluation of the proposed solution.",

In this note, we show that some snarks constructed by using a method introduced by Loupekhine admit a normal edge-coloring with five colors. The existence of a Berge-Fulkerson Covering for a part of the snarks considered in this paper was recently proved by Manuel and Shanthi (2015). Since the existence of a normal edge-coloring with five colors implies the existence of a Berge-Fulkerson Covering, our main theorem can be viewed as a generalization of their result.",

The weight of a double Roman dominating function f is the value ω(f)=Σv∈V(G)f(v).

The double Roman reinforcement number rdR(G) of a graph G is the minimum number of edges that have to be added to G in order to decrease the double Roman domination number. In this paper, we first show that the decision problem associated to the double Roman reinforcement problem is NP-hard even when restricted to bipartite graphs and then we investigate the properties of double Roman reinforcement number in graphs, and we present some sharp bounds for rdR(G).

We begin by defining an order on the Gaussian integers that lie in the first quadrant. Using this ordering, we show that several families of trees admit a prime labeling with the Gaussian integers.",

We show that the result is not true in general for multidigraphs and supply a class of non-bipartite multidigraphs which have this property. We describe the complete spectrum of a multi-directed tree in terms of the spectrum of the corresponding modular tree.

In this paper, we initiate to study the total mixed domination number of a connected graph by giving some tight bounds in terms of some parameters such as order and total domination numbers of the graph and its line graph. Then we discuss on the relation between total mixed domination number of a graph and its diameter. Study of this number in trees and 2-corona graphs is our next work. Also we show that the total mixed domination number of a graph is equal to the total domination number of its total graph. Giving the total mixed domination numbers of the paths, cycles, complete bipartite graphs, complete graphs and wheels is our last work.",

    "abstract": "The subject of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLSs) has fascinated researchers for many years. Although there is a number of intriguing results in this area, many open problems remain to which the answers seem as elusive as ever. Mutually orthogonal graph squares (MOGSs) are considered a generalization to MOLS. MOLS are considered an area of combinatorial design theory which has many applications in optical communications, cryptography, storage system design, wireless communications, communication protocols, and algorithm design and analysis, to mention just a few areas. In this paper, we introduce a technique for constructing the mutually orthogonal disjoint union of graphs squares and the generalization of the Kronecker product of MOGS as a generalization to the MacNeish's Kronecker product of MOLS. These are useful for constructing many new results concerned with the MOGS.",

Let C0 be a k-coloring of the induced subgraph G[S]. The coloring C0 is called an extendable coloring if C0 can be extended to a k-coloring of G. We say that C0 is a Sudoku coloring of G if C0 can be uniquely extended to a k-coloring of G. The smallest order of such an induced subgraph G[S] of G which admits a Sudoku coloring is called the Sudoku number of G and is denoted by sn(G). In this paper we initiate a study of this parameter. We first show that this parameter is related to list coloring of graphs. In Section 2, basic properties of Sudoku coloring that are related to color dominating vertices, chromatic numbers and degree of vertices, are given. Particularly, we obtained necessary conditions for C0 being extendable, and for C0 being a Sudoku coloring. In Section 3, we determined the Sudoku number of various families of graphs. Particularly, we showed that a connected graph G has sn(G) = 1 if and only if G is bipartite. Consequently, every tree T has sn(T) = 1. We also proved that sn(G)=|V(G)|−1 if and only if G = Kn. Moreover, a graph G with small chromatic number may have arbitrarily large Sudoku number. In Section 4, we proved that extendable partial coloring problem is NP-complete. Extendable coloring and Sudoku coloring are nice tools for providing a k-coloring of G.",

A good drawing provides an understanding of the system to the reader, while a poor drawing may create confusion. A lot of information related to graphs and graph drawings can be stored using data structures where vertices represent entities and edges correspond to relationships among entities. In this paper, we have reviewed various studies to present the unsolved problems in the domain of graph drawing and to identify its applications in real life. By reviewing the existing approaches related to graph drawings, we found that there exist various drawing strategies that efficiently allow us to create drawings with a confined area, relatively high angular resolution, user-restrained aspect ratio, a lesser number of bends, etc. Moreover, there are several known algorithms for addressing different measures of graph drawing (such as symmetricity, spirality, rotation, etc.) but they are usually restricted to specific sub-classes of planar graphs. The present study provides readers a better understanding of the field of graph drawing and related problems.",

An inclusive vertex irregular d-distance labeling is a labeling defined as λ:V(G)→{1,…,k} such that the vertex weight, that is wt(v)=λ(v)+∑{u:1≤d(u,v)≤d}λ(u), are all distinct. The minimal value of the largest label used over all such labeling of graph G, denoted by disd0(G), is defined as inclusive d-distance irregularity strength of G. Others studies have concluded the lower bound value of dis10(G) and the value of dis10(Ln). In this paper, we generalize the lower bound value of disd0(G) for d≥2. We used the lower bound value of disd0(G) and the previous result of dis10(Ln) to investigate the value of dis20(Ln). As a result, we found the exact values of dis20(Ln) for the cases n≡0,3,4,5,8 (mod9), n = 7, and the value of the upper bound of dis20(Ln) for other n. We also found the relation of the value of disd0(Ln) and the value of dis2d0(P2n). Further investigation on path brought us to conclude the exact value of dis20(Pn),dis30(Pn) and dis40(Pn) for some n.",

The first of them states that for any bridgeless cubic graph G, edge e and i with 0≤i≤2, there are three perfect matchings F1,F2,F3 of G such that F1∩F2∩F3=0̸ and e belongs to exactly i of these perfect matchings.

Catlin in 1990 raised the problem of determining the reduced nonsupereulerian graphs with small orders, as such results are of particular importance in the study of Eulerian subgraphs and Hamiltonian line graphs. We determine all reduced graphs with order at most 14 and with few vertices of degree 2, extending former results of Chen and Chen in 2016. In 1985, Bauer proposed the problems of determining best possible sufficient conditions on minimum degree of a simple graph (or a simple bipartite graph, respectively) G to ensure that its line graph L(G) is Hamiltonian. These problems have been settled by Catlin and Lai in 1988, respectively. As an application of our main results, we prove the following for a connected simple graph G on n vertices: If δ ( G ) ≥ n 10 , then for sufficiently large n, L(G) is Hamilton-connected if and only if both κ ( G ) ≥ 3 and G is not nontrivially contractible to the Wagner graph. If G is bipartite and δ ( G ) > n 20 , then for sufficiently large n, L(G) is Hamilton-connected if and only if both κ ( G ) ≥ 3 and G is not nontrivially contractible to the Wagner graph.",

A graph is called edge-graceful if it admits an edge-graceful labeling. In 2005 Hefetz (2005) proved that a regular graph of even degree is edge-graceful if it contains a 2-factor consisting of mCn, where m,n are odd. In this article, we show that a regular graph of odd degree is edge-graceful if it contains either of two particular 3-factors, namely, a claw factor and a quasi-prism factor. We also introduce a new notion called edge-graceful deficiency, which is a parameter to measure how close a graph is away from being an edge-graceful graph. In particular the edge-graceful deficiency of a regular graph of even degree containing a Hamiltonian cycle is completely determined.",

    "abstract": "Potassium ion (K+) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and survival. K+ involves several biochemical and physiological pathways and hence its regulation is essential for normal metabolism and cellular functions. K+ homeostasis is maintained by many proteins in a coordinated manner. In barley at least fifteen proteins are directly involved in potassium transport. Interaction among these proteins forms a network along with forty-nine other proteins. We retrieved the potassium transporter interaction network from STRING and the network was analyzed for centrality measures using Cytoscape. Based on the centrality measures such as betweenness, bridging, closeness, degree, eccentricity, eigenvector, radiality and stress, the proteins MLOC_6793.2, MLOC_14891.1, MLOC_16944.1, MLOC_57408.2, and MLOC_63991.1 are found to be most important for the network. These five proteins interact among themselves and form a subgraph. MLOC_63991.1 is the most essential protein as it links other 4 proteins in the network. MLOC_63991.1 is a monomer with 769 amino acid sequences. This protein is predicted and described as potassium transporter.",

    "abstract": "For a simple connected graph G=(V(G),E(G)) and a positive integer k with 1⩽k⩽diam(G), a radio k-coloring of G is a mapping f:V(G)→{0,1,2,…} such that |f(u)−f(v)|⩾k+1−d(u,v) holds for each pair of distinct vertices u and v of G, where diam(G) is the diameter of G and d(u,v) is the distance between u and v in G. The span of a radio k-coloring f is the number maxu∈V(G)f(u). The main aim of the radio k-coloring problem is to determine the minimum span of a radio k-coloring of G, denoted by rck(G). Due to NP-hardness of this problem, people are finding lower bounds for rck(.) for particular families of graphs or general graphs G. In this article, we concentrate on finding upper bounds of radio k-chromatic number for general graphs and in consequence a coloring scheme depending on a partition of the vertex set V(G). We apply these bounds to cycle graph Cn and hypercube Qn and show that it is sharp when k is close to the diameter of these graphs.",

The least number of colors sufficient for a total coloring of graph G is called its total chromatic number and denoted by χ″(G). An adjacent vertex distinguishing (AVD)-total coloring of G is a total coloring with the additional property that for any adjacent vertices u and v, the set of colors used on the edges incident on u including the color of u is different from the set of colors used on the edges incident on v including the color of v. The adjacent vertex distinguishing (AVD)-total chromatic number of G, χa″(G) is the minimum number of colors required for a valid AVD-total coloring of G. It is conjectured that χ″(G)≤Δ(G)+2, which is known as total coloring conjecture and is one of the famous open problems. A graph for which the total coloring conjecture holds is called totally colorable graph. The problem of deciding whether χ″(G)=Δ(G)+1 or χ″(G=Δ(G)+2 for a totally colorable graph G is called the classification problem for total coloring. However, this classification problem is known to be NP-hard even for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition for a bipartite biconvex graph G to have χ″(G)=Δ(G)+1. Also, we propose a linear time algorithm to compute the total chromatic number of chain graphs, a proper subclass of biconvex graphs. We prove that the total coloring conjecture holds for the central graph of any graph. Finally, we obtain the AVD-total chromatic number of central graphs for basic graphs such as paths, cycles, stars and complete graphs.",

The span of an L(2, 1)-coloring f of G, denoted by span(f), is max {f(v):v∈V(G)}. The span of G, denoted by λ(G), is the minimum span of all possible L(2, 1)-colorings of G. If f is an L(2, 1)-coloring of a graph G with span k then an integer l is a hole in f if l∈(0,k) and there is no vertex v in G such that f(v) = l. A no-hole coloring is defined to be an L(2, 1)-coloring with no hole in it. An L(2, 1)-coloring is said to be irreducible if the color of none of the vertices in the graph can be decreased and yield another L(2, 1)-coloring of the same graph. An irreducible no-hole coloring of a graph G, in short inh-coloring of G, is an L(2, 1)-coloring of G which is both irreducible and no-hole. A graph G is inh-colorable if there exists an inh-coloring of it. For an inh-colorable graph G the lower inh-span or simply inh-span of G, denoted by λinh(G), is defined as λinh(G)=min{span (f):f is an inh-coloring of G}. In this paper, we prove that the Cartesian product of trees with paths are inh-colorable.",

We call the set S0 the seed set of the process, and refer to S0 as an irreversible k-threshold conversion set, or a k-conversion set, of G if St=V(G) for some t≥0. The k-conversion number ck(G) is the size of a minimum k-conversion set of G. A set X⊆V is a decycling set, or feedback vertex set, if and only if G[V−X] is acyclic. It is known that k-conversion sets in (k+1)-regular graphs coincide with decycling sets. We characterize k-regular graphs having a k-conversion set of size k, discuss properties of (k+1)-regular graphs having a k-conversion set of size k, and obtain a lower bound for ck(G) for (k+r)-regular graphs. We present classes of cubic graphs that attain the bound for c2(G), and others that exceed it—for example, we construct classes of 3-connected cubic graphs Hm of arbitrary girth that exceed the lower bound for c2(Hm) by at least m.",

The maximum order of a quorum coloring of G is called the quorum coloring number of G and is denoted ψq(G).

When such a labeling exists, G is called graceful. Rosa showed that a cycle Cn ( n ≥ 3 ) is graceful if and only if n is congruent to 0 or 3 modulo 4. Truszczyński conjectured that unicyclic graphs, except the cycles in Rosa's result are graceful. Several classes of unicyclic graphs are known to be graceful. In this article, we present a survey of results related to Truszczyński's conjecture. We also present a new class of graceful unicyclic graphs.",

This graph class has many practical applications in the study of the human genome as well as in signal processing for networks. The same class of graphs was also studied by Soto and Caro in 2015 with a different name, p -BOX(1) graphs. In our article, we consider a natural subclass of max-point-tolerance graphs, namely, proper max-point-tolerance graphs (proper MPTG), where intervals associated with the vertices are not contained in each other properly. We present the first characterization theorem of this graph class by defining certain linear ordering on the vertex set. In the course of this study, we prove proper max-point-tolerance graphs are asteroidal triple-free, and perfect. We also find that proper max-point-tolerance graphs are equivalent to unit max-point-tolerance graphs. Further, we show that MPTG (proper MPTG) and max-tolerance graphs (proper max-tolerance graphs) are incomparable. In conclusion, we demonstrate relations between proper MPTG with other variants of MPTG and max-tolerance graphs.",

In this paper we will characterize the infinite kernel perfect digraphs by means of finitely critical imperfect digraphs and strong components of its asymmetric part and then, by using some previous theorems for infinite digraphs, we will deduce several results from the main result. Richardson’s theorem establishes that if D is a finite digraph without cycles of odd length, then D has a kernel. In this paper we will show a generalization of this theorem for infinite digraphs.",

    "abstract": "Rosa, in his classical paper (Rosa, 1967) introduced a hierarchical series of labelings called ρ,σ,β and α labeling as a tool to settle Ringel’s Conjecture which states that if T is any tree with q edges then the complete graph K2q+1 can be decomposed into 2q+1 copies of T. Inspired by the result of Rosa, many researchers significantly contributed to the theory of graph decomposition using graph labeling. In this direction, in 2004, Blinco, El-Zanati and Vanden Eynden introduced γ-labeling as a stronger version of ρ-labeling. A function h defined on the vertex set of a graph G with q edges is called a γ-labeling if(i) h is a ρ-labeling of G,(ii) G is tripartite with vertex tripartition (A,B,C) with C={c} and b̄∈B such that (b̄,c) is the unique edge joining an element of B to c,(iii) for every edge (a,v)∈E(G) with a∈A, h(a)<h(v),(iv) h(c)−h(b̄)=q.Further, Blinco et al. proved a significant result that if a graph G with q edges admits a γ-labeling, then the complete graph K2cq+1 can be cyclically decomposed into 2cq+1 copies of the graph G, where c is any positive integer. Motivated by the result of Blinco et al., we show that a new family of almost bipartite graphs each admits γ-labeling. The new family of almost bipartite graphs is defined based on the supersubdivision graph of certain connected graph. Supersubdivision graph of a graph was introduced by Sethuraman and Selvaraju in Sethuraman and Selvaraju (2001). A graph is said to be a supersubdivision graph of a graph G with q edges, denoted SSD(G) if SSD(G) is obtained from G by replacing every edge ei of G by a complete bipartite graph K2,mi, 1≤i≤q, (where mi may vary for each edge ei) in such a way that the ends of ei are identified with the 2 vertices of the vertex part having two vertices of the complete bipartite graph of K2,mi after removing the edge ei of G. In the graph SSD(G), the vertices which originally belong to the graph G are called the base vertices of SSD(G) and all the other vertices of SSD(G) are called the non-base vertices of SSD(G). More precisely, we prove that if G is a connected graph containing a cycle Ck, where k≥6 and having a vertex of degree two with one of its adjacent vertices of degree one and its other adjacent vertex is of degree at least two, then certain supersubdivision graph of the graph G, SSD(G) plus an edge eˆ admits γ-labeling, where eˆ is added between a suitably chosen pair of non-base vertices of the graph SSD(G). Also, we discuss a related open problem.",

The graph G is said to be H-magic if there exists a total labeling f:V(G)∪E(G)→{1,2,3,…,|V(G)|+|E(G)|} such that for every subgraph H′ of G isomorphic to H, ∑v∈V(H′)f(v)+∑e∈E(H′)f(e) is constant. Additionally, the labeling f is called H-E supermagic labeling if f(E(G))={1,2,3,…,|E(G)|}. In this paper, we study Cm-E-supermagic labeling of some families of connected graphs.",

A Generalized Spline on an edge labeled graph G is a vertex labeling of G by elements of the ring R, such that the difference between any two adjacent vertex labels belongs to the ideal corresponding to the edge joining both the vertices. The set of generalized splines forms a subring of the product ring R|V|, with respect to the operations of coordinate-wise addition and multiplication. This ring is known as the generalized spline ring RG, defined on the edge labeled graph G, for the commutative ring R. We have considered particular graphs such as complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs and hypercubes, labeling the edges with the non-zero ideals of an integral domain R and have identified the generalized spline ring RG for these graphs. Also, general algorithms have been developed to find these splines for the above mentioned graphs, for any number of vertices and Python code has been written for finding these splines.",

In each round, a firefighter chooses a vertex to protect, and the fire then spreads to all unprotected neighbors of the burning vertex. This sequence continues until the fire can no longer spread. The objective is to maximize the number of saved vertices, necessitating a strategic approach by the firefighter. This problem serves as a simplistic model for scenarios such as disease spread in a network or people's movement under specific circumstances. To simulate a scenario with limited resources, we introduce a new firefighter method, involving the protection of one vertex and subdividing one edge. This method, achieved by adding a new vertex to the edge, effectively delays the burning of the vertex connected to the edge, providing additional time for the firefighter to protect it. Our investigation delves into the firefighter problem with subdividing edges, focusing on specific graphs. Notably, we present an optimal strategy for a graph with a maximum degree at most three.",

    "abstract": "An outer-independent triple Roman dominating function (OI[3]RDF) on a graph G=(V,E) is function f:V→{0,1,2,3,4} having the property that (i) if f(v)=0, then v must have either a neighbor assigned 4 or two neighbors one of which is assigned 3 and the other at least 2 or v has three neighbors all assigned 2; (ii) no two vertices assigned 0 are adjacent; (iii) if f(v)=1, then v must have either a neighbor assigned at least 3 or two neighbors assigned 2; (iv) if f(v)=2, then v must have one neighbor assigned at least 2. The weight of an OI[3]RDF is the sum of its function value over the whole set of vertices, and the outer-independent triple Roman domination number of G is the minimum weight of an OI[3]RDF on G. In this paper, we continue the study of outer-independent triple Roman domination number in graphs. First, we characterize all graphs with small or large outer-independent triple Roman domination number, and then we establish relationships with some other related parameters. Finally we present a sharp upper bound for the outer-independent triple Roman domination number of trees.",

A classical result in kernel theory is Richardson's theorem which establishes that if D is a finite digraph without odd cycles, then D has a kernel. In this paper, the original results are sufficient conditions for the existence of (A,B)-kernels in possibly infinite digraphs, in particular we will present some generalizations of Richardson's theorem for infinite digraphs.

A dominating induced matching (DIM) of G is an induced matching that dominates every edge of G. It is well known that, if they exist, all dominating induced matchings of G are of the same size. The dominating induced matching number of G, denoted by dim(G), is the size of any dominating induced matching of G. In this paper, we continue the study of dominating induced matchings. We prove that, if G has a DIM, then the induced matching number of G is equal to the independence number of its line graph L(G) and to the edge domination number of G. It is also shown that dim(G)≤2 dim(L(G)), provided that both G and L(G) have a DIM. We also present some bounds on dim(G). In particular, for a tree T with a DIM we show that ⌈n−l+13⌉≤dim(T)≤⌊n−1+l3⌋, where l is the number of leaves. Moreover, for a regular graph G we establish some Nordhaus-Gaddum type bounds.",

In 1994, Mitchem and Simoson introduced a stronger concept called super-edge-graceful labeling for some classes of graphs. Among many other interesting pioneering results, Mitchem and Simoson provided a simple but powerful recursive way of constructing super-edge-graceful trees of odd order. In this note, we present a stronger concept of “tight” super-edge-graceful labeling. Such a super-edge graceful labeling has an additional constraint on the edge and vertices with the largest and smallest labels. This concept enables us to recursively construct tight super-edge-graceful trees of any order. As applications, we provide insights on the characterization of super-edge-graceful trees of diameter 4, a question posed by Chung, Lee, Gao and Schaffer. We also observe infinite families of super-edge-graceful trees that can be generated from tight labelings. Given the direct applications of “tight” super-edge-graceful labeling to the study of super-edge-graceful labelings, we note that it is worthwhile to further examine recursively generated tight super-edge-graceful trees.",

A graph G on n edges is m-bonacci graceful if the vertices can be labeled with distinct integers from the set {0,1,2,…,Zn,m} such that the derived edge labels are the first n m-bonacci numbers. We show that complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, gear graphs, triangular grid graphs, and wheel graphs are not m-bonacci graceful. Almost all trees are m-bonacci graceful. We give m-bonacci graceful labeling to cycles, friendship graphs, polygonal snake graphs, and double polygonal snake graphs.",

In this paper, we partially solve this problem. In fact, we prove that the clique number and the coprime index of a zero-divisor graph of an ordered set and the zero-divisor graph of a ring Zpn coincide. Also, it is proved that the annihilating ideal graphs, the co-annihilating ideal graphs and the comaximal ideal graphs of commutative rings can be realized as the zero-divisor graphs of specially constructed posets. Hence the coprime index and the clique number coincide for these graphs as well.",

In recent times social networks play a major role in the thought process of people and influences the social movements, election and politics. The burning number is an ideal model to calculate the speed at which information is passed throughout the network. The burning number is a number which burns a graph in minimum number of steps. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm is proposed to compute the burning number of network graph based on selection of activators. The algorithm uses spanning tree, weighted centrality and uses a vertex set that are edge connected with previously burnt set. The network graph used were ca-sandiauths, ca-netscience, dolphin and mahindas. A significant improvement was found in the process of finding minimum burning number of the graph.",

We begin by showing that the decision problem associated with the independent k-rainbow bondage problem is NP-hard for general graphs for k≥2. Then various upper bounds on bir2(G) are established as well as exact values on it for some special graphs. In particular, for trees T of order at least three, it is shown that bir2(T)≤2.",

    "abstract": "Given a graph G=(V,E), not necessarily finite, a graphoidal cover of G means a collection Ψ of non-trivial paths in G called Ψ-edges, which are not necessarily open (not necessarily finite), such that every vertex of G is an internal vertex of at most one path in Ψ and every edge of G is in exactly one path in Ψ. The set of all graphoidal covers of a graph G=(V,E) is denoted by GG and for a given Ψ∈GG the ordered pair (G,Ψ) is called a graphoidally covered graph.Two vertices u and v of G are Ψ-adjacent if they are the ends of an open Ψ-edge. A set D of vertices in (G,Ψ) is Ψ-independent if no two vertices in D are Ψ-adjacent and is said to be Ψ-dominating if every vertex of G is either in D or is Ψ-adjacent to a vertex in D; G is γΨ(G)-definable (γiΨ(G)-definable) if (G,Ψ) has a finite Ψ-dominating (Ψ-independent Ψ-dominating) set. Clearly, if G is γiΨ(G)-definable, then G is γΨ(G)-definable and γΨ(G)≤γiΨ(G). Further if for any graphoidal cover Ψ of G such that γΨ(G)=γiΨ(G) then we call Ψ as a least-kernel graphoidal cover of G (in short, an LKG cover of G). A graph is said to be a least kernel graphoidal graph or simply an LKG graph if it possesses an LKG cover.This paper is based on a conjecture by Dr. B.D Acharya, “Every graph possesses an LKG cover”. After finding an example of a graph which does not possess an LKG cover, we obtain a necessary condition in the form of forbidden subgraph for a graph to be a least kernel graphoidal graph. We further prove that the condition is sufficient for a block graph with a unique nontrivial block. Thereafter we identify certain classes of graphs in which every graph possesses an LKG cover. Moreover, following our surmise that every graph with Δ≤6 possesses an LKG cover, we were able to show that every finite graph with Δ≤3 is indeed an LKG graph.",

An orthogonal point set embedding of a plane graph G is a point set embedding of G such that each edge is drawn as a sequence of horizontal and vertical line segments. A plane graph of the maximum degree five or more does not admit an orthogonal point set embedding. To deal with plane graphs of the maximum degree five or more, in this paper we introduce “L-shaped point set embeddings”. An L-shaped point set embedding of a plane graph G on a point set P is a point set embedding of G on P such that each edge is drawn by a sequence of two straight-line segments which create a 90° angle at their common end. In this paper we consider L -shaped point set embeddings of trees and Halin Graphs. Let P be a point set of n points on a 2 D plane such that no two points in P lie on a horizontal or on a vertical line. We show that every tree of n vertices as well as every Halin graph of n vertices has an L-shaped point set embedding on P .",

The adversary degree associated reconstruction number of a graph G, denoted adrn(G), is the minimum number k such that every collection of k dacards of G uniquely determines G. A strong double broom is the graph on at least 5 vertices obtained from a union of (at least two) internally vertex disjoint paths with same ends u and v by appending leaves at u and v. The strong double broom, obtained from a union of m internally vertex disjoint paths of order k with same ends u and v by appending n leaves at each u and v, is denoted by B(n,n,mPk).

This procedure is also applied to any collection of α-trees such that any pair of trees in this collection have stable sets with the same cardinalities. We also use this idea on other types of α-graphs. In addition, we present a family of α-trees of even diameter formed with four caterpillars of the same size.",

In this paper, we first consider the enumeration of asymmetric trees, a question posed by Erdős and Rényi. We show that the number of asymmetric subdivided stars is approximately q(n−1)−⌊n−12⌋, where q(n) is the number of ways to sum to n using distinct positive integers found by Hardy and Ramanujan in 1918. We also investigate cubic Hamiltonian graphs where asymmetry, where at least for small values of n, seem to be rare. It is known that none of the cubic Hamiltonian graphs on 4≤n≤10 vertices are asymmetric, and of the 80 cubic Hamiltonian graphs on 12 vertices only 5 are asymmetric. We give a construction of an infinite family of cubic Hamiltonian graphs that are asymmetric. Then we present an infinite family of quartic Hamiltonian graphs that are asymmetric. We use both of the above results for cubic and quartic asymmetric Hamiltonian graphs to establish the existence of k-regular asymmetric Hamiltonian graphs for all k≥3.",

    "abstract": "For a graph G with n vertices and m edges, the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix A(G) are known as eigenvalues of G. The sum of absolute values of eigenvalues of G is called the energy of G. The Laplacian matrix of G is defined as L(G)=D(G)−A(G) where D(G) is the diagonal matrix with (i,j)th entry is the degree of vertex vi. The collection of eigenvalues of L(G) with their multiplicities is called spectra of L(G). If μ1,μ2,⋯,μn are the eigenvalues of L(G) then the Laplacian energy LE(G) of G is defined as LE(G)=∑i=1n|μi−2mn|. It is always interesting and challenging as well to investigate the graphs which are L-equienergetic but L-noncopectral as L-cospectral graphs are obviously L-equienergetic. We have devised a method to construct L-equienergetic graphs which are L-noncospectral.",

The P-composition D[D1, …, Dn]P is the digraph obtained from D by replacing each vertex si of D by Di and adding an arc from each vertex of Di to each vertex of Dj if and only if those vertices have different color and si→sj is an arc of D (with i, j∈[n] and i≠j). Notice that this is a generalization of the usual composition D, whenever each of the digraphs D1, …, Dn are k-partite, we obtain a k-partite digraph as a P-composition and this digraph is a subdigraph of the usual composition D[D1, …, Dn]. In our case, we obtain a bipartite digraph. Particularly, the P-composition Cn[D1, …, Dn]P, when Cn is the 2- or 3-cycle and each Di is a semicomplete bipartite digraph, is also a semicomplete bipartite digraph. Gutin, Häggkvist and Manoussakis proved that a semicomplete bipartite digraph has a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if it is strong and has a cycle-factor.

In Petri net theory, matrices have been used to describe the structural behavior of the Petri net. Such matrices have been introduced for SPN which help in identifying relationships among the transitions and places of an SPN. Various subclasses of SPN are given along with characterizations of these subclasses using the matrices introduced. We consider ordinary SPNs (i.e. SPNs without multiple arcs) in the paper.",

The span of an L(2, 1)-coloring is the maximum color assigned by it. The minimum of span of all possible L(2, 1)-colorings of a graph G is called the span of G and is denoted by λ(G). An L(2, 1)-coloring f of a graph G is called (i) no-hole if f uses all the colors from {0,1,…,span f}, (ii) irreducible if no color of the vertices can be decreased and yield another L(2, 1)-coloring of G, (iii) irreducible no-hole (in short inh-coloring) if f is both irreducible and no-hole. The inh-span of an inh-colorable graph G, denoted by λinh(G), is defined as λinh(G)=min{span f: f is an inh−coloring of G}. The lexicographic product of two graphs G and H is the graph G°H with vertex set V(G)×V(H), in which two vertices (x, y) and (x′,y′) are adjacent precisely if xx′∈E(G), or x=x′ and yy′∈E(H). In this paper, we give improved upper bounds for span of lexicographic product of arbitrary graphs. We study inh-colorability of Pn°G, Cn°G, Cn°Km¯, and T°Km¯, where G is an arbitrary graph and T is a tree different from a star and a path. We show that for an arbitrary graph G1, if G1°Km¯ is inh-colorable then for any graph G2 with |V(G2)|=m and λ(G2)≥m−1, G1°G2 is inh-colorable and λinh(G1°G2)≥λinh(G1°Km¯).",

Eigenvalues of D(G) are called the distance eigenvalues of G. The m-generation n-prism graph or (m, n)-prism graph can be defined in an iterative way where (1,n)-prism graph is an n-vertex cycle. In this paper, we first find the number of zero eigenvalues of the distance matrix of a (m, n)-prism graph. Next, we find some quotient matrix that contains m nonzero distance eigenvalues of a (m, n)-prism graph. Our next result gives the rest of the nonzero distance eigenvalues of a (m, n)-prism graph in terms of distance eigenvalues of a cycle. Finally, we find the characteristic polynomial of the distance matrix of a (m, n)-prism graph. Applying this result, we provide the explicit distance eigenvalues of a (3,n)-prism graph.",

In contrast, the situation becomes different for the complement of a line graph. In this paper, it is shown that γ(G¯)≤3 for a claw-free G with α(G)≥3, and thus determining the domination number of the complement of a claw-free G with α(G)≥3 is polynomial, where α(G) is the independence number of G. Furthermore, if a graph G is not a star, has no isolated vertex and isolated edge, then 2≤γ(J(G))≤3, where J(G) is the complement of the line graph L(G) of G. If a graph G is not a star, and has no isolated vertex, τ(J(G))=n−Δ(G)−1, provided Δ(G)≥6. For the case when Δ(G)≤5, τ(J(G)) is also given.
