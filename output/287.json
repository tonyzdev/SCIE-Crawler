    "abstract": "Abstract As the next-generation manufacturing system, intelligent manufacturing enables better quality, higher productivity, lower cost, and increased manufacturing flexibility. The concept of sustainability is receiving increasing attention, and sustainable manufacturing is evolving. The digital twin is an emerging technology used in intelligent manufacturing that can grasp the state of intelligent manufacturing systems in real-time and predict system failures. Sustainable intelligent manufacturing based on a digital twin has advantages in practical applications. To fully understand the intelligent manufacturing that provides the digital twin, this study reviews both technologies and discusses the sustainability of intelligent manufacturing. Firstly, the relevant content of intelligent manufacturing, including intelligent manufacturing equipment, systems, and services, is analyzed. In addition, the sustainability of intelligent manufacturing is discussed. Subsequently, a digital twin and its application are introduced along with the development of intelligent manufacturing based on the digital twin technology. Finally, combined with the current status, the future development direction of intelligent manufacturing is presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), which considers the cost, sustainability, flexibility, and quality, has been actively explored by scholars. Nanoadditive phases have been widely investigated as atomizing media for MQL, aimed at enhancing the heat transfer and friction reduction performance of vegetable-oil-based biolubricants. However, the industrial application of nano-enhanced biolubricants (NEBL) in grinding wheels and workpiece interfaces as a cooling and lubricating medium still faces serious challenges, which are attributed to the knowledge gap in the current mapping between the properties and grindability of NEBL. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of research developments in NEBL grinding, highlighting the key challenges, and clarifies the application of blind spots. Firstly, the physicochemical properties of the NEBL are elaborated from the perspective of the base fluid and nanoadditive phase. Secondly, the excellent grinding performance of the NEBL is clarified by its distinctive film formation, heat transfer, and multiple-field mobilization capacity. Nanoparticles with high thermal conductivity and excellent extreme-pressure film-forming properties significantly improved the high-temperature and extreme-friction conditions in the grinding zone. Furthermore, the sustainability of applying small amounts of NEBL to grinding is systematically evaluated, providing valuable insights for the industry. Finally, perspectives are proposed to address the engineering and scientific bottlenecks of NEBL. This review aims to contribute to the understanding of the effective mechanisms of NEBL and the development of green grinding technologies.",

However, SiC p /Al composites are considered as difficult-to-cut materials due to the hard ceramic reinforcement, which causes severe machinability degradation by increasing cutting tool wear, cutting force, etc. To improve the machinability of SiC p /Al composites, many techniques including conventional and nonconventional machining processes have been employed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the machining performance of SiC p /Al composites using conventional machining, i.e., turning, milling, drilling, and grinding, and using nonconventional machining, namely electrical discharge machining (EDM), powder mixed EDM, wire EDM, electrochemical machining, and newly developed high-efficiency machining technologies, e.g., blasting erosion arc machining. This research not only presents an overview of the machining aspects of SiC p /Al composites using various processing technologies but also establishes optimization parameters as reference of industry applications.",

As for commercial applications in our daily life, there are still some obstacles for VO2-based smart coatings, such as the high phase transition temperature, optical properties (luminous transmittance and solar modulation ability), environmental stability in a long-time period, as well as mass production.

    "abstract": "Micro-milling is a precision manufacturing process with broad applications across the biomedical, electronics, aerospace, and aeronautical industries owing to its versatility, capability, economy, and efficiency in a wide range of materials. In particular, the micro-milling process is highly suitable for very precise and accurate machining of mold prototypes with high aspect ratios in the microdomain, as well as for rapid micro-texturing and micro-patterning, which will have great importance in the near future in bio-implant manufacturing. This is particularly true for machining of typical difficult-to-machine materials commonly found in both the mold and orthopedic implant industries. However, inherent physical process constraints of machining arise as macro-milling is scaled down to the microdomain. This leads to some physical phenomena during micro-milling such as chip formation, size effect, and process instabilities. These dynamic physical process phenomena are introduced and discussed in detail. It is important to remember that these phenomena have multifactor effects during micro-milling, which must be taken into consideration to maximize the performance of the process. The most recent research on the micro-milling process inputs is discussed in detail from a process output perspective to determine how the process as a whole can be improved. Additionally, newly developed processes that combine conventional micro-milling with other technologies, which have great prospects in reducing the issues related to the physical process phenomena, are also introduced. Finally, the major applications of this versatile precision machining process are discussed with important insights into how the application range may be further broadened.",

    "abstract": "Separation and purification of critical metal ions such as rare-earth elements (REEs), scandium and niobium from their minerals is difficult and often determines if extraction is economically and environmentally feasible. Solvent extraction is a commonly used metal-ion separation process, usually favored because of its simplicity, speed and wide scope, which is why it is often employed for separating trace metals from their minerals. However, the types of solvents widely used for the recovery of metal ions have adverse environmental impact. Alternatives to solvent extraction have been explored and advances in separation technologies have shown commercial establishment of liquid membranes as an alternative to conventional solvent extraction for the recovery of metals and other valuable materials. Liquid membrane transport incorporates solvent extraction and membrane separation in one continuously operating system. Both methods conventionally use solvents that are harmful to the environment, however, the introduction of ionic liquids (ILs) over the last decade is set to minimize the environmental impact of both solvent extraction and liquid membrane separation processes. ILs are a family of organic molten salts with low or negligible vapour pressure which may be formed below 100 °C. Such liquids are also highly thermally stable and less toxic. Their ionic structure makes them thermodynamically favorable solvents for the extraction of metallic ions. The main aim of this article is to review the current achievements in the separation of REE, scandium, niobium and vanadium from their minerals, using ILs in either solvent extraction or liquid membrane processes. The mechanism of separation using ILs is discussed and the engineering constraints to their application are identified.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The machining accuracy of computer numerical control machine tools has always been a focus of the manufacturing industry. Among all errors, thermal error affects the machining accuracy considerably. Because of the significant impact of Industry 4.0 on machine tools, existing thermal error modeling methods have encountered unprecedented challenges in terms of model complexity and capability of dealing with a large number of time series data. A thermal error modeling method is proposed based on bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) deep learning, which has good learning ability and a strong capability to handle a large group of dynamic data. A four-layer model framework that includes BiLSTM, a feedforward neural network, and the max pooling is constructed. An elaborately designed algorithm is proposed for better and faster model training. The window length of the input sequence is selected based on the phase space reconstruction of the time series. The model prediction accuracy and model robustness were verified experimentally by three validation tests in which thermal errors predicted by the proposed model were compensated for real workpiece cutting. The average depth variation of the workpiece was reduced from approximately 50 µm to less than 2 µm after compensation. The reduction in maximum depth variation was more than 85%. The proposed model was proved to be feasible and effective for improving machining accuracy significantly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies such as fused deposition modeling (FDM) rely on the quality of manufactured products and the process capability. Currently, the dimensional accuracy and stability of any AM process is essential for ensuring that customer specifications are satisfied at the highest standard, and variations are controlled without significantly affecting the functioning of processes, machines, and product structures. This study aims to investigate the effects of FDM fabrication conditions on the dimensional accuracy of cylindrical parts. In this study, a new class of experimental design techniques for integrated second-order definitive screening design (DSD) and an artificial neural network (ANN) are proposed for designing experiments to evaluate and predict the effects of six important operating variables. By determining the optimum fabrication conditions to obtain better dimensional accuracies for cylindrical parts, the time consumption and number of complex experiments are reduced considerably in this study. The optimum fabrication conditions generated through a second-order DSD are verified with experimental measurements. The results indicate that the slice thickness, part print direction, and number of perimeters significantly affect the percentage of length difference, whereas the percentage of diameter difference is significantly affected by the raster-to-raster air gap, bead width, number of perimeters, and part print direction. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that a second-order DSD integrated with an ANN is a more attractive and promising methodology for AM applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are currently employed for the manufacturing of completely functional parts and have gained the attention of high-technology industries such as the aerospace, automotive, and biomedical fields. This is mainly due to their advantages in terms of low material waste and high productivity, particularly owing to the flexibility in the geometries that can be generated. In the tooling industry, specifically the manufacturing of dies and molds, AM technologies enable the generation of complex shapes, internal cooling channels, the repair of damaged dies and molds, and an improved performance of dies and molds employing multiple AM materials. In the present paper, a review of AM processes and materials applied in the tooling industry for the generation of dies and molds is addressed. AM technologies used for tooling applications and the characteristics of the materials employed in this industry are first presented. In addition, the most relevant state-of-the-art approaches are analyzed with respect to the process parameters and microstructural and mechanical properties in the processing of high-performance tooling materials used in AM processes. Concretely, studies on the AM of ferrous (maraging steels and H13 steel alloy) and non-ferrous (stellite alloys and WC alloys) tooling alloys are also analyzed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Possessing an efficient production line relies heavily on the availability of the production equipment. Thus, to ensure that the required function for critical equipment is in compliance, and unplanned downtime is minimized, succeeding with the field of maintenance is essential for industrialists. With the emergence of advanced manufacturing processes, incorporating predictive maintenance capabilities is seen as a necessity. Another field of interest is how modern value chains can support the maintenance function in a company. Accessibility to data from processes, equipment and products have increased significantly with the introduction of sensors and Industry 4.0 technologies. However, how to gather and utilize these data for enabling improved decision making within maintenance and value chain is still a challenge. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate on how maintenance and value chain data can collectively be used to improve value chain performance through prediction. The research approach includes both theoretical testing and industrial testing. The paper presents a novel concept for a predictive maintenance platform, and an artificial neural network (ANN) model with sensor data input. Further, a case of a company that has chosen to apply the platform, with the implications and determinants of this decision, is also provided. Results show that the platform can be used as an entry-level solution to enable Industry 4.0 and sensor data based predictive maintenance.",

This paper proposes an intuitive user interface for programming welding robots remotely using augmented reality (AR) with haptic feedback. The proposed system uses a depth camera to reconstruct the surfaces of workpieces. A haptic input device is used to allow users to define welding paths along these surfaces. An AR user interface is developed to allow users to visualize and adjust the orientation of the welding torch. Compared with the traditional robotic welding path programming methods which rely on prior CAD models or contact between the robot end-effector and the workpiece, this proposed approach allows for fast and intuitive remote robotic welding path programming without prior knowledge of CAD models of the workpieces. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is a user-friendly interface and can assist users in obtaining an accurate welding path.",

    "abstract": "Abstract High-speed grinding (HSG) is an advanced technology for precision machining of difficult-to-cut materials in aerospace and other fields, which could solve surface burns, defects and improve surface integrity by increasing the linear speed of the grinding wheel. The advantages of HSG have been preliminarily confirmed and the equipment has been built for experimental research, which can achieve a high grinding speed of more than 300 m/s. However, it is not yet widely used in manufacturing due to the insufficient understanding on material removal mechanism and characteristics of HSG machine tool. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of HSG technologies. A new direction for adding auxiliary process in HSG is proposed. Firstly, the combined influence law of strain hardening, strain rate intensification, and thermal softening effects on material removal mechanism was revealed, and models of material removal strain rate, grinding force and grinding temperature were summarized. Secondly, the constitutive models under high strain rate boundaries were summarized by considering various properties of material and grinding parameters. Thirdly, the change law of material removal mechanism of HSG was revealed when the thermodynamic boundary conditions changed, by introducing lubrication conditions such as minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), nano-lubricant minimum quantity lubrication (NMQL) and cryogenic air (CA). Finally, the mechanical and dynamic characteristics of the key components of HSG machine tool were summarized, including main body, grinding wheel, spindle and dynamic balance system. Based on the content summarized in this paper, the prospect of HSG is put forward. This study establishes a solid foundation for future developments in the field and points to promising directions for further exploration.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of Industry 4.0, maintenance is considered to be a specific area of action that is needed to successfully sustain a competitive advantage. For instance, predictive maintenance will be central for asset utilization, service, and after-sales in realizing Industry 4.0. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) is also central for Industry 4.0, and offers data-driven methods. The aim of this article is to develop a new maintenance model called deep digital maintenance (DDM). With the support of theoretical foundations in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and maintenance, a concept for DDM is proposed. In this paper, the planning module of DDM is investigated in more detail with realistic industrial data from earlier case studies. It is expected that this planning module will enable integrated planning (IPL) where maintenance and production planning can be more integrated. The result of the testing shows that both the remaining useful life (RUL) and the expected profit loss indicator (PLI) of ignoring the failure can be calculated for the planning module. The article concludes that further research is needed in testing the accuracy of RUL, classifying PLI for different failure modes, and testing of other DDM modules with industrial case studies.",

    "abstract": "The manufacturing of bioimplants not only involves selecting proper biomaterials with satisfactory bulk physicochemical properties, but also requires special treatments on surface chemistry or topography to direct a desired host response. The lifespan of a bioimplant is also critically restricted by its surface properties. Therefore, developing proper surface treatment technologies has become one of the research focuses in biomedical engineering.

    "abstract": "The fast-growing economy and the gradually established highway system have boosted the road transportation for both passenger and cargo over the last decade in China. From 2000 to 2010 Chinese GDP increased by around 10.15% annually and the sales of medium and heavy trucks by around 18.87% (sales increased from 0.2 million in 2000 to 1.3 million in 2010) according to the National Bureau of Statistics of People's Republic of China. Today commercial vehicles consume almost the same amount of fuel as passenger cars in China although the number of commercial vehicles is only about one fourth of passenger cars. It is estimated that around 50% of imported fuel to China each year will be consumed by vehicle transportation. This situation will worsen fuel shortage problems in the long run and at the same time it is partially responsible for the ever-worsening air pollution in China. Due to the widespread overloading in China, lightweight development in commercial vehicles has fallen far behind that of passenger cars with the consequences that Chinese commercial vehicles consume in average about 20% more fuel, especially the heavy trucks, compared to European models. Under these circumstances it is essential to reduce the vehicle fuel consumption and increase the transport efficiency. The key solution thereby is to implement lightweight design in commercial vehicles as it has been successfully practiced over the last decade in the passenger cars. This paper summarizes highlights given in presentations during the \"International seminar on the application of high strength steels in light weight commercial vehicles\" with the focus on the development and application of Nb alloyed high performance steels made for lightweight commercial vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Ti-6Al-4V has a wide range of applications, especially in the aerospace field; however, it is a difficult-to-cut material. In order to achieve sustainable machining of Ti-6Al-4V, multiple objectives considering not only economic and technical requirements but also the environmental requirement need to be optimized simultaneously. In this work, the optimization design of process parameters such as type of inserts, feed rate, and depth of cut for Ti-6Al-4V turning under dry condition was investigated experimentally. The major performance indexes chosen to evaluate this sustainable process were radial thrust, cutting power, and coefficient of friction at the tool-chip interface. Considering the nonlinearity between the various objectives, grey relational analysis (GRA) was first performed to transform these indexes into the corresponding grey relational coefficients, and then kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) was applied to extract the kernel principal components and determine the corresponding weights which showed their relative importance. Eventually, kernel grey relational grade (KGRG) was proposed as the optimization criterion to identify the optimal combination of process parameters. The results of the range analysis show that the depth of cut has the most significant effect, followed by the feed rate and type of inserts. Confirmation tests clearly show that the modified method combining GRA with KPCA outperforms the traditional GRA method with equal weights and the hybrid method based on GRA and PCA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been widely applied in various complex, dynamic processes at atomistic scale, because an MD simulation can provide some deformation details of materials in nano-processing and thus help to investigate the critical and important issues which cannot be fully revealed by experiments. Extensive research with the aid of MD simulation has provided insights for the development of nanotechnology. This paper reviews the fundamentals of nano-machining from the aspect of material structural effects, such as single crystalline, polycrystalline and amorphous materials. The classic MD simulations of nano-indentation and nano-cutting which have aimed to investigate the machining mechanism are discussed with respect to the effects of tool geometry, material properties and machining parameters. On nano-milling, the discussion focuses on the understanding of the grooving quality in relation to milling conditions.",

    "abstract": "Development of artificial joints is a great progress for joint replacement operations of human being, but the short longevity of prostheses has concerned both industries and researchers since the advent of modern implants. Thus, continuous improvements have been made alongside the clinical applications. The methodologies to inspect the potential properties of new designs have also seen many advances. The test machines have evolved from easy pin-on-disk configuration to the modern joint simulator. Besides, various wear traces provided by testing machines are investigated greatly, and multi-directional files are recommended as motion profiles for in vitro testing. The typical testing parameters, like sliding speed or loading profile, are discussed in this article, and their working mechanisms are described in detail. Meanwhile, the calf or bovine serum has been regarded as the gold standard for testing lubricant, and the future trend of fluid will be focused on investigating the effects of lubricant composites on the tribological properties. Hard particles and proteins are discussed as well, and their effects on the wear mechanisms are the focus. Finally, various approaches to measure the wear rate, wear factor and the thickness of lubricant film are presented, and suggestions are given for the development in future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the last two decades, industrial applications of augmented reality (AR) have been incorporated in sectors such as automotive or aeronautics in tasks including manufacturing, maintenance, and assembly. However, AR’s potential has yet to be demonstrated in the railway sector due to its complexity and difficulties in automating tasks. This work aims to present an AR system based on HoloLens 2 to assist the assembly process of insulation panels in the railway sector significantly decreasing the time required to perform the assembly. Along with the technical description of the system, an exhaustive validation process is provided where the assembly using the developed system is compared to the traditional assembly method as used by a company that has facilitated a case study. The results obtained show that the system presented outperforms the traditional solution by 78% in the time spent in the localization subtask, which means a 47% decrease in the global assembly time. Additionally, it decreases the number of errors in 88% of the cases, obtaining a more precise and almost error-free assembly process. Finally, it is also proven that using AR removes the dependence on users’ prior knowledge of the system to facilitate assembly.",

Compression and microhardness testing onto the resulting 3D printed copper current collector are shown to demonstrate adequate mechanical performance. Electrophoretic deposition of graphite as a negative electrode active material and other additives was then performed onto the 3D printed copper collector, with the intention to demonstrate energy storage functionality. Half-cell electrochemical cycling of the 3D multi-material current collector/negative electrode versus lithium metal finally demonstrates that structural battery components can be successfully obtained through this approach.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of chatter in milling processes was investigated in this study. The prediction of the stability lobes of metal cutting processes requires a model of the cutting force and a model of the dynamic machine tool behavior. Parameter uncertainties in the models may lead to significant differences between the predicted and measured stability behavior. One approach towards robust stability consists of running a large number of simulations with a random sample of uncertain parameters and determining the confidence levels for the chatter vibrations, which is a time-consuming task. In this paper, an efficient implementation of the multi frequency solution and the construction of an approximate solution is presented. The approximate solution requires the explicit calculation of the multi frequency solution only at a few parameter points, and the approximation error can be kept small. This study found that the calculation of the robust stability lobe diagram, which is based on the approximate solution, is significantly more efficient than an explicit calculation at all random parameter points. The numerically determined robust stability diagrams were in good agreement with the experimentally determined stability lobes.",

    "abstract": "In the motorized spindle system of a computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool, internal heat sources are formed during high-speed rotation; these cause thermal errors and affect the machining accuracy. To address this problem, in this study, a thermal resistance network model of the motorized spindle system is established based on the heat transfer theory. The heat balance equations of the critical thermal nodes are established according to this model with Kirchhoff’s law. Then, they are solved using the Newmark-β method to obtain the temperature of each main component, and steady thermal analysis and transient thermal analysis of the motorized spindle system are performed. In order to obtain accurate thermal characteristics of the spindle system, the thermal-conduction resistance of each component and the thermal-convection resistance between the cooling system and the components of the spindle system are accurately obtained considering the effect of the heat exchanger on the temperature of the coolant in the cooling system. Simultaneously, high-precision magnetic temperature sensors are used to detect the temperature variation of the spindle in the CNC machining center at different rotational speeds. The experimental results demonstrate that the thermal resistance network model can predict the temperature field distribution in the spindle system with reasonable accuracy. In addition, the influences of the rotational speed and cooling conditions on the temperature increase of the main components of the spindle system are analyzed. Finally, a few recommendations are provided to improve the thermal performance of the spindle system under different operational conditions.",

A large share of industrial castings is made from iron and steel alloys, combining attractive properties and low production cost. Upgrading of properties in cast iron and steel is mainly achieved by alloying and in fewer cases by heat treatment. Molybdenum is an important alloying element in that respect, increasing strength, hardness and toughness. It also facilitates particular heat treatments such as austempering. The paper describes the metallurgical functionality of molybdenum alloying in iron-based castings and demonstrates its effectiveness for applications in the automotive and mining industry.",

This paper outlines two neural network models to analyze and classify acoustic signals emanating from machines: (i) a backpropagation neural network (BP-NN); and (ii) a convolutional neural network (CNN). Microphones are used to collect acoustic data for training models from a computer numeric control (CNC) lathe. Numerical experiments demonstrate that CNN performs better than the BP-NN.",

The process of carburizing lower to medium carbon containing steel can generally provide this combination of properties and has been practiced for several decades. Such steel is essential in the vehicle power-train, machines and power generation equipment. However, the increasing performance demands by such applications as well as economical considerations forced steel producers to develop better alloys and fabricators to design more efficient manufacturing processes. The present paper describes recent concepts for alloy design optimization of carburizing steel and demonstrates the forthcoming beneficial consequences with regard to manufacturing processes and final properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thin film structures are becoming increasingly more important for industrial applications such as the making of solar panels, microelectronic devices and micro systems. However, the challenges encountered in the machining of thin film structures have been a bottleneck that impedes further wide spread uses of such structures. The development of material removal processes that are capable of producing a damage free surface at high removal rates is critical for cost effective production. Such development relies highly on a comprehensive understanding of the deformation, failure and removal mechanisms of thin film structures involved in mechanical loading. In this paper, the current understanding of the deformation characteristics of thin film systems was reviewed to provide important insights into the interfacial failure under mechanical loading, with focuses on the interfacial failure mechanisms and existing problems in the machining of thin film structures. The key characterization techniques were outlined. In particular, the recent progress in the abrasive machining of a thin film multilayer structure was summarized. The potential research directions were also presented in the end of the review.",

This paper addresses this issue of practical significance to production efficiency. Herein, a robust optimization model for this problem is formulated to hedge against uncertainty. Moreover, the counterpart of the robust optimization model is developed by duality. A hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed to solve this problem. In this algorithm, a heuristic method is utilized to seed the initial population. In addition, an adaptive local search procedure and a discrete Levy flight are hybridized with the genetic algorithm (GA) to enhance the performance of the algorithm. The effectiveness of the HGA is tested on a set of benchmark instances. Furthermore, the effect of uncertainty parameters on production efficiency is also investigated.",

The increasing demand for high-performance products to be used in infrastructural projects as well as in production of consumer and capital goods has been driving this development until today. The installation of state-of-the-art steel making and rolling facilities has provided the possibility of processing the most advanced steel grades. The production of high-performance steel grades relies on specific alloying elements of which molybdenum is one of the most powerful. China is nearly self-sufficient in molybdenum supplies. This paper highlights the potential and advantages of molybdenum alloying over the entire range of flat-rolled steel products. Specific aspects of steel property improvement with respect to particular applications are indicated.",

    "abstract": "A physical-based constitutive model was developed to model the viscoplastic flow behavior and microstructure evolution of AZ80 magnesium alloy during the hot working process. The competing deformation mechanisms, including work hardening, dynamic recovery, and dynamic recrystallization, in an isothermal compression environment were considered in the model. The internal state variables, including the normalized dislocation density and recrystallized volume fraction, were incorporated into the model to articulate the microstructure evolution during hot deformation. The kinetic condition critical for dynamic recrystallization, considering the effects of the deformation temperature and strain rate, was obtained by employing both the Poliak-Jonas criterion and Zener-Hollomon parameter. Microstructure observations indicate that the recrystallized volume fraction increases with decreasing Z parameter at constant strain, which is consistent with the predicted kinetics model. Based on the developed model, a good correlation was also obtained between the predicted and experimental flow stress. The results indicate a good predictability of the model in describing the hot deformation behavior and microstructure evolution of AZ80 magnesium alloy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The precision casting method based on alumina-based ceramic cores is one of the main techniques used to manufacture hollow turbine blades. Additive manufacturing (AM) technology provides an alternate solution to fabricating ceramic cores quickly and precisely. As the complexity of the structure increases and the strength of the material improves, the leaching process of the cores becomes more complicated. This study proposes a compound pore-forming method to increase the porosity of ceramic cores by adding a preformed-pore agent and materials that convert to easy-to-corrode phases. The preformed-pore agents (e.g., carbon fibers) can be burned off during sintering to form pores before the leaching, and the easy-to-corrode phases (e.g., CaCO 3 , SiO 2 , β -Al 2 O 3 ) can be leached firstly to form pores during the leaching process. The pores formed in the aforementioned two stages increase the contact area of the cores and leaching solution, thus improving the leaching rate. In the current study, the additive amount of the preformed-pore agent was optimized, and the effect of the easy-to-corrode phases on the comprehensive properties of the cores was then compared. Based on this, the corresponding model was established.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Impact hydroforming (IHF), as a novel sheet metal forming technology with the advantages of high strain rate forming and flexible liquid loading, is highly suitable for efficiently manufacturing aluminum complex-shaped sheet parts. In this paper, deformation characteristics of complex sheet parts under IHF are systematically investigated. The mechanical properties of 2024 aluminum alloy under a wide range of strain rates (10 −3 s −1 –3.3×10 3 s −1 ) were studied. It indicated that the elongation of 2024 aluminum alloy was improved by 116.01% under strain rates of 3.306 × 10 3 s −1 , referring to 10 −3 s −1 . Further, a complex-shaped part with symmetrical and asymmetrical structures was selected. The deformation characteristics of sheet and role of inertial effect under IHF were investigated with well-developed solid–liquid coupling finite element (SLC-FE) model with high accuracy. Differentiating deformation tendency is found for symmetrical structure with notably prior deformation at central zone, showing a “bulging” profile at initial forming stage. Whereas, synchronous deformation is presented for asymmetrical structure with a “flat” profile. Additionally, distinctive inertial effect was observed at different positions change for both symmetrical and asymmetrical structures, in which lower values were resulted at their central regions. Meanwhile, the inertial effect evolved with the impacting speed. Specially, larger difference of inertial effect was observed with increasing impacting speed.",

To adapt to the increasing challenges of the traditional manufacturing industry transforming toward service-oriented and innovative manufacturing, this paper proposes a product platform architecture based on cloud manufacturing. Firstly, a framework for the product platform for cloud manufacturing was built. The proposed architecture is composed of five layers: resource, cloud technology, cloud service, application, and user layers. Then, several key enabling technologies for forming the product platform were studied. Finally, the product platform for cloud manufacturing built by a company was taken as an application example to illustrate the architecture and functions of the system. The validity and superiority of the architecture were verified.",

This difference is manifest in both carbon steels and stainless steels, suggesting a significant opportunity for more widespread use of molybdenum in the future as China follows its self-reliance policy, calling for more sophisticated materials. Active market development, as being pursued by the International Molybdenum Association (IMOA), is a key asset in that respect.

    "abstract": "Abrading is a very important sub-technology of the surface treatment technology with vast applications in the industry. This study aims at analyzing the inherent laws of friction systems during abrading. In particle flow code modeling, the abrading process can be simplified to the movement of particles in a parallel-plate shear friction system. In this study, the PFC2D software is used to construct the particle flow friction system with the set of parallel plates and the model parameters according to the abrading processing equipment and processing materials, control the simulation of a single variable, and compare the output data to estimate the impact of change of parameters on the force chain. The simulation results show that the shear dilatancy can be divided into three stages: plastic strain, macroscopic failure, and granular recombination stages. The distribution and load rates of the weak force chains depend on the load, velocity, friction coefficient between granules, granular diameter, and number of granular layers. The number of granular layers and the load increase cause the direction of the force chain to be oriented with the vertical direction, and the force chains move toward the horizontal direction as the velocity increases. The increase in load does not cause the shear dilatancy stage to occur; the velocity, friction coefficient between granules, and granular diameter increase cause the shear dilatancy to occur gradually.",

In this respect manufacturing technology has to adapt to the altered (and typically reduced) formability and weldability of modern high strength steel. However, this is a rather passive approach from a manufacturing point of view. An indeed much more powerful approach is to generate synergies between innovative manufacturing technology, design and material enabling additional weight savings and efficiency gains. Laser-based material processing, in particular laser welding, offers a wide range of opportunities in this sense. Furthermore, hot stamping and roll forming open up new possibilities for advanced manufacturing of commercial vehicle components. Applications and examples of these technologies will be given in terms of producing innovative semi-products as well as final components.",

The machining zone was divided into three regions: primary, secondary and tertiary deformation zones. The tendency of particles to fracture in each deformation zone was investigated. The findings of this study were also discussed with respect to the experimental results available in the literature. It was found that particles at the cutting path in the tertiary deformation zone fractured as it interacted with tool. In the secondary deformation zone, particles interacted with other particles as well as cutting tool. This caused debonding and fracture of huge number of particles as those were moving up along the rake face with the chips. No particle fracture was noted at the primary deformation zone. The results obtained from finite element analysis were very similar to those obtained from experimental studies.",

The work material was fabricated using direct laser deposition (DLD) technology. The experiment included precision milling of tungsten carbide samples with a monolithic torus cubic boron nitride tool and grinding with diamond and alumina cup wheels. An optical surface profiler was applied to the measurements of surface textures and roughness profiles. In addition, the micro-geometry of the milling cutter was measured with the application of an optical device. The surface roughness height was also estimated with the application of a model, which included kinematic-geometric parameters and minimum uncut chip thickness. The research revealed the occurrence of micro-grooves on the machined surface. The surface roughness height calculated on the basis of the traditional kinematic-geometric model was incompatible with the measurements. However, better agreement between the theoretical and experimental values was observed for the minimum uncut chip thickness model.",

Using a concentrated acid electrolyte, the polarization curve and current density transient are observed. For a NaOH electrolyte, the effects of interelectrode gap and electrolyte concentration on electropolishing are investigated. The differences in electropolishing characteristics are compared among different electrolyte types. Microholes are etched on the electropolished tungsten surface to determine the minimum material removal depth on the tungsten surface. Experimental results indicate the color effect due to a change in the thickness of the oxide film on the tungsten surface after electropolishing with a concentrated acid electrolyte. The surface roughness decreases with the interelectrode gap width owing to the increased current density when using the NaOH electrolyte. However, the electropolishing effect is less prominent with a significantly smaller gap because the generated bubbles are unable to escape from the narrow working gap in time. A material removal depth of less than 10 nm is achieved on the tungsten surface in an area of diameter 300 µm, using the electrochemical etching method.",

    "abstract": "The limitations of significant tool wear and tool breakage of commercially available fluted micro-end mill tools often lead to ineffective and inefficient manufacturing, while surface quality and geometric dimensions remain unacceptably poor. This is especially true for machining of difficult-to-machine (DTM) materials, such as super alloys and ceramics. Such conventional fluted micro-tool designs are generally down scaled from the macro-milling tool designs. However, simply scaling such designs from the macro to micro domain leads to inherent design flaws, such as poor tool rigidity, poor tool strength and weak cutting edges, ultimately ending in tool failure. Therefore, in this article a design process is first established to determine optimal micro-end mill tool designs for machining some typical DTM materials commonly used in manufacturing orthopaedic implants and micro-feature moulds. The design process focuses on achieving robust stiffness and mechanical strength to reduce tool wear, avoid tool chipping and tool breakage in order to efficiently machine very hard materials. Then, static stress and deflection finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out to identify stiffness and rigidity of the tool design in relation to the maximum deformations, as well as the Von Mises stress distribution at the cutting edge of the designed tools. Following analysis and further optimisation of the FEA results, a verified optimum tool design is established for micro-milling DTM materials. An experimental study is then carried out to compare the optimum tool design to commercial tools, in regards to cutting forces, tool wear and surface quality.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on an estimation of light weighting opportunities for the frame structure of commercial road vehicles. This estimation is based on simplified static load cases which play a predominant role for the dimensioning of a frame structure and therefore these simplifications are not putting the general validity of the conclusions into question. A comparison of different materials under this scenario shows that light metals do not show any weight reduction advantage in comparison to steel while a material-independent topology optimization has more weight reduction potential for the frame structure than a simple change of materials. Considering the constraints of part complexity which is directly linked with production and assembly cost, the ladder frame structure has become the current state of the art design. Thus the paper also puts a spotlight on basic rules of node design and vertical load induction in order to keep the weight of such a design as low as possible. Practical examples from manufacturers show that the weight of a commercial vehicle could be reduced by 10% and main parts of the frame structure could be reduced by 30% using high strength steel in combination with innovative production methods like roll forming.",

    "abstract": "Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) crystals play an important role in high-energy laser systems, but the laser damage threshold (LDT) of KDP components is lower than expected. The LDT is significantly influenced by subsurface damage produced in KDP crystals. However, it is very challenging to detect the subsurface damage caused by processing because a KDP is soft, brittle, and sensitive to the external environment (e.g., humidity, temperature and applied stress). Conventional characterization methods such as transmission electron microscopy are ineffective for this purpose. This paper proposes a nondestructive detection method called grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) to investigate the formation of subsurface damage during ultra-precision fly cutting of KDP crystals. Some crystal planes, namely (200), (112), (312), (211), (220), (202), (301), (213), (310) and (303), were detected in the processed subsurface with the aid of GIXD, which provided very different results for KDP crystal bulk. These results mean that single KDP crystals change into a lattice misalignment structure (LMS) due to mechanical stress in the subsurface. These crystal planes match the slip systems of the KDP crystals, implying that dislocations nucleate and propagate along slip systems to result in the formation of the LMS under shear and compression stresses. The discovery of the LMS in the subsurface provides a new insight into the nature of the laser-induced damage of KDP crystals.",

    "abstract": "To realize the reuse of process design knowledge and improve the efficiency and quality of process design, a method for extracting thinking process rules for process design is proposed. An instance representation model of the process planning reflecting the thinking process of technicians is established to achieve an effective representation of the process documents. The related process attributes are extracted from the model to form the related events. The manifold learning algorithm and clustering analysis are used to preprocess the process instance data. A rule extraction mechanism of process design is introduced, which is based on the related events after dimension reduction and clustering, and uses the association rule mining algorithm to realize the similar process information extraction in the same cluster. Through the vectorization description of the related events, the final process design rules are formed. Finally, an example is given to evaluate the method of process design rules extraction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An experimental analysis regarding the distribution of the cutting fluid is very difficult due to the inaccessibility of the contact zone within the bore hole. Therefore, suitable simulation models are necessary to evaluate new tool designs and optimize drilling processes. In this paper the coolant distribution during helical deep hole drilling is analyzed with high-speed microscopy. Micro particles are added to the cutting fluid circuit by a developed high-pressure mixing vessel. After the evaluation of suitable particle size, particle concentration and coolant pressure, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is validated with the experimental results. The comparison shows a very good model quality with a marginal difference for the flow velocity of 1.57% between simulation and experiment. The simulation considers the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. The results show that the fluid velocity in the chip flutes is low compared to the fluid velocity at the exit of the coolant channels of the tool and drops even further between the guide chamfers. The flow velocity and the flow pressure directly at the cutting edge decrease to such an extent that the fluid cannot generate a sufficient cooling or lubrication. With the CFD simulation a deeper understanding of the behavior and interactions of the cutting fluid is achieved. Based on these results further research activities to improve the coolant supply can be carried out with great potential to evaluate new tool geometries and optimize the machining process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Marginal-restraint mandrel-free spinning is an advanced technology for manufacturing ellipsoidal heads with large diameter-thickness ratios. Nevertheless, the spinning-induced residual stress, which greatly influences the in-service performance of spun heads, should be removed. In this study, the effects of annealing on the residual-stress relaxation behavior of 5052H32 aluminum alloy spun heads were investigated. It is found that the residual stress first rapidly decreases and then remains steady with the increase in annealing time at the tested annealing temperatures. The relaxation of the residual stress becomes increasingly obvious with the increase in annealing temperature. When the annealing temperature is less than 220 °C, there are no obvious changes in grain size. Moreover, the spinning-induced dislocations are consumed by the static recovery behavior, which decreases the residual stress during annealing. When the annealing temperature is approximately 300 °C, the broken grains transform into equiaxed grains. In addition, static recrystallization and recovery behaviors occur simultaneously to promote the relaxation of the residual stress. Considering the different stress relaxation mechanisms, a model based on the Zener-Wert-Avrami equation was established to predict the residual-stress relaxation behavior. Finally, the optimized annealing temperature and time were approximately 300 °C and 30 min, respectively.",

In this work, a MnO 2 -based catalyst (M-MnO 2 ) with an interconnected network structure was successfully synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method. The M-MnO 2 catalyst was composed of the main catalytic agent, δ -MnO 2 nanosheets, dispersed in a nonactive framework material of γ -MnOOH nanowires. The catalytic activity of M-MnO 2 for HCHO oxidation at room temperature was much higher than that of the pure δ -MnO 2 nanosheets. This is attributed to the special interconnected network structure. The special interconnected network structure has high dispersion and specific surface area, which can provide more surface active oxygen species and higher surface hydroxyl groups to realize rapid decomposition of HCHO.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ubiquitous augmented reality (UAR) implementation can benefit smart shop floor operations significantly. UAR from a user’s first-person view can support and provide the user with suitable and comprehensive information without him/her being distracted from ongoing tasks. A natural hand-based interaction interface, namely, a mobile bare-hand interface (MBHI), is proposed to assist a user in exploring and navigating a large amount of information for a task in the user’s first-person view. The integration of a smart shop floor and UAR-based MBHI is particularly challenging. A real shop floor environment is composed of challenging conditions for the implementation of UAR, e.g., messy backgrounds and significant changes in illumination conditions. Meanwhile, the MBHI is required to provide precise and quick responses to minimize the difficulty of a user’s task. In this study, a wearable UAR system integrated with an MBHI is proposed to augment the shop floor environment with smart information. A case study is implemented to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed UAR and MBHI system.",

Its dry turning performance as applied to AISI-1045 steel was analyzed via three-factor five-level orthogonal experiments for different coating parameters, including coating thickness, coating material, and thickness ratio of the soft and hard coatings. In addition, the cutting performance of the proposed SHCCT tool was compared with those of uncoated non-textured, coated non-textured, and uncoated textured tools, and its superiority was proved by the significant reductions in the cutting force, and specifically, the cutting temperature. The optimal results were provided by the SHCCT tool with a WS2/ZrN soft/hard composite coating, a 0.9:0.1 thickness ratio of the above ingredients, and a total coating thickness of 0.5 μm.",

An efficient method based on subset simulation is proposed in this paper to analyze time-variant reliability by considering the strength deterioration of mechanical components in a continuous system. A gamma process is used to describe the deterioration of system strength. A model for time-variant reliability considering strength deterioration is constructed for a continuous system. A representative example and tubular cantilever structure are assessed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. The reliability probability examples were analyzed using a first-order reliability method and benchmark results for the proposed method were derived using direct Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The results of the proposed method and MCS are consistent, indicating that the proposed method is an effective reliability analysis method for evaluating small failure probabilities in a continuous system subjected to strength deterioration and dynamic loads.",

    "abstract": "Well-designed tool orientation is crucial for the quality execution of five-axis machining with flat-end tools. Tool orientation can be specified in terms of tool inclination and tool tilt angles. For a given surface path, these aspects need to be specified for each cutter contact point along the path, because poor tool orientation choice can cause large axial acceleration of the machine tool, leading to inferior quality of the machined surface. The rotation-minimizing frame aims to reduce unnecessary frame rotation during movement. This concept has been adopted to develop tool orientation methods that allow variation in the inclination angle, the tilt angle, and both the inclination and tilt angles. The intention is to reduce unnecessary rotation of the tool frame as the tool follows a specified path. Evaluation was conducted in the context of five-axis flat-end tool machining. Based on these methods, tool orientation was planned along surface paths of a torus, sphere, and dome. Changes in tool orientation were always smooth. From the perspective of reducing tool orientation changes and axial acceleration, it was demonstrated that simultaneous variation of the inclination and tilt angles based on rotation minimization provided the best results.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the development of techniques for the controlled preparation of functional graded materials (FGMs) has become a vigorous research field. In this study, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of sample preparations, an automated feeding system based on gravimetric principles for dry powder with three dosing feeders is designed and realized. The feeding rate and accuracy can be regulated by coordinating the protruded length L (mm) and rotational speed V (r/min) of the feeder stirrer. To demonstrate this automatic sample preparation system, the well-known thermoelectric material BixSb2−xTe3 (x = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8) is selected and prepared by the developed system, and the composition distribution of the functional graded material is characterized. Experimental results show that the BixSb2−xTe3 (x = 0.3–0.8) functionally graded material crystalizes in the rhombohedral phase after hot-pressing sintering and annealing and the prepared sample has a good gradient composition distribution. This verifies the reliability and accuracy of the feeding system. The concept of samples with a gradient component and application of the automatic powder feeding system could considerably accelerate the research and development of new materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) crystals are widely used in laser ignition facilities as optical switching and frequency conversion components. These crystals are soft, brittle, and sensitive to external conditions (e.g., humidity, temperature, and applied stress). Hence, conventional characterization methods, such as transmission electron microscopy, cannot be used to study the mechanisms of material deformation. Nevertheless, understanding the mechanism of plastic-brittle transition in KDP crystals is important to prevent the fracture damage during the machining process. This study explores the plastic deformation and brittle fracture mechanisms of KDP crystals through nanoindentation experiments and theoretical calculations. The results show that dislocation nucleation and propagation are the main mechanisms of plastic deformation in KDP crystals, and dislocation pileup leads to brittle fracture during nanoindentation. Nanoindentation experiments using various indenters indicate that the external stress fields influence the plastic deformation of KDP crystals, and plastic deformation and brittle fracture are related to the material’s anisotropy. However, the effect of loading rate on the KDP crystal deformation is practically negligible. The results of this research provide important information on reducing machining-induced damage and further improving the optical performance of KDP crystal components.",

The growth of the vehicle fleet has also placed enormous pressure on China’s energy supply and environment. Thus sustainable development of the Chinese automotive industry must pay significant attention to fuel-saving and emission-reduction of vehicles. Although commercial vehicles make up only about 20% of the entire automobile fleet, their contribution to energy-consumption and emission of pollutants is significant. Thus, priority should be given to fuel-saving and emission-reduction of commercial vehicles. As a result of concerted efforts by Chinese government, industry and enterprises, great progress has been made in technologies concerning new-energy, intelligent and lightweight automobiles. However, compared with developed countries, the level of lightweighting of commercial vehicles produced in China remains comparably low. This means that great potential for development of lightweight commercial vehicles in China exists and it will be an efficient path towards fuel-saving and emission-reduction.",

Unsurprisingly, almost all countries suffered from a critical supply shortage of goggles and face shields, as well as many other types of personal protective equipment (PPE), for a long period, owing to the lack of key medical material supplies and the inefficiency of existing fabrication methods arising from the need to avoid crowds during the outbreak of COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a novel combined shield design for eye and face protection that can be rapidly fabricated using three-dimensional printing technology. The designed prototype eye-face shield is accessible to the general public, offering more possibilities for yield improvement in PPE during emergent infectious disease events such as COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Numerical simulation is an effective approach in studying cutting mechanism. The widely used methods for cutting simulation include finite element analysis and molecular dynamics. However, there exist some intrinsic shortcomings when using a mesh-based formulation, and the capable scale of molecular dynamics is extremely small. In contrast, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a candidate to combine the advantages of them. It is a particle method which is suitable for simulating the large deformation process, and is formulated based on continuum mechanics so that large scale problems can be handled in principle. As a result, SPH has also become a main way for the cutting simulation. Since some issues arise while using conventional SPH to handle solid materials, the total Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (TLSPH) is developed. But instabilities would still occur during the cutting, which is a critical issue to resolve. This paper studies the effects of TLSPH settings and cutting model parameters on the numerical instability, as well as the chip formation process. Plastic deformation, stress field and cutting forces are analyzed as well. It shows that the hourglass coefficient, critical pairwise deformation and time step are three important parameters to control the stability of the simulation, and a strategy on how to adjust them is provided.",

By means of this approach, low damage and even damage-free surfaces with a high material removal rate can be achieved in lutetium oxide surface finishing. Analysis of transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that plasma hydrogenation converts the sesquioxide into hydroxide, which leads a high efficient way to polish the surfaces. The influences of process conditions on the etching boundary and surface roughness are also qualitatively investigated using scanning electron microscope and white light interferometry. The newly developed process is verified by a systematic experiment.",

In this study, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was used to manufacture a high-performance Ni-superalloy heat pipe, through tailoring LPBF process parameters to fabricate thin wall and micro-channel. By using novel laser scanning strategies, wick structure heat pipes with maximised surface-area-to-volume ratio, fine features size around 100 µm, and controlled porosity were successfully fabricated. Microscopy and X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) were used to investigate the 3D structure of the void space within the pipe. Wick test results showed that most of the heat pipes made by LPBF had better performance than the conventionally manufactured pipes. This study also investigated the influences of the process parameters on the porosity volume fraction and the feature size. The results showed that LPBF process could fabricate thin structure due to the change of melt pool contact angle. The relationship between process parameters and bead size reported in this study could help design and manufacture heat pipe with complex fine structure.",

The formed insert is subjected to a controlled densification process and analysed through a series of characterisation investigations. The purpose of the study is to develop the design concept and analyse the forming and sintering parameters used in the lithographic ceramic manufacturing process. The results validated the feasibility of the geometrical design, providing the required structural conformity with the integrated internal feature using conditional specifications. It is confirmed that the forming parameters would affect the material properties of the green body. Furthermore, the results indicate that the heating rate and temperature variance of the de-binding and thermal treatment regime influences the microstructural growth kinetics and the quality of the densified insert. Using a novel application of liquid gallium as an internal coolant, experimental results showed a decrease in tool wear difference of 36% at",

The present study aims to estimate the specific energy consumption for abrasive metal cutting with ultra-thin discs at comparatively low and medium feed rates. Using an experimental technique, the cutting power was measured at four predefined feed rates for S235JR, intermetallic Fe-Al(40%), and C45K with different thermal treatments. The variation in the specific energy consumption with the material removal rate was analyzed through an empirical model, which enabled us to distinguish three phenomena of energy dissipation during material removal. The thermal treatment and mechanical properties of materials have a significant impact on the energy consumption pattern, its corresponding components, and cutting power. Ductile materials consume more specific cutting energy than brittle materials. The specific cutting energy is the minimum energy required to remove the material, and plowing energy is found to be the most significant phenomenon of energy dissipation.",

Accordingly, a method based on sheet-bulk metal forming for fabricating a duplex gear with extremely small die roll in one stroke is proposed in the current work. The process could be divided into three stages according to the forming features: upsetting and shearing stage, lateral extrusion stage, and local filling stage. The die roll appeared in the shearing stage, which could be reduced in the subsequent extrusion and local filling stages. To reveal the underground mechanism, material flows under two situations, as a key factor to influence the forming quality, were compared and investigated. The results revealed that by controlling material flow, one could avoid the defects and reduce the die roll.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conformal cooling coils have been developed during the last decades through the use of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. The main goal of this study was to analyze how the presence of an internal channel that could act as a conformal cooling coil could affect compressive strength and quasi-elastic gradient of AlSi10Mg lattice structures produced by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Three different configurations of samples were tested in compression at 25 °C and 200 °C. The reference structures were body centered cubic (BBC) in the core of the samples with vertical struts along Z (BCCZ) lattices in the outer perimeter, labelled as NC samples. The main novelty consisted in inserting a straight elliptical channel and a 45° elliptical channel inside the BCCZ lattice structures, labelled as SC and 45C samples respectively. All the samples were then tested in as-built (AB) condition, and after two post process heat treatments, commonly used for AlSi10Mg LPBF industrial components, a stress relieving (SR) and a T6 treatment. NC lattice structures AB exhibited an overall fragile fracture and therefore the SC and 45C configuration samples were tested only after thermal treatments. The test at 25 °C showed that all types of samples were characterized by negligible variations in their quasi-elastic gradients and yield strength. On the contrary, the general trend of stress-strain curves was influenced by the presence of the channel and its position. The test at 200 °C showed that NC, SC and 45C samples after SR and T6 treatments exhibited a metal-foam like deformation.",

    "abstract": "New and increasingly sharp laws for the reduction of emissions from commercial vehicles entered into force in the European Union since 1993 with the aim of substantially reducing pollutants and emissions from trucks and buses. Thereby the maximum levels for the emission of particulate matter (basically soot particles) as well as oxides of nitrogen (NOx) have been subsequently lowered. To comply with these demands, commercial vehicle producers had to introduce new emission reducing technologies of which exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and diesel particle filters (DPF/ CRT) are vital. However, the implementation of such technologies in a commercial vehicle causes a weight increase that can be estimated to reach 300 kg. Practically this means that for instance the capacity of a bus would have to be reduced by four passenger seats unless the extra vehicle weight is reduced in other areas of the vehicle. Unlike in passenger cars, maximum CO2 emissions are not yet being specified by European regulations for commercial vehicles (see Fig. 1). CO2 emissions (of course all other emissions) are directly proportional to the fuel consumption of the vehicle, which in turn can be reduced by higher efficiency in the powertrain, lower vehicle weight and improved aerodynamics. However, what actually counts beyond the absolute emissions and efficiency of a commercial vehicle is its relative performance per ton of transported cargo. A lighter vehicle simply allows transporting more cargo respecting a given total admitted vehicle weight on the road. Accordingly, the emission per ton of transported cargo becomes less. Improved design, better-performing materials and innovative manufacturing technology each by itself enable light weighting of vehicle structures and efficiency gains in the powertrain. However, the optimum benefit can only be obtained by a holistic approach involving all three approaches in a coordinated way. China Automotive Lightweight Association (CALA) was installed in 2008 to work out strategies of weight reduction in the automotive sector. In November 2014 CITIC Metals and Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineracao (CBMM) organized a seminar in Beijing focusing on the ‘‘Application of high strength steels in lightweight commercial vehicles’’. Around 90 experts from organization delegated by commercial vehicle producers, CALA, China Iron and Steel Research Institute (CISRI), steelmakers and supply companies participated to identify the opportunities and needs for producing lighter and more fuel-efficient trucks in China. Two facts emphasize the urgency of these activities:",

A substructure synthesis technique is used to calculate the frequency response function of the tool point, which is adopted to determine the stability lobe diagram. Based on the Taguchi design method, simulations are first conducted for varying combinations of tool overhang length, helix angle, and teeth number. The optimal geometrical parameters of the tool are determined through an orthogonal analysis of the maximum axial depth of cut, which is obtained from the predicted stability lobe diagram. It was found that the sequence of every factor used to determine the optimal tool geometrical parameters is the tool overhang length, teeth number, and helix angle. Finally, a series of experiments were carried out as a parameter study to determine the influence of the tool overhang length, helix angle, and teeth number on the cutting stability of a mill. The same conclusion as that obtained through the simulation was observed.",

Recently, evolution has been centred around automation of scene interpretation from three-dimensional (3D) scan data. The scope of this paper is to assess assemblies as the installation process progresses and inferring if arising deviations are problematic (complex task). The adequacy of utilising unorganised point clouds to compliance check are trialled with a real life down-scaled prototype model in conjunction with a synthetic dataset. This work aims to highlight areas where large rework could be avoided, in part by the detection of potential clashes of components early in the pipeline installation process. With the help of an extracted model in the form of a point cloud generated from a scanned physical model and a 3D CAD model representing the nominal geometry, an operator can be made visually aware of potential deviations and component clashes during a pipeline assembly process.",
