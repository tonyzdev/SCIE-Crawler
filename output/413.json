    "abstract": "Gut microbial ecology and function are dynamic in infancy, but are stabilized in childhood. The 'new friends' have a great impact on the development of the digestive tract and host immune system. In the first year of life, especially, the gut microbiota dramatically changes through interactions with the developing immune system in the gut. The process of establishing the gut microbiota is affected by various environmental factors, with the potential to be a main determinant of life-long health. In this review, we summarize recent findings regarding gut microbiota establishment, including the importance of various factors related to the development of the immune system and allergic diseases later in life.",

    "abstract": "A relationship between viral infections and the simultaneous or subsequent development of allergic inflammation has often been observed in various clinical situations. Recent studies suggest an intimate relationship between reactivations of herpesviruses including human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and the development of a severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction referred to as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS).This syndrome has several important clinical features that cannot be solely explained by drug antigen-driven oligoclonal expansion of T cells: they include paradoxical worsening of clinical symptoms after discontinuation of the causative drug. In view of the similarity to GVHD or immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS) in clinical manifestations and emergence of viral infections, the clinical symptoms observed during the course of DIHS and GVHD are likely to be mediated by antiviral T cells that can cross-react with the drug and alloantigens, respectively. In considering common intrinsic properties of the causative drugs to potentially induce immunosuppression, re-constitution of a valid immune response to these viruses, which is typically observed in IRS, may be the most crucial process that takes place after withdrawal of the causative drug in patients with DIHS. Thus, this syndrome should be regarded as a reaction induced by a complex interplay among several herpesviruses (EB virus, HHV-6, HHV-7, and cytomegalovirus), antiviral immune responses, and drug-specific immune responses. This review includes discussion of the pathomechanism, the clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, pathological findings and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is an inflammatory disorder principally involving the conducting airways and characterised by infiltration of the airway wall with a range of inflammatory cells driven in large part by activation of Th2-type lymphocytes, mast cells and eosinophils. However a key component of asthma is the structural change that involves all of the elements of the airway wall. Here evidence is presented to suggest that the airway epithelium in asthma is fundamentally abnormal with increased susceptibility to environmental injury and impaired repair associated with activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit (EMTU). In addition to adopting an activated phenotype, the barrier function of the epithelium is impaired through defective tight junction formation thereby facilitating penetration of potentially toxic or damaging environmental insults. Activated and repairing epithelial cells generate a range of growth factors that are involved in the early life origins of this disease as well as its progression in the form of mucous metaplasia and airway wall remodeling. By placing the epithelium at the forefront of asthma pathogenesis, different approaches to treatment can be devised focused more on protecting vulnerable airways against environmental injury rather than focusing on suppressing airway inflammation or manipulating the immune response.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of allergic diseases has increased all over the world during the last two decades. Dietary change is considered to be one of the environmental factors that cause this increase and worsen allergic symptoms. If this is the case, an appropriate intake of foods or beverages with anti-allergic activities is expected to prevent the onset of allergic diseases and ameliorate allergic symptoms. Flavonoids, ubiquitously present in vegetables, fruits or teas possess anti-allergic activities. Flavonoids inhibit histamine release, synthesis of IL-4 and IL-13 and CD40 ligand expression by basophils. Analyses of structure-activity relationships of 45 flavones, flavonols and their related compounds showed that luteolin, ayanin, apigenin and fisetin were the strongest inhibitors of IL-4 production with an IC50 value of 2–5 μM and determined a fundamental structure for the inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activity of flavonoids on IL-4 and CD40 ligand expression was possibly mediated through their inhibitory action on activation of nuclear factors of activated T cells and AP-1. Administration of flavonoids into atopic dermatitis-prone mice showed a preventative and ameliorative effect. Recent epidemiological studies reported that a low incidence of asthma was significantly observed in a population with a high intake of flavonoids. Thus, this evidence will be helpful for the development of low molecular compounds for allergic diseases and it is expected that a dietary menu including an appropriate intake of flavonoids may provide a form of complementary and alternative medicine and a preventative strategy for allergic diseases. Clinical studies to verify these points are now in progress.",

Patients with AD have a predisposition to colonization or infection by microbial organisms, most notably Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Measures directed at healing and protecting the skin barrier and controlling the immune activation are needed for effective management of AD.

Several new insights have been made, particularly with regards to the diagnosis, pathogenesis and care of some important complications and sequelae. The indication of herpesvirus reactivations in diagnosis in the assessment of disease severity is now better specified. Nevertheless, because fatal complications and autoimmune sequelae have been under-recognized, there is a clear need to identify effective parameters for assessing disease severity and predicting prognosis of the disease in the early phase. In this regard, we have established a scoring system that can be used to monitor severity, predict prognosis and stratify the risk of developing severe complications including fatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. Regulatory T cells are likely to be central to the mechanism and would represent potential targets for therapeutic approaches that can ameliorate inflammatory responses occurring at the acute phase while preventing the subsequent development of harmful outcomes, such as CMV disease and autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic or chronically relapsing, eczematous, severely pruritic skin disorder mostly associated with IgE elevation and skin barrier dysfunction due to decreased filaggrin expression. The lesional skin of AD exhibits Th2- and Th22-deviated immune reactions that are progressive during disease chronicity. Th2 and Th22 cytokines further deteriorate the skin barrier by inhibiting filaggrin expression. Some IgEs are reactive to self-antigens. The IgE autoreactivity may precipitate the chronicity of AD. Upon activation of the ORAI1 calcium channel, atopic epidermis releases large amounts of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which initiates the Th2 and Th22 immune response. Th2-derived interleukin-31 and TSLP induce an itch sensation. Taken together, TSLP/Th2/Th22 pathway is a promising target for developing new therapeutics for AD. Enhancing filaggrin expression using ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor may also be an adjunctive measure to restore the disrupted barrier function specifically for AD.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by local inflammation of the upper airways and sinuses which persists for at least 12 weeks. CRS can be divided into two phenotypes dependent on the presence of nasal polyps (NPs); CRS with NPs (CRSwNP) and CRS without NPs (CRSsNP). Immunological patterns in the two diseases are known to be different. Inflammation in CRSsNP is rarely investigated and limited studies show that CRSsNP is characterized by type 1 inflammation. Inflammation in CRSwNP is well investigated and CRSwNP in Western countries shows type 2 inflammation and eosinophilia in NPs. In contrast, mixed inflammatory patterns are found in CRSwNP in Asia and the ratio of eosinophilic NPs and non-eosinophilic NPs is almost 50:50 in these countries. Inflammation in eosinophilic NPs is mainly controlled by type 2 cytokines, IL-5 and IL-13, which can be produced from several immune cells including Th2 cells, mast cells and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that are all elevated in eosinophilic NPs. IL-5 strongly induces eosinophilia. IL-13 activates macrophages, B cells and epithelial cells to induce recruitment of eosinophils and Th2 cells, IgE mediated reactions and remodeling. Epithelial derived cytokines, TSLP, IL-33 and IL-1 can directly and indirectly control type 2 cytokine production from these cells in eosinophilic NPs. Recent clinical trials showed the beneficial effect on eosinophilic NPs and/or asthma by monoclonal antibodies against IL-5, IL-4Rα, IgE and TSLP suggesting that they can be therapeutic targets for eosinophilic CRSwNP.",

In this guideline, food allergies are generally classified into four clinical types: (1) neonatal and infantile gastrointestinal allergy, (2) infantile atopic dermatitis associated with food allergy, (3) immediate-type of food allergy (urticaria, anaphylaxis, etc.), and (4) special forms of immediate-type of food allergy such as food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis and oral allergy syndrome (OAS).

We have discussed the neonatal and infantile gastrointestinal allergy and special forms of immediate type food allergy types separately. Diagnostic procedures are highlighted, such as probability curves and component-resolved diagnosis, including the recent advancement utilizing antigen-specific IgE. The oral food challenge using a stepwise approach is recommended to avoid complete elimination of causative foods. Although oral immunotherapy (OIT) has not been approved as a routine treatment by nationwide insurance, we included a chapter for OIT, focusing on efficacy and problems. Prevention of food allergy is currently the focus of interest, and many changes were made based on recent evidence. Finally, the contraindication between adrenaline and antipsychotic drugs in Japan was discussed among related medical societies, and we reached an agreement that the use of adrenaline can be allowed based on the physician's discretion. In conclusion, this guideline encourages physicians to follow the principle to let patients consume causative foods in any way and as early as possible.",

    "abstract": "Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an IL-7-like cytokine initially identified in the culture supernatant of a thymic stromal cell line. Highly expressed in the epidermis in skin lesions of atopic dermatitis patients, TSLP was subsequently found to be a critical factor linking responses at interfaces between the body and environment (skin, airway, gut, ocular tissues, and so on) to Th2 responses. Recent studies have revealed that various cell types other than epithelial cells and epidermal keratinocytes (such as mast cells, airway smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, trophoblasts, and cancer or cancer-associated cells) also express TSLP. Environmental factors such as Toll-like receptor ligands, a Nod2 ligand, viruses, microbes, allergen sources, helminths, diesel exhaust, cigarette smoke, and chemicals trigger TSLP production. Proinflammatory cytokines, Th2-related cytokines, and IgE also induce or enhance TSLP production, indicating cycles of amplification. Skin barrier injury, increased epidermal endogenous protease activity, and less epidermal Notch signaling, all of which have been reported in atopic dermatitis, and keratinocyte-specific loss of retinoid X receptors and treatment of skin with agonists for vitamin D receptor in mice induce TSLP production, Th2 response, or atopic dermatitis-like inflammation. The transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, nuclear receptors, single nucleotide polymorphisms, microRNAs, and the peptidyl-proryl isomerase Pin1 regulate TSLP mRNA expression transcriptionally or posttranscriptionally. This review focuses on events upstream of TSLP production, which is critical in allergic diseases and important in other TSLP-related disorders i.e. production sites, cellular sources, environmental and endogenous triggers and regulatory factors, and regulatory mechanisms of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial asthma is characterized by persistent cough, increased sputum, and repeated wheezing. The pathophysiology underlying these symptoms is the hyper-responsiveness of the airway along with chronic airway inflammation. Repeated injury, repair, and regeneration of the airway epithelium following exposure to environmental factors and inflammation results in histological changes and functional abnormalities in the airway mucosal epithelium; such changes are believed to have a significant association with the pathophysiology of asthma. Damage to the barrier functions of the airway epithelium enhances mucosal permeability of foreign substances in the airway epithelium of patients with asthma. Thus, epithelial barrier fragility is closely involved in releasing epithelial cytokines (e.g., TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33) because of the activation of airway epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and innate group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). Functional abnormalities of the airway epithelial cells along with the activation of dendritic cells, Th2 cells, and ILC2 form a single immunopathological unit that is considered to cause allergic airway inflammation. Here we use the latest published literature to discuss the potential pathological mechanisms regarding the onset and progressive severity of asthma with regard to the disruption of the airway epithelial function.",

Allergic rhinitis includes pollinosis, which is intractable and reduces quality of life (QOL) when it becomes severe. A guideline is needed to understand allergic rhinitis and to use this knowledge to develop a treatment plan. In Japan, the first guideline was prepared after a symposium held by the Japanese Society of Allergology in 1993. The current 8th edition was published in 2016, and is widely used today. To incorporate evidence based medicine (EBM) introduced from abroad, the most recent collection of evidence/literature was supplemented to the Practical Guideline for the Management of Allergic Rhinitis in Japan 2016. The revised guideline includes assessment of diagnosis/treatment and prescriptions for children and pregnant women, for broad clinical applications. An evidence-based step-by-step strategy for treatment is also described. In addition, the QOL concept and cost benefit analyses are also addressed. Along with Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact of Asthma (ARIA), this guideline is widely used for various clinical purposes, such as measures for patients with sinusitis, childhood allergic rhinitis, oral allergy syndrome, and anaphylaxis and for pregnant women.

Its rarity and unique features such as eosinophilic inflammation have delayed progress of research regarding EGPA for several years, compared to other forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis. However, recently, attention to EGPA as a research subject has been gradually increasing. To resolve problems in existing criteria for EGPA, new classification criteria for EGPA generated by a large international cohort will be launched and is being expected to accelerate future studies. Pathogenesis and roles of ANCA in EGPA are still largely unknown; however, it has been reported that glomerulonephritis is more frequent in ANCA-positive patients than in ANCA-negative patients, while heart failure is more frequent in ANCA-negative patients than in ANCA-positive patients. In addition, a recent genome-wide association study has suggested the presence of two genetically distinct subgroups of EGPA, which correspond to ANCA-positive and -negative subgroups. Although responses to glucocorticoids in EGPA are generally good, patients with EGPA often experience a relapse. Currently, there is no standard therapy for EGPA based on accumulation of clinical trial results. Recently, clinical benefits of mepolizumab for EGPA were proved by a randomized controlled trial and mepolizumab was approved for EGPA. In addition, various new drugs are under evaluation. To find optimal use of these drugs and to resolve unmet needs, such as relapse prevention, will be needed in future.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) is a subgroup of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), which is associated with severe eosinophilic infiltration and intractable. Its symptoms include dysosmia, nasal obstruction, and visous nasal discharge. The cause of ECRS is not clear, although it is thought that Staphylococcus aureus and its enterotoxins are involved in stimulating the Th2 system to promote IgE production and eosinophil infiltration through various pathways. While, the coagulation system is activated and the fibrinolytic system is suppressed, leading to deposition of fibrinous networks in nasal polyps. Therefore, a fibrin-degrading agent could be a new treatment for ECRS. Genetic analysis of nasal polyp cells using next-generation sequencing has identified some of the factors involved in ECRS, including periostin, which can be used as a biomarker of this condition. A protease inhibitor could be a therapeutic agent for ECRS. Regarding the role of eosinophils, many researchers have been interested in the mechanism of ETosis. However, the mechanism leading to development of nasal polyps is unknown. In Japan (as well as in East Asia), the incidence of non-ECRS is decreasing and that of ECRS is increasing, but the reason is also unknown. Thanks to the development of biologics therapy, it is thought that there will be a shift to precision medicine in the future.",

    "abstract": "Omega-3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are found naturally in fish oil and are commonly thought to be anti-inflammatory nutrients, with protective effects in inflammatory diseases including asthma and allergies. The mechanisms of these effects remain mostly unknown but are of great interest for their potential therapeutic applications. Large numbers of epidemiological and observational studies investigating the effect of fish intake or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adulthood on asthmatic and allergic outcomes have been conducted. They mostly indicate protective effects and suggest a causal relationship between decreased intake of fish oil in modernized diets and an increasing number of individuals with asthma or other allergic diseases. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM: protectins, resolvins, and maresins) are generated from omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA via several enzymatic reactions. These mediators counter-regulate airway eosinophilic inflammation and promote the resolution of inflammation in vivo. Several reports have indicated that the biosynthesis of SPM is impaired, especially in severe asthma, which suggests that chronic inflammation in the lung might result from a resolution defect. This article focuses on the beneficial aspects of omega-3 fatty acids and offers recent insights into their bioactive metabolites including resolvins and protectins.",

    "abstract": "Like asthma and atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis is an allergic disease, but of the three, it is the only type I allergic disease. Allergic rhinitis includes pollinosis, which is intractable and reduces quality of life (QOL) when it becomes severe. A guideline is needed to understand allergic rhinitis and to use this knowledge to develop a treatment plan. In Japan, the first guideline was prepared after a symposium held by the Japanese Society of Allergology in 1993. The current 8th edition was published in 2016, and is widely used today. To incorporate evidence based medicine (EBM) introduced from abroad, the most recent collection of evidence/literature was supplemented to the Practical Guideline for the Management of Allergic Rhinitis in Japan 2016. The revised guideline includes assessment of diagnosis/treatment and prescriptions for children and pregnant women, for broad clinical applications. An evidence-based step-by-step strategy for treatment is also described. In addition, the QOL concept and cost benefit analyses are also addressed. Along with Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact of Asthma (ARIA), this guideline is widely used for various clinical purposes, such as measures for patients with sinusitis, childhood allergic rhinitis, oral allergy syndrome, and anaphylaxis and for pregnant women. A Q&A section regarding allergic rhinitis in Japan was added to the end of this guideline.",

    "abstract": "Exposure and sensitization to fungal allergens can promote the development and worsening of allergic diseases. Although numerous species of fungi have been associated with allergic diseases in the literature, the significance of fungi from the genera Alternaria, Cladosporium, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Malassezia has been well documented. However, it should be emphasized that the contribution of different fungal allergens to allergic diseases is not identical, but species-specific. Alternaria and Cladosporium species are considered to be important outdoor allergens, and sensitization and exposure to species of these genera is related to the development of asthma and rhinitis, as well as epidemics of asthma exacerbation, including life-threatening asthma exacerbation. In contrast, xerophilic species of Penicillium and Aspergillus, excluding Aspergillus fumigatus, are implicated in allergic diseases as indoor allergens. A. fumigatus has a high capacity to colonize the bronchial tract of asthmatic patients, causing severe persistent asthma and low lung function, and sometimes leading to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Malassezia are common commensals of healthy skin, although they are also associated with atopic dermatitis, especially on the head and neck, but not with respiratory allergies. Despite its importance in the management of allergic diseases, precise recognition of species-specific IgE sensitization to fungal allergens is often challenging because the majority of fungal extracts exhibit broad cross-reactivity with taxonomically unrelated fungi. Recent progress in gene technology has contributed to the identification of specific and cross-reactive allergen components from different fungal sources. However, data demonstrating the clinical relevance of IgE reactivity to these allergen components are still insufficient.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a heterogenous disorder and can be classified into different types. Stratification of subtypes may enable personalized medicine approaches. AD can be categorized into the IgE-high, extrinsic subtype and the IgE-normal, intrinsic subtype. While extrinsic AD is the major subtype possessing skin barrier impairment (high incidence of filaggrin mutations), intrinsic AD occupies about 20% of AD with female dominance and preserved barrier. Extrinsic AD exhibits protein allergy and food allergy, but intrinsic AD shows metal allergy possibly in association with suprabasin deficiency. In particular, accumulated knowledge of food allergy has more clearly characterized extrinsic AD. European American (EA) and Asian AD subtypes have been also proposed. Asian patients with AD are characterized by a unique blended immune dysregulation and barrier feature phenotype between EA patients with AD and those with psoriasis. In another ethnic study, filaggrin loss-of-function mutations are not prevalent in African American patients with AD, and Th1/Th17 attenuation and Th2/Th22 skewing were seen in these patients. Recent endotype classification provides new insights for AD and other allergic disorders. Endotype is defined as the molecular mechanisms underlying the visible features/phenotype. Endotype repertoire harbors activation of type 2 cytokines, type 1 cytokines, and IL-17/IL-22, impairment of epidermal barrier, and abnormalities of intercellular lipids. Classification of endotype has been attempted with serum markers. These lines of evidence indicate a need for personalized or precision medicine appropriate for each subtype of AD.",

    "abstract": "Discoveries from basic science research in the last decade have brought significant progress in knowledge of pathophysiologic processes of allergic diseases, with a compelling impact on understanding of the natural history, risk prediction, treatment selection or mechanism-specific prevention strategies. The view of the pathophysiology of allergic diseases developed from a mechanistic approach, with a focus on symptoms and organ function, to the recognition of a complex network of immunological pathways. Several subtypes of inflammation and complex immune-regulatory networks and the reasons for their failure are now described, that open the way for the development of new diagnostic tools and innovative targeted-treatments. An endotype is a subtype of a disease condition, which is defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism, whereas a disease phenotype defines any observable characteristic of a disease without any implication of a mechanism. Another key word linked to disease endotyping is biomarker that is measured and evaluated to examine any biological or pathogenic processes, including response to a therapeutic intervention. These three keywords will be discussed more and more in the future with the upcoming efforts to revolutionize patient care in the direction of precision medicine and precision health. The understanding of disease endotypes based on pathophysiological principles and their validation across clinically meaningful outcomes in asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis and food allergy will be crucial for the success of precision medicine as a new approach to patient management.",

    "abstract": "Adult bronchial asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, and presents clinically with variable airway narrowing (wheezes and dyspnea) and cough. Long-standing asthma induces airway remodeling, leading to intractable asthma. The number of patients with asthma has increased; however, the number of patients who die of asthma has decreased (1.2 per 100,000 patients in 2015). The goal of asthma treatment is to enable patients with asthma to attain normal pulmonary function and lead a normal life, without any symptoms. A good relationship between physicians and patients is indispensable for appropriate treatment. Long-term management by therapeutic agents and elimination of the causes and risk factors of asthma are fundamental to its treatment. Four steps in pharmacotherapy differentiate between mild and intensive treatments; each step includes an appropriate daily dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, varying from low to high levels. Long-acting β2-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, sustained-release theophylline, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist are recommended as add-on drugs, while anti-immunoglobulin E antibody and oral steroids are considered for the most severe and persistent asthma related to allergic reactions. Bronchial thermoplasty has recently been developed for severe, persistent asthma, but its long-term efficacy is not known. Inhaled β2-agonists, aminophylline, corticosteroids, adrenaline, oxygen therapy, and other approaches are used as needed during acute exacerbations, by choosing treatment steps for asthma in accordance with the severity of exacerbations. Allergic rhinitis, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic otitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aspirin-induced asthma, and pregnancy are also important issues that need to be considered in asthma therapy.",

Skin barrier dysfunction leads to enhanced skin irritability to non-specific stimuli and epicutaneous sensitization. In the lesion site, a further inflammation-related reduction in skin barrier function, enhanced irritability and scratching-related stimuli deteriorate eczema, leading to vicious cycle of inflammation. The current strategies to treat AD in Japan from the perspective of evidence-based medicine consist of three primary measures: (i) the use of topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment as the main treatment for the inflammation; (ii) topical application of emollients to treat the cutaneous barrier dysfunction; and (iii) avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling and advice about daily life. The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes with respect to several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.",

A role for IL-5 in eosinophil extracellular trap cell death, i.e., a proinflammatory cell death, has also been reported. Mepolizumab and benralizumab are humanized mAbs that target IL-5 and the IL-5 receptor α, respectively, and their therapeutic efficacy for severe asthma has been established. Although consistent differences in the efficacies of those drugs have not been proven, benralizumab extensively depleted eosinophils via Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Blood eosinophil count, but not FeNO or IgE, is the best-established predictive biomarker of the efficacy of anti-IL-5 treatment. Regarding the choice of biologics, the balance between blood eosinophil count and FeNO, indication of comorbidities, longitudinal safety, and interval of injection should be considered. Mepolizumab was also effective in maintaining the remission of refractory eosinophilic granulomatous polyangiitis. Moreover, mepolizumab decreased the proportion of patients who required surgery and lowered the nasal polyp score in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; a further extensive trial is currently under way. In a phase II benralizumab study performed in Japan, no significant effect on nasal polyp score at week 12 was observed, suggesting a requirement for longer treatment. In this review, the role of IL-5 in eosinophil biology and the current status of anti-IL-5 therapy are discussed. The longitudinal safety of anti-IL-5 therapy has been increasingly established, and this strategy will be continuously indicated for eosinophilic diseases as a specific treatment for eosinophilic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the mainstay treatment for the cure of allergic disorders, with depicted efficacy and safety by several trials and meta-analysis. AIT impressively contributes to the management of allergic rhinitis, asthma and venom allergies. Food allergy is a new arena for AIT with promising results, especially via novel administration routes. Cell subsets with regulatory capacities are induced during AIT. IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β are the main suppressor cytokines, in addition to surface molecules such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) within the micro milieu. Modified T- and B-cell responses and antibody isotypes, increased activity thresholds for eosinophils, basophils and mast cells and consequent limitation of inflammatory cascades altogether induce and maintain a state of sustained allergen-specific unresponsiveness. Established tolerance is reflected into the clinical perspectives as improvement of allergy symptoms together with reduced medication requirements and evolved disease severity. Long treatment durations, costs, reduced patient compliance and risk of severe, even life-threatening adverse reactions during treatment stand as major limiting factors for AIT. By development of purified non-allergenic, highly-immunogenic modified allergen extracts, and combinational usage of them with novel adjuvant molecules via new routes may shorten treatment durations and possibly reduce these drawbacks. AIT is the best model for custom-tailored therapy of allergic disorders. Better characterization of disease endotypes, definition of specific biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy follow-up, as well as precision medicine approaches may further contribute to success of AIT in management of allergic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by chronic, eczematous, severe pruritic skin lesions. The knowledge on the pathogenesis of AD is driving the development of new drugs. From the research results, it has been revealed that Th2 cell-mediated immunity, skin barrier dysfunction, and pruritus cause a vicious cycle of AD. On the other hand, the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway are one of the essential signaling pathways in various inflammatory diseases including AD. In particular, TSLP, IL-4, IL-13 and IL-22 occupy an important position for Th2 cell-mediated immune reaction. Moreover, experimentally pan-JAK inhibitor suppress the STAT3 activation and improved the skin barrier function. Furthermore TSLP, IL-4, IL-13 and IL-31 contribute a lot to chronic pruritus of AD, and transmitted via JAK-STAT pathway. Therefore, JAK inhibitors are promising candidates for the treatment of severe AD. Here we review clinical trials of topical dergocitinib; a pan-JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib; a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, and tofacitinib; a JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3 inhibitor and oral baricitinib; a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, abrocitinib and upadacitinib; JAK1 inhibitor. Significant improvements in the symptoms were obtained by each drug with low frequency of adverse events. In particular, oral JAK inhibitors have the ability to improve the pruritus and skin symptoms quickly. Therefore, the emergence of these topical and oral JAK inhibitors would be regarded as an innovation in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.",

Multiple biological drugs use monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 as cancer immunotherapies. These are termed immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, activation of the immune system by ICIs can induce the development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can affect multiple organ systems. The most frequent irAEs are cutaneous and mimic various types of spontaneous skin disorders. Most irAEs are classified as autoimmune conditions mediated by ICI-activated CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, some of which are also related to activated B cells and production of pathogenic antibodies. Interestingly, blockade of CTLA-4 mainly induces activation of T cells and inhibition of Treg cells. On the other hand, the mechanisms underlying anti-PD-1/PD-L1 ICI-induced irAEs are more complicated. PD-1 is a receptor expressed on T and B cells, which binds not only PD-L1, but also PD-L2. The role of PD-L1 is dominant in Th1 and Th17 immunity, while PD-L2 works mainly in Th2 immunity. Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying irAEs will allow for better management of irAEs and improve outcomes and quality of life in cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis is a skin disorder caused by skin dryness and barrier dysfunction, resulting in skin inflammation and chronic itch (or pruritus). The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is thought to be initiated by a lowering of the itch threshold due to dry skin. This lowering of the itch threshold is at least partially due to the increase in intraepidermal nerve fibers and sensitization of sensory nerves by interleukin (IL)-33 produced and secreted by keratinocytes. Such skin is easily prone to itch due to mechanical stimuli, such as rubbing of clothing and chemical stimuli from itch mediators. In patients with atopic dermatitis, once itch occurs, further itch is induced by scratching, and the associated scratching breaks down the skin barrier. Disruption of the skin barrier allows entry into the epidermis of external foreign substances, such as allergens derived from house dust mites, leading to an increased induction of type 2 inflammatory responses. As a result, type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 are mainly secreted by Th2 cells, and their action on sensory nerve fibers causes further itch sensitization. These sequences of events are thought to occur simultaneously in patients with atopic dermatitis, leading to a vicious itch-scratch cycle. This vicious cycle becomes a negative spiral that leads to disease burden. Therefore, controlling itch is essential for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. In this review, we summarize and discuss advances in the mechanisms of peripheral itch sensitization in atopic dermatitis, focusing on skin barrier-neuro-immune triadic connectivity.",

    "abstract": "The gut-brain axis exemplifies the bidirectional connection between the intestines and the brain, as evidenced by the impact of severe stress on gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain and diarrhea, and conversely, the influence of abdominal discomfort on mood. Clinical observations support the notion of the gut-brain connection, including an increased prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with depression and anxiety, as well as the association of changes in the gut microbiota with neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. The gut and brain communicate via complex mechanisms involving inflammatory cytokines, immune cells, autonomic nerves, and gut microbiota, which contribute to the pathogenesis in certain gut and brain diseases. Two primary pathways mediate the bidirectional information exchange between the intestinal tract and the brain: signal transduction through bloodstream factors, such as bacterial metabolites and inflammatory cytokines, and neural pathways, such as neurotransmitters and inflammatory cytokines within the autonomic nervous system through the interaction between the nerve cells and beyond. In recent years, the basic mechanisms of the pathophysiology of the gut-brain axis have been gradually elucidated. Beyond the gut-brain interaction, emerging evidence suggests the influence of the gut extends to other organs, such as the liver and lungs, through intricate inter-organ communication pathways. An increasing number of reports on this clinical and basic cross-organ interactions underscore the potential for better understanding and novel therapeutic strategies targeting inter-organs networks.

Several current lines of evidence from gene-deficient mice indicate that IL-17 and Th17 cells, but not IFN-y and Th1 cells, are responsible for the development of autoimmune diseases such as murine arthritis and encephalomyelitis, which have classically been considered to be Th1-mediated disorders. Th17 cells may also contribute to the pathogenesis of classically recognized Th2-mediated allergic disorders. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding iL-17 and Th17 cells and discuss their potential roles in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, Lyell's syndrome) are now considered to be distinct clinical entities within a spectrum of adverse cutaneous drug reactions of increasing severity based on their surface of skin detachment. Within this spectrum, SJS which can be considered as a minor form of TEN is characterized by less than 10% body surface area of skin detachment, and an average reported mortality of 1–5%, whereas TEN is characterized by more than 30% skin detachment, and an average reported mortality 25-35%. Both SJS and TEN are characterized morphologically by the rapid onset of keratinocyte cell death by apoptosis, a process that results in the separation of the epidermis from the dermis. Recent evidence is supportive of a role for inflammatory cytokines and the death receptor Fas and its ligand FasL in the pathogenesis of keratinocyte apoptosis during TEN. This Fas-mediated keratinocyte apoptosis that is the last step culminating in epidermal detachment in TEN can be inhibited in vitro by antagonistic monoclonal antibodies to Fas, and by intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) which have been shown to contain natural anti-Fas antibodies. Consequently, over the last few years, numerous case reports and 9 non-controlled clinical studies containing 10 or more patients have analyzed the therapeutic effect of IVIG in TEN. Taken together, although each study has its potential biases, 7 of 9 such studies point towards a benefit of IVIG used at doses greater than 2 g/kg on the mortality associated with TEN. These studies should serve as the basis for designing an appropriate prospective trial or for conducting a metaanalysis in the near future, in order to determine the therapeutic efficacyof IVIG in TEN.",

The aim of this study is to determine whether galectin-3 is involved in human lung fibrosis.We measured galectin-3 concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and examined its expression in alveolar macrophages from patients with interstitial lung disorders using ELISA and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Using monocyte/macrophage cell lines in vitro, we examined the effect of cytokines on galectin-3 expression, and the opposite similarly by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Finally, we performed Micro Boyden chamber assay and Sircoll assay to determine whether galectin-3 induces migration and collagen synthesis, respectively, in fibroblasts.Galectin-3 was specifically increased in BALF from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular disease (CVD-IP). Galectin-3 levels in BALF seemed to be lower in IPF and CVD-IP patients receiving corticosteroid therapy. Alveolar macrophages from IPF patients expressed more galectin-3 compared with those from control. Galectin-3 expression was induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon (IFN)-gamma in a monocytic cell line U937. Galectin-3 also induced mRNA expression and protein production of TNF-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 in a macrophage cell line THP-1. This lectin stimulated NIH-3T3 fibroblast to induce migration and collagen synthesis in vitro.These results suggest that galectin-3 is involved in the pathogenesis of human IPF and CVD-IP by activating macrophages and fibroblasts.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions have been explained by the hapten concept, according to which a small chemical compound is too small to be recognized by the immune system. Only after covalently binding to an endogenous protein the immune system reacts to this so called hapten-carrier complex, as the larger molecule (protein) is modified, and thus immunogenic for B and T cells. Consequently, a B and T cell immune response might develop to the drug with very heterogeneous clinical manifestations. In recent years, however, evidence has become stronger that not all drugs need to bind covalently to the MHC-peptide complex in order to trigger an immune response. Rather, some drugs may bind directly and reversibly to immune receptors like the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or the T cell receptor (TCR), thereby stimulating the cells similar to a pharmacological activation of other receptors. This concept has been termed pharmacological interaction with immune receptors the (p-i) concept. While the exact mechanism is still a matter of debate, non-covalent drug presentation clearly leads to the activation of drug-specific T cells as documented for various drugs (lidocaine, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), lamotrigine, carbamazepine, p-phenylendiamine, etc.). In some patients with drug hypersensitivity, such a response may occur within hours even upon the first exposure to the drug. Thus, the reaction to the drug may not be due to a classical, primary response, but rather be mediated by stimulating existing, pre-activated, peptide-specific T cells that are cross specific for the drug. In this way, certain drugs may circumvent the checkpoints for immune activation imposed by the classical antigen processing and presentation mechanisms, which may help to explain the peculiar nature of many drug hypersensitivity reactions.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a CD4 + T cell-mediated autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system. It was largely accepted that Th1 cells driven by IL-12 were pathogenic T cells in human MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. Recent data have established that IL-17-producing CD4 + T cells, driven by IL-23 and referred to as Th17 cells, play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of EAE. A combination of TGF-p and IL-6 induce Th17 cell lineage commitment via expression of transcription factor RORyt. Th17 cells and induced Foxp3 + T regulatory cells are in reciprocal position in the T cell lineage commitment governed by TGF-p and IL-6. The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid is involved in this process via TGF-p dependent induction of Foxp3. We have demonstrated that human Th17 cells could be identified as CCR2 + CCR5- memory CD4 + T cells. It is becoming clear that IL-23/Th17 axis also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various human autoimmune diseases including MS. Additionally, accumulating evidences raise a possibility that CCR2 on Th17 cells may be a therapeutic target in MS.",

In Europe and the United States, it has recently been divided into two subgroups: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). The majority of CRSwNP cases have a strong tendency to recur after surgery and show eosinophil-dominant inflammation. However, this definition has proved difficult to apply in Japan and East Asia, because more than half of the CRSwNP cases do not exhibit eosinophil-dominant inflammation in these areas of the world. In Japan in the 1990s, refractory CRSwNP to the standard treatment was focused on in clinical studies and the term \"eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis\" (ECRS) was introduced to identify this subgroup of chronic rhinosinusitis in 2001. ECRS is different from non-ECRS in terms of many clinical features: symptom appearance, occurrence site of nasal polyps, CT scan findings, the histology of nasal polyps, blood examination findings, clinical course after surgery, and co-morbid asthma, etc. In this review, we describe these clinical features and mention how to make a clinical diagnosis of ECRS as well as how to treat it. Finally, we discuss the pathophysiology of ECRS. The concept of ECRS in Japan would be applicable for CRSwNP in other countries including Europe and the United States.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease. Animal models induced by relevant allergens play a very important role in the elucidation of the disease. The patients with atopic dermatitis are highly sensitized with mite allergens such as Dermatophagoides farinae (Df). Therefore, in the present study, we tried to develop a novel model for atopic dermatitis by repeated application with Df extract ointment. Df extract ointment was repeatedly applied to the back of NC/Nga mice together with barrier disruption. Atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions were evaluated by dermatitis scores, skin histology and immunological parameters. The effect of corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitor was also examined. Repeated application of Df extract ointment caused rapid increase in dermatitis scores. Clinical (skin dryness, erythema, edema and erosion) and histological symptoms (dermal and epidermal thickening, hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and inflammatory cell infiltration) in this model were very similar to those in human atopic dermatitis. Serum total and Df-specific IgE levels were elevated in this model compared with normal mice, and draining lymph node cells isolated from the mice that exhibited dermatitis produced significant amounts of interleukin-5, interleukin-13 and interferon-γ after re-stimulation with Df. Furthermore, current first-line drugs for the treatment of human atopic dermatitis, corticosteroid and tacrolimus ointments, were effective against the clinical and histological symptoms in this model. These results suggest that the model we have established is useful for not only elucidating the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis but also for evaluating therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Airway remodeling can be defined as changes in the composition, content, and organization of the cellular and molecular constituents of the airway wall. Airway remodeling is a characteristic feature of asthma, and has important functional implications. These structural changes include epithelial detachment, subepithelial fibrosis, increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass, decreased distance between epithelium and ASM cells, goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus gland hyperplasia, proliferation of blood vessels and airway edema and changes in the cartilage. Each can contribute to airway hyperreactivity (AHR), and may eventually lead to irreversible airflow obstruction with disease progression. Structural changes can be observed from early onset of the disease and thus remodeling is thought to be characteristic of asthma. Some aspects of airway remodeling can be explained as a consequence of TH2 inflammation, although it has also been suggested that the exaggerated inflammation and remodeling seen in asthmatic airways is the consequence of abnormal injury and repair responses stemming from the susceptibility of bronchial epithelia to components of the inhaled environment. According to this view, remodeling occurs by way of a noninflammatory mechanism, where inflammation of airways and altered structure and function of the airways are parallel and interacting factors. Airway remodeling in established asthma is poorly responsive to current therapies, such as inhalation of corticosteroids and administration of β2-agonists, antileukotrienes, and theophylline.",

The serodominant specificities are the group 1&2 and the group 23 faecal allergens. The collective IgE binding to the group 1&2 allergens can measure unequivocal HDM sensitisation better than HDM extracts although discrepancies have been found in regions with complex acarofauna suggesting a need to investigate the specificity with allergen components. The group 4, 5, 7&21 allergens that each induce responses in about 40% of subjects are mid-tier allergens accounting for most of the remaining IgE binding. Their titres are proportional to the concomitant responses to Der p1&2. Group 2 allergen variants have different antibody binding. Body proteins only occasionally induce sensitisation although a higher prevalence of binding by atopic dermatitis patients provides a new avenue of research. A broad spectrum of IgE binding has been associated with diverse symptoms but not with the severity of asthma which is associated with low IgG antibody. Some allergens such as the group 14 large lipid binding proteins and the recently described proteins Der f 24-33, need further investigation but with the cognoscence that other denominated allergens have been found to be minor sensitisers by comparative quantitative analyses. Scabies is a confounder for diagnosis with extracts, inducing cross-reactive antibodies with Der p 4&20 as is seafood allergy with cross reactivity to Der p 10 a minor HDM allergen.

No adverse effects were related to the use of probiotics.These data suggest that the prenatal and postnatal supplementation of bifidobacteria is effective in primary preventing allergic diseases.

    "abstract": "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with considerable variability noted in disease severity, patterns of airway inflammation, and achievement of disease control on current medications. An absence of disease control is most frequently noted in patients with severe asthma, and is defined as a lack of control while on high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus a second controller medication. In part, this lack of control may relate to a diminished effect of current guideline-directed care on the existing pattern of airway inflammation in severe asthma. Airway inflammation in severe asthma has been arbitrarily divided into T (type) 2 high and T2 low. T2 high is characterized by the generation of key cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4, −5 and −13, which generate and regulate airway inflammation. Biomarkers to mark the presence of T2-high inflammation include eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and immunoglobulin (Ig) E, whose presence arises from the action of IgE, IL-5, IL-4, and IL-13. In this review, treatment of severe asthma with monoclonal antibodies, i.e. biologics, which are directed against these inflammation generated pathways are reviewed. The available monoclonal antibodies include omalizumab (anti-IgE); mepolizumab, reslizumab and benralizumab (anti-IL-5 pathways), and dupilumab (anti-IL-4/IL-13). The use of these T2-high interventions has led to significant reductions in asthma symptoms, a decreased frequency of exacerbations, and improved lung function in many patients. Not only has the use of these monoclonal antibodies led to improved asthma control in patients with severe disease, their use has provided insight into mechanisms of severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Given the importance of appropriate diagnosis and appropriate assessment of cutaneous symptoms in treatment of atopic dermatitis, the basics of treatment in this guideline are composed of (1) investigation and countermeasures of causes and exacerbating factors, (2) correction of skin dysfunctions (skin care), and (3) pharmacotherapy, as three mainstays. These are based on the disease concept that atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory cutaneous disease with eczema by atopic diathesis, multi-factorial in onset and aggravation, and accompanied by skin dysfunctions. These three points are equally important and should be appropriately combined in accordance with the symptoms of each patient. In treatment, it is important to transmit the etiological, pathological, physiological, or therapeutic information to the patient to build a favorable partnership with the patient or his/her family so that they may fully understand the treatment. This guideline discusses chiefly the basic therapy in relation to the treatment of this disease. The goal of treatment is to enable patients to lead an uninterrupted social life and to control their cutaneous symptoms so that their quality of life (QOL) may meet a satisfactory level. The basics of treatment discussed in this guideline are based on the “Guidelines for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis 2008” prepared by the Health and Labour Sciences Research and the “Guidelines for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis 2015 (ADGL2015)” prepared by the Atopic Dermatitis Guidelines Advisory Committee, Japanese Society of Allergology in principle. The guidelines for the treatment of atopic dermatitis are summarized in the “Japanese Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Allergic Disease 2016” together with those for other allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, which manifests clinically as variable airway narrowing (wheezes and dyspnea) and cough. Long-standing asthma may induce airway remodeling and become intractable. The prevalence of asthma has increased; however, the number of patients who die from it has decreased (1.3 per 100,000 patients in 2018). The goal of asthma treatment is to control symptoms and prevent future risks. A good partnership between physicians and patients is indispensable for effective treatment. Long-term management with therapeutic agents and the elimination of the triggers and risk factors of asthma are fundamental to its treatment. Asthma is managed by four steps of pharmacotherapy, ranging from mild to intensive treatments, depending on the severity of disease; each step includes an appropriate daily dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, which may vary from low to high. Long-acting β2-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, sustained-release theophylline, and long-acting muscarinic antagonists are recommended as add-on drugs, while anti-immunoglobulin E antibodies and other biologics, and oral steroids are reserved for very severe and persistent asthma related to allergic reactions. Bronchial thermoplasty has recently been developed for severe, persistent asthma, but its long-term efficacy is not known. Inhaled β2-agonists, aminophylline, corticosteroids, adrenaline, oxygen therapy, and other approaches are used as needed during acute exacerbations, by selecting treatment steps for asthma based on the severity of the exacerbations. Allergic rhinitis, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic otitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, and pregnancy are also important conditions to be considered in asthma therapy.",

    "abstract": "Periostin, an extracellular matrix protein belonging to the fasciclin family, has been shown to play a critical role in the process of remodeling during tissue/organ development or repair. Periostin functions as a matricellular protein in cell activation by binding to their receptors on cell surface, thereby exerting its biological activities. After we found that periostin is a downstream molecule of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, signature cytokines of type 2 immune responses, we showed that periostin is a component of subepithelial fibrosis in bronchial asthma, the first formal proof that periostin is involved in allergic inflammation. Subsequently, a great deal of evidence has accumulated demonstrating the significance of periostin in allergic inflammation. It is of note that in skin tissues, periostin is critical for amplification and persistence of allergic inflammation by communicating between fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Furthermore, periostin has been applied to development of novel diagnostics or therapeutic agents for allergic diseases. Serum periostin can reflect local production of periostin in inflamed lesions induced by Th2-type immune responses and also can predict the efficacy of Th2 antagonists against bronchial asthma. Blocking the interaction between periostin and its receptor, αv integrin, or down-regulating the periostin expression shows improvement of periostin-induced inflammation in mouse models or in in vitro systems. It is hoped that diagnostics or therapeutic agents targeting periostin will be of practical use in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Skin barrier dysfunction has emerged as a critical driving force in the initiation and exacerbation of atopic dermatitis and the \"atopic march\" in allergic diseases. The genetically determined barrier deficiency and barrier disruption by environmental and endogenous proteases in skin and epithelium are considered to increase the risk of sensitization to allergens and contribute to the exacerbation of allergic diseases. Sources of allergens such as mites, cockroaches, fungi, and pollen, produce or contain proteases, which are frequently themselves allergens. Staphylococcus aureus, which heavily colonizes the lesions of atopic dermatitis patients and is known to trigger a worsening of the disease, also produces extracellular proteases. Environmental proteases can cause barrier breakdown in the skin, not only in the epithelium, and stimulate various types of cells through IgE-independent mechanisms. Endogenous protease inhibitors control the functions of environmental and endogenous proteases. In this review, we focus on the barrier dysfunction caused by environmental proteases and roles of endogenous protease inhibitors in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. Additionally, we examine the subsequent innate response to Th2-skewed adaptive immune reactions.",

Allergic rhinitis includes pollinosis, which is intractable and reduces quality of life (QOL) when it becomes severe. A guideline is needed to understand allergic rhinitis and to use this knowledge to develop a treatment plan. In Japan, the first guideline was prepared after a symposium held by the Japanese Society of Allergology in 1993. The current 6th edition was published in 2009, and is widely used today. To incorporate evidence based medicine (EBM) introduced from abroad, the most recent collection of evidence/literature was supplemented to the Practical Guideline for the Management of Allergic Rhinitis in Japan 2009. The revised guideline includes assessment of diagnosis/treatment and prescriptions for children and pregnant women, for broad clinical applications. An evidence-based step-by-step strategy for treatment is also described. In addition, the QOL concept and cost benefit analyses are also addressed. Along with Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact of Asthma (ARIA), this guideline is widely used for various clinical purposes, such as measures for patients with sinusitis, childhood allergic rhinitis, oral allergy syndrome, and anaphylaxis and for pregnant women.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of ocular allergies has been increasing worldwide for the past several decades. The geographical distribution and hot spots of rhinoconjunctivitis have been documented in a global survey by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). ISAAC indicated that Africa, Latin America, and Japan were notable for their high prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis. The outcomes of follow-up studies of regional differences and the characteristics of allergic conjunctivitis are summarized in this review. Currently, comorbid diseases and socioeconomic and environmental factors, including climate and air pollution, are proposed to contribute to the regional differences in the prevalence of allergic conjunctivitis. Of them, rhinitis has been shown repeatedly to be significantly associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Their mechanistic aspects on association with the prevalence of systemic allergic diseases have been reviewed by examining the birth cohort or in vitro analyses. A vision threatening form of ocular allergy, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, is prevalent in the African countries and Japan. Of the proposed associated factors, air pollution was shown to contribute not only to aggravating the symptoms but also to the increase in the incidence of its severe forms. Its mechanistic aspects are discussed in this review in the context of comorbid diseases.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease composed of various phenotypes. Periostin, a molecule inducible with interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13 in bronchial epithelial cells, is a biomarker of \"TH2-high\" asthma. The objective of this study is to examine whether the serum periostin concentrations are correlated with the severity, specific phenotype(s), or comorbidity of asthma. Serum concentrations of periostin were measured in 190 Japanese asthmatic patients and 11 healthy controls. The protocol was registered under UMIN 000002980 in the clinical trial registry. The serum concentrations of periostin were significantly higher (P = 0.014) in asthmatics [70.0 (54.0–93.5) ng/ml] than in healthy subjects [57.0 (39.0–63.0) ng/ml], though we found no correlation between serum periostin concentrations and treatment steps required to control asthma. To characterize \"high-periostin\" phenotype(s), the patients with asthma were divided among tertiles based on the serum concentrations of periostin. The high-periostin group was older at onset of asthma (P = 0.04), had a higher prevalence of aspirin intolerance (P = 0.04) or concomitant nasal disorders (P = 0.03–0.001), higher peripheral eosinophil counts (P < 0.001), and lower pulmonary function (P = 0.02–0.07). The serum concentrations of periostin were particularly high in asthmatic patients complicated by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and olfactory dysfunction. In contrast, neither atopic status, control status of asthma, nor quality of life were related with the \"high-periostin\" phenotype. Elevated periostin concentrations in serum were correlated with a specific phenotype of eosinophilic asthma, late-onset and often complicated by obstructive pulmonary dysfunction and nasal disorders.",

This study investigated the expression of pendrin and periostin in sinonasal tissue of patients with allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and aspirin-induced asthma. Prospective control study conducted at Yamagata University, Japan. : Surgical samples were investigated by means of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the expression of pendrin and periostin mRNA. The presence and location of pendrin and periostin were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. : Pendrin and periostin production was significantly higher in patients with nasal disorders than in controls. Further significant increases in periostin expression were noted in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and in those with aspirin-induced asthma. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining for pendrin in epithelial cells and submucosal glands and for periostin in the basement membrane in all three disorders, and additionally for periostin in nasal polyp tissue in chronic rhinosinusitis and aspirin-induced asthma. : Production of pendrin and periostin is upregulated in allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and aspirin-induced asthma. These findings suggest that pendrin can induce mucus production and that periostin can induce tissue fibrosis and remodeling in the nasal mucosa. Therefore, these mediators may be therapeutic target candidates for allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and aspirin- induced asthma.",

    "abstract": "Filaggrin is a key protein that facilitates terminal differentiation of the epidermis and formation of the skin barrier. Mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG) have been identified as the cause of ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) and have been shown to be major predisposing factors for atopic dermatitis (AD). Approximately 40 loss-of-function FLG mutations have been identified in patients with ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) and/or atopic dermatitis (AD) in Europe and Asia. Major differences exist in the spectra of FLG mutations observed between different ancestral groups. Notably, prevalent FLG mutations are distinct between European and Asian populations. Many cohort studies on FLG mutations in AD have revealed that approximately 25-50% of AD patients harbour filaggrin mutations as a predisposing factor. In addition, FLG mutations are significantly associated with AD-associated asthma. The risk for developing allergic rhinitis is also significantly higher with a FLG mutation, both with and without accompanying AD. Recent studies have hypothesized that skin barrier defects caused by FLG mutations allows allergens to penetrate the epidermis and to interact with antigen-presenting cells, leading to the development of atopic disorders including asthma. The restoration of skin barrier function seems a feasible and promising strategy for prophylactic treatment of AD patients with FLG mutations.",

It has been shown to regulate the expression of pruritic factors, such as nerve growth factor and semaphorin 3A, in skin keratinocytes via histamine H1 receptor (H1R). Furthermore, H1R antagonist reduced the level of IL-31, a cytokine involving the skin barrier and pruritus, in chronic dermatitis lesions in NC/Nga mice and patients with AD. Histamine plays roles in the induction of allergic inflammation by activating eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and Th2 cells via histamine H4 receptor (H4R). H4R, in addition to H1R, is expressed on sensory neurons, and a decrease in scratching behaviors was observed in H4R-deficient mice and mice treated with a H4R antagonist. We found that the combined administration of H1R and H4R antagonists inhibited the itch response and chronic allergic inflammation, and had a pharmacological effect similar to that of prednisolone. Although the oral administration of H1R antagonists is widely used to treat AD, it is not very effective. In contrast, JNJ39758979, a novel H4R antagonist, had marked effects against pruritus in Japanese patients with AD in a phase II clinical trial. Next generation antihistaminic agents possessing H1R and H4R antagonistic actions may be a potent therapeutic drug for AD.",

    "abstract": "Background: In Th2 immune responses, TSLP is a key player by induction of OX40-ligand (OX40L) on dendritic cells (DCs), which is the trigger to induce Th2 cell-mediated allergic cascade. Thus, TSLP-DC-OX40L axis might be the principal pathway in the inflammatory cascades in atopic dermatitis and asthma. IL-33, which is produced by epithelial cells, has been implicated in the Th2 immune responses and pathogenesis of the allergic disorders. However, the role of IL-33 in the Th2-polarizing TSLP-DC-OX40L axis still remains largely elusive. We focused on the ability of IL-33 to promote OX40L-mediated Th2 responses. Methods: Purified human naïve or memory CD4 + T cells were stimulated with recombinant OX40L or TSLP- treated DCs (TSLP-DCs) in the presence of IL-33, and the cytokine production by the primed T cells was examined. We also performed immunohistochemical analyses for the expression of IL-33 in specimens of lymph node and skin from the patients with atopic dermatitis. Results: IL-33 remarkably enhanced TSLP-DCs-driven or OX40L-driven Th2 responses from naïve T cells and the Th2 functional attributes of CRTH2 + CD4 + Th2 memory cells by the increased production of IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13. In addition, IL-33 was expressed in the nuclei of epithelial cells in not only skin lesion but also lymph nodes of the patient with atopic dermatitis, suggesting a specialized role in adaptive T cell-priming phase. Conclusions: IL-33 works as a positive regulator of TSLP-DC-OX40L axis that initiates and maintains the Th2 cell-mediated inflammatory responses, and therefore, it would be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of allergic disorders.",

However, elimination diets should be used only if necessary because of the patient-related burden. For this purpose, it is very important that causative foods be accurately identified. There are a number of means available to identify causative foods, including the history taking, a skin prick test, detection of antigen-specific IgE antibodies in the blood, the basophil histamine release test, the elimination diet test, and the oral challenge test, etc. Of these, the oral challenge test is the most reliable. However, it should be conducted under the supervision of experienced physicians because it may cause adverse reactions, such as anaphylaxis.",

However, recent advances in analytical tools for basophils have clarified the non-redundant roles of basophils in allergic inflammation. Basophils play crucial roles in both IgE-dependent and -independent allergic inflammation, through their migration to the site of inflammation and secretion of various mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. Basophils are known to produce large amounts of IL-4 in response to various stimuli. Basophil-derived IL-4 has recently been shown to play versatile roles in allergic inflammation by acting on various cell types, including macrophages, innate lymphoid cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Basophil-derived serine proteases are also crucial for the aggravation of allergic inflammation. Moreover, recent reports suggest the roles of basophils in modulating adaptive immune responses, particularly in the induction of Th2 differentiation and enhancement of humoral memory responses. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in understanding the roles of basophils in allergic inflammation.",

Few studies have used noninvasive techniques to measure epidermis function in asymptomatic neonates.Data of 116 infants from our previous randomized controlled study were analyzed. Skin barrier function was measured through transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum hydration (SCH), and pH. The association between skin barrier function and time to AD development was evaluated. Patients were classified with high or low TEWL, and SCH and pH were assessed. The survival function of the time to AD development and hazard ratios were estimated. Allergic sensitization to egg white and ovomucoid at 32 weeks was assessed.Regardless of a filaggrin mutation, TEWL (optimal cutoff, 6.5 g/m(2)/h) of the forehead within the first week of life showed a lower p-value than TEWL of the leg, and the SCH and pH measurements. Baseline TEWL of the forehead was not different between groups, except for the mean gestational age, and it was not affected by humidity. We found a significant difference in the cumulative AD incidence between the high and low TEWL groups for the forehead only (p < 0.05). The probability without AD was lower in the high TEWL group than in the low TEWL group. For only the high TEWL group, AD development decreased significantly with daily emollient use. The high TEWL group exhibited a higher rate of sensitization to ovomucoid (p = 0.07).TEWL of the forehead during the first week of life is associated with AD development.",

    "abstract": "Hippocrates is often credited with first recognizing that food could be responsible for adverse symptoms and even death in some individuals, but it was not until the seminal observations by Prausnitz that the investigation of food allergy was viewed on a more scientific basis. In the first half of the 20th century, there were periodic reports in the medical literature describing various food allergic reactions. In the mid- to late- 1970's, the studies of Charles May and colleagues began to penetrate the medical world's skepticism about the relevance of food allergy and how to diagnose it, since standard skin testing was known to correlate poorly with clinical symptoms. With May's introduction of the double-blind placebo-controlled oral food challenge, the study of food allergy became evidence-based and exponential strides have been made over the past four decades in the study of basic immunopathogenic mechanisms and natural history, and the diagnosis and management of food allergies. Today IgE- and non-IgE-mediated food allergic disorders are well characterized and efforts to treat these allergies by various immunotherapeutic strategies are well under way.",

Itch sensations are thought to protect against external insults and toxic substances. Although itch is not directly lethal, chronic and long lasting itch in certain diseases can worsen quality of life. Therefore, the mechanisms responsible for chronic itch require careful investigation. There is a significant amount of basic research concerning itch, and the effect of various itch mediators on primary sensory neurons have been studied. Interestingly, many mediators of itch involve signaling related to transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. TRP channels, especially thermosensitive TRP channels, are expressed by primary sensory neurons and skin keratinocytes, which receive multimodal stimuli, including those that cause itch sensations. Here we review the molecular and cellular mechanisms of itch and the involvement of TRP channels in mediating itch sensations.",

Twenty-eight cases of SJS (53.8%) and all cases of TEN were caused by drugs. Hepatitis was the most common organ involvement in both SJS and TEN. Renal dysfunction, intestinal disorder, and respiratory disorder were also involved in some cases. The major complication was pneumonia and sepsis. All cases except for 3 cases were treated systemically with corticosteroids. Steroid pulse therapy was performed in 88.6% of TEN. Plasmapheresis and/or immunoglobulin therapy was combined with steroid therapy mainly in TEN after 2007. The mortality rate was 6.9% and the rates for SJS and TEN were 1.9% and 14.3%, respectively. These were much lower than predicted mortality according to a severity-of-illness scoring system for TEN prognosis (SCORTEN) score. When comparing the mortality rate between 2000-2006 and 2007-2013, it was decreased from 4.5% to 0.0% in SJS and from 22.2% to 5.3% in TEN.Treatment with steroid pulse therapy in combination with plasmapheresis and/or immunoglobulin therapy seems to have contributed to prognostic improvement in SJS/TEN.",

However, they distinctly differ in etiology, clinical manifestations, and the nature of disease course. Especially, although AEP and CEP respond well to corticosteroids, relapse frequently occurs in patients with CEP, but rarely in those with AEP.

To determine the genetic components of these diseases and to discover the genes and cellular pathways underlying them, a large number of genetic studies have been conducted. Progress in genetics enables us to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which is a comprehensive and unbiased approach to identify susceptibility loci for multifactorial diseases. Recent GWASs have convincingly detected a large number of loci associated with allergic diseases. Candidate genes in the susceptibility loci suggest roles for epithelial barrier functions, innate-adaptive immunity, IL-1 family signaling, regulatory T cells and the vitamin D pathway in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. Interestingly, the IL1RL1, HLA, IL13 and C11orf30 regions are overlapping susceptibility loci among atopic dermatitis and asthma or allergic rhinitis. Although a more complete collection of associated genes and pathways is needed, biologic insights revealed by GWASs improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of human allergic diseases and contribute to the development of better treatment and preventive strategies.",

    "abstract": "Successful allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is associated with a marked decrease in symptoms on allergen exposure, a reduced requirement for 'rescue' anti-allergic drugs and improvement in patients' quality of life. These benefits persist for at least several years following discontinuation of immunotherapy - the hallmark of clinical and immunological tolerance. AIT has been shown to modulate both innate and adaptive immunological responses. Early suppression of innate effector cells of allergic inflammation (mast cells, basophils), regulation of pro-allergic T helper 2 type (Th 2) responses and IgE + B cell responses have been shown to occur both in the tissue and in the peripheral blood during AIT. The allergen-tolerant state is associated with local and systemic induction of distinct populations of allergen-specific T regulatory cells including IL-10 + Tregs (Tr1 cells), TGF-P + Tregs and FoxP3 + memory T regs. B cells are switched in favour of producing IgG (particularly IgG4) antibodies and associated blocking activity for IgE-dependent events, including basophil activation and IgE-facilitated allergen binding to B cells. An induction of IL-10 + B regulatory cells and alterations in dendritic cell subsets have also recently been described. These events are followed by the induction of T regulatory cells, suppression of allergen-specific T cell proliferation and immune deviation from Th2 in favour of Th1 responses. Alternative mechanisms of tolerance include apoptosis/deletion of antigen-specific memory Th2 cells and/or a failure of co-stimulation leading to T cell anergy.",

    "abstract": "IgE and mast cells play a pivotal role in various allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and urticaria. Treatment with omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, has significantly improved control of these allergic diseases and introduced a new era for the management of severe allergic conditions. About 10 years of experience with omalizumab treatment for severe allergic asthma confirmed its effectiveness and safety, reducing symptoms, frequency of reliever use, and severe exacerbations in patients with intractable conditions. Omalizumab is particularly useful in childhood asthma, where atopic conditions often determine clinical courses of asthma. Recently, omalizumab is approved for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with the fixed dose of 300 mg. Although the mechanisms underlying the actions of omalizumab in CSU are not fully clarified, nearly 90% of patients with CSU showed a complete or a partial response to omalizumab treatment. Furthermore, omalizumab is just approved for the treatment of severe Japanese cedar pollinosis (JC) based on the successful results of an add-on study of omalizumab for inadequately controlled severe pollinosis despite antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids. For proper use of omalizumab to treat severe JC, co-administration of antihistamines is necessary, while patients should meet the criteria including strong sensitization to Japanese cedar pollen (≥class 3) and poor control under standard treatment. In the management of severe allergic diseases using omalizumab, issues including cost and concerns about relapse after its discontinuation should be overcome. At the same time, possibilities for application to other intractable allergic diseases should be considered.",

To that end, identification of the associated allergen is important for facilitating both education and allergen avoidance that are essential to long-term risk reduction. As the number of known exposures associated with anaphylaxis is limited, discovery of novel causative agents is crucial to evaluation and management of patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis. Within the last 10 years several apparently separate observations were recognized to be related, all of which resulted from the development of antibodies to a carbohydrate moiety on proteins. Interestingly, the exposure differed from airborne allergens but was nevertheless capable of producing anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions. Our recent work has identified these responses as being due to a novel IgE antibody directed against a mammalian oligosaccharide epitope, galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (\"alpha-gal\"). This review will present the historical summary of the identification of cetuximab hypersensitivity due to alpha-gal IgE and discuss the non-primate mammalian meat food allergy as well as current goals and directions of our research programs.",

Therefore, establishing such biomarkers is essential for managing patients who suffer from these conditions. This review addresses the importance of serum periostin measurements by describing observations made in a KiHAC multicenter cohort with periostin used as a marker of pulmonary function decline and refractory Th2/ eosinophilic inflammation in patients with asthma receiving long-term ICS treatment. Furthermore, serum periostin could be a companion diagnostic for targeted therapy against refractory Th2/eosinophilic inflammation.

    "abstract": "Chronic pruritus is a complex multifactorial symptom associated with many different diseases that represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for physicians. In order to better manage chronic pruritus, a detailed medical history, individualized diagnostic procedures and treatment approaches are necessary. Treatment should not only take itch into consideration, but also scratching-induced skin lesions and accompanying disorders such as anxiety, depression and insomnia. Various standardized questionnaires and scales have been developed to assist in the characterization and assessment of these parameters. Monodimensional scales (e.g. the visual analogue scale) represent a simple method for assessing pruritus intensity and are frequently used; however, they can easily be confounded and may indicate the level of satisfaction regarding the medical care provided rather than the itch course. The Dynamic Pruritus Score and Itch-Free Days questionnaire enable a closer assessment of patient responses to treatment. Because chronic pruritus has the potential to greatly impact the quality of life, it is important that physicians recognize it as a major issue. The Dermatology Quality of Life Index is an instrument that is used in a variety of dermatological conditions, but may be unsuitable for measuring pruritus of extracutaneous origin. The ItchyQol is a tool designed specifically for those suffering from pruritus. Additional tools, such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, take psychiatric comorbidities into consideration. Recommendations from European (EADV-based Task Force Pruritus) and international (International Forum for the Study of Itch) expert groups focusing on assessment instruments for chronic pruritus are also provided in this article.",

We performed a nationwide survey to determine the clinical characteristics of ABPA in Japan.In 2013, a questionnaire on physician-diagnosed ABPA/allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis was sent to 903 medical centers specializing in respiratory or allergic diseases. Cases fulfilling the following criteria were categorized as possible ABPA-central bronchiectasis (ABPA-CB): 1) presence of specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies or a positive skin reaction to Aspergillus, and 2) bronchiectasis or mucoid impaction in the central bronchi.Of 499 physician-diagnosed cases reported by 132 clinical centers, 358 cases met the criteria for possible ABPA-CB. Median age of ABPA-CB onset was 57 (interquartile range, 44-68) years; later-onset disease, developing ≥50 years of age, accounted for 66% of the cases and was associated with female sex, delayed onset of asthma, and lower levels of serum IgE. A third of the patients (120 patients, 34%) exhibited low levels of serum total IgE (<1000 IU/mL). Aspergillus species were isolated from sputum in 126/213 cases (59%), and Schizophyllum commune was identified in 12 (6%) patients. During the course of the treatment, ABPA recurred in 169 (48%) cases.This nationwide survey identified several unique clinical characteristics of ABPA in Japan, such as late-onset, relatively lower serum IgE levels, and frequent recurrences/flares.",

A total of 52 patients were included. Thirty-seven patients (71.2%) were female. The four most common causative agents were phenytoin (23.1%), nevirapine (17.3%), allopurinol (15.4%), and cotrimoxazole (13.5%). The overall prevalence was 9.63 cases per 100,000 inpatients.

The majority (84.6%) had single internal organ involvement. The most common internal organ involvement was liver (94.2%). Allopurinol was associated with higher incidence of renal involvement (p = 0.01). Up to 60% of patients had eosinophilia. Allopurinol was associated with higher eosinophilia (p = 0.003).

DRESS is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Phenytoin, nevirapine, allopurinol, and cotrimoxazole were the major causes. Allopurinol-induced DRESS had the longest onset time, and was associated with higher eosinophilia and incidence of renal involvement. Raising awareness among both health care providers and public for early detection and withdrawal of the causative agent is critical to save life and reduce morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic skin disease. The presence of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is frequently detected on skin affected with AD. In this review, we focused on the characteristics of S. aureus strains isolated from AD skin, particularly the proteins on the cell surface that modulates the interactions between Langerhans cell, keratinocyte, and S. aureus. The skin microbiome plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the skin, and colonization of S. aureus in AD is considered to be deeply involved in the clinical manifestation and pathogenesis of skin flares. Colonizing S. aureus strains in AD harbor different surface proteins at the strain level, which are indicated as clonal complexes. Moreover, the cell wall proteins of S. aureus affect skin adhesion and induce altered immune responses. S. aureus from AD skin (AD strain) exhibits internalization into keratinocytes and induces imbalanced Th1/Th2 adaptive immune responses via Langerhans cells. AD strain-derived cell wall proteins and secreted virulence factors are expected to represent therapeutic targets. In addition, the microbiome on the AD skin surface is associated with skin immunity; thus, microbiome-based immunotherapy, whose mechanism of action completely differs from that of typical steroid ointments, are expected to be developed in the future.",

    "abstract": "TSLP is an epithelial cell-derived cytokine synthesized in response to various stimuli, including protease allergens and microorganisms like viruses and bacteria. Biological functions of TSLP require heterodimer formation between the TSLP receptor (TSLPR) and IL-7 receptor-α, which polarize dendritic cells to induce type 2 inflammation and directly expand and/or activate Th2 cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells, basophils, and other immune cells. TSLP is thus considered a master regulator of type 2 immune responses at the barrier surfaces of skin and the respiratory/gastrointestinal tract. Indeed, genetic, experimental, and clinical evidence suggests that the TSLP-TSLPR pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma. Tezepelumab (AMG-157/MEDI9929) is a human anti-TSLP antibody that prevents TSLP-TSLPR interactions. A phase 2 trial for moderate to severe AD showed that a greater but not statistically significant percentage of tezepelumab-treated patients showed clinical improvements compared to the placebo group. A phase 2 trial for uncontrolled, severe asthma showed significant decreases in asthma exacerbation rate and improved pulmonary function and asthma control for tezepelumab-treated patients. Levels of biomarkers of type 2 inflammation, such as blood/sputum eosinophil counts and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide decreased, however, clinical efficacy was observed irrespective of the baseline levels of these biomarkers. A blockade of the TSLP-TSLPR pathway likely will exert significant clinical effects on AD, asthma, and other allergic diseases. The efficacy of anti-TSLP antibodies compared to other biologics needs to be further examined.",

Current analyses provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States have estimated the rates of anaphylactic reactions in 2.5 and 11.1 per million of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines administered, respectively. Although rather low, such rates could have importance due to the uncommon fact that a large majority of the world population will be subjected to vaccination with the aforementioned vaccines in the following months and vaccination will most likely be necessary every season as for influenza vaccines. Health regulators have advised that any subject with a previous history of allergy to drugs or any component of the vaccines should not be vaccinated, however, certain misunderstanding exists since allergy to specific excipients in drugs and vaccines are in occasions misdiagnosed due to an absence of suspicion to specific excipients as allergenic triggers or due to inaccurate labeling or nomenclature. In this review, we provide an updated revision of the most current data regarding the anaphylactic reactions described for BNT162b2 vaccine, mRNA-1273 vaccine, and AZD1222 vaccine. We extensively describe the different excipients in the vaccines with the potential to elicit systemic allergic reactions such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysorbates, tromethamine/trometamol, and others and the possible immunological mechanisms involved.",

In development of EoE, refluxed gastric acid may also have an important role. For diagnosis of EGIDs, the presence of symptoms possibly originating from the involved gastrointestinal tract and dense eosinophil infiltration are important factors. Imaging studies, including endoscopy and computed tomography, along with histopathological examinations of biopsy specimens are useful for diagnosis, whereas laboratory testing of blood, urine, and stool samples has limited value. Three useful options for treating EoE patients are acid inhibitors, swallowed topical corticosteroids, and an elimination diet, while systemic administration of glucocorticoids is the standard treatment of EGE, though information is limited. Since the prevalence of EGIDs is increasing in Western countries as well as Japan, development of effective treatments based on sufficient evidence is becoming an urgent need.",

The cause of AERD have remained unclear, however the decrease in the production of PGE2 caused by the reduction in COX-2 activity is considered to main pathological mechanism of AERD. The mast cell activation and the interaction between platelets and granulocytes are lead to the CysLT overproduction and severe eosinophilic inflammation. The ongoing activation of mast cells is important key pathogenesis in not only stable AERD but exacerbated AERD by aspirin and NSAIDs. In recent years, type 2 inflammation caused by ILC2 activation in patients with AERD have been attracting attention. Omalizumab is effective option for AERD via suppression of mast cell activation and CysLT overproduction. Dupilumab improves sinus symptoms especially in patients with AERD.

Since IL-4 and IL-13 play important and redundant roles in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, blocking both the IL-4 and IL-13 signals would be a powerful and effective strategy for treating allergic diseases. Dupilumab (Dupixent®) is a fully human monoclonal antibody recognizing IL-4Rα and blocking both the IL-4 and IL-13 signals. Dupilumab was first prescribed for atopic dermatitis (AD) patients and has been widely approved for adult patients with moderate to severe AD since 2018. Dupilumab has since been used for asthma, receiving approval for uncontrolled asthma in 2019. A phase 3 study using dupilumab for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) has been just completed, with positive results. Several clinical trials of dupilumab for other diseases in which type 2 inflammation is dominant are now underway. It is hoped that dupilumab will open the door to a new era for treating allergic patients with AD, asthma, and CRSwNP, and for more patients with type 2 inflammations.",

    "abstract": "Biologics have been a key component of severe asthma treatment, and there are currently biologics available that target IgE, IL-5, IL-4/IL-13, and TSLP. Randomized controlled trials have established clinical evidence, but a significant portion of patients with severe asthma in real-life settings would have been excluded from those trials. Therefore, real-world research is necessary, and there is a growing body of information about the long-term efficacy and safety of biologics. Multiple clinical phenotypes of severe asthma exist, and it is crucial to choose patients based on their phenotypes. Blood eosinophil count is an important biomarker for anti-IL-5 therapies, and FeNO and eosinophil counts serve as prediction markers for dupilumab. Reliable markers for predicting response, however, have not yet been fully established for omalizumab. Identification of clinical or biological prediction factors is crucial for the path toward clinical remission because the current treatment goal includes clinical remission, which is defined as a realistic goal for remission off treatment. Additionally, since there are now multiple biologic options and overlaps in eligibility for biologics in clinical practice, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of switching the biologics is crucial. Investigations into the clinical trajectory following the cessation of biologics are another important issue. Recent research on omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab and dupilumab's real-world effectiveness, the prediction factor for the efficacy, and the impact of switching or discontinuation will be reviewed and discussed in this review.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota resides in the human gastrointestinal tract, where it plays an important role in maintaining host health. The human gut microbiota is established by the age of 3 years. Studies have revealed that an imbalance in the gut microbiota, termed dysbiosis, occurs due to factors such as cesarean delivery and antibiotic use before the age of 3 years and that dysbiosis is associated with a higher risk of future onset of allergic diseases. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing methods have revealed the presence of dysbiosis in patients with allergic diseases, which increases attention on the relationship between dysbiosis and the development of allergic diseases. However, there is no unified perspective on the characteristics on dysbiosis or the mechanistic link between dysbiosis and the onset of allergic diseases. Here, we introduce the latest studies on the gut microbiota in children with allergic diseases and present the hypothesis that dysbiosis characterized by fewer butyric acid-producing bacteria leads to fewer regulatory T cells, resulting in allergic disease. Further studies on correcting dysbiosis for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, variable airway narrowing, and sensory nerve irritation, which manifest as wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and cough. Longstanding asthma may result in airway remodeling and become intractable. Despite the increased prevalence of asthma in adults, asthma-associated deaths have decreased in Japan (0.94 per 100,000 people in 2020). The goals of asthma treatment include the control of symptoms and reduction of future risks. A functional partnership between physicians and patients is indispensable for achieving these goals. Long-term management with medications and the elimination of triggers and risk factors are fundamental to asthma treatment. Asthma is managed via four steps of pharmacotherapy (“controllers”), ranging from mild to intensive treatments, depending on disease severity; each step involves daily administration of an inhaled corticosteroid, which varies from low to high dosage. Long-acting β2 agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, sustained-release theophylline, and long-acting muscarinic antagonists are recommended as add-on drugs. Allergen immunotherapy is a new option that is employed as a controller treatment. Further, as of 2021, anti-IgE antibody, anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5 receptor α-chain antibodies, and anti-IL-4 receptor α-chain antibodies are available for the treatment of severe asthma. Bronchial thermoplasty can be performed for asthma treatment, and its long-term efficacy has been reported. Algorithms for their usage have been revised. Comorbidities, such as allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, should also be considered during the treatment of chronic asthma. Depending on the severity of episodes, inhaled short-acting β2 agonists, systemic corticosteroids, short-acting muscarinic antagonists, oxygen therapy, and other approaches are used as needed (“relievers”) during exacerbation.",

    "abstract": "Airway mucus is a hydrogel with unique biophysical properties due to its primary water composition and a small proportion of large anionic glycoproteins or mucins. The predominant mucins in human mucus, MUC5AC and MUC5B, are secreted by specialized cells within the airway epithelium both in normal conditions and in response to various stimuli. Their relative proportions are correlated with specific inflammatory responses and disease mechanisms. The dysregulation of mucin expression is implicated in numerous respiratory diseases, including asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis, where the pathogenic role of mucus has been extensively described yet often overlooked. In airway diseases, excessive mucus production or impaired mucus clearance leads to mucus plugging, with secondary airway occlusion that contribute to airflow obstruction, asthma severity and poor control. Eosinophils and Charcot Leyden crystals in sputum contribute to the mucus burden and tenacity. Mucin may also contribute to eosinophil survival. Other mechanisms, including eosinophil-independent IL-13 release, mast-cell activation and non-type-2 (T2) cytokines, are also likely to participate in mucus pathobiology. An accurate assessment of mucus and its clinical and functional consequences require a thorough approach that includes evaluation of cellular predominance in sputum, airway cytokines and other inflammatory markers, mucus characteristics and composition and structural and functional impact measured by advanced lung imaging. This review, illustrated with clinical scenarios, provides an overview of current methods to assess mucus and its relevance to the choice of biologics to treat patients with severe asthma.",

When considering interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 signaling, effects of dupilumab on airway mucus hypersecretion and airway remodeling are expected, but they have been reported in only a few short-term studies. Its efficacy for airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) remains unknown. We comprehensively assessed the efficacy of dupilumab, especially for subjective and objective measures of airway mucus hypersecretion and airway dimensions in moderate-to-severe asthmatic patients. In 28 adult patients with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma, the comprehensive efficacy of 48-week dupilumab treatment, including the Cough and Sputum Assessment Questionnaire (CASA-Q), radiological mucus scores and airway dimensions on computed tomography (CT), was assessed prospectively. Treatment responsiveness to dupilumab was analyzed. With 48-week dupilumab treatment, all four cough and sputum domain scores of CASA-Q improved significantly. Radiological mucus scores and airway wall thickening on CT were significantly decreased. The decreases in mucus scores were significantly associated with improvements in Asthma Control Questionnaire scores, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) overall scores, airway obstruction, and airway type 2 inflammation. When defined by > 0.5 improvement in AQLQ overall scores, 18 patients (64%) were identified as responders.

The pathophysiology of FPIES remains poorly characterized. The first international consensus guidelines for FPIES were published in 2017 and provided clinicians with parameters on the diagnosis and treatment of FPIES. The guidelines have served as a resource in the recognition and management of FPIES, contributing to an increased awareness of FPIES. Since then, new evidence has emerged, shedding light on adult-onset FPIES, the different phenotypes of FPIES, the recognition of new food triggers, center-specific food challenge protocols and management of acute FPIES. Emerging evidence indicates that FPIES impacts both pediatric and adult population. As a result, there is growing need to tailor the consensus guidelines to capture diagnoses in both patient groups. Furthermore, it is crucial to provide food challenge protocols that meet the needs of both pediatric and adult FPIES patients, as well as the subset of patients with atypical FPIES. This review highlights the evolving clinical evidence relating to FPIES diagnosis and management published since the 2017 International FPIES Guidelines. We will focus on areas where recent published evidence may support evolution or revision of the guidelines.",

Cytokines including interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13 are key immune signatures of type 2 inflammation and are the targets of multiple specific therapeutics for allergic diseases. Despite shared core immune mechanisms, the distinct structures and functions of the skin and airways lead to unique therapeutic responses. It is increasingly recognized that the nervous system has a major role in sensing and directing inflammatory processes. Indeed, crosstalk between type 2 immune activation and somatosensory functions mediates tissue-specific signatures such as itching in the skin. However, neuroimmune interactions are shaped by distinct neuronal and immune landscapes, and differ between the skin and airways. In the skin, dorsal root ganglia-derived neurons mediate pruritus via type 2 cytokines and neurogenic inflammation by mast cell or basophil activation. Conversely, vagal ganglia-derived neurons regulate airway immune responses by releasing neuropeptides/neurotransmitters such as calcitonin gene-related peptides, neuromedin U, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline. Sensory neuron-derived vasoactive intestinal peptide forms a feedback loop with IL-5, amplifying eosinophilic inflammation in the airways, a mechanism that is absent in the skin. These differences influence the efficacy of cytokine-targeted therapies. For instance, IL-4/IL-13-targeted therapies like dupilumab demonstrate efficacy in AD and allergic airway diseases, whereas IL-5-targeted therapies are effective in eosinophilic asthma but not AD. Understanding these neuroimmune interactions underscores the need for tailored therapeutic approaches to address allergic diseases where barrier tissues are involved.",

    "abstract": "Among small-vessel vasculitides, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), and allergic granulomatous angiitis (AGA) are known collectively as ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) because of the involvement of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) as the common pathogenesis. Major target antigens of ANCA associated with vasculitis are myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3). MPO-ANCA is related to MPA and AGA, and PR3-ANCA is the marker antibody in WG. MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis is more frequent in Japan, whereas PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis is more common in Europe and USA. ANCA appears to induce vasculitis by directly activating neutrophils. Therefore, no immunoglobulins or complement components are detected in the vasculitis lesions; hence, AAV is called pauci-immune vasculitis (pauci = few/little). Untreated patients with severe AAV with multi-organ involvement have a poor prognosis, which is improved by combination therapy with cyclophosphamide and high-dose corticosteroid. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) regarding induction and maintenance of remission of AAV indicated that the rate of remission induction by the standard regimen is approximately 90% in 6 months, that maintenance of remission can be achieved with oral azathioprine as well as cyclophosphamide, and that methotrexate can be used only for non-renal mild AAV. As these data were obtained mostly in patients positive for PR3-ANCA, caution must be taken in applying these findings to Japanese patients, most of whom are positive for MPO-ANCA. A prospective study is now underway to clarify the effectiveness of the standard regimen in Japanese patients with MPOANCA-associated vasculitis. This article describes the diagnostic criteria and the recent evidence-based therapeutic strategy of AAV.",

    "abstract": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a lipid mediator with potent chemoattractant properties and that is rapidly generated from activated innate immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells. Elevated levels of LTB4 have been reported in various allergic diseases and these levels have been related to disease activity and response to treatment. Recent studies using LTB4 receptor-1 (BLT1) antagonists or BLT1-deficient mice have revealed that ligation of BLT1 by LTB4 is important for the activation and recruitment of inflammatory cells including neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophages, mast cells, dendritic cells, and more recently, effector T cells to inflamed tissues in various inflammatory diseases. The LTB4/BLT1 pathway appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of severe persistent asthma, aspirin- and exercise-induced asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis together with other mediators including cysteinyl leukotrienes, cytokines, and chemokines. LTB4 production is in general resistant to corticosteroid treatment. In fact, corticosteroids can upregulate BLT1 expression on corticosteroid-resistant inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and effector memory CD8 + T cells. As a result, this corticosteroid-resistant LTB4/BLT1 pathway may contribute to the development of inflammation in allergic diseases that do not respond to the introduction of corticosteroids. Inhibition of this pathway has potential therapeutic benefit in various allergic diseases that have involvement of corticosteroid-insensitivity.",

The effect of oral administration of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus Strain L-92 (L-92) on ovalbumin (OVA)-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E production was investigated in BALB/c mice. L-92 was orally administered to mice for 8 weeks from 2 weeks after initiation of OVA-immunization. Patterns of cytokine and Ig production in splenocytes and cells from Peyer's patches (PPs) from these mice were examined after restimulation with OVA in vitro. L-92 significantly suppressed serum OVA-specific IgE levels for a long period. Cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 and Igs such as total IgE and OVA-specific IgE were produced at significantly lower levels by splenocytes of L-92-treated mice, compared with those of control mice. In contrast, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and IgA levels produced by PPs from L-92-treated mice were significantly higher than in those from control mice. Oral L-92 administration regulated both Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses, suppressed serum OVA-specific IgE, and induced TGF-β production in PPs. TGF-β is known to be associated with activation of regulatory T (Treg) cells. These data suggest that LAB may have immunomodulative effect by Treg cells via TGF-β activity.",

In addition to PFS, latex-fruit syndrome is also well-known as the disease exhibiting OAS. In treating the condition, it must be noted that most but not all symptoms of PFS are those of OAS. In many cases, antigens become edible by heating, but some are resistant to heating. Also, since the exacerbation of atopic dermatitis is occasionally observed after the intake of cooked antigens in asymptomatic individuals, careful inquiry of the history is important in designing the treatment.

The major complication was sepsis, but in only 1.9% of SJS and 10.8% of TEN. Most cases were treated systemically with corticosteroids, and 42 cases (80.8%) of SJS and 39 cases (60.0%) of TEN were treated with corticosteroids alone. Plasmapheresis and/or immunoglobulin therapy was combined with corticosteroid therapy in some cases. The mortality rates for patients with SJS and TEN were 1.9% and 6.2%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by reversible airflow limitation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Persistent inflammation in airway tissues may lead to structural changes known as airway remodeling and consequently airway obstruction that is not fully reversible and progressive loss of lung function over time. It is generally accepted that airway remodeling is closely related to progression of airway hyperresponsiveness, and the severity of asthma. The structural changes observed in chronic persistent asthma, which includes airway smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, collagen deposition to sub-epithelial basement membrane, hyperplasia of goblet cells, thickening of airway mucosa and an increase in vascularity, are derived from airway inflammation. For instance, the thickened airway mucosa might be produced by cytokines and growth factors released from inflammatory cells and airway epithelial cells, and associated with bronchial hyperreactivity and asthma severity. To date, many studies have identified candidate mechanisms and mediators for these observed structural changes, which are thus potential targets in the treatment of asthma. In this review, we describe the recent knowledge of the mechanisms and clinical implications of airway remodeling in asthma.",

Some trials of specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) have been carried out, but the rate of tolerance induction was low despite long treatment periods, at least 3 months to several years. A new type of treatment is long desired. The objectives of this study are to perform our rush SOTI for school-age patients with severe egg allergy, and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this method for one year. Six school-age children (7-12 years of age) with severe IgE-mediated egg allergy confirmed by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) underwent rush SOTI, in which patients ingested increasing doses of egg several times every day. After rush SOTI, patients ingested the maintenance dose of egg at least twice a week. In DBPCFC, the median threshold dose of egg white inducing allergic reactions was 0.152 g (0.012-0.360 g). All subjects acquired tolerance to more than one whole egg (60 g). It took only 12 days (9-18 days). None experienced any serious reaction. We observed a decrease in IL-10 and an increase in TGF-β1 at 6 months and a decrease in egg-specific IgE and an increase in egg white-specific IgG4 at 12 months after rush SOTI in blood. All subjects have been able to ingest more than one whole egg ever since. Our rush SOTI is a safe and effective treatment for severe food allergy since only a few weeks are needed to acquire tolerance.

    "abstract": "Clinicians had suspected for years that drug eruptions were probably mediated by immune mechanisms because their timing suggested sensitization and specific immunologic memory rather than direct toxicity. An immune response to medications was also demonstrated by positive skin tests and by several types of in vitro tests that evidenced immediate or delayed hypersensitivity. In the last decade several teams of researchers obtained in vitro drug-specific human T-cell clones, in a variety of clinical types of drug eruptions. These clones were produced from blood or skin mononuclear cells of patients with a history of drug reaction by stimulation in vitro with drug. They were either of CD4 or CD8 phenotypes. Drug specific clones were stimulated by the parent drug much more often than by reactive metabolites. That challenged the classical \"hapten hypothesis\" that the immune response was initiated by reactive metabolites combined to self proteins. The medication usually stimulated specific T-cells after non-covalent binding to major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules on antigen presenting cells. In toxic epidermal necrolysis, T-lymphocytes present at the site of lesions, exhibited a drug specific cytotoxicity against autologous target cells, or allogeneic cells that shared the same HLA than autologous cells. This MHC class I restriction and mediation of death by perforin/granzyme release, is the classical behavior of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, like those operating in the reject of a transplanted organ. MHC restriction could explain the key role of HLA genes as predisposing factors to severe drug reactions. A strong association between HLA and hypersensitivity to abacavir, SJS or TEN to carbamazepine or allopurinol has been recently demonstrated. Resemblance to graft rejection points to the possible therapeution value of immuno suppressive agents. Most drug eruptions appear to result from T-cell mediated delayed hypersensitivity. The secondary activation of different cascades of cytokines, may contribute to the heterogeneity of clinical presentations.",

Two DC subsets have been identified in humans: myeloid DCs and plasmacytoid DCs. The DC subsets induce different types of adaptive immune responses depending on environmental factors. Interleukin (IL)-12 from myeloid DCs is a dominant factor for the induction of a Th1 response, whereas OX40 ligand on myeloid DCs is important for the induction of a Th2 response. Furthermore, inducible costimulator (ICOS) ligand on plasmacytoid DCs is critical for the induction of IL-10-producing regulatory T cells. Elucidating cellular and molecular mechanisms by which functions of the two DC subsets are modulated will lead to understanding the pathogenesis of various immune-related diseases and to developing novel immunological therapies.",

In the case of IgE-mediated food allergy, the diagnostic approaches and pathogenic mechanisms are well characterized. In contrast, the diagnostic approaches and pathogenic mechanisms of GI allergy remain mostly unclear. In this review, we summarized each type of GI allergy in regard to its historical background and updated clinical features, offending foods, etiology, diagnosis, examinations, treatment and pathogenesis. There are still many problems, especially in regard to the diagnostic approaches for GI allergy, that are closely associated with the definition of each disease.

Allergic conjunctival disease is defined as \"a conjunctival inflammatory disease associated with a Type I allergy accompanied by some subjective or objective symptoms.\" Allergic conjunctival disease is classified into allergic conjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and giant papillary conjunctivitis. Representative subjective symptoms include ocular itching, hyperemia, and lacrimation, whereas objective symptoms include conjunctival hyperemia, swelling, folliculosis, and papillae. Patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis, which is characterized by conjunctival proliferative changes called giant papilla accompanied by varying extents of corneal lesion, such as corneal erosion and shield ulcer, complain of foreign body sensation, ocular pain, and photophobia. In the diagnosis of allergic conjunctival diseases, it is required that type I allergic diathesis is present, along with subjective and objective symptoms accompanying allergic inflammation. The diagnosis is ensured by proving a type I allergic reaction in the conjunctiva. Given that the first-line drug for the treatment of allergic conjunctival disease is an antiallergic eye drop, a steroid eye drop will be selected in accordance with the severity. In the treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis, an immunosuppressive eye drop will be concomitantly used with the abovementioned drugs.",

After the childhood period, itch appears first, followed by formation of well-circumscribed plaque or polymorphous dermatoses at the same site. When accompanied with dermatitis and dry skin, treatment of skin lesions should be prioritized. When itch appears first, disease history, such as causes and time of appearance of itch should be obtained by history taking. In many cases, itch increases in the evening when the sympathetic nerve activity decreased. Treatment is provided considering that hypersensitivity to various external stimulations can cause itch. Heat and sweating are thought to especially exacerbate itch. Factors causing itch, such as cytokines and chemical messengers, also induce itch mainly by stimulating the nerve. Scratching further aggravates dermatitis. Skin hypersensibility, where other non-itch senses, such as pain and heat, are felt as itch, sometimes occurs in AD. Abnormal elongation of the sensory nerve into the epidermis, as well as sensitizing of the peripheral/central nerve, are possible causes of hypersensitivity, leading to itch. To control itch induced by environmental factors such as heat, treatment for dermatitis is given priority. In the background of itch exacerbated by sweating, attention should be given to the negative impact of sweat on skin homeostasis due to 1) leaving excess sweat on the skin, and 2) heat retention due to insufficient sweating. Excess sweat on the skin should be properly wiped off, and dermatitis should be controlled so that appropriate amount of sweat can be produced. Not only stimulation from the skin surface, but also visual and auditory stimulation can induce new itch. This \"contagious itch\" can be notably observed in patients with AD. This article reviews and introduces causes of aggravation of itch and information regarding how to cope with such causes.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale biodiversity loss and complex changes in social behaviors are altering human microbial ecology. This is increasingly implicated in the global rise in inflammatory diseases, most notably the “allergy epidemic” in very early life. Colonization of human ecological niches, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, is critical for normal local and systemic immune development and regulation. Disturbances in composition, diversity and timing of microbial colonization have been associated with increased allergy risk, indicating the importance of strategies to restore a dysbiotic gut microbiota in the primary prevention of allergic diseases, including the administration of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. Here, we summarize and discuss findings of randomized clinical trials that have examined the effects of these microbiome-related strategies on short and long-term allergy preventative effects – including new guidelines from the World Allergy Organization which now recommend probiotics and prebiotics for allergy prevention under certain conditions. The relatively low quality evidence, limited comparative studies and large heterogeneity between studies, have collectively hampered recommendations on specific probiotic strains, specific timing and specific conditions for the most effective preventive management. At the same time the risk of using available products is low. While further research is needed before specific practice guidelines on supplement probiotics and prebiotics, it is equally important that the underlying dietary and lifestyle factors of dysbiosis are addressed at both the individual and societal levels.",

Patients develop allergic reactions not only with soap use, but also with exercise after the intake of wheat protein (WP). ω5-Gliadin and HMW-glutenin were identified as major allergens in conventional WP-WDEIA patients. However, the allergens in HWP-WDEIA have yet to be elucidated.Sera were obtained from 22 patients with HWP-sensitized WDEIA. The allergenic activities of HWP and six recombinant wheat gluten proteins, including α/β-, γ-, ω1,2- and ω5-gliadin and low- and high molecular weight (HMW)-glutenins, were characterized by immunoblot analysis and histamine releasing test. IgE-binding epitopes were identified using arrays of overlapping peptides synthesized on SPOTs membrane.Immunoblot analysis showed that IgE antibodies (Abs) from HWP-WDEIA bound to α/β-, γ- and ω1,2-gliadin. Recombinant γ-gliadin induced significant histamine release from basophils in eight of 11 patients with HWP-WDEIA. An IgE-binding epitope \"QPQQPFPQ\" was identified within the primary sequence of γ-gliadin, and the deamidated peptide containing the \"PEEPFP\" sequence bound with IgE Abs more strongly compared to the native epitope-peptide. The epitope-peptide inhibited IgE-binding to HWP, indicating that the specific IgE to HWP cross-reacts with γ-gliadin.HWP-WDEIA patients could be sensitized to HWP containing a PEEPFP sequence, and WDEIA symptoms after WP ingestion could partly be induced by γ-gliadin. These findings could be useful to help develop tools for diagnosis and desensitization therapy for HWP-WDEIA.",

One hundred and thirty-three Japanese patients with generalized vitiligo were enrolled in this study to investigate the occurrence of autoimmune diseases in Japanese patients with generalized vitiligo and their families. Twenty-seven of the patients with generalized vitiligo (20.3%) had autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease (sixteen patients, 12%) and alopecia areata (seven patients, 5.3%). Thirty-five patients (26.3%) had a family history of generalized vitiligo and/or other autoimmune diseases. Familial generalized vitiligo was present in fifteen (11.3%), including four families with members affected by autoimmune disorders. Twenty (15.0%) had one or more family members with only autoimmune disorders. Among Japanese vitiligo patients, there is a subgroup with strong evidence of genetically determined susceptibility to not only vitiligo, but also to autoimmune thyroid disease and other autoimmune disorders.",

    "abstract": "Despite its direct exposure to huge amounts of microorganisms and foreign and dietary antigens, the gut mucosa maintains intestinal homeostasis by utilizing the mucosal immune system. The gut mucosal immune system protects the host from the invasion of infectious pathogens and eliminates harmful non-self antigens, but it allows the cohabitation of commensal bacteria in the gut and the entry of dietary non-self antigens into the body via the mucosal surface. These physiological and immunological activities are regulated by the ingenious gut mucosal immune network, comprising such features as gut-associated lymphoid tissue, mucosal immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial peptides, secretory IgA, and commensal bacteria. The gut mucosal immune network keeps a fine tuned balance between active immunity (against pathogens and harmful non-self antigens) and immune tolerance (to commensal microbiota and dietary antigens), thus maintaining intestinal healthy homeostasis. Disruption of gut homeostasis results in persistent or severe gastrointestinal infection, inflammatory bowel disease, or allergic inflammation. In this review, we comprehensively introduce current knowledge of the gut mucosal immune system, focusing on its interaction with allergic inflammation.",

The patients with this disease often have history of strenuous exercise or labor a few days to 1–2 weeks before the onset. The chief symptoms are symmetrical, full-circumference swelling and plate-like hardness of the distal limbs. This is accompanied by redness and pain in the early stages, with many cases exhibiting systemic symptoms such as fever or generalized fatigue. The lesions have been observed extending to the proximal limbs, though never on the face or fingers. En bloc biopsies from the skin to the fascia show marked fascial thickening and inflammatory cell infiltration by the lymphocytes and plasma cells. Eosinophilic infiltration is useful for the diagnosis but is only seen in the early stages of the disease. Recently, “Diagnostic criteria, severity classification, and clinical guidelines for eosinophilic fasciitis” were published. This review article discusses about eosinophilic faciitis in detail, from its pathophysiology to the treatment.",

Although ILC2s were initially reported to play a key role in the anti-helminth innate immunity, we now have greater interest in their role in asthma and other allergic diseases. In various asthma mouse models, ILC2s provoke eosinophilic inflammation accompanied by airway hyperresponsiveness independent of acquired immunity. Moreover, recent mouse studies show that ILC2s also promote acquired immunity and Th2 polarization, and various cytokines and lipid mediators influence the functions of ILC2s. Although ILC2s have also been identified in humans, studies on the role of human ILC2s in asthma are very limited. Thus far, human studies have shown that there is a slight difference in responsiveness and production of cytokines between mouse and human ILC2s, and it has been suggested that ILC2s are involved in allergic-type asthma and the exacerbation of asthma. In this review, we focus on mouse and human ILC2s, and discuss their role in asthma.",

A diet that includes baked milk or egg is well tolerated and appears to accelerate the development of regular milk or egg tolerance when compared with strict avoidance. However, the indications for an oral food challenge (OFC) using baked products are limited for patients with high specific IgE values or large skin prick test diameters. Oral immunotherapies (OITs) are becoming increasingly popular for the management of food allergies. However, the reported efficacy of OIT is not satisfactory, given the high frequency of symptoms and requirement for long-term therapy. With food allergies, removing the need to eliminate a food that could be consumed in low doses could significantly improve quality of life. This review discusses the importance of an OFC and OIT that use low doses of causative foods as the target volumes. Utilizing an OFC or OIT with a low dose as the target volume could be a novel approach for accelerating the tolerance to causative foods.",

The skin provides a distinctive environment characterized by rich fibroblasts producing various ECM proteins, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and immune responses induced by external stimuli. Recently, periostin-a matricellular protein-has been highlighted for its pivotal functions in the skin. Analysis of periostin null mice has revealed that periostin contributes to collagen fibrillogenesis, collagen cross-linking, and the formation of ECM meshwork via interactions with other ECM components. Periostin expression is enhanced by mechanical stress or skin injury; this is indicative of the physiologically protective functions of periostin, which promotes wound repair by acting on keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Along with its physiological functions, periostin plays pathogenic roles in skin fibrosis and chronic allergic inflammation. In systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, periostin levels reflect the severity of skin fibrosis. Periostin null mice have shown reduced skin fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model, indicating a key role of periostin in fibrosis. Moreover, in atopic dermatitis (AD), attenuated AD phenotype has been observed in periostin null mice in a house dust mite extract-induced AD mouse model. Th2 cytokine-induced periostin acts on keratinocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines that further enhance the Th2 response, thereby sustaining and amplifying chronic allergic inflammation. Thus, periostin is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of AD and other inflammation-related disorders affecting the skin. Understanding the dynamic actions of periostin would be key to dissecting pathogenesis of skin-related diseases and to developing novel therapeutic strategies.",

Recently, otologi- cal symptoms such as otitis media and hearing loss, not previously often associated with AAV, have been reported in AAV cases. In these cases we propose a diagnosis of otitis media with AAV (OMAAV). The ANCA titer is important for the diagnosis of OMAAV, and in most cases rapid progressive hearing loss is observed as localized AAV. Peripheral facial nerve palsy or hypertrophic pachymeningitis are coupled with 25% of cases and 18% of cases respectively. Proteinase 3-ANCA (PR3-ANCA) positive otitis media causes granulomatous formation or middle ear effusion in the middle ear, on the other hand myeloperoxidase-ANCA (MPO-ANCA) positive otitis media predominantly presents as otitis media with effusion. The early diagnosed case and the sensorineural hearing loss not progressed deaf could be recovered by the immunosuppressive therapy. Delayed diagnosis of AAV occasionally leads to progression to the irreversible phase; therefore, diagnosis at the early-localized stage is important for treating AAV. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of this newly proposed concept of OMAAV.",

The nuclear IL-33 is released by necrotic cells after tissue injury and/or trauma, and subsequently provokes local inflammation as an alarmin, like high-mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB-1) and IL-1α. IL-33 mainly activates Th2 cells and such innate-type immune cells as mast cells, basophils, eosinophils and natural helper cells that express IL-33R (a heterodimer of IL-1 receptor-like 1 [IL-1RL1; also called ST2, T1, Der4, fit-1] and IL-1 receptor accessory protein [IL-1RAcP]). That activation causes the cells to produce Th2 cytokines, which contribute to host defense against nematodes.

    "abstract": "Eosinophils not only play a critical role in the pathogenesis of eosinophil-associated diseases, but they also have multiple important biological functions, including the maintenance of homeostasis, host defense against infections, immune regulation through canonical Th1/Th2 balance modulation, and anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic activities. Recent studies have elucidated some emerging roles of eosinophils in steady-state conditions; for example, eosinophils contribute to adipose tissue metabolism and metabolic health through alternatively activated macrophages and the maintenance of plasma cells in intestinal tissue and bone marrow. Moreover, eosinophils exert tissue damage through eosinophil-derived cytotoxic mediators that are involved in eosinophilic airway inflammation, leading to diseases including asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps characterized by fibrin deposition through excessive response by eosinophils-induced. Thus, eosinophils possessing these various effects reflect the heterogenous features of these cells, which suggests the existence of distinct different subpopulations of eosinophils between steady-state and pathological conditions. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that instead of dividing eosinophils by classical morphological changes into normodense and hypodense eosinophils, murine eosinophils from lung tissue can be phenotypically divided into two distinct subtypes: resident eosinophils and inducible eosinophils gated by Siglec-Fint CD62L+ CD101low and Siglec-Fhigh CD62L- CD101high, respectively. However, it is difficult to explain every function of eosinophils by rEos and iEos, and the relationship between the functions and subpopulations of eosinophils remains controversial. Here, we overview the multiple roles of eosinophils in the tissue and their biological behavior in steady-state and pathological conditions. We also discuss eosinophil subpopulations.",

    "abstract": "Physicians think of mast cells and IgE primarily in the context of allergic disorders, including fatal anaphylaxis. This 'bad side' of mast cells and IgE is so well accepted that it can be difficult to think of them in other contexts, particularly those in which they may have beneficial functions. However, there is evidence that mast cells and IgE, as well as basophils (circulating granulocytes whose functions partially overlap with those of mast cells), can contribute to host defense as components of adaptive type 2 immune responses to helminths, ticks and certain other parasites. Accordingly, allergies often are conceptualized as \"misdirected\" type 2 immune responses, in which IgE antibodies are produced against any of a diverse group of apparently harmless antigens, as well as against components of animal venoms. Indeed, certain unfortunate patients who have become sensitized to venoms develop severe IgE-associated allergic reactions, including fatal anaphylaxis, upon subsequent venom exposure. In this review, we will describe evidence that mast cells can enhance innate resistance to reptile or arthropod venoms during a first exposure to such venoms. We also will discuss findings indicating that, in mice which survive an initial encounter with venom, acquired type 2 immune responses, IgE antibodies, the high affinity IgE receptor (FcɛRI), and mast cells can contribute to acquired resistance to the lethal effects of both honeybee venom and Russell's viper venom. These findings support the hypothesis that mast cells and IgE can help protect the host against venoms and perhaps other noxious substances.",

The section on child asthma in JAGL 2017 provides information on how to diagnose asthma between infancy and adolescence (0-15 years of age). It makes recommendations for best practices in the management of childhood asthma, including management of acute exacerbations and non-pharmacological and pharmacological management. This guideline will be of interest to non-specialist physicians involved in the care of children with asthma. JAGL differs from the Global Initiative for Asthma Guideline in that JAGL emphasizes diagnosis and early intervention of children with asthma at <2 years or 2-5 years of age. The first choice of treatment depends on the severity and frequency of symptoms. Pharmacological management, including step-up or step-down of drugs used for long-term management based on the status of asthma control levels, is easy to understand; thus, this guideline is suitable for the routine medical care of children with asthma. JAGL also recommends using a control test in children, so that the physician aims for complete control by avoiding exacerbating factors and appropriately using anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists).",

    "abstract": "Allergens are foreign proteins or glycoproteins that are the target of IgE antibody responses in humans. The relationship between subsequent exposure and the allergic symptoms is often or usually obvious; however, there is increasing evidence that in asthma, atopic dermatitis and some forms of food allergy the induction of symptoms is delayed or chronic. The primary exposure to inhaled allergens is to the particles, which are capable of carrying allergens in the air. Thus, the response reflects not only the properties of the proteins, but also the biological properties of the other constituents of the particle. This is best understood in relation to the mite fecal particles in which the contents include many different immunologically active substances. Allergic disease first became a major problem over 100 years ago, and for many years sensitization to pollens was the dominant form of these diseases. The rise in pediatric asthma correlates best with the move of children indoors, which started in 1960 and was primarily driven by indoor entertainment for children. While the causes of the increase are not simple they include both a major increase in sensitization to indoor allergens and the complex consequences of inactivity. Most recently, there has also been an increase in food allergy. Understanding this has required a reappraisal of the importance of the skin as a route for sensitization. Overall, understanding allergic diseases requires knowing about the sources, the particles and the routes of exposure as well as the properties of the individual allergens.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has recently been recognised as the third important gas-signalling molecule, besides nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. H2S has been reported to be produced by many cell types in mammalian tissues and organs throughout the actions of H2S-generating enzymes or redox reactions between the oxidation of glucose and element of sulfur. Although the pathological role of H2S has not yet been fully elucidated, accumulative data suggest that H2S may have biphasic effects. Briefly, it mainly has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant roles, although it can also have pro-inflammatory effects under certain conditions where rapid release of H2S in tissues occur, such as sepsis. To date, there have been several clinical studies published on H2S in respiratory disorders, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). According to previous studies, H2S is detectable in serum, sputum, and exhaled breath, although a gold standard method for detection has not yet been established. In asthma and COPD, H2S levels in serum and sputum can vary depending on the underlying conditions such as an acute exacerbation. Furthermore, sputum H2S in particular correlates with sputum neutrophils and the degree of airflow limitation, indicating that H2S has potential as a novel promising biomarker for neutrophilic airway inflammation for predicting current control state as well as future risks of asthma. In the future, concurrent measures of H2S with conventional inflammatory biomarkers (fractional exhaled nitric oxide, eosinophils etc) may provide more useful information regarding the identification of inflammatory phenotypes of asthma and COPD for personalised treatment.",

Moreover, we have recently revealed for the first time the pivotal functions of IL-24 in IL-13–mediated skin barrier dysfunction in atopic dermatitis (AD), which is known to be a characteristic of AD caused by Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 or IL-13. In this review, we show recent advances in the basic characteristics of IL-24 and its novel functions in the pathogenesis of allergic skin inflammation, focusing on AD.

During the recent years, there has been major advances in personalized/precision medicine linked to better understanding of disease pathophysiology and precision treatment options of AD. A greater understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of AD through substantial progress in epidemiology, genetics, skin immunology and psychological aspects resulted in advancements in the precision management of AD. However, the implementation of precision medicine in the management of AD still requires the validation of reliable biomarkers, which will provide more tailored management, starting from prevention strategies towards targeted therapies for more severe diseases. Cutaneous exposure to food via defective barriers is an important route of sensitization to food allergens. Studies on the role of the skin barrier genes demonstrated their association with the development of IgE-mediated FA, and suggest novel prevention and treatment strategies for type 2 diseases in general because of their link to barrier defects not only in AD and FA, but also in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis and inflammatory bowel disease. The development of more accurate diagnostic tools, biomarkers for early prediction, and innovative solutions require a better understanding of molecular mechanisms and the pathophysiology of FA. Based on these developments, this review provides an overview of novel developments and advances in AD and FA, which are reported particularly during the last two years.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophils are short-lived and comprise only a small population of circulating leukocytes; however, they play surprisingly multifunctional roles in homeostasis and various diseases including allergy and infection. Recent research has shed light on active cytolytic eosinophil cell death that releases eosinophil extracellular traps (EETs) and total cellular contents, namely eosinophil extracellular trap cell death (EETosis). The pathological contribution of EETosis was made more cogent by recent findings that a classical pathological finding of eosinophilic inflammation, that of Charcot-Leyden crystals, is closely associated with EETosis. Currently no gold standard methods to identify EETosis exist, but \"an active eosinophil lysis that releases cell-free granules and net-like chromatin structure\" appears to be a common feature of EETosis. In this review, we describe several approaches that visualize EETs/EETosis in clinical samples and in vitro studies using isolated human eosinophils. EETs/EETosis can be observed using simple chemical or fluorescence staining, immunostaining, and electron microscopy, although it is noteworthy that visualization of EETs is greatly changed by sample preparation including the extracellular space of EETotic cells and shear flow. Considering the multiple aspects of biological significance, further study into EETs/EETosis is warranted to give a detailed understanding of the roles played in homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.",

Research has shown that the principal cause of cetuximab-induced anaphylaxis is anti-oligosaccharide IgE antibodies specific for galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal) oligosaccharide present on the mouse-derived Fab portion of the cetuximab heavy chain. Furthermore, it has been revealed that patients who are allergic to cetuximab also develop an allergic reaction to mammalian meat containing the same α-Gal oligosaccharide owing to cross-reactivity, and the presumed cause of sensitization is tick bites: Amblyomma in the United States, Ixodes in Australia and Europe, and Haemaphysalis in Japan. The α-Gal-specific IgE test (bovine thyroglobulin-conjugated ImmunoCAP) or CD63-expression-based basophil activation test may be useful to identify patients with IgE to α-Gal in order to predict risk for cetuximab-induced anaphylactic shock. Investigations of cetuximab-related anaphylaxis have revealed three novel findings that improve our understanding of immediate-type allergy: 1) oligosaccharide can serve as the main IgE epitope of anaphylaxis; 2) because of the oligosaccharide epitope, a wide range of cross-reactivity with mammalian meats containing α-Gal similar to cetuximab occurs; and 3) tick bites are a crucial factor of sensitization to the oligosaccharide. Nonetheless, taking a medical history of tick bites and beef allergy may be insufficient to prevent cetuximab-induced anaphylaxis, and therefore blood testing with an α-Gal-specific IgE test, with high sensitivity and specificity, is necessary to detect sensitization to α-Gal.",

Allergic conjunctival disease is defined as \"a conjunctival inflammatory disease associated with a Type I allergy accompanied by some subjective or objective symptoms.\" Allergic conjunctival disease is classified into allergic conjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and giant papillary conjunctivitis. Representative subjective symptoms include ocular itching, hyperemia, and lacrimation, whereas objective symptoms include conjunctival hyperemia, swelling, folliculosis, and papillae. Patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis, which is characterized by conjunctival proliferative changes called giant papilla accompanied by varying extents of corneal lesion, such as corneal erosion and shield ulcer, complain of foreign body sensation, ocular pain, and photophobia. In the diagnosis of allergic conjunctival diseases, it is required that type I allergic diathesis is present, along with subjective and objective symptoms accompanying allergic inflammation. The diagnosis is ensured by proving a type I allergic reaction in the conjunctiva. Given that the first-line drug for the treatment of allergic conjunctival disease is an antiallergic eye drop, a steroid eye drop will be selected in accordance with the severity. In the treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis, an immunosuppressive eye drop will be concomitantly used with the abovementioned drugs.",

AD varies considerably in clinical course, age of onset and degree to which it is accompanied by allergic and non-allergic comorbidities. Skin barrier impairment in both lesional and nonlesional skin is now recognized as a critical and often early feature of AD. This may be explained by a number of abnormalities identified within both the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum layers of the epidermis. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of key barrier defects in AD, starting with a historical perspective. We will also highlight some of the commonly used methods to characterize and quantify skin barrier function. There is ample opportunity for further investigative work which we call out throughout this review. These include: quantifying the relative impact of individual epidermal abnormalities and putting this in a more holistic view with physiological measures of barrier function, as well as determining whether these barrier-specific endotypes predict clinical phenotypes (e.g. age of onset, natural history, comorbidities, response to therapies, etc). Mechanistic studies with new (and in development) AD therapies that specifically target immune pathways, Staphylococcus aureus abundance and/or skin barrier will help us understand the dynamic crosstalk between these compartments and their relative importance in AD.",

    "abstract": "Clinically and pathologically, the patients with hyper-IgE syndrome present similar skin manifestations to common atopic dermatitis. The original hyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by diminished inflammatory response, in combination with Staphylococcus aureus skin abscess and pneumonia followed by pneumatocele formation. These immunological manifestations are frequently associated with skeletal and connective tissue abnormalities. We previously identified that major causal variants of the hyper-IgE syndrome are dominant negative variants in the STAT3. In addition to the identification of new causative variants for the disorders similar to the original hyper-IgE syndrome, causative variants for new types of hyper-IgE syndrome centered only on atopy, high serum IgE levels, and susceptibility to infection, but not associated with diminished inflammatory response, pneumatocele formation, and connective tissue manifestations, have been identified. Recent discovery identified a novel zinc finger protein that regulates STAT3 transcription. Investigation of IL6ST variants disclosed that IL6ST/IL6R cytokine receptor plays a crucial role for the signal transduction upstream of STAT3 in the pathogenesis of the original hyper-IgE syndrome. Even if the same IL6ST variants are used for the signal transduction of IL-6 family cytokines, the signaling defect is more severe in IL-6/IL-11 and milder in LIF. The fact that the non-immune manifestations of the gain-of-function mutations of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 are similar to the those of dominant negative mutations of STAT3 provide a clue to elucidate molecular mechanisms of non-immune manifestations of hyper-IgE syndrome. Research on this hereditary atopic syndrome is being actively conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and to develop new therapeutic approaches.",

Recent studies using cell-type specific steroid hormone receptor-deficient mice have revealed the precise roles of some of these hormones in the immune system. Glucocorticoids are known to have strong anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects and pleiotropic effects on innate and adaptive immune responses. They suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages and DCs and the production of IFN-γ by NK cells, thus inhibiting innate immunity. By contrast, glucocorticoids enhance the immune response by inducing the expression of IL-7R and CXCR4 in T cells and the accumulation of T cells in lymphoid organs in accordance with the diurnal change of the glucocorticoid concentration. Thus, glucocorticoids suppress innate immunity but enhance adaptive immunity. Androgens suppress the homeostasis and activation of ILC2s and the differentiation of Th2 and Th17 cells and enhance the suppressive function of Tregs, thereby alleviating allergic airway inflammation. Thus, these steroid hormones have pleiotropic functions in the immune system. Further investigations are awaited on the regulation of immunity and allergy by estrogens using cell-specific steroid hormone receptor-deficient mice.",

Infants 3–4 months old with atopic dermatitis from 14 primary care pediatric clinics in Japan were enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The infants were administered either mixed allergenic food powder (MP) containing egg, milk, wheat, soybean, buckwheat, and peanuts, or placebo powder (PP). The amount of powder was increased in a stepwise manner on weeks 2 and 4, and continued until week 12. The occurrence of food allergy episodes after powder intervention was assessed at 18 months old. This trial was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (number UMIN000027837). A total of 163 participants were randomly allocated to either the MP group (n = 83) or the PP group (n = 80). The incidence of food allergy episodes by 18 months was significantly different between the MP and PP groups (7/83 vs. 19/80, respectively; risk ratio 0.301 [95% CI 0.116–0.784]; P = 0.0066). Egg allergies were reduced in the MP group. In addition, food allergy episodes from any of the other five foods were significantly reduced, although the reductions in those due to individual foods were not significant. Gradually increasing the intake of very small amounts of multiple foods in early infancy can safely reduce the incidence of egg allergies. Other foods may also suppress food allergies, but no definitive conclusions could be reached.",

The ubiquitous presence of A. fumigatus, its thermotolerant nature, the respirable size of its conidia, and its ability to produce potent allergens are pivotal in worsening asthma control. Due to the diverse clinical manifestations of fungal asthma and the lack of specific biomarkers, its diagnosis remains intricate. Diagnosing fungal asthma requires carefully assessing the patient's clinical history, immunological tests, and imaging. Depending on the severity, patients with fungal asthma require personalized treatment plans, including inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators, and antifungal therapy.

We discuss the diagnosis of various entities included in fungal asthma. We also debate whether newer definitions, including allergic fungal airway disease, offer any additional advantages over the existing ones. Finally, we provide the current treatment options for the individual entities, including A. fumigatus-associated asthma, severe asthma with fungal sensitization, and allergic bronchopulmonary mycoses.",

The development of international consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of FPIES in 2017 enabled us to compare patients worldwide, regardless of geographic variation in disease features. As a result, it has become clear that there is heterogeneity among patients with FPIES or that there are cases that partly fit the diagnostic criteria for FPIES but have different characteristics. This review highlights the heterogeneity in FPIES characteristics in terms of trigger foods, the age of onset, differences in geographic regions, and symptoms; it further proposes four disease entities, including acute FPIES in children, acute FPIES in adults, chronic FPIES, and early-onset neonatal FPIES, depending on the age of onset and presumed pathophysiology. The major symptoms at onset and trigger foods differ in acute FPIES in children, acute FPIES in adults, and chronic FPIES, whereas the disease entities may share a similar pathophysiology. Early-onset neonatal FPIES may have a different pathophysiology than acute or chronic FPIES, and may not necessarily fulfil the full diagnostic criteria for acute or chronic FPIES described in the international consensus guidelines. Due to the similarity in symptoms, early-onset neonatal FPIES may sometimes be misdiagnosed as necrotizing enterocolitis. We aim to increase awareness of FPIES among medical staff in pediatrics, neonatology, and internal medicine and promote research, to gain a better understanding of the heterogeneity and pathophysiology of FPIES.",

    "abstract": "Associations of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) with airway wall remodeling and mucus plugs remain to be explored in smokers and nonsmokers with asthma. Ultra-high-resolution computed tomography (U-HRCT), which allows accurate structural quantification of airways >1 mm in diameter, was used in this study to examine whether higher FeNO was associated with thicker walls of the 3rd to 6th generation airways and mucus plugging in patients with asthma. The retrospective analyses included consecutive former smokers and nonsmokers with asthma who underwent U-HRCT in a hospital. The ratio of wall area to summed lumen and wall area was calculated as the wall area percent (WA%). Mucus plugging was visually scored. Ninety-seven patients with asthma (including 59 former smokers) were classified into low (<20 ppb), middle (20–35 ppb), and high (>35 ppb) FeNO groups (n = 24, 26, and 47). In analysis including all patients and subanalysis including nonsmokers or former smokers, WA% in the 6th generation airways was consistently higher in the high FeNO group than in the low FeNO group, whereas WA% in the 3rd to 5th generation airways was not. In multivariable models, WA% in the 6th generation airways and the rate of mucus plugging were higher in the high FeNO group than in the low FeNO group after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, lung volume, and allergic rhinitis presence. Higher FeNO may reflect the inflammation and remodeling of relatively peripheral airways in asthma in both former smokers and nonsmokers.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe drug reaction characterized by a range of clinical manifestations. These range from mild cases resolving upon cessation of the causative drug to severe cases involving complex disease progression and potential fatality. A hallmark of DIHS/DRESS is the sequential reactivation of herpesviruses, particularly human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), during the disease course, contributing to recurrent symptoms. Viral reactivation can lead to critical complications, including infectious DIHS/DRESS-associated complications (iDACs) and autoimmune sequelae (aDACs). Managing DIHS/DRESS remains challenging due to its complexity, requiring precise prediction and tailored treatment strategies. Recent studies suggest that early-stage classification using the DIHS/DRESS Severity (DDS) score may help identify refractory cases, including DACs. Furthermore, early intervention with anti-cytomegalovirus (anti-CMV) therapy can mitigate iDACs caused by CMV reactivation, preventing progression to severe CMV-related diseases. Long-term follow-up is crucial, as aDACs can manifest even 3 years postonset. Serial monitoring is recommended, particularly in patients treated with intravenous immunoglobulin or corticosteroid pulse therapy, which are recognized risk factors for aDAC development. This review highlights DIHS/DRESS management strategies, focusing on its clinical features, the role of viral reactivation, and therapeutic interventions.",

Activated platelets play a role in the pathomechanism of inflammatory diseases such as asthma, but little is known about platelet activation in chronic skin inflammation, including atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. Furthermore, the relationship between platelet activation and disease severity is not understood. This work was performed to investigate plasma levels of β-thromboglobulin (β-TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF4) as platelet activation markers in patients with AD or psoriasis, and to determine the relationships between these markers and disease severity. Plasma levels of β-TG and PF4 were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay in 22 healthy controls, 44 patients with AD, and 16 patients with psoriasis. The relationships between these markers and the scoring AD (SCORAD) index, blood eosinophilia, serum IgE and serum lactate dehydrogenase were investigated in AD patients, and relationships with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score were examined in psoriatic patients. Plasma β-TG and PF4 levels were significantly higher in patients with AD or psoriasis compared with healthy controls. β-TG and PF4 levels correlated with the SCORAD index, and PF4 levels correlated with PASI scores. Elevated β-TG and PF4 levels were significantly reduced after treatments. Our results show that blood platelets are activated in patients with AD or psoriasis, suggesting that activated platelets play a role in the pathomechanism of chronic skin inflammation. Furthermore, plasma β-TG and PF4 may be markers for the severity of AD and psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "For in vitro diagnosis of wheat allergy, specific IgE to wheat is known to be a poor predictive marker. Oral food challenge, the gold standard for the diagnosis, is accompanied by a risk of severe induced reactions. Reliable in vitro tests are needed to be developed for safe indication for oral challenge. We examined the utility of a basophil activation marker, CD203c, for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated wheat allergy. Fifty-eight children with suspected wheat allergy with positive CAP-FEIA to wheat were enrolled. On 70 occasions, the clinical distinction between patients with wheat allergy (WA) and patients tolerant to wheat (TW) was made by means of an oral food challenge test or recent history of immediate allergic reactions or tolerance after ingestion of wheat. Twelve replicate evaluations were performed in 9 patients over more than a 6-month interval. Thirty two patients on 43 occasions were diagnosed with WA and 27 were confirmed to be TW. One patient had both diagnoses 18 months apart. Peripheral blood was incubated with fractionated wheat extracts, purified native omega-5 gliadin (nOG5) and recombinant omega-5 gliadin (rOG5). Expression of CD203c on basophils was then analyzed by flow cytometry using a commercial kit. All wheat proteins induced concentration-dependent enhancement of CD203c expression in WA, but did not in TW. The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) showed that nOG5-induced CD203chigh% values provided the best power for discriminating between WA and TW, with a sensitivity of 85.0% and specificity of 77.0% at the cut-off level of 14.4%. AUC for CD203c with nOG5 were significantly higher than that for conventional CAP-FEIA, 0.89 and 0.73, respectively (p < 0.01). Measurement of nOG-induced enhancement of CD203c on basophils is useful for the diagnosis of immediate wheat allergy in children.",

The 2 surveys were conducted in the same regions using the same methodology employing a modified Japanese version of the American Thoracic Society-Division of Lung Diseases (ATS-DLD) Epidemiology Questionnaire. We conducted the third survey in 2002, and compared the findings to those of previous studies. In the third survey, 37,036 students attending the same schools as in previous surveys (in 11 prefectures) were given the questionnaire. A total of 35,582 responses (96.1%) were collected. An ATS-DLD Epidemiology Questionnaire was also used in this study, and the findings were compared to those of previous studies. The prevalence of bronchial asthma (BA) in boys, girls, and all students was 3.8%, 2.5%, and 3.2%, respectively, for the first survey; 5.6%, 3.5%, and 4.6% for the second survey; and 8.1%, 4.9%, and 6.5% for the third survey. A decline in the BA prevalence in older subjects which could be seen in the first survey was absent in the second and third surveys. There were no regional differences in the third survey. The boys-to-girls ratio in the first, second, and third surveys was 1.5, 1.6, and 1.6, respectively. BA was more prevalent among subjects with a past history of respiratory disease in infancy and those with a family history of allergic disease. The prevalence of asthma symptoms and wheezing in the first, second, and third surveys was 7.1%, 9.8%, and 11.8%, respectively. A comparison of the prevalence of other allergic diseases between the second and third surveys revealed a decrease in atopic dermatitis and an increase in allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and cedar pollinosis. BA prevalence in the third survey increased 2.1 and 1.4 times respectively compared to the first survey and second survey, indicating an upward trend in all regions and age groups surveyed.",

In these cases, CRS tends to be associated with bronchial asthma (BA), especially, aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA). On the other hand, arachidonic acid metabolites have been extensively investigated in the pathogenesis of BA. We sought to assess the role of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the recalcitrant pathophysiology of CRS. Samples were prepared from the nasal polyps and mucosa of 40 patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) at our hospital. The nasal polyp specimens obtained from the patients with CRS were divided into three groups, as follows: the CRS-AIA group, consisting of specimens obtained from patients with CRS complicated by AIA, the CRS-ATA group, consisting of specimens obtained from patients with CRS associated with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), and the CRS-NA group, consisting of specimens obtained from CRS patients without BA. PGD2 and PGE2 were extracted from the specimens and quantified. The concentrations of PGD2 were significantly higher in the nasal polyps of the CRS-ATA group. The concentrations of PGE2 were lowest in the nasal polyps of the CRS-AIA group. The PGD2/PGE2 ratio was highest in the CRS-AIA group. It has previously been reported that CRS complicated by AIA is most likely to be characterized by repeated remissions and relapses, and is thus the most intractable. We may therefore say that the PGD2/PGE2 ratio reflects the intractable nature of CRS.",

Drug-induced angioedema has been reported to occur in response to a wide range of drugs and vaccines. Drug-induced angioedema, like other cutaneous drug reactions, has been reported to be most frequently elicited by beta-lactam antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, although reliable data from epidemiologic studies are scarce. Recent reports suggested an increasing role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in the causation of life- threatening angioedema. ACEI-related angioedema is never accompanied by urticaria and occurs via a kinin- dependent mechanism. ACEI-related angioedema not only can start years after beginning the treatment, but it can then recur irregularly while under that treatment. Furthermore, allergy tests are unreliable for the diagnosis of ACEI-related angioedema, and so the relationship between angioedema and ACEIs is often missed and consequently quite underestimated. Accordingly, better understanding of the kinin-dependent mechanism, which is particular to angioedema, is necessary for the appropriate management of drug-induced angioedema.",

Clinical illness consistent with IRS includes tuberculosis, herpes zoster, herpes simples, cytomegalovirus infections and sarcoidosis: thus, the manifestations of this syndrome and diverse and depend on the tissue burden of the preexisting infectious agents during the immunosuppressive state, the nature of the immune system being restored, and underlying diseases of the hosts. Although IRS has originally been reported to occur in the setting of HIV infection, it has become clear that the development of IRS can also be in HIV-negative hosts receiving immunosuppressive agents, such as prednisolone and tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors, upon their reduction and withdrawal. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, a life-threatening multiorgan system reaction, is another manifestation of the newly observed IRS. Clinical recognition of the IRS is especially important in improving the outcome for diseases with an otherwise life-threatening progenosis. Clinicians should be aware of the implications of IRS and recognize that relieving the symptoms and signs of immune recovery by anti-inflammatory therapies needs to be balanced with anti-microbial therapies aiming at reducing the amplitude and duration of tissue burden of preexisting microbes.",

We analyzed patients with SJS associated with M. pneumoniae infection to elucidate the differences between drug-induced SJS and M. pneumoniae-associated SJS and also to study differences between M. pneumoniae-associated SJS in children and adults. This is a retrospective review of Japanese patients who have been reported as M. pneumoniae-associated SJS in medical Journals published from 1981 to 2009, compared with data of Japanese patients with drug-induced SJS reported from 2000 to 2009. Thirty-eight cases of M. pneumoniae-associated SJS and 78 cases of drug-induced SJS were analyzed in this study. Ocular lesions were observed more frequently in M. pneumoniae-associated SJS than in drug-induced SJS (p < 0.01), and adult patients showed a higher ratio of sequelae in their eyes than did patients under 20 years of age (p < 0.01). Sixty-six percent of adult patients with M. pneumoniae-associated SJS developed fever/respiratory symptoms and mucocutaneous lesions on the same day. In contrast, most of the patients under 20 years of age developed fever/respiratory symptoms before mucocutaneous involvement. This means that these adult patients were infected and immunized previously and developed allergic reactions to M. pneumoniae soon after the later infection. In order to prevent ocular sequelae in adult patients when M. pneumoniae infection is suspected, more intensive treatment may be needed in adult patients than in younger patients.",

    "abstract": "Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are life-threatening adverse reactions, which could be induced by a variety of drugs. It was proposed that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted presentation of antigens (drugs or their metabolites) to T lymphocytes initiates the immune reactions of SJS/ TEN. However, the genetic susceptibility and the exact pathogenesis were not clear until the recent studies. We first identified that HLA-B*1502 is strongly associated with carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced SJS/TEN and HLA-B*5801 with allopurinol-SJS/TEN in Han Chinese. The same associations had been validated across different human populations. For the downstream danger signals, Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) and perforin/granzyme B had been advocated as cytotoxic mediators for keratinocyte death in SJS/TEN. However, expression levels of these cytotoxic proteins from the skin lesions were too low to explain the distinct and extensive epidermal necrosis. Our recent study identified that the granulysin, a cytotoxic protein released from cytotoxic T cells or natural killer (NK) cells, is a key mediator for disseminated keratinocyte death in SJS/TEN. This article aims to provide an overview of both of the genomic and immunologic perspectives of SJS/TEN. These studies give us a better understanding of the immune mechanisms, biomarkers for disease prevention and early diagnosis, as well as providing the therapeutic targets for the treatments of SJS/TEN.",

Keratinocytes persistently secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, amplifying Th2-type responses in AD. We have recently reported that periostin, an extracellular matrix protein induced by Th2 cytokines, plays a critical role in AD. In the present study, we have further investigated the characteristics of our allergen-induced AD model mice and the role of periostin in the pathogenesis of AD. The ears of C57BL/6 mice, BALB/c mice, and Rag-2−/− γc−/− mice (BALB/c background) were epicutaneously sensitized repeatedly with HDM. Mice were analyzed after the final sensitization. To examine the direct role of periostin, we reconstituted skin in vitro by coculture of keratinocytes with wild-type or periostin-deficient fibroblasts. Epicutaneous sensitization with HDM induced AD-like phenotypes and accumulation of periostin in dermis in C57BL/6 mice but not in Rag-2−/− γc−/− mice. In vitro organotypic coculture systems revealed that periostin promoted survival and proliferation of keratinocytes and directly induced production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).

Two genes responsible for EDA-ID have been identified: nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO) for X-linked EDA-ID (XL-EDA-ID) and IκBα for autosomal-dominant EDA-ID (AD-EDA-ID). Both genes are involved in NF-κB activation, such that mutations or related defects cause impaired NF-κB signaling. In particular, NEMO mutations are scattered across the entire NEMO gene in XL-EDA-ID patients, which explains the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and the difficulties associated with making a diagnosis. In this review, we focus on the pathophysiology of EDA-ID and different diagnostic strategies, which will be beneficial for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",

Ciclesonide is delivered and deposited in the peripheral region of the lung as a small particle corticosteroid. The aim of the study is to compare the effects of ciclesonide with fluticasone propionate on small airway function in asthma. : Thirty mild persistent asthma patients treated with 200 μg of fluticasone propionate were randomized to receive either ciclesonide 200 μg once daily or fluticasone propionate 100 μg twice daily for 8 weeks. Small airway function was assessed by impulse oscillometry (IOS) and percentage of eosinophil induced sputum. : We observed that ciclesonide significantly improved IOS measured resistance of small airways (R5-R20; p < 0.05), distal reactance (X5; p < 0.01), reactance area (AX; p < 0.01), and decreased late-phase sputum eosinophil level (p < 0.01) compared with fluticasone propionate. There were no significant changes in spirometry indices in either group during the study. : These findings suggest that ciclesonide improves small airway function and inflammation compared with fluticasone propionate in mild asthma. This study provides evidence that IOS and late-phase induced sputum allows detection of changes in the small airways that can not be detected by spirometry.",

    "abstract": "Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) is the only available curative treatment of allergic diseases. Recent evidence provided a plausible explanation to its multiple mechanisms inducing both rapid desensitization and long-term allergen-specific immune tolerance, and suppression of allergic inflammation in the affected tissues. During SIT, peripheral tolerance is induced by the generation of allergen-specific regulatory T cells, which suppress proliferative and cytokine responses against the allergen of interest. Regulatory T cells are characterized by IL-10 and TGF-beta secretion and expression of important cell surface suppressive molecules such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 and programmed death-1 that directly or indirectly influence effector cells of allergic inflammation, such as mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. Regulatory T cells and particularly IL-10 also have an influence on B cells, suppressing IgE production and inducing the production of blocking type IgG4 antibodies. In addition, development of allergen-specific B regulatory cells that produce IL-10 and develop into IgG4 producing plasma cells represent essential players in peripheral tolerance. These findings together with the new biotechnological approaches create a platform for development of the advanced vaccines. Moreover, reliable biomarkers could be selected and validated with the intention to select the patients who will benefit most from this immune-modifying treatment. Thus, allergen-SIT could provide a complete cure for a larger number of allergic patients and novel preventive approaches need to be elaborated.",

This disease usually begins in early infancy with a pernio-like rash, especially in winter. The patients develop periodic high fever and nodular erythema-like eruptions, and gradually progress lipomuscular atrophy in the upper body, mainly the face and the upper extremities, to show the characteristic thin facial appearance and long clubbed fingers with joint contractures. So far about 30 cases have been reported from Kansai, especially Wakayama and Osaka, Tohoku and Kanto areas. At present, about 10 cases are confirmed to be alive only in the Kansai area, including one infant case in Wakayama. However, more cases are expected to be added in the near future. Although cause of the disease has long been undefined, a homozygous mutation of the PSMB8 gene, which encodes the β35i subunit of immunoproteasome, has been identified to be responsible in 2011. By analyses of the patients-derived cells and tissues, it has been suggested that accumulation of ubiquitinated and oxidated proteins due to immunoproteasome dysfunction causes hyperactivation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and interleukin-6 overproduction. Since similar diseases with PSMB8 mutations have recently been reported from Europe and the United States, it is becoming clear that Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome and related disorders form proteasome disability syndromes, a new category of autoinflammatory diseases distributed globally.",

We have reported that surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors detect large changes of refractive index (RI) with living cells, such as mast cells, human basophils and lymphocytes. However conventional SPR sensors detect only an average change of RI with thousands of cells at detectable area on a sensor chip. Therefore, we developed an SPR imaging (SPRI) sensor with a CMOS camera and an objective lens in order to visualize RI of individual living cells and their changes upon stimuli. The SPRI sensor we developed could detect reactions of individual rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells and mouse keratinocyte cells in response to specific or nonspecific stimuli. Moreover, the sensor could detect the reactions of individual human basophils isolated from patients in response to antigens (allergens). Thus the technique can visualize the effect of various stimuli, inhibitors and/or conditions on cell reactions as change of intracellular RI distribution at single cell levels. Establishment of the technique to rapidly isolate cells from patient blood should enable us to utilize SPRI system as a high throughput screening system in clinical diagnosis, such as type I hypersensitivity and drug hypersensitivity, and as a tool to reveal novel phenomena in evanescent fields around plasma membranes.",

Allergic rhinitis includes pollinosis, which is intractable and reduces quality of life (QOL) when it becomes severe. A guideline is needed to understand allergic rhinitis and to use this knowledge to develop a treatment plan. In Japan, the first guideline was prepared after a symposium held by the Japanese Society of Allergology in 1993. The current 7th edition was published in 2013, and is widely used today. To incorporate evidence based medicine (EBM) introduced from abroad, the most recent collection of evidence/literature was supplemented to the Practical Guideline for the Management of Allergic Rhinitis in Japan 2013. The revised guideline includes assessment of diagnosis/treatment and prescriptions for children and pregnant women, for broad clinical applications. An evidence-based step-by-step strategy for treatment is also described. In addition, the QOL concept and cost benefit analyses are also addressed. Along with Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact of Asthma (ARIA), this guideline is widely used for various clinical purposes, such as measures for patients with sinusitis, childhood allergic rhinitis, oral allergy syndrome, and anaphylaxis and for pregnant women. A Q&A section regarding allergic rhinitis in Japan was added to the end of this guideline.",

Allergic conjunctival disease is defined as \"a conjunctival inflammatory disease associated with a Type I allergy accompanied by some subjective or objective symptoms.\" Allergic conjunctival disease is classified into allergic conjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and giant papillary conjunctivitis. Representative subjective symptoms include ocular itching, hyperemia, and lacrimation, whereas objective symptoms include conjunctival hyperemia, swelling, folliculosis, and papillae. Patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis, which is characterized by conjunctival proliferative changes called giant papilla accompanied by varying extents of corneal lesion, such as corneal erosion and shield ulcer, complain of foreign body sensation, ocular pain, and photophobia. In the diagnosis of allergic conjunctival diseases, it is required that type I allergic diathesis is present, along with subjective and objective symptoms accompanying allergic inflammation. The diagnosis is ensured by proving a type I allergic reaction in the conjunctiva. Given that the first-line drug for the treatment of allergic conjunctival disease is an antiallergic eye drop, a steroid eye drop will be selected in accordance with the severity. In the treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis, an immunosuppressive eye drop will be concomitantly used with the abovementioned drugs.",

Long-standing asthma induces airway remodeling to cause an intractable asthma.

The aim of asthma treatment is to enable patients with asthma to lead a healthy life without any symptoms. A partnership between physicians and patients is indispensable for appropriate treatment. Long-term management with agents and elimination of causes and risk factors are fundamental to asthma treatment. Four steps in pharmacotherapy differentiate mild to intensive treatments; each step includes an appropriate daily dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), varying from low to high doses. Long-acting β2 agonists (LABA), leukotriene receptor antagonists, and theophylline sustained-release preparation are recommended as concomitant drugs, while anti-IgE antibody therapy is a new choice for the most severe and persistent asthma. Inhaled β2 agonists, aminophylline, corticosteroids, adrenaline, oxygen therapy, etc., are used as needed against acute exacerbations. Allergic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), aspirin induced asthma, pregnancy, and cough variant asthma are also important factors that need to be considered.",

Methods: FEno was measured in 142 steroid-naive asthmatics and 224 control subjects using an online electrochemical nitric oxide analyzer in accordance with the current guidelines. Subjects without respiratory symptoms and normal spirometric parameters were included in the control group. Asthma was diagnosed on the basis of the presence of significant airway reversibility and/or airway hyperresponsiveness during clinical follow up 6 months after FEno measurements. FEno was significantly higher in asthmatic patients compared with control subjects (p < 0.01). Based on all study subjects, the receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that the cutoff value of FEno 22 parts per billion (ppb) was associated with the highest combination of sensitivity (90.8%) and specificity (83.9%). Multivariate analysis showed allergic rhinitis, current smoking, and asthma were significant factors influencing the FEno levels. The cutoff values of FEno to discriminate asthma from non-asthma ranged from 18 to 28 ppb depending on rhinitis and smoking status. The cutoff values presented may be useful for the interpretation of FEno values in the clinical practice.",

These are based on the disease concept that atopic dermatitis is a inflammatory cutaneous disease with eczema by atopic diathesis, multi-factorial in onset and aggravation, and accompanied by skin dysfunctions. These three points are equally important and should be appropriately combined in accordance with the symptoms of each patient. In treatment, it is important to transmit the etiological, pathological, physiological, or therapeutic information to the patient to build a favorable partnership with the patient or his/her family so that they may fully understand the treatment. This guideline discusses chiefly the basic therapy in relation to the treatment of this disease. The goal of treatment is to enable patients to lead an uninterrupted social life and to control their cutaneous symptoms so that their quality of life (QOL) may meet a satisfactory level. The basics of treatment discussed in this guideline are based on the \"Guidelines for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis 2008\" prepared by the Health and Labour Sciences Research and the \"Guidelines for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis 2009 (ADGL2009)\" prepared by the Atopic Dermatitis Guidelines Advisory Committee, Japanese Society of Allergology in principle.",

    "abstract": "Although it is currently recognized that bronchial asthma is not a single disease but a syndrome, we have not yet made use of our new understanding of this heterogeneity as we treat asthma patients. To increase the efficacy of anti-asthma drugs and to decrease costs, it is important to stratify asthma patients into subgroups and to develop therapeutic strategies for each subgroup. Periostin has recently emerged as a biomarker for bronchial asthma, unique in that it is useful not in diagnosis but in categorizing asthma patients. We first found that periostin is a novel component of subepithelial fibrosis in bronchial asthma downstream of IL-13 signals. Thereafter, it was shown that periostin can be a surrogate biomarker of type 2 immune responses, the basis of the notion that a detection system of serum periostin is potentially a companion diagnostic for type 2 antagonists. Furthermore, we have recently shown that serum periostin can predict resistance or hyporesponsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids, based on its contribution to tissue remodeling or fibrosis in bronchial asthma. Thus, serum periostin has two characteristics as a biomarker for bronchial asthma: it is both a surrogate biomarker of type 2 immune responses and a biomarker reflecting tissue remodeling or fibrosis. We can take advantage of these characteristics to develop stratified medicine in bronchial asthma.",

    "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is known as a common comorbidity of asthma and chronic cough. The impact of GERD symptoms on cough-specific quality of life (QoL) in patients with asthmatic cough is poorly understood. The aim of this study is to determine the association of GERD symptoms with cough-specific quality of life in patients with cough variant asthma (CVA) using the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ).A total of 172 consecutive patients (121 females) with mean cough duration of 45.1 months (range 2-480 months) completed the Japanese version of the LCQ. The Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of Gastroesophageal reflux was administered to assess symptoms of acid-reflux and dysmotility. A range of clinical variables that may determine cough-specific QoL (LCQ) were estimated.The mean LCQ scores was 12.9 (SD 3.5), consistent with severe impairment in QoL. Female gender, symptoms of gastroesophageal dysmotility, sensitization to allergens (house dust and Japanese cedar pollen) and the number of sensitized allergens were associated with lower LCQ scores (i.e. impaired cough-specific QoL) in univariate regression analysis. Acid-reflux symptoms, airway hyperresponsiveness, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and sensitization to molds were unrelated to the LCQ score. After adjustment for gender, symptoms of gastroesophageal dysmotility was the only significant determinant of impaired cough-specific QoL accounting for 23% of the variance.Cough-specific QoL is severely impaired in patients with CVA. Symptoms of gastroesophageal dysmotility are an independent predictor of cough-specific QoL of patients with CVA.",

    "abstract": "Alternatively activated macrophages (M2 macrophages) play key roles in the suppression of Th1 cell responses and the orchestration of tissue repair. However, recent studies have shown that M2 macrophages have potentials to produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, suggesting that M2 macrophages may exacerbate inflammation in some settings. In this regard, we have recently shown that large numbers of M2 macrophages accumulate in the sites of hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS), an animal model of allergic contact dermatitis, and that M2 macrophages exacerbate hapten-induced CHS by producing matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12). We have also shown that suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), a member of SOCS family proteins that are cytokine-inducible negative regulators of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways, is highly and preferentially expressed in M2 macrophages in hapten-induced CHS and that SOCS3 expressed in M2 macrophages is involved in the attenuation of CHS by suppressing MMP12 production. These findings underscore the importance of M2 macrophage-derived MMP12 in the development of CHS, and suggest that inhibition of M2 macrophages or MMP12 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of allergic contact dermatitis.",

    "abstract": "Given the importance of appropriate diagnosis and appropriate assessment of cutaneous symptoms in treatment of atopic dermatitis, the basics of treatment in this guideline are composed of (1) investigation and coun- termeasures of causes and exacerbating factors, (2) correction of skin dysfunctions (skin care), and (3) pharmacotherapy, as three mainstays. These are based on the disease concept that atopic dermatitis is a inflammatory cutaneous disease with eczema by atopic diathesis, multi-factorial in onset and aggravation, and accompanied by skin dysfunctions. These three points are equally important and should be appropriately combined in accordance with the symptoms of each patient. In treatment, it is important to transmit the etiological, pathological, physiological, or therapeutic information to the patient to build a favorable partnership with the patient or his/her family so that they may fully understand the treatment. This guideline discusses chiefly the basic therapy in relation to the treatment of this disease. The goal of treatment is to enable patients to lead an uninterrupted social life and to control their cutaneous symptoms so that their quality of life (QOL) may meet a satisfactory level. The basics of treatment discussed in this guideline are based on the \"Guidelines for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis 2008\" prepared by the Health and Labour Sciences Research and the \"Guidelines for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis 2012 (ADGL2012)\" prepared by the Atopic Dermatitis Guidelines Advisory Committee, Japanese Society of Allergology in principle. The guidelines for the treatment of atopic dermatitis are summarized in the \"Japanese Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Allergic Disease 2013\" together with those for other allergic diseases.",

We examined the changes in pre- and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FeNO in 140 patients with controlled asthma. We initially determined the FeNO cut-off point for identifying patients with a rapid decline in FEV1 (>40 mL/yr). Next, a total of 122 patients who maintained high or non-high FeNO were selected, and the associations between the FeNO trend and changes in FEV1 and bronchodilator response (BDR) were investigated.A FeNO level >40.3 ppb yielded 43% sensitivity and 86% specificity for identifying patients with a rapid decline in FEV1. Patients with persistently high FeNO had higher rates of decline in FEV1 (42.7 ± 37.5 mL/yr) than patients with non-high FeNO (16.7 ± 31.5 mL/yr) (p < 0.0005). The changes in BDR from baseline to the end of the study, in patients who had high or non-high levels of FeNO were -0.8% and 0.1%, respectively (p < 0.01). In a multivariate analysis adjusted by age, body mass index, asthma control, blood eosinophil numbers, and FEV1% of predicted, a FeNO level of ≥40 ppb was independently associated with an accelerated decline in FEV1 (p < 0.05).This study suggests that FeNO is potentially valuable tool for identifying individuals who are at risk of a progressive loss of lung function among patients with controlled asthma.",

The Diagnostic and Classification Criteria for Vasculitis study (DCVAS) is a global study to develop and improve the diagnostic criteria for systemic vasculitides. The epidemiology of systemic vasculitides differs widely among countries. For example, in the case of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and with positivity for MPO-ANCA are predominant in Asian countries, whereas patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and with positivity for PR3-ANCA are predominant in northern Europe and the United States. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurs more frequently in Asian patients compared with patients in Europe. The incidence and the prevalence of large-vessel vasculitis also differ significantly. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) occurs frequently in northern Europe, unlike Takayasu arteritis (TAK). The ethnic and regional differences in the incidence, prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with vasculitis should be recognized when we diagnose and treat patients with vasculitis using criteria, and should also be considered when interpreting the results from clinical studies.",

Patients who had at least one visit for urticaria in 2002 and 2003 were excluded and the study cohort consisted of 1,027,620 subjects with no history of urticaria. We analyzed cumulative incidences of urticaria, chronic urticaria, and chronic urticaria remission using the life table estimation method from 2004 to 2013. Their association with related factors was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards analysis. From 2004 to 2013, a total of 49,129 patients with new-onset urticaria were identified. The 10-year cumulative incidence rate of urticaria for the general population was 4.9% and that of chronic urticaria among patients with new-onset urticaria was 7.8%. Remission rates of chronic urticaria were 52.6% at 1 year and 88.9% at 5 years. Age, sex, residential area, and autoimmune thyroid disease were significantly associated with urticaria or chronic urticaria, but not with chronic urticaria remission, after adjusting for covariates. Female individuals were more likely to have new-onset urticaria but less likely to develop chronic urticaria compared with male individuals. During the 10-year follow-up period, only a small proportion of patients with new-onset urticaria developed chronic urticaria. Remission was achieved in the majority of patients with chronic urticaria regardless of demographic characteristics or accompanying thyroid disease.",

Some GRPs in fruits and pollens have been identified as allergens including peach Pru p 7, Japanese apricot Pru m 7, orange Cit s 7, pomegranate Pun g 7, and cypress pollen GRP. The clinical features of fruit-derived GRP allergies frequently include systemic reactions, multiple fruit allergies regardless of plant kingdom classifications and, less frequently, cofactor-dependence. Multiple fruit allergies might be related to cross-reactivity between GRPs. Clinical cross-reactivity, at least between the four fruit-derived GRPs, has been proven. In addition, GRP allergy induces peculiar clinical symptoms, such as laryngeal tightness and facial swelling, especially eyelid edema, which was proposed to be a predictive factor for Pru p 7 allergy. Fruit-derived GRPs have an unusually high content of cysteine, resulting in high stability to heat and resistance to digestive enzymes. Therefore, GRPs are considered \"true\" food allergens that induce severe allergic reactions. As an alternative mechanism of fruit-derived GRP allergies, cross-reactivity between fruit GRP and cypress pollen GRP, which might play a role as a sensitizer, is suspected. Taken together, these characteristics indicate GRPs are clinically relevant plant allergens. This review article summarizes our current knowledge of the clinical features and important aspects of GRP sensitization and allergy.",

However, the effects of long-term treatment with omalizumab in this population haven't been well investigated. The objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of omalizumab in children with uncontrolled severe asthma. Thirty-eight Japanese children (aged 7–16 years) who completed the 24-week treatment core study were included in an uncontrolled extension study, in which treatment with omalizumab continued until the pediatric indication was approved in Japan (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01328886). Thirty-five patients (92.1%) completed the extension study. The median exposure throughout the core and extension studies was 116.6 weeks (range, 46.9–151.1 weeks). The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, and asthma. Serious adverse events developed in 10 patients (26.3%), but resolved completely with additional treatments. Incidence of adverse events didn't increase with extended exposure with omalizumab. Twenty-nine patients (76.3%) achieved completely- or well-controlled asthma compared with 9 patients (23.7%) at the start of the extension study. QOL scores, the rates (per year) of hospitalizations and ER visits were significantly improved compared with the baseline of the core study [39.0 vs 48.0 (median), p < 0.001 for QOL, 1.33 vs 0.16, p < 0.001 for hospitalization, 0.68 vs 0.15, p = 0.002 for ER visits]. Remarkably, the mean total IgE level showed a decreasing trend while exposure to omalizumab remained at steady-state. Long-term treatment with omalizumab is well-tolerated and effective in children with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma. No new safety findings were identified.",

During the last decade, component resolved diagnostics has been introduced into the field of clinical allergology, providing information that cannot be obtained from extract-based tests. Component resolved data facilitate more precise diagnosis of allergic diseases and identify sensitizations attributable to cross-reactivity. Furthermore it assists risk assessment in clinical practice as sensitization to some allergenic molecules is related to persistence of clinical symptoms and systemic rather than local reactions. The information may also aid the clinician in prescription of oral immunotherapy (OIT) in patients with severe symptoms, and in giving advice on food allergen avoidance or on the need to perform food challenges. The use of allergen components is rapidly evolving and increases our possibility to treat food allergic patients with a more individual approach. Using molecular allergology, we can already now better diagnose, prognose and grade the food allergy. In summary, daily routine molecular allergy diagnostics offers a number of benefits that give us a higher diagnostic precision and allow for better management of the patient.",

Various ingredients contained in sweat are involved in a broad sense in skin homeostasis including temperature regulation, skin moisture, and immune functions. Thus, sweat plays a major role in maintaining skin homeostasis. Therefore, abnormal sweating easily compromises human health. For example, in atopic dermatitis (AD), perspiration stagnation accompanying sweat tube or sweat pore blockage, leakage of perspiration from the sweat gland to the outside tissue, and impaired secretion of sweat from the sweat gland are confirmed. In recent years, the hypothesis that atopic dermatitis is a sweat stasis syndrome has been clarified by the establishment of a sweat and sweat gland dynamic analysis technique. Secretion of sweat and leakage into tissues is caused by dermatitis and is thought to promote itching. Furthermore, from the metabolomic analysis of sweat of patients with atopic dermatitis, it was confirmed that the glucose concentration in AD sweat increased according to severity and skin phenotype, suggesting that elevated glucose affected the homeostasis of the skin. Multifaceted analyses of sweat from subjects with AD have revealed new aspects of the pathology, and appropriate measures to treat sweat can be expected to contribute to long-term control of AD.",

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a heterogeneous collection of lymphocytes that lack antigen-specificity (non-T, non-B cells) and potently produce characteristic cytokines of T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17). ILCs are divided into group 1 (ILC1s), group 2 (ILC2s), or group 3 (ILC3s). Similar to Th2 cells, ILC2s produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, among others, and are present in increased numbers in samples from patients with many allergic disorders including asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Animal models have identified that ILC2s contribute to eosinophilic tissue infiltration, airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus production, as well as coordinate adaptive immune responses. Finally, recent studies support regulation of ILC2s by neuro-immune mechanisms as well as demonstrate a significant degree of plasticity between ILC subsets that may impact the immune responses in asthma and allergic airway diseases. Here, we review the current literature on ILC2s in human asthma and allergic airway diseases, as well as highlight some recent mechanistic insights into ILC2 function from in vitro studies and in vivo animal models.",

    "abstract": "Prompt diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) is an important clinical issue in preventing irreversible lung damage. Therefore, a good serological marker for the diagnosis of ABPM is desired in clinical practice. The measurement of IgE antibody to crude Aspergillus fumigatus allergen is considered the first step in screening asthmatic patients for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). However, presence of IgE to A. fumigatus does not always indicate genuine sensitization to A. fumigatus because of cross-reactivity between crude extracts from different fungal sources. The application of molecular-based allergy diagnosis can solve this problem. The specificity of testing can be greatly improved by measuring the IgE antibody to Asp f 1 and f 2, specific allergen components for genuine A. fumigatus allergy. The problem of cross-reactivity between crude fungal extracts is also true for the identification of genuine causal fungi in each ABPM patient. Some patients with ABPM induced by fungi other than Aspergillus may be consistent with ABPA diagnostic criteria because current criteria depend on IgE/IgG reactivity to crude extracts. Accurate identification of genuine causal fungi for ABPM is of clinical importance, considering that clinical presentation, anti-fungal treatment strategies and disease prognosis can be influenced by different causal fungi. The diagnosis of causal fungi can be robustly validated by the confirmation of genuine sensitization to fungi after measuring IgE to specific allergen components, as well as repeated microbiological isolation of the fungi from their airway.",

    "abstract": "Adult bronchial asthma (hereinafter, asthma) is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, reversible airway narrowing, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Long-standing asthma induces airway remodeling to cause intractable asthma. The number of patients with asthma has increased, and that of patients who die from asthma has decreased (1.5 per 100,000 patients in 2012). The aim of asthma treatment is to enable patients with asthma to lead a normal life without any symptoms. A good relationship between physicians and patients is indispensable for appropriate treatment. Long-term management with antiasthmatic agents and elimination of the causes and risk factors of asthma are fundamental to its treatment. Four steps in pharmacotherapy differentiate between mild and intensive treatments; each step includes an appropriate daily dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, varying from low to high. Long-acting 02-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and sustained-release theophylline are recommended as concomitant drugs, while anti-immunoglobulin E antibody therapy has been recently developed for the most severe and persistent asthma involving allergic reactions. Inhaled 02-agonists, aminophylline, corticosteroids, adrenaline, oxygen therapy, and others are used as needed in acute exacerbations by choosing treatment steps for asthma exacerbations depending on the severity of attacks. Allergic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aspirin-induced asthma, pregnancy, asthma in athletes, and coughvariant asthma are also important issues that need to be considered.",

AD is often described as \"the itch that rashes, rather than the rash that itches\". Several studies suggest that mechanisms of central modulation play an important role in the development and maintenance of chronic itch. Therefore, treating the neurosensory aspects of itch is an important part in the management of chronic itch. However, little attention has been paid to the role of the central nervous system in the processing of itch in AD. Targeting itch-related anatomical structures in the brain with non-invasive treatments such as psychological interventions and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) could have an antipruritic effect in AD. Therefore, in this review article, we discuss the current progress in brain imaging research of itch, as well as the efficacy of non-invasive interventions for itch relief in this patient group.",

Recently, the activation of the blood coagulation cascade has been suggested to be involved in CSU, but the trigger of the coagulation cascade remains unclear. In this article, we review recent understanding of the relationship between the pathogenesis of CSU and extrinsic coagulation reactions. In CSU, vascular endothelial cells and eosinophils may play a role as TF-expressing cells for activating the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Moreover, the expression of TF on endothelial cells is synergistically enhanced by the activation of Toll-like receptors and histamine H1 receptors. The activated coagulation factors may induce plasma extravasation followed by degranulation of skin mast cells and edema formation recognized as wheal in CSU. Molecules involved in this cascade could be a target for new and more effective treatments of urticaria.",

    "abstract": "This review discussed the contribution of eosinophilic upper airway inflammation includes allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) to the pathophysiology and course of asthma, the representative counterpart in the lower airway. The presence of concomitant AR can affect the severity of asthma in patients who have both diseases; however, it is still debatable whether the presence of asthma affects the severity of AR. Hypersensitivity, obstruction and/or inflammation in the lower airway can be detected in patients with AR without awareness or diagnosis of asthma, and AR is known as a risk factor for the new onset of wheeze and asthma both in children and adults. Allergen immunotherapy, pharmacotherapy and surgery for AR can contribute to asthma control; however, a clear preventive effect on the new onset of asthma has been demonstrated only for immunotherapy. Pathological similarities such as epithelial shedding are also seen between asthma and CRS, especially eosinophilic CRS. Abnormal sinus findings on computed tomography are seen in the majority of asthmatic patients, and asthmatic patients with CRS show a significant impairment in Quality of Life (QOL) and pulmonary function as compared to those without CRS. Conversely, lower airway inflammation and dysfunction are seen in non-asthmatic patients with CRS. Treatments for CRS that include pharmacotherapy such as anti-leukotrienes, surgery, and aspirin desensitization show a beneficial effect on concomitant asthma. Acting as a gatekeeper of the united airways, the control of inflammation in the nose is crucial for improvement of the QOL of patients with co-existing AR/CRS and asthma.",

    "abstract": "Obesity affects the pathogenesis of various chronic diseases, including asthma. Research on correlations between obesity/BMI and eosinophilic inflammation in asthma has yielded contradictory results, which could be partly ascribed to the absence of epidemiological data on the correlations. We aimed to elucidate the correlations between blood eosinophil count, its genetic backgrounds, and BMI in the general population. This community-based Nagahama study in Japan enrolled 9789 inhabitants. We conducted self-reporting questionnaires, lung function tests, and blood tests in the baseline and 5-year follow-up studies. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 4650 subjects at the baseline and in 4206 of these at the follow-up to determine single-nucleotide polymorphisms for elevated blood eosinophil counts. We assessed the correlations between BMI and eosinophil counts using a multifaceted approach, including the cluster analysis. Eosinophil counts positively correlated with BMI, observed upon the interchange of an explanatory variable, except for subjects with the highest quartile of eosinophils (≥200/μL), in whom BMI negatively correlated with eosinophil counts. GWAS and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) imputation identified rs4713354 variant (MDC1 on chromosome 6p21) for elevated eosinophil counts, independent of BMI and IgE. Rs4713354 was accumulated in a cluster characterized by elevated eosinophil counts (mean, 498 ± 178/μL) but normal BMI. Epidemiologically, there may be a positive association between blood eosinophil counts and BMI in general, but there was a negative correlation in the population with high eosinophil counts. Factors other than BMI, particularly genetic backgrounds, may contribute to elevated eosinophil counts in such populations.",

It makes recommendations for best practices in the management of childhood asthma, including management of acute exacerbations and non-pharmacological and pharmacological management. These guidelines will be of interest to non-specialist physicians involved in the care of children with asthma. In JPGL, JPGL2017 is the first evidence-based guidelines updated according to the GRADE system and Minds approach, and it addresses eight clinical questions about the treatment of childhood asthma. In children aged ≤5 years, infant and preschool asthma is diagnosed according to the response to short acting beta2 agonists or the effect of a therapeutic trial during 1 month with controller treatment and worsening after treatment cessation. Long-term management both promotes pharmacological therapy and measures against risk factors that induce exacerbation, better patient education and a partnership with trinity. In addition, long-term management should not be carried out without review but rather be based on a cycle of evaluation, adjustment and treatment. In JPGL2017, the transdermal patch and oral beta2 agonists are positioned as drugs within the concept of \"short-term additional treatment\" to be used until the symptoms are stabilized when the control state transiently deteriorates.",

Recent studies have revealed that eosinophil extracellular trap cell death (EETosis) exacerbates eosinophilic inflammation by releasing the products, including Charcot-Leyden crystals (CLCs). In type 2 inflammatory diseases, memory-type pathogenic helper T (Tpath) cells are involved in shaping the pathogenesis of eosinophilic inflammation by recruiting and activating eosinophils in vivo. We herein review the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of eosinophils and the various functions of granules, including CLCs, during eosinophilic inflammation.

According to recent estimates of the percentage of patients with atopic dermatitis in Japan by age, the majority of patients are between 20 and 44 years old. Because the peak age of onset of atopic dermatitis is during infancy, many patients may experience prolonged symptoms from infancy to adulthood. A prolonged clinical course also increases the burden of atopic dermatitis on affected patients. Decreased productivity due to work disruptions, reduced daily activity, higher direct medical costs, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness due to sleep disturbances are typical burdens on patients with atopic dermatitis. In order to reduce these burdens, it is necessary to shorten its clinical course and achieve long-term control without relying on medications, possibly by using avoidance or coping measures of aggravating factors. Typical aggravating factors of atopic dermatitis include irritant dermatitis, food allergy in children, sweating, and psychological stress in adults. Food allergy places a heavy burden on the quality of life of affected patients and their families. The effectiveness of educational interventions for sweating and psychological stress is unclear. We must also evaluate the economic burden and cost-effectiveness of interventions on the patient as aggravating factors to be addressed.",

Japanese cedar pollinosis and Japanese cypress pollinosis, which are caused by pollen from Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) and Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa), respectively, are the most prevalent seasonal allergic diseases in Japan. Recently, the novel major Japanese cypress allergen Cha o 3 and the homologous Japanese cedar allergen Cry j cellulase were identified, and it was shown, for the first time, that cellulase in plants is allergenic. Although the allergenic components of pollen from both species exhibit high amino acid sequence identity, their pollinosis responded differently to allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) using a standardized extract of Japanese cedar pollen. Pharmacotherapy and ASIT for Japanese cedar and cypress pollinosis have advanced considerably in recent years. In particular, Japanese cedar ASIT has entered a new phase, primarily in response to the generation of updated efficacy data and the development of new formulations. In this review, we focus on both Japanese cypress and cedar pollinosis, and discuss the latest findings, newly identified causative allergens, and new treatments. To manage pollinosis symptoms during spring effectively, ASIT for both Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress pollen is considered necessary.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing COhort for Childhood Origin of Asthma and allergic diseases (COCOA) study is a prospective birth cohort investigating the origin and natural courses of childhood allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, food allergy, allergic rhinitis and asthma, with long-term prognosis. Initiated under the premise that allergic diseases result from a complex interplay of immune development alterations, environmental exposures, and host susceptibility, the COCOA study explores these dynamic interactions during prenatal and postnatal periods, framed within the hygiene and microbial hypotheses alongside the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. The scope of the COCOA study extends to genetic predispositions, indoor and outdoor environmental variables affecting mothers and their offsprings such as outdoor and indoor air pollution, psychological factors, diets, and the microbiomes of skin, gut, and airway. We have embarked on in-depth investigations of diverse risk factors and the pathophysiological underpinnings of allergic diseases. By employing multi-omics approaches-proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics-we gain deeper insights into the distinct pathophysiological processes across various endotypes of childhood allergic diseases, incorporating the exposome using extensive resources within the COCOA study. Integration with large-scale datasets, such as national health insurance records, enhances robustness and mitigates potential limitations inherent to birth cohort studies. As part of global networks focused on childhood allergic diseases, the COCOA study fosters collaborative research across multiple cohorts. The findings from the COCOA study are instrumental in informing precision medicine strategies for childhood allergic diseases, underpinning the establishment of disease trajectories.",

    "abstract": "The activation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) is controlled by various tissue-derived factors, including cytokines, whereas T cells respond to foreign antigens. This review discusses the tissue-specific properties of ILC2s in skin and their involvement in human skin diseases. In a steady state, cutaneous ILC2s contribute to tissue homeostasis. In the keratinocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is overexpressed. ILC2s are stimulated by IL-33-stimulated basophils through IL-4 to produce type 2 cytokines, such as IL-5 and IL-13. According to several studies, ILC2 expression is upregulated in human AD skin lesions, and it is involved in AD pathogenesis. Dupilumab, an antibody against IL-4 receptor α, lowered the number and percentage of ILC2s in the peripheral blood of patients with AD. Cutaneous ILC2s are divided into two subgroups: circulating and skin-resident ILC2s. However, ILC2s are homogeneous cell populations that are highly diverse and plastic, and there is no consensus on the classification that should be used. The variations in the definition for cutaneous ILC2s in different studies make comparisons among studies difficult, and in particular, the weak expression of the IL-33 receptor ST2 in cutaneous ILC2s and its lack of markers have posed a great challenge to researchers. Therefore, further comprehensive analytical studies are warranted.",

The present review addresses the characteristics of asthma with obesity, focusing especially on the heterogeneity caused by the degree of type 2 inflammation, sex differences, the onset of asthma, and race differences. To understand the severity mechanisms in asthma and obesity, such as corticosteroid resistance, fatty acids, gut microbiome, and cytokines, several basic research studies are evaluated. Finally, possible future therapies, including weight reduction, microbiome-targeted therapies, and other molecular targeted therapies are addressed.

We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of how CMs/Mφ induce the activation of neutrophils/innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in SA. Serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2) were measured from 39 patients with SA and 98 those with nonsevere asthma (NSA). CMs/Mφ were isolated from patients with SA (n = 19) and those with NSA (n = 18) and treated with LPS/interferon-gamma. Monocyte/M1Mφ extracellular traps (MoETs/M1ETs) were evaluated by western blotting, immunofluorescence, and PicoGreen assay. The effects of MoETs/M1ETs on neutrophils, airway epithelial cells (AECs), ILC1, and ILC3 were assessed in vitro and in vivo. The SA group had significantly higher CM counts with increased migration as well as higher levels of serum MCP-1/sST2 than the NSA group. Moreover, the SA group had significantly greater production of MoETs/M1ETs (from CMs/M1Mφ) than the NSA group. The levels of MoETs/M1ETs were positively correlated with blood neutrophils and serum levels of MCP-1/sST2, but negatively correlated with FEV1%. In vitro/in vivo studies demonstrated that MoETs/M1ETs could activate AECs, neutrophils, ILC1, and ILC3 by increased migration as well as proinflammatory cytokine production. CM/Mφ-derived MoETs/M1ETs could contribute to asthma severity by enhancing neutrophilic airway inflammation in SA, where modulating CMs/Mφ may be a potential therapeutic option.",

The primary study is a national administrative cohort study involving 499,428 children born in 2002, tracked until 2017. Atopic dermatitis was defined as five or more principal diagnoses of atopic dermatitis and two or more topical steroid prescriptions. We estimated the risks for the occurrence of 41 autoimmune diseases, controlling for risk factors. In addition, we sourced a gene library from the National Library of Medicine to conduct a comprehensive gene ontology. We used Gene Weaver to identify gene set similarity and clustering, and used GeneMania to generate a network for shared genes. Exposed and unexposed groups included 39,832 and 159,328 children, respectively. During a mean follow-up of 12 years, the exposed group had an increased risk of autoimmune disease (hazard ratio, 1.27 [95 % confidence interval, 1.23–1.32]) compared to the unexposed group. The hazard ratios of autoimmune illnesses consistently increased with two- and five years lag times and alternative atopic dermatitis definitions. Shared genes between atopic dermatitis and autoimmune diseases were associated with comorbidities such as asthma, bronchiolitis, and specific infections. Genetic interactions of these shared genes revealed clustering in Th1, Th2, Th17, and non-classifiable pathways. Atopic dermatitis was significantly associated with an increased risk of subsequent autoimmune disease. we identified the genetically associated disease in atopic dermatitis patients comorbid with autoimmune disease and demonstrated a genetic network between atopic dermatitis and autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic inflammation is primarily characterized by type 2 immune responses against parasitic organisms. In the contemporary human being especially in developed countries, eosinophilic inflammation is strongly associated with allergic/sterile inflammation, and constitutes an undesired immune reaction. This situation is in stark contrast to neutrophilic inflammation, which is indispensable for the host defense against bacterial infections. Among eosinophilic inflammatory disorders, massive accumulation of eosinophils within mucus is observed in certain cases, and is often linked to the distinctive clinical finding of mucus with high viscosity. Eosinophilic mucus is found in a variety of diseases, including chronic allergic keratoconjunctivitis, chronic rhinosinusitis encompassing allergic fungal sinusitis, eosinophilic otitis media, eosinophilic sialodochitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis, eosinophilic plastic bronchitis, and eosinophilic asthma. In these pathological conditions, chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling coupled with irreversible organ damage due to persistent adhesion of toxic substances and luminal obstruction may impose a significant burden on the body. Eosinophils aggregate in the hyperconcentrated mucus together with cell-derived crystals, macromolecules, and polymers, thereby affecting the biophysical properties of the mucus. This review focuses on the clinically significant challenges of mucus and discusses the consequences of activated eosinophils on the mucosal surface that impact mucus and persistent inflammation.",

Immune cells are continuously exposed to a wide range of microbes and microbial-derived compounds, with important mucosal and systemic ramifications. Microbial fermentation of dietary components in vivo generates thousands of molecules, some of which are integral components of the molecular circuitry that regulates immune and metabolic functions. These in turn protect against aberrant inflammatory or hyper-reactive processes and promote effector immune responses that quickly eliminate pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. Potent tolerance mechanisms should ensure that these immune cells do not over-react to non-pathogenic factors (e.g. food proteins), while maintaining the ability to respond to infectious challenges in a robust, effective and well controlled manner. In this review we examine the factors and mechanisms that shape microbiota composition and interactions with the host immune system, their associations with immune mediated disorders and strategies for intervention.",

    "abstract": "Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare but serious mucocutaneous disorders primarily caused by medications. Despite their low incidence, both conditions remain associated with high mortality and significant long-term complications. Recent studies have advanced the understanding of their pathogenesis, including the roles of neutrophil extracellular traps and several cell death pathways. However, reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis are lacking, and no internationally standardized diagnostic criteria have been established. To address these gaps, new diagnostic frameworks have been proposed that incorporate conventional cutaneous and mucosal findings with mandatory histopathological confirmation. These are expected to enhance diagnostic precision and facilitate global comparability. The increasing incidence of SJS/TEN-like reactions associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecular targeted therapies further highlights the importance of accurate histopathological differentiation. Prognostic tools are essential for therapeutic planning. Although the Severity-of-Illness Score for Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SCORTEN) score remains widely used, newer systems offer improved risk stratification and practical utility in diverse clinical settings. However, the optimal use of immunomodulatory therapies remains uncertain owing to limited consensus and evidence. Corticosteroids continue to serve as first-line treatment, but more selective agents are gaining attention for their potential efficacy and reduced toxicity. This review summarizes recent progress in SJS/TEN diagnosis, severity assessment, and management. It discusses the utility and limitations of novel scoring systems and emerging therapies while highlighting persistent challenges, including high mortality, regional practice variation, and delayed standardization. International collaboration and high-quality evidence generation remain essential for improving patient outcomes.",

We previously reported that IL-13 induced goblet cell differentiation along with less ciliated cell differentiation in guinea pig tracheal epithelial cells in vitro. In this study, we asked whether elimination of IL-13 could reverse the established goblet cell metaplasia into ciliated epithelia. Primary epithelial cells from guinea pig tracheas were cultured at an air-liquid interface with the medium containing human recombinant IL-13 for 14 days, and continuously cultured with IL-13-eliminated medium, or cultured under the condition of neutralization of IL-13 with anti IL-13 antibody. 2 days after elimination of IL-13, the periodic acid-Schiff-positive area as well as MUC5AC protein level rapidly decreased. After 4 days, the number of goblet cells dramatically decreased, while that of ciliated cells inversely increased. The total number of epithelial cells did not change, and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine uptake decreased after IL-13 elimination. Transitional cells with cilia and secretory granules increased after IL-13 elimination. Similarly, the neutralization of IL-13 with anti-IL-13 antibody for 5 days reversed the goblet cell metaplasia into ciliated epithelia, and transitional cells also increased. Elimination of IL-13 reverses goblet cell metaplasia into ciliated epithelia in vitro, and transition of goblet cells to other phenotypes, especially ciliated cells, may be involved in this phenomenon. IL-13 inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy of established goblet cell metaplasia in asthma.",

They induce type 1 immediate immune response in airway or other organ, resulting in bronchial asthma and other allergic diseases. However, they also play a critical role in host defense against infection with helminthes. Upon linkage of FcepsilonRI with a complex of allergen and IgE, basophils and mast cells release a large amount of Th2 cytokines and chemical mediators. Therefore these responses are \"acquired allergic responses\" and induce allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma. However, basophils and mast cells derived from cultured bone marrow cells with IL-3 for 10 days express IL-18Ralpha chain and produce Th2 cytokines in response to the stimulation with IL-3 and IL-18 without FcepsilonRI cross-linkage. Furthermore, they produce Th2 cytokines upon stimulation with several TLR ligands, such as LPS. This finding may suggest the presence of allergen/IgE-independent allergic responses, which we would like to designate as \"innate allergic response\". However, in vivo treatment with IL-18 and IL-2 protects against gastrointestinal nematode infection by activating intestinal mucosal mast cells in STAT6-independent manner, suggesting the importance of innate allergic response against helminth infection. Here we discuss the functional role of IL-18-induced \"innate allergic response\" in disease and host defense.",

We analyzed the protease activities derived from allergenic pollen of Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, and Rocky mountain juniper, which belong to the Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae family, and white birch and short ragweed, using synthetic substrates and class-specific inhibitors. We found that the pollen of the three members of the Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae family contained serine protease activity, that the pollen of white birch and short ragweed contained not only serine protease activity but also cysteine protease activity, that all five types of pollen tested contained at least one other type of serine protease, whose sensitivity to a serine protease-specific inhibitor was relatively low, and that the content and releasability of the pollen-derived proteases differed according to the plant families. Clinically relevant allergenic pollens tested in the present study can release serine and/or cysteine endopeptidases. Information on the spectrum of the endopeptidase activities from these allergenic pollen grains will be useful for investigating their contribution to the pathogenesis of allergies.",

We have established that there is no eosinophilic inflammation or reticular basement membrane thickening in wheezing infants median age one year; but by age three years, both are present. This accords with cohort studies, showing that children who become persistent wheezers have a drop in lung function in the pre-school years. Thereafter, lung function tracks into middle age, so the preschool years represent window during which an intervention might have long term benefit. Supportive are measurements in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, implicating the neutrophil as the key inflammatory cell in early wheeze. Models of the pathophysiology of asthma include (1) that eosinophilic inflammation is the primary event, and leads to remodelling as a secondary event, which itself results in progressive airflow obstruction (the least likely model); (2) eosinophilic inflammation is the primary event, but remodelling is protective, preventing worsening AHR. It should be noted that these first two are not mutually exclusive; rbm thickening may be protective, but other components of remodeling, for example increased ASM, may have adverse effects; (3) eosinophilic inflammation and airway remodelling are parallel processes, driven by some underlying 'asthma factor'; and (4) the primary abnormality is not airway inflammation, but some form of disordered airway repair.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder with an increasing prevalence in industrialized countries. AD belongs to the group of allergic disorders that includes food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. A multifactorial background for AD has been suggested, with genetic as well as environmental factors influencing disease development. Recent breakthroughs in genetic methodology have greatly augmented our understanding of the contribution of genetics to susceptibility to AD. A candidate gene association study is a general approach to identify susceptibility genes. Fifty three candidate gene studies (50 genes) have identified 19 genes associated with AD risk in at least one study. Significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in chemokines (chymase 1–1903A > G), cytokines (interleukin13 Arg144Gln), cytokine receptors (interleukin 4 receptor 1727 G > A) and SPINK 1258 G > A have been replicated in more than one studies. These SNPs may be promising for identifying at-risk individuals. SNPs, even those not strongly associated with AD, should be considered potentially important because AD is a common disease. Even a small increase in risk can translate to a large number of AD cases. Consortia and international collaborative studies, which may maximize study efficacy and overcome the limitations of individual studies, are needed to help further illuminate the complex landscape of AD risk and genetic variations.",

Oral administration of Bifidobacterium longum BB536 has been shown to be effective in relieving JCPsis symptoms during the pollen season. Methods: This double- two-way crossover study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of BB536 on reducing symptoms in JCPsis patients exposed to Japanese cedar pollen (JCP) in an environmental exposure unit (EeU) outside of the normal JCP season. After a 1-week run-in period, subjects (n = 24) were randomly allocated to receive BB536 powder (approximately 5 x 1010) or placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, subjects were crossed over to another 4 weeks of intake. At the end of each intake period, subjects received controlled JCP exposure for 4 hours in the EEU. Symptoms were self-rated 30 minutes before and every 30 minutes during the exposures. From the first day of exposure through the next 5 successive days, participants self-rated their delayed symptoms and medication uses. Blood samples were taken before the exposures. The mean JCP levels for exposures were 6500 to 7000 grains/m3 air. Results: In comparison with placebo, BB536 intake significantly reduced the ocular symptom scores during JCP exposures. Evaluating delayed symptoms after exposures indicated that scores for disruption of normal activities were significantly lower in the BB536 group compared with the placebo group. Prevalence of medication use was markedly reduced by BB536 intake. Conclusions: These results suggest the potential beneficial effect of BB536 in relieving symptoms of JCP allergy",

    "abstract": "Airway remodeling in asthma has been recognized as structural changes of airways such as smooth muscle hypertrophy (an increase in size of airway smooth muscle cells) and hyperplasia (an increase in the number of airway smooth muscle cells), thickening and fibrosis of sub-epithelial basement membrane, hypertrophy of bronchial glands, goblet cell hyperplasia, and thickening of airway epithelium. In these pathological changes, airway smooth muscle remodeling has been recognized as one of the most important factors related to in vitro and in vitro airway responsiveness and the severity of asthma. Both hypertrophy and hyperplasia have been shown in asthmatic airways by morphometrical analyses, although there is a wide variation in the contribution of each mechanism in each patient. Such changes could also be recognized as a phenotypic modulation of airway smooth muscle. On the background of airway smooth muscle remodeling, the existence of several contributing factors, such as inflammatory mediators, growth factors, cytokines, extra-cellular matrix proteins, and genetic factors have been suggested. On the other hand, recent studies revealed that airway smooth muscle could also be a source of inflammatory mediators promoting airway inflammation. In this article, the recent understanding in the mechanisms of airway smooth muscle remodeling in asthma, its relations to airway inflammation and airway physiology, and possible usefulness of early intervention with inhaled glucocorticoids have been discussed.",

The airway wall thickness increases because of subepithelial fibrosis, and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the airway smooth muscle cells and submucosal glands. Airway remodeling, therefore, can often cause irreversible airflow limitation and an increase of airway hyperresponsiveness. Recent studies have described the molecular and cellular mechanisms of collagen deposition in the airway wall such as subepithelial fibrosis. Fibroblasts or myofibroblasts play a critical role in the exaggerated deposition of collagen in asthmatic airways. Bone marrow derived fibroblasts may play a role in fibrotic remodeling in asthmatic airways. Airway remodeling is induced by cytokines and mediators produced in chronic allergic airway inflammation. Since, once formed, remodeling is resistant to asthma therapy, early intervention with inhaled corticosteroid should be considered to prevent the progress of airway remodeling.",

A total of 240 healthy adults aged between 18 to 74 years were recruited from four medical centers in Japan. Current smokers and subjects having a history of atopic disease were not included. FEno was measured using an online electrochemical nitric oxide analyzer according to the current guidelines. The reference ranges for FEno were estimated using two different statistical methods recommended by International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. The mean FEno was 16.9 ppb (parts per billion) with a 95% prediction interval (2.5 to 97.5 percentiles) of 6.5 to 35.0 ppb in healthy Japanese adults. Normality assumptions were met for the logarithm- transformed FEno. The geometric mean FEno was 15.4 ppb with a mean ± two standard deviations of 6.5 to 36.8 ppb. Age, gender, height, and past smoking history were not associated with the FEno levels. The reference ranges for FEno in healthy Japanese adults were similar to those of Caucasians. It seems reasonable that the upper limit of FEno for healthy adults should be set at approximately 36.0 ppb irrespective of ethnic differences.",

    "abstract": "The overall pathological view of paranasal sinus inflammation in the Japanese population has profoundly changed in recent years. Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) is a clinical entity of intractable chronic sinus inflammation accompanied by numerous infiltrations of activated eosinophils in the paranasal sinus mu- cosa and/or nasal polyps. Several pathologic processes are considered to act in concert to promote the accumulation of eosinophils in ECRS. They include infiltration of progenitor cells, increase in local IL-3, IL-5, IL-13, GM-CSF and eotaxin production, and upregulation of adhesion molecules. The role of nasal allergen sensitization and innate immunity responses in the sinus mucosa has also been proposed in the development of ECRS. Various pathogens including TLRs ligands may trigger an abnormal immune response at the mucosal surface. The objectives of ECRS management should focus directly on inhibition of local eosinophil infiltration. Surgical procedures include widely opening the bony wall septum of every affected sinus and mechanical removal of diseased mucosal lesion. The use of local and/or systemic steroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and Th2 cytokine antagonists is recommended. Local administration of steroids is a potent treatment strategy for preventing relapse of nasal polyposis and is considered to be the first-line treatment for ECRS patients.",

The objective of this study was to determine how pruritic skin diseases impact patient productivity and quality of life (QOL), in order to improve the measurement of these endpoints to allow the influence of treatment options including sedative and non- sedative antihistamines to be analyzed. The impact of pruritic skin diseases and the effect of antihistamine therapy on work, classroom, and daily productivity were evaluated using the Work Productivity Assessment Index-Allergy Specific Questionnaire. The intensity of itch and patient QOL were assessed using a visual analogue scale and Skindex-16, respectively. Pruritic skin diseases resulted in significant impairment of work, classroom, and daily productivity. The severity of overall work impairment in atopic dermatitis (AD), urticaria, and prurigo was higher than for other diseases analyzed. However, classroom activity was more adversely affected in patients with urticaria relative to other diseases. All pruritic diseases in this study negatively impacted daily activity to a similar degree. Impaired productivity was significantly improved in patients taking non-sedative antihistamines for 1 month, and the improvements correlated with the alleviation of itch and improved QOL. These results indicate that pruritic skin diseases reduce patient productivity at work, in the classroom, and during daily activities, and that non-sedative antihistamines may offer an advantage over sedative antihistamines for alleviating certain negative consequences of these skin diseases.",

The prevalences of bronchial asthma (BA), atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR), and allergic conjunctivitis (AC) in 1996 and 2006 were 5.1% and 5.0% (p = 0.58), 4.2% and 5.6% (p < 0.0001), 20.3% and 27.4% (p < 0.0001), and 13.3% and 25.2% (p < 0.0001), respectively. Although the distribution of BA severity improved, the severity distribution of AD, AR, and AC all deteriorated. The lifetime prevalence (present prevalence and past history combined) of BA increased from 6.5% to 7.6% (p < 0.0001). The sex ratio analysis showed that the female predominance in the prevalence of AD observed in 1996 disappeared in 2006, indicating a particular rise in AD prevalence among boys.

    "abstract": "Challenge testing with wheat plus exercise and/or aspirin is a gold standard for the diagnosis of wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA); however, the test may often yield false-negative results. Our previous study suggested that an increase in serum wheat gliadin levels is required to induce allergic symptoms in patients with WDEIA. Based on this knowledge, we sought to extract the patients with false negative results in the challenge tests of WDEIA.Thirty-six patients with suspected WDEIA were enrolled. First, group categorizations-Group I, challenge tests were positive; Group II, challenge tests were negative and serum gliadin were undetectable; Group III, challenge tests were negative and serum gliadin were detectable-were given according to the results of wheat plus exercise and/or aspirin challenge testing and serum gliadin levels. Second, diagnoses were made using retests and/or dietary management in Group II and III.Positive results for wheat plus exercise and/or aspirin challenge tests gave a diagnosis of definite WDEIA in 17 of 36 patients (Group I). Of the remaining 19 challenge negative patients, serum gliadin was undetectable in ten patients (Group II). Of the ten patients (Group II), three of them were diagnosed as definite WDEIA by retesting and six of them were diagnosed as probable WDEIA using a wheat elimination diet, whereas one patient was non-WDEIA. In the rest of the nine challenge negative patients, serum gliadin was detectable (Group III). No allergic episodes with a normal diet provided a diagnosis of non-WDEIA in seven of the nine patients, whereas the remaining two patients were probable WDEIA or had another food allergy because of repeated episodes.Our study revealed that serum gliadin monitoring during challenge testing is useful.",

    "abstract": "Tree nut allergy is characterized by a high frequency of life-threatening reactions and is typically lifelong persistent. Some people with a pistachio nut allergy, which is common in the pistachio rich area of Iran, develop a hypersensitivity to other tree nuts as well. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of pistachio nut allergy in Iran, the major pistachio cultivation region in the world. The study also addressed the presence of allergenic cross-reactivity between pistachio and other nuts, including almond, peanut, and cashew in pistachio allergic patients. A survey was conducted to determine whether the prevalence of pistachio allergy is affected by exposure to this nut in pistachio cultivation regions, as well as possible cross-reactivity between pistachio and other nuts including cashew, almond, and peanut. Inhibition Western blot and inhibition ELISA studies were conducted to assess the presence of allergenic cross-reactivity between pistachio and the other tree nuts. Our results revealed that the prevalence of pistachio allergy is twice as much in pistachio cultivation regions than other areas. Western blotting and inhibition ELISA presented high percentages of inhibition with pistachio and cashew, followed by almond and, to some degree, peanut which indicates different levels of aller- genic cross-reactivity. The results indicate that exposure of people to pistachio significantly affects the prevalence of its allergic reactions. In addition, it was observed that, among pistachio allergic subjects, such exposure may affect the co-sensitivities with other nuts, including cashew and almond. The plant taxonomic classification of pistachio and other tree nuts does appear to predict allergenic cross-reactivity.",

    "abstract": "The character or timing of chronic cough is considered to be unpredictable for diagnosing its cause. However, the associations of cough triggers with cough pathophysiology remains unknown.We developed a closed questionnaire listing 18 triggers that were reported by ≥1% of 213 patients in a retrospective survey. Using this questionnaire, patients with cough-predominant or cough-variant asthma (n = 140) and those with non-asthmatic cough (54) were asked whether their cough was induced by the listed triggers. Associations of triggers with causes of cough, airway sensitivity to inhaled methacholine, exhaled nitric oxide (NO) levels, number of sensitizing allergens, and scores from gastroesophageal reflux (GER) questionnaires were examined. Factor analysis was used to categorize variables, including the 12 most common cough triggers, diagnosis of asthmatic cough, airway sensitivity, and exhaled NO levels.\"Cold air\" and \"fatigue/stress\" induced cough more often in asthmatic coughers than in non-asthmatic coughers. \"Spices\" and \"meals\" induced cough more frequently in GER-coughers (n = 19). Patients who marked \"cold air\" as the trigger were more sensitive to inhaled methacholine and showed higher exhaled NO levels than those who did not mark this trigger. The \"post-nasal drip\" trigger was associated with elevated exhaled NO levels, and this association was mainly exhibited by patients with cough-predominant asthma. The triggers \"pollen\" and \"mold smell\" were associated with a number of sensitizing allergens. The number of triggers was weakly associated with GER scores. By factor analysis, \"cold air,\" \"fatigue/stress,\" asthmatic cough, airway hypersensitivity, and elevated NO levels were categorized into the same factor.Several cough triggers may reflect the pathophysiology of prolonged or chronic cough.",

The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The subjects with JCP were randomly assigned to drink 700 ml of 'Benifuuki' green tea containing O-methylated EGCG or 'Yabukita' green tea (not containing O-methylated EGCG) as a placebo every day from December 2007 through March 2008, which includes the pollen season. The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of symptom scores during the peak pollen season. Fifty-one adults with JCP participated in the study. Twenty-six subjects were assigned to 'Benifuuki' and 25 to 'Yabukita'. The AUC of symptom score during the peak pollen season in the 'Benifuuki' group was significantly smaller than in the 'Yabukita' group for each of runny nose, itchy eyes, tearing, total nasal symptom score, total ocular symptom score, nasal symptom-medication score and ocular symptom-medication score. The total QOL-related questionnaire score for one week in the peak pollen season was significantly better in the 'Benifuuki' group. Increase in the peripheral eosinophil count in response to pollen exposure was suppressed in the 'Benifuuki' group. No adverse events were reported in either group. 'Benifuuki' green tea containing a large amount of O-methylated EGCG reduced the symptoms of JCP and has potential as a complementary/alternative medicine for treating seasonal allergic rhinitis.",

Since then, many studies have clarified the changes of lung sounds due to airway narrowing as well as the mechanism of genesis for these sounds. Studies using bronchoprovocation have shown that an increase of the frequency and/or intensity of lung sounds was a common finding of airway narrowing and correlated well with lung function. Bronchoprovocation studies have also disclosed that wheezing may not be as sensitive as changes in basic lung sounds in acute airway narrowing. A forced expiratory wheeze (FEW) may be an early sign of airway obstruction in patients with bronchial asthma. Studies of FEW showed that airway wall oscillation and vortex shedding in central airways are the most likely mechanisms of the generation of expiratory wheezes. Studies on the genesis of wheezes have disclosed that inspiratory and expiratory wheezes may have the same mechanism of generation as a flutter/flow limitation mechanism, either localized or generalized. In lung sound analysis, the narrower the airways are, the higher the frequency of breathing sounds is, and, if a patient has higher than normal breathing sounds, i.e., bronchial sounds, he or she may have airway narrowing or airway inflammation. It is sometimes difficult to detect subtle changes in lung sounds; therefore, we anticipate that automated analysis of lung sounds will be used to overcome these difficulties in the near future.",

However, despite its comparatively old history, the pathogenesis and classification remains to be clarified. CU patients are occasionally complicated by anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis. This reduced-sweat type should be included in the classification because the therapeutic approaches are different from the ordinary CU. It is also well-known that autologous sweat is involved in the occurrence of CU. More than half of CU patients may have sweat hypersensitivity. We attempt to classify CU and address the underlying mechanisms of CU based on the published data and our findings. The first step for classification of CU seems to discriminate the presence or absence of hypersensitivity to autologous sweat. The second step is proposed to determine whether the patients can sweat normally or not. With these data, the patients could be categorized into three subtypes: (1) Cu with sweat hypersensitivity; (2) CU with acquired anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis; (3) idiopathic CU. The pathogenesis of each subtype is also discussed in this review.",

We previously showed that periostin, a matricellular protein, plays a critical role in epidermal hyperplasia in AD, using a mouse model and a 3-dimensional organotypic coculture system. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that periostin is involved in epidermal hyperplasia in psoriasis. To examine expression of periostin in psoriasis patients, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on skin biopsies from six such patients. To investigate periostin's role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we evaluated periostin-deficient mice in a psoriasis mouse model induced by topical treatment with imiquimod (IMQ). Periostin was substantially expressed in the dermis of all investigated psoriasis patients. Epidermal hyperplasia induced by IMQ treatment was impaired in periostin-deficient mice, along with decreased skin swelling. However, upon treatment with IMQ, periostin deficiency did not alter infiltration of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils; production of IL-17, −22, or −23; or induction/expansion of IL-17– and IL-22–producing group 3 innate lymphoid cells. Periostin plays an important role during epidermal hyperplasia in IMQ-induced skin inflammation, independently of the IL-23–IL-17/IL-22 axis. Periostin appears to be a mediator for epidermal hyperplasia that is common to AD and psoriasis.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy including free IgE suppression and safety of omalizumab in Japanese children with severe allergic asthma. The primary objective was to examine whether omalizumab decreases serum free IgE levels to less than 25 ng/ml (target level of suppression).Thirty-eight Japanese children (6-15 years) with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma despite inhaled corticosteroids (>200 μg/day fluticasone propionate or equivalent) and two or more controller therapies received add-on treatment with omalizumab in a 24-week, multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label study.The geometric mean serum free IgE level at 24 weeks was 15.6 ng/mL. Compared with baseline, total asthma symptom scores, daily activity scores and nocturnal sleep scores at 24 weeks were significantly improved. The rates of asthma exacerbation and hospitalization due to asthma were reduced by 69.2% and 78.2%, respectively (p < 0.001), versus baseline. Quality-of-life scores were also significantly improved (p < 0.001). In addition, 11 (28.9%) patients reduced the dose of any asthma controller medications. Thirty-six (94.7%) patients experienced at least one adverse event during the treatment period. All adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and no new safety concerns were detected. No patients discontinued the study.In Japanese children with severe allergic asthma, omalizumab decreased free IgE levels to less than 25 ng/mL.

Studying inflammatory mediators in clearly defined disease subgroups may lead to a better differentiation of chronic sinus diseases. Homogenates of sinonasal mucosal tissue from 14 controls, 9 CRSsNP patients, and 19 CRSwNP patients were assayed for transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, interleukin (IL)-5, immunoglobulin E (IgE), Staphylococcus enterotoxin (SAE)-IgE, eosinophil-catioic protein (ECP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or UNICAp system. CRSwNP had significantly higher levels of IL-5, IgE, SAE-IgE, and ECP compared with CRSsNP and controls. CRSsNP was characterized by high levels of TGF-β, while CRSwNP showed a Th2 polarization and lower levels of TGF-β. Especially, in CRSwNP samples, 68.4% were eosinophilic (ECP/MPO ratio > 1), and 52.6% were SAE-IgE positive. On the other hand, in 9 CRSsNP patients, eosinophilic or SAE-IgE positive sample was only one sample respectively. Additionally, 31.6% of CRSwNP were asthmatic patients, while none of CRSsNP patient was suffering from bronchial asthma. This study is thought to be the first one that showed the cytokine profiles in Japanese CRSs/wNP similar to those of European CRS. Based on mediator profiles, we suggest that CRSsNP and CRSwNP are distinct disease entities within the group of chronic sinus diseases.",

    "abstract": "In September 2015, Japan experienced an unusual increase in acute asthma hospitalizations of children that coincided with an enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) epidemic. The objective of this study is to investigate whether EV-D68 had a causal relationship with the spike in asthma hospitalizations. A nation-wide retrospective survey of asthma hospitalizations of children was performed for the period from January 2010 through October 2015. The Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology asked its affiliated hospitals to report monthly numbers of hospitalizations, ICU admissions and mechanical ventilations due to acute asthma exacerbation. The data were retrieved from medical databases using predefined search criteria: diagnosis of asthma or asthmatic bronchitis, admission, and age <20 years. Monthly numbers of EV-D68 detection were also obtained from the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center of Japan. A Granger causality test was used to analyze the association of EV-D68 detections for asthma exacerbation. A total of 157 hospitals reported 87,189 asthma hospitalizations, including 477 ICU admissions and 1193 mechanical ventilations, during the survey period of 5 years and 10 months. The numbers of these events increased drastically in September 2015. The Granger causality test verified the association between EV-D68 and asthma hospitalizations/mechanical ventilations. The most-affected age group was 3–6 years old. The spike in pediatric asthma hospitalizations in Japan in September 2015 was found to be associated with the EV-D68 epidemic. Respiratory pathogens can cause \"epidemics\" of asthma exacerbation. Coordinated surveillance of infectious diseases and asthma may be beneficial for prevention and better control of both illnesses.",

Carmine is an aluminum- or calcium-chelated product of CA. CA and carmine usually contain contaminating proteins, including a 38-kDa protein thought to be the primary allergen. Severe allergic reactions manifest as anaphylaxis. The aim of this study was to review all Japanese reported cases and propose useful diagnostic chart.All reported Japanese cases of cochineal dye-induced immediate allergy were reviewed, and newly registered cases were examined by skin prick test (SPT) with cochineal extract (CE) and measurement of CE and carmine-specific serum IgE test. Two-dimensional (2D) western blotting using patient serum was conducted to identify the antigen.Twenty-two Japanese cases have been reported. SPT and the level of specific IgE test indicated that six cases should be newly registered as cochineal dye allergy. All cases were adult females, and all cases except three involved anaphylaxis; 13 cases involved past history of local symptoms associated with cosmetics use. Japanese strawberry juice and fish-meat sausage, and European processed foods (especially macarons made in France) and drinks were recent major sources of allergen. 2D western blotting showed that patient IgE reacted to the 38-kDa protein and other proteins. Serum from healthy controls also weakly reacted with these proteins.SPT with CE and determination of the level of CE and carmine-specific IgE test are useful methods for the diagnosis of cochineal dye allergy.",

A \"dual-allergen-exposure hypothesis\" has been proposed to explain those findings. However, several other recent studies have demonstrated that some allergic diseases can be successfully treated by recurrent epicutaneous exposure to allergens. At a glance, these two sets of findings seem to be contradictory, but we think they provide important clues for understanding the mechanisms behind the allergy march. Here, we propose that per-\"eczema\"tous sensitization drives the allergy march, and we introduce results from several published studies in support of this hypothesis.

    "abstract": "Inhaled corticosteroids enhance airway epithelial barrier integrity. However, the mechanism by which they accomplish this is unclear. Therefore, we investigated steroid-inducible genes and signaling pathways that were involved in enhancing airway epithelial barrier integrity. A human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE cells) was cultured with 10−6 M dexamethasone (DEX) for 3 days to enhance epithelial barrier integrity. After measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and paracellular permeability, we extracted total RNA from 16HBE cells and performed microarray and pathway analysis. After we identified candidate genes and a canonical pathway, we measured TER and immunostained for tight junction (TJ) and adherent junction (AJ) proteins in cells that had been transfected with specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for these genes. We identified a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated oxidative stress response pathway which was primarily involved in the steroid-induced enhancement of airway epithelial barrier integrity. Transfecting cells with Nrf2 specific siRNA reduced the steroid-induced enhancement of airway epithelial barrier integrity and the accumulation of TJ and AJ proteins at sites of cell–cell contact. Moreover, based on pathway analysis, aldehyde oxidase 1 (AOX1) was identified as a downstream enzyme of Nrf2. Transfecting cells with AOX1-specific siRNA also reduced the steroid-induced enhancement of airway epithelial barrier integrity. Our results indicated that the Nrf2/AOX1 pathway was important for enhancing airway epithelial barrier integrity. Because the airway epithelium of asthmatics is susceptible to reduced barrier integrity, this pathway might be a new therapeutic target for asthma.",

For example, IRF8 induces GATA2 expression to promote the generation of both basophils and mast cells.

In addition, C/EBPα and MITF mutually suppress each other's expression.

    "abstract": "Inhaled bronchodilator treatment with a long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) reduces symptoms and the risk of exacerbations in COPD and asthma. However, increasing evidence from cell culture and animal studies suggests that anti-muscarinic drugs could also possess anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies have revealed that acetylcholine (ACh) can be synthesized and released from both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, and the released ACh can potentiate airway inflammation and remodeling in airway diseases. However, these anti-inflammatory effects of anti-muscarinic drugs have not yet been confirmed in COPD and asthma patients. This review will focus on recent findings about the possible involvement of ACh in airway inflammation and remodeling, and the anti-inflammatory effect of anti-muscarinic drugs in airway diseases. Clarifying the acetylcholine-mediated inflammation could provide insights into the mechanisms of airway diseases, which could lead to future therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the disease progression and exacerbations.",

We wished to analyze the presenting symptoms in allergic rhinitis, as well as their relationship with quality of life (QoL) and therapeutic outcomes. Presenting symptoms and QoL were assessed using the OptumTM SF-12v2® Health Survey in 260 patients with allergic rhinitis. Clinical response at 3 months after treatment was measured. Ten most common symptoms presenting with at least moderate severity in allergic rhinitis were: blocked nose (82.7%), rhinorrhea (75.0%), sneeze (70.9%), itchy nose (68.5%), fatigue (63.6%), mouth breathing (61.1%), daytime somnolence (52.7%), postnasal drip (49.1%), itchy eyes (47.3%), and dry mouth (46.3%). Severity of sneeze was correlated with physical component summary (PCS) whereas postnasal drip and daytime somnolence were correlated with mental component summary (MCS). Severity of dry mouth was correlated with PCS and MCS. The symptoms with the highest severity scores after treatment were blocked nose, postnasal drip, fatigue, and dry mouth, respectively. Extranasal symptom scores correlated well with physical health and mental health in allergic rhinitis patients. Assessment of extranasal symptoms should be included to evaluate disease severity and assess therapeutic outcomes. Clinical trial NCT02000648, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.",

    "abstract": "Psychological stress is recognized as a key factor in the exacerbation of allergic asthma, whereby brain responses to stress act as immunomodulators for asthma. In particular, stress-induced enhanced type 2 T-helper (Th2)-type lung inflammation is strongly associated with asthma pathogenesis. Psychological stress leads to eosinophilic airway inflammation through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal pathway and autonomic nervous system. This is followed by the secretion of stress hormones into the blood, including glucocorticoids, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, which enhance Th2 and type 17 T-helper (Th17)-type asthma profiles in humans and rodents. Recent evidence has shown that a defect of the μ-opioid receptor in the brain along with a defect of the peripheral glucocorticoid receptor signaling completely disrupted stress-induced airway inflammation in mice. This suggests that the stress response facilitates events in the central nervous and endocrine systems, thus exacerbating asthma. In this review, we outline the recent findings on the interplay between stress and neuroendocrine activities followed by stress-induced enhanced Th2 and Th17 immune responses and attenuated regulatory T (Treg) cell responses that are closely linked with asthma exacerbation. We will place a special focus on our own data that has emphasized the continuity from central sensing of psychological stress to enhanced eosinophilic airway inflammation. The mechanism that modulates psychological stress-induced exacerbation of allergic asthma through neuroendocrine activities is thought to involve a series of consecutive pathological events from the brain to the lung, which implies there to be a \"neuropsychiatry phenotype\" in asthma.",

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of omalizumab in CSU refractory to conventional therapy, to identify possible factors affecting treatment response and relapse, and also to evaluate the efficacy of retreatment on relapsed disease.The data of CSU patients treated with 300 mg/month omalizumab for at least 3 months were retrospectively analyzed. In order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and retreatment, baseline and follow-up concomitant medication score (CMS) and urticaria activity score (UAS) were calculated. Possible factors affecting treatment response and relapse were identified.Twenty-five patients were included. The median duration of omalizumab therapy was 6 (6-12) months. Of the patients with baseline UAS 6 (5.5-6) and CMS 13 (10-15), 8 (32%) had complete response (UAS = 0) and 2 (8%) were non-responders after 3 months of therapy. None of the complete responders were positive for IgG-anti-TPO. After discontinuation of omalizumab therapy, 11 (61%) patients experienced relapse and 10 of them received retreatment with omalizumab. Half of the patients had complete response, and half had partial response (UAS = 1-4) after retreatment. No treatment related adverse events were documented.Omalizumab has high efficacy in both the treatment and retreatment of CSU; however, relapse rates after discontinuation are high.

Surrogate biomarkers, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and blood eosinophil count (b-EOS), may predict eosinophilic airway inflammation. Here we investigated clinical characteristics of severe asthma phenotype using a combined analysis of FeNO and b-EOS.This retrospective study examined clinical data of patients with severe asthma (N = 107; median age, 64 years) treated at Saitama Medical University Hospital from 2009 to 2016. Thresholds of FeNO and b-EOS for sputum eosinophil ratio ≥2% were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Clinical characteristics were analyzed after classifying patients into four subgroups according to these thresholds.Of 39 induced sputum samples examined, ROC area under the curve for predicting sputum eosinophilia was 82.0% (p = 0.001) for b-EOS and 77.0% (p = 0.006) for FeNO at optimal cut-off values of ≥300/μL and ≥25 ppb, respectively. The number of sensitized allergens was higher in the high FeNO/low b-EOS and high FeNO/high b-EOS subgroups (p < 0.05). The prevalence of chronic sinusitis was higher in the low FeNO/high b-EOS and high FeNO/high b-EOS subgroups (p = 0.04). The high FeNO/high b-EOS subgroup included the largest proportion (approximately 40%) of patients experiencing frequent severe exacerbations. Both low FeNO/low b-EOS and high FeNO/low b-EOS subgroups showed less severe exacerbations.Combined evaluation of FeNO and b-EOS can identify patients with frequent exacerbations and stratify the appropriate therapy for type 2 inflammation-predominant severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "In Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS), it is difficult to estimate the refractoriness and recurrence risk for each patient. Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is known as a biomarker of eosinophilic inflammation in lower airway. It has been reported that nasal NO has some crucial functions in the upper and lower airways. However, in upper airway, paranasal sinuses, the usefulness of NO measurement remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to identify the usefulness of nasal NO measurement in ECRS and the involvement of nasal NO in the pathogenesis of ECRS.We compared the nasal NO levels of ECRS, non-ECRS, and normal control groups. Correlation between nasal NO levels and clinical findings were observed. Then, we compared nasal NO levels before and after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). We also examine whether nasal NO levels might discriminate ECRS by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.Nasal NO levels were significantly decreased in ECRS compared to the other two groups. Moreover, nasal NO levels in ECRS significantly and negatively correlated with eosinophil levels and CT score. However, they did not correlate with the nasal polyp score. Nasal NO levels were not upregulated soon after opening the sinus ostium by ESS. The ROC curves for nasal NO levels were used to discriminate all CRS patients and ECRS patients from normal controls.Nasal NO may be useful as a marker of ECRS severity and low nasal NO levels in ECRS may contribute to its pathogenesis.",

Collagen was identified as a second allergen; however, its allergenic properties remain uncharacterized. Although fish is an important staple in coastal countries, its thermostability is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to determine the thermostability of fish collagen as an allergen.Meat of seven bony and four cartilaginous fishes was heated at various temperatures and times, and extracts were analyzed using SDS-PAGE, IgE-ELISA, and SPTs.Collagen was dissolved from heated meat of Pacific mackerel into a crude extract. Collagen in the extracts was degraded at a high heating load-140 °C (10 min) or 100 °C (320 min). However, ELISA revealed the IgE reactivities of patients' sera with the extracts were unchanged even after heating the samples. Patients strongly reacted to extract proteins of other bony fish, which were detected by patients' IgE even after heating at 100 °C (320 min). In contrast, reactivities of the extracts of cartilaginous fish were lower than those of bony fish. SPTs in one patient revealed that all bony and cartilaginous fish extracts prepared from heated meat elicited allergic reactions.The IgE reactivity of patients' sera to fish collagen in extracts was retained even when fish meat was treated by a high heating load. As for the fish collagen, the IgE reactivities to cartilaginous fish were lower than that to bony fish. Reducing IgE reactivity to fish meat using heat is difficult, and other modalities will be required to produce hypoallergenic fish meat.",

    "abstract": "The season of birth and ultraviolet B exposure have been related to the occurrence of food allergy. The levels of vitamin D produced from skin by ultraviolet B exposure might reflect this relationship. Vitamin D is known to induce antimicrobial peptides, protect intestinal flora, enhance the gut epithelial barrier, suppress mast cell activation and IgE synthesis from B cells, and increase the number of tolerogenic dendritic cells and IL-10-producing regulatory T cells. Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to exacerbate sensitization and allergic symptoms in a murine model of food allergy. However, in clinical situations, contradictory observations have been reported regarding the relationship between food allergy and vitamin D deficiency/supplementation. In this review, we have explored the links between food allergy and vitamin D levels. One explanation for the discrepant findings is confounding factors such as race, age, residency, skin color, and epigenetic changes that contribute to vitamin D levels. In addition, the season of birth influences the development of atopic dermatitis, which could lead to food sensitization. Finally, ultraviolet radiation could lead to regulatory T cell expansion and immunosuppression, irrespective of vitamin D status. Based on our current understanding, we believe that correction of vitamin D deficiency by supplementation, appropriate skin care, and sufficient ultraviolet radiation exposure could alter the prognosis of food allergy. To identify potential treatment strategies for food allergy, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the appropriate levels of vitamin D and ultraviolet radiation exposure.",

The result of OFC was judged positive if any gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, or bloody stool) were induced.Among 11 cytokines profiled, serum levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-5, and IL-8 were clearly increased in all 4 positive OFCs in which elevations of the serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and peripheral blood neutrophilia were also seen. The level of serum IL-10 also rose in 2 positive OFCs. Remarkable increases in the serum level of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-6, and IL-12 were observed in a positive OFC where the serum level of CRP rose markedly (6.75 mg/dL). The serum levels of IL-5 were also elevated in 2 negative OFCs. No apparent specific correlations were found between cytokines and GI symptoms.These results suggest that IL-2 and IL-8 are involved in the antigen-specific immune responses in most patients with FPIES. Further studies are needed to elucidate the significance of these cytokine in the pathogenesis of FPIES.",

GERD symptoms and cough-specific QoL were evaluated through the Frequency Scale for Symptoms of Gastroesophageal reflux (FSSG) and the Japanese version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (J-LCQ). According to the FSSG domains, patients with GERD were arbitrarily categorized into 3 groups; acid-reflux predominant, dysmotility predominant, and pauci-symptoms groups, respectively.The average scores of J-LCQ was 12.5 (SD3.7). One hundred-forty three were diagnosed as having GERD-related cough based on classical reflux symptoms including heartburn and characteristic triggers of cough such as phonation, rinsing, lying, and eating. Most of them (89.8%) had other causative diseases including CVA. Cough lasted longer (p = 0.019) and required a longer time until alleviation (p = 0.003) in patients with GERD than in those without GERD. They also scored lower J-LCQ than counterpart group (p < 0.0001). In terms of symptom stratification, dysmotility predominant group showed significant more response to specific GERD treatments than the remnants (p = 0.002).These results indicate that GERD is associated with the aggravation of other causes including CVA. Particularly, dysmotility symptoms may be potential therapeutic target for GERD-related cough.",

    "abstract": "Zinc is an essential micronutrient in human body and a vital cofactor for the function of numerous proteins encoded by the human genome. Zinc has a critical role in maintaining many biochemical and physiological processes at the molecular, cellular, and multiple organ and systemic levels. The alteration of zinc homeostasis causes dysfunction of many organs and systems. In the immune system, zinc regulates the differentiation, proliferation and function of inflammatory cells, including T cells, eosinophils, and B cells, by modifying several signaling pathways such as NFκB signaling pathways and TCR signals. An adequate zinc level is essential for proper immune responses and decreased zinc levels were reported in many allergic inflammatory diseases, including atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Decreased zinc levels often enhance inflammatory activation. On the other hand, the inflammatory conditions alter the intracellular homeostasis of zinc, often decreasing zinc levels. These findings implied that there could be a vicious cycle between zinc deficiency and inflammatory conditions. In this review, we present recent evidence on the involvement of zinc in atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis, with insights into the involvement of zinc in the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms related to these allergic inflammatory diseases.",

Furthermore, the TS/Pro (Total Score of ASCA/cumulative protein dose) can be a marker to represent the overall severity of a food allergy. We aimed to develop a prediction model for a severe allergic reaction that is provoked in a boiled egg white challenge.We used two separate datasets to develop and validate the prediction model, respectively. The development dataset included 198 OFCs, that tested positive. The validation dataset prospectively included 140 consecutive OFCs, irrespective of the result. A 'severe reaction' was defined as a TS/Pro higher than 31 (the median score of the development dataset). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with a severe reaction and develop the prediction model.The following four factors were independently associated with a severe reaction: ovomucoid specific IgE class (OM-sIgE: 0-6), aged 5 years or over, a complete avoidance of egg, and a total IgE < 1000 IU/mL. Based on these factors, we made a simple scoring prediction model. The model showed good discrimination in a receiver operating characteristic analysis; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.84 in development dataset, AUC = 0.85 in validation dataset. The prediction model significantly improved the AUC in both datasets compared to OM-sIgE alone.This simple scoring prediction model was useful for avoiding risky OFC.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a known risk and exacerbation factor for bronchial asthma. Leptin is an adipokine secreted by adipocytes and enhances energy consumption. Earlier studies have shown that leptin also activates inflammatory cells and structural cells, including airway epithelial cells, thereby exacerbating inflammation. However, little is known about leptin's effect on normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), which are deeply involved in airway remodeling in asthma. This study aimed to elucidate the direct effect of leptin on NHLFs. NHLFs were co-cultured with leptin, and production of cytokines/chemokines was analyzed with real-time PCR and cytometric bead arrays (CBA). Expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in the lysate of NHLFs stimulated with leptin was assessed by western blotting. Expression of leptin receptor (Ob-R) was analyzed by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. NHLFs were transfected with Ob-R small interference ribonucleic acid (siRNA) by electroporation and used for experiments. Leptin enhanced production of CCL11/Eotaxin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2/MCP-1), CXCL8/IL-8, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (CXCL10/IP-10) and IL-6 by NHLFs at both the protein and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels. Leptin also slightly, but significantly, elevated expression of α-SMA. We found robust Ob-R expression on cell surfaces, and transfection with Ob-R siRNA suppressed the enhanced production of CCL11/Eotaxin, CXCL10/IP-10 and IL-6 by leptin, although not completely. These findings indicate that leptin may contribute to worsening of asthma in obese patients by enhancing production of inflammatory mediators by binding to Ob-R and accelerating myofibroblast differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Allergic conjunctivitis affects approximately 15–20% of the global population and can permanently deteriorate one's quality of life (QoL) and work productivity, leading to societal work force costs. Although not fully understood, allergic conjunctivitis is a multifactorial disease with a complex network of environmental, lifestyle, and host contributory risk factors. To effectively enhance the quality of treatment for patients with allergic conjunctivitis, as well as other allergic diseases, the field must first comprehend the pathology underlying various individualized subjective symptoms and stratify the disease according to risk factors and presentations. Such competent stratification and societal reconstruction that targets the alleviation of the damage due to allergic diseases would greatly help ramify personalized treatments and prevent the projected increase in societal costs imposed by allergic diseases. Owing to the rapid advancements in the information and technology sector, medical big data are greatly accessible and useful to decipher the pathophysiology of many diseases. Such data collected through multi-omics and mobile health have been effective for research on chronic diseases including allergic and immune-mediated diseases. Novel big data containing vast and continuous information on individuals with allergic conjunctivitis and other allergic symptoms are being used to search for causative genes of diseases, gain insights into new biomarkers, prevent disease progression, and, ultimately, improve QoL. The individualized and holistic data accrued from new angles using technological innovations are helping the field realize the principles of P4 medicine: predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory medicine.",

The value of TARC in diagnosing drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) was also examined.Study participants included 84 patients who presented with generalized eruptions suspected to be drug-related, including DIHS, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), maculopapular exanthema (MPE), erythema multiforme (EM), erythroderma, and toxicoderma. The correlation coefficients between serum TARC levels and clinical parameters in peripheral blood samples were calculated.Serum TARC levels in patients with DIHS were higher than those found in patients with SJS/TEN, MPE, EM, and toxicoderma. TARC levels had 100% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity in diagnosing DIHS, with a threshold value of 13,900 pg/mL. Serum TARC levels positively correlated with age, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, eosinophil count, monocyte count, atypical lymphocyte (Aty-ly) count, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, and creatinine (Cr) levels. It negatively correlated with serum total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Among these clinical parameters, blood eosinophil counts were most strongly correlated with serum TARC levels, with a correlation coefficient of 0.53.Serum TARC levels are well correlated with blood eosinophil counts in patients with generalized drug eruptions, indicating that Th2-type immune reactions underlie TARC production. Serum TARC measurements also have potent diagnostic value for DIHS, with high sensitivity and specificity.",

Not all patients respond to anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids, leading to significant morbidity in severe asthma. Much attention has been paid to defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms of type 2 inflammation that are operative in asthma. Development of targeted therapies for pathologic type 2 inflammation is opening a new approach to asthma treatment; however, not all asthmatics have type 2 airway inflammation, especially those with severe corticosteroid-refractory asthma. Much less is known about non-type 2 immunological mechanisms in asthma. In health, inflammation triggers resolution mechanisms that control immune (type 1 and type 2) responses and enable the restoration of tissue homeostasis. The resolution response is comprised of cellular and molecular events, including production of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). SPMs halt leukocyte recruitment, promote macrophage efferocytosis, and restore epithelial barrier integrity, all of which are critical to resolution of inflammation in the lungs. Here, we review recent insights into the disruption of these homeostatic mechanisms and their contributions to non-type 2 inflammation in severe asthma immunopathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Although breastfeeding has been well-established as the preferred method for infant nutrition, its prophylactic effects on food allergy remain controversial. Infantile eczema has been linked to food allergy via percutaneous sensitization; however, this relationship has not been considered in previous studies. We aimed to uncover the prophylactic effects of breastfeeding on food allergy, focusing on eczema-mediated percutaneous sensitization.This retrospective cohort study was based on 46,616 children from the Longitudinal Survey of Newborns in the 21st Century in Japan, begun in 2001. We classified participants into three groups based on infant feeding practices (exclusive breastfeeding, partial breastfeeding including only colostrum, and formula feeding only) and used information from at least one outpatient visit for food allergy during two observation periods (age 6-18 months and age 6-66 months) as health outcomes. We performed log-binomial regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders and stratified analysis according to infantile eczema status.Compared with formula feeding, partial breastfeeding including only colostrum reduced the risk of food allergy only in children with infantile eczema, (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.96 for age 6-66 months), whereas exclusive breastfeeding increased this risk in those without infantile eczema (RR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.40, 4.15, age 6-66 months). The prophylactic effects of breastfeeding on food allergy in the infantile eczema group increased with shorter breastfeeding duration.Our results showed that breastfeeding, especially colostrum, had prophylactic effects on food allergy only among high-risk children with infantile eczema whereas prolonged breastfeeding increased the risk of food allergy.",

But, whether a correlation exist between the CD69 expression on eosinophils and clinical findings is unclear. We performed quantitative PCR and/or flow cytometry using tissue and purified eosinophils from the blood and nasal polyps of 12 patients with ECRS and from 8 patients without ECRS (controls). We assessed clinical findings including nasal polyp (NP) scores, sinus CT findings, and pulmonary function test results, and examined their possible association with the CD69 expression. We also performed CD69 cross-linking experiments in mouse eosinophils to investigate the functional role of CD69. Levels of cytokine mRNAs (IL-4, -5, -10, and -13) were significantly higher in purified NP eosinophils and tissues from patients with ECRS than the levels of those in controls. The expressions of major basic protein (MBP), eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), eosinophilic-derived neurotoxin (EDN), eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) in cytotoxic granules, and CD69 mRNA were significantly higher in purified eosinophils from NPs than in those from blood. We also found a correlation between expression of CD69 and clinical findings. Moreover, we found EPX release from mouse eosinophils following CD69 cross-linking. These data suggest that increased CD69 expression by eosinophils is not only a biomarker for nasal obstruction and pulmonary dysfunction, but also a potential therapeutic target for patients with ECRS and asthma.",

Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs), mainly synthesized in eosinophils, are a class of inflammatory lipid mediators produced via multiple enzymatic reactions from arachidonic acid. Multiple clinical studies have reported dysregulated fatty acid metabolism in severe asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanism responsible for this metabolic abnormality has attracted a lot of attention. In eosinophils, various stimuli (including cytokines, chemokines, and pathogen-derived factors) prime and/or induce leukotriene generation and secretion. Cell-cell interactions with component cells (endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts) also enhance this machinery to augment allergic responses. Nasal polyp-derived eosinophils from patients with eosinophilic rhinosinusitis present a characteristic fatty acid metabolism with selectively higher production of leukotriene D4. Interestingly, type 2 cytokines and microbiome components might be responsible for this metabolic change with altered enzyme expression. Here, we review the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, especially cys-LT metabolism, in human eosinophils toward allergic inflammatory status.",

Th2 cytokines, especially IL-13, play a pathogenic role in AD. IL-13 signals via a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-4Rα and IL-13 Rα1. A second receptor, IL-13 Rα2, binds to IL-13 with high affinity, but it works as a decoy receptor. IL-13 Rα2 is overexpressed in the lesional skin of AD. Notably, mechanical scratching, as well as IL-13 itself, also upregulates IL-13 Rα2 expression. The scratch-induced IL-13 Rα2 upregulation may attenuate the IL-13-mediated epidermal barrier dysfunction and dermal fibrosis. Recent studies stress an importance of another IL-13 Rα2 ligand, chitinase 3-like 1 or YKL-40 in Th2 differentiation. However, the implications of increased IL-13 Rα2 levels remain elusive in AD. In this review, we summarize the recent topics on IL-13 Rα2 in atopic skin inflammation.",

Moreover, MCs are positive for a large number of receptors for classical neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine and corticotropin-releasing hormone) and neuropeptides (e.g., substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptides and hemokinin), and MC's functions are regulated by those nerve-derived factors. Also, histamine and proteases produced and released by MCs modulate nerve fiber functions. This functional cross-talk between MCs and nerve fibers can play physiological and pathological roles. MCs are key effector cells of allergic inflammation, such as atopic dermatitis, airway inflammation and food allergy.

    "abstract": "HDM SLIT is one of the disease-modifying treatment for allergic asthma, and has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials. Dupilumab, blocks IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, key drivers of type 2 inflammation, and is approved for patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes after HDM SLIT initiation in asthma with rhinitis not optimally controlled with dupilumab in a real-world setting.At baseline and 48 weeks after treatment, asthma control questionnaire (ACQ)-5, asthma quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ) and rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) were assessed. Spirometry, type 2 inflammatory biomarkers and quantitative computed tomographic parameters of airway remodeling were also collected.Of 47 patients received HDM SLIT and 41 completed the study. Combined HDM SLIT and dupilumab improved ACQ-5 (p < 0.05), AQLQ (p < 0.05), RQLQ (p < 0.05), and increased lung function and reduced FeNO (p < 0.05) and airway percentage wall area, and wall thickness (each, p < 0.05). The change in ACQ-5 and AQLQ score correlated with both changes in FeNO and FEV1 percent predicted. Multiple regression analysis showed that the change in FEV1 percent predicted was independent factor for improvement of AQLQ (r2 = 0.510, p = 0.012). Based on ROC analysis for predicting SLIT responders, the baseline area under the curves in serum HDM specific-IgE, total IgE and FEV1 percent predicted were high (>0.8).These results support the benefits of adding HDM SLIT to pharmacotherapy plus dupilumab in uncontrolled asthma with rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a syndrome with extremely diverse clinical phenotypes in which the onset, severity, and response to treatment are defined by the complex interplay of many genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors epigenetically affect gene expression, and the disease is driven by a multidimensional dynamic network involving RNA and protein molecules derived from gene expression, as well as various metabolic products. In other words, specific pathophysiological mechanisms or endotypes are dynamic networks that arise in response to individual genotypes and the various environmental factors to which individuals have been exposed since before birth, such as diet, infection, air pollution, smoking, antibiotic use, and the bacterial flora of the intestinal tract, skin, and lungs. A key feature of asthma genome scans is their potential to reveal the molecular pathways that lead to pathogenesis. Endotypes that drive the disease have a significant impact on the phenotypes of asthma patients, including their drug responsiveness. Understanding endotypes will lead to not only the implementation of therapies that are tailored to the specific molecular network(s) underlying the patient's condition, but also to the development of therapeutic strategies that target individual endotypes, as well as to precision health, which will enable the prediction of disease onset with high accuracy from an early stage and the implementation of preventive strategies based on endotypes. Understanding of endotypes will pave the way for the practice of precision medicine in asthma care, moving away from 'one-size-fits-all' medicine and population-based prevention approaches that do not take individuals' susceptibility into account.",

However, these drugs have not been approved for ocular allergic diseases such as allergic conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and atopic keratoconjunctivitis. Although the putative mechanisms suggest that these drugs should have beneficial effects in patients with ocular allergies and some studies have reported such beneficial effects, various adverse ocular symptoms have also been observed in clinical trials and off-label use studies. Since ocular allergic diseases have distinct pathogeneses, each biologic drug must be examined regarding specific effects on each ocular allergy. For example, IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity plays a critical role in allergic conjunctivitis. By contrast, T cells and eosinophilic and non-IgE-mediated type 2 inflammation play important roles in vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Allergists must fully understand the effects of each drug on the eye. This review outlines both potential therapeutic and adverse effects of various biologics on allergic diseases of the eye.",

We investigated an association between lifetime oral corticosteroid (OCS) exposure with frailty and muscle weakness among elderly patients with asthma.We studied 203 consecutive elderly outpatients with asthma aged ≥60 years old. They were classified into three groups according to their cumulative lifetime OCS dose (lifetime non-users, lower-dose users, and higher-dose users), which was retrospectively estimated from the response to a structured questionnaire. The prevalence of frailty determined by the Kihon Checklist was compared between the three groups. Hand-grip strength, and lean mass index were also measured as markers of muscle strength.Thirty-seven percent of the patients studied were considered frail. Higher cumulative lifetime OCS exposure was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of frailty (33% in lifetime non-users, 59% in lower-dose users, and 68% in higher-dose users; P for trend <0.005). This was also associated with lower hand-grip strength in both sexes (P for trend; 0.012 in men, and 0.020 in women), and lower lean mass index in men (P for trend 0.002). However, current doses of OCS were not significantly associated with these outcomes.Cumulative lifetime OCS exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of frailty and muscle weakness. These findings emphasize the importance of minimizing lifetime OCS exposure for the prolongation of healthy life expectancy in patients with asthma.",

    "abstract": "Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and Schnitzler syndrome (SchS) are autoinflammatory diseases that present with urticaria-like rashes. CAPS is characterized by periodic or persistent systemic inflammation caused by the dysfunction of the NLRP3 gene. With the advent of IL-1-targeted therapies, the prognosis of CAPS has improved remarkably. SchS is considered an acquired form of autoinflammatory syndrome. Patients with SchS are adults of relatively older age. The pathogenesis of SchS remains unknown and is not associated with the NLRP3 gene. Previously, the p.L265P mutation in the MYD88 gene, which is frequently detected in Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) with IgM gammopathy, was identified in several cases of SchS. However, because persistent fever and fatigue are symptoms of WM that require therapeutic intervention, it is a challenge to determine whether these patients truly had SchS or whether advanced WM was misidentified as SchS. There are no established treatments for SchS. The treatment algorithm proposed with the diagnostic criteria is to use colchicine as first-line treatment, and systemic administration of steroids is not recommended due to concerns about side effects. In difficult-to-treat cases, treatment targeting IL-1 is recommended. If targeted IL-1 treatment does not improve symptoms, the diagnosis should be reconsidered. We hope that the efficacy of IL-1 therapy in clinical practice will serve as a stepping stone to elucidate the pathogenesis of SchS, focusing on its similarities and differences from CAPS.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder characterized by cutaneous and submucosal swelling caused mostly by excessive local bradykinin production. Bradykinin is a vasoactive peptide generated by the limited proteolysis of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) by plasma kallikrein via the contact activation system. The contact activation system occurs not only in solution but also on the cell surface. Factor XII (FXII), prekallikrein, and HMWK are assembled on the endothelial cell surface via several proteins, including a trimer of a receptor for globular C1q domain in a Zn2+-dependent manner, and the reciprocal activation on the cell surface is believed to be physiologically important in vivo. Thus, the contact activation system leads to the activation of coagulation, complement, inflammation, and fibrinolysis. C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) is a plasma protease inhibitor that is a member of the serpin family. It mainly inhibits activated FXII (FXIIa), plasma kallikrein, and C1s. C1-INH hereditary deficiency induces HAE (HAE-C1-INH) due to excessive bradykinin production via the incomplete inhibition of plasma kallikrein and FXIIa through the low C1-INH level. HAE is also observed in patients with normal C1-INH (HAEnCI) who carry pathogenic variants in genes of factor XII, plasminogen, angiopoietin 1, kininogen, myoferlin, and heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 6, which are associated with bradykinin production and/or vascular permeability. HAE-causing pathways triggered by pathogenic variants in patients with HAE-C1-INH and HAEnCI are reviewed and discussed.",

The similarity of symptoms and pathology to allergen-induced skin reactions supports that skin mast cell IgE receptor activation is also involved in CSU. Accumulating evidence also supports a role for blood basophils in disease expression. Blood basopenia is noted in active CSU disease with the recruitment of blood basophils to skin lesion sites. Blood basophils further display altered IgE receptor mediated degranulation patterns in two phenotypes that improve in remission. In active CSU subjects, changes in IgE receptor signaling molecule expression levels accompany the altered degranulation function in blood basophils. The success of therapies targeting IgE in CSU patients have also shown that altered blood basophil phenotypes and enumeration have potential use as a disease biomarker.",

This study aimed to analyze and compare the gut microbiota of food-allergic children with that of healthy children of the same age. Stool samples were collected from one-and-a-half-year-old food-allergic (FA group, n = 29) and healthy controls (HC group, n = 19). A questionnaire was provided to examine the children's birth, dietary, medical, and social histories. The gut microbiota was profiled by 16S rRNA sequencing. Differences in taxonomic composition were assessed using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), and microbial functional profiles were predicted with Tax4Fun2. No significant difference in the alpha diversity index between the two groups; however, a negative correlation was observed between the Shannon diversity index and the relative abundance of Bacteroides. A significant difference was observed in beta diversity (permutational multivariate analysis of variance) in the bacterial composition between the FA and HC groups (P < 0.05). The FA group had a higher abundance of Escherichia and Anaeromassilibacillus and a lower abundance of Bacteroides, Oscillibacter, Ruminococcus, Hungateiclostridium and Anaerotaenia than the HC group (LEfSe: linear discriminant analysis score >2). The FA group showed a predicted increase in the expression levels of genes associated with intestinal pathogenicity compared with that in the HC group. The gut microbiota of food-allergic children has a higher abundance of bacteria involved in intestinal inflammation and a lower abundance of bacteria involved in immune tolerance than that of healthy children. This dysbiosis may also be associated with food allergies.",

    "abstract": "Basophils represent less than 1% of peripheral blood leukocytes. They are often recruited to the site of allergic inflammation, albeit in small numbers. However, it remained uncertain whether basophils play any significant role in allergic reactions or act as minor and redundant 'circulating mast cells'. We have recently demonstrated that basophils play critical roles in systemic anaphylaxis and chronic allergic inflammation, distinctively from mast cells. Basophils are one of the major players in the IgG-but not IgE-mediated systemic anaphylaxis, in contrast to mast cells. In response to the allergen-IgG immune complexes, basophils release the platelet-activating factor rather than histamine as the major chemical mediator to induce the systemic anaphylaxis. The depletion of basophils protects mice from death due to anaphylactic shock. Basophils also play a crucial role in the development of the IgE-mediated chronic allergic inflammation with massive eosinophil infiltration in the skin, independently of T cells and mast cells, even though basophils account for only ~ 2% of the infiltrates. The basophil depletion shows a therapeutic effect on on-going allergic inflammation. Accumulating evidence suggests that basophils function as initiators rather than effectors of the chronic allergic inflammation. Thus, basophils and their products seem to be promising therapeutic targets for allergic disorders.",

The association of Th17-inducing activities with Notch ligand expression patterns has been unclear. Mo-DCs from healthy volunteers were co-cultured with HLA-DR-nonshared allogeneic CD4 + naive T cells to induce a mixed lymphocyte reaction, in the presence of adjuvants, such as curdlan. Culture supernatants were assayed for IFNγ, IL-5 and IL-17 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Notch ligand expression on Mo-DCs and THP-1 cells was evaluated by using RT-PCR. The present study shows that curdlan, one of the β-glucans, has the ability to induce DC-mediated Th17 differentiation. It is also interesting to note that Jagged1 mRNA in Mo-DCs and THP-1 cells is up-regulated by curdlan. Furthermore, polyclonal anti-Jagged1 antibody inhibited such DC-mediated Th17 differentiation. This study suggests that curdlan induces human DC-mediated Th17 polarization via Jagged1 activation in DCs.",

We investigated the relationship between wheat/soybean specific IgE antibody levels and the outcome of wheat/soybean allergy diagnosis in children of different ages. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 536 children admitted consecutively to our clinic with the suspicion of wheat and/or soybean allergy. The children underwent an oral food challenge and blood samples for specific IgE measurement were obtained. Results: The children who reacted to the oral food challenge had higher specific IgE titers to the specific allergen compared to the non-reacting group. The risk for reaction increased 2.33-fold (95% CI 1.90-2.87) for wheat and 2.08-fold (95% CI 1.65-2.61) for soybean, with increasing levels of specific IgE. A significant difference between the ages of subjects pertained only to wheat. Conclusions: We found a relationship between the probability of failed challenge and the concentration of IgE antibodies to both wheat and soybean. Age influences the relationship of allergen specific IgE levels to wheat and oral food challenge outcome. Younger children are more likely to react to low levels of specific IgE antibody concentration to wheat than older children.",

In order to encompass food allergy from infancy to adulthood, the project committee included not only pediatricians, but also internists, dermatologists, and otolaryngologists. After the release of the guideline, oral food challenge tests were approved as a medical examination on hospital admission by the national health insurance system in 2006, and the tests at outpatient clinics were also approved in 2008. As clearly stated in the guideline, it is essential for general practitioners to refer food allergy patients to specialists to receive accurate diagnosis. A specialist is needed because the oral food challenge test, which is sometimes required for accurate diagnosis, carries the potential risk of developing an adverse reaction. In 2008, the \"Food Allergy Management Guideline 2008\" was revised to update recent advances, such as the appropriate conditions needed to perform oral food challenge tests and probability curves for hen's egg and cow's milk developed in Japan. In the same year, \"The Guidelines for the Treatment of Allergic Diseases in Schools\" was published by the Japanese Society of School Health. In addition to the guideline, \"School Life Management Certificate (for Allergic Diseases) \" was developed in order to allow the verification of the diagnosis and encourage the discussion of countermeasures by parents/guardians and school teachers for students requiring special care. It is hoped that this review article will be useful for doctors treating food allergy and that the quality of life of food allergy patients and their parents will be improved.",

    "abstract": "A 24 year-old woman with atopic dermatitis occasionally developed symptoms, including dyspnea and generalized urticaria, following ingestion of food containing cows milk. Similar episodes had continued, and had been treated empirically since the age of 16 years. Although a skin test and IgE RAST showed positive reactions to cows milk, a provocation test with cows milk alone did not induce any symptoms. Therefore, food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) was suspected, but examination using various combinations of cows milk, aspirin and exercise failed to elicit any symptoms. Finally, a provocation test during the ovulatory phase with cows milk followed by aspirin and exercise evoked systemic urticaria, dyspnea and hypotension. The symptoms against cows milk began when she took baths with bath salts containing cows milk as its main ingredient for one year at the age 15 years. Sensitization to cows milk through eczematous skin is indicated from this history. Hormonal change during a premenstrual or ovulatory phase is also an important factor for the development of FDEIA in this case.",

    "abstract": "Recently, some common foods in daily life, especially lactic acid bacteria, have been found to have anti-allergic effects. We previously isolated a halophilic lactic acid bacterium, Tetragenococcus halophilus Th221, from soy sauce moromi, a mixture of koji and salt solution, and showed that it possesses an immunomodulatory activity that promotes T helper type 1 immunity. To evaluate the anti-allergic effects of Th221, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 45 subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) treated by oral administration of Th221 (high dose, 60 mg/day, 15 subjects; low dose, 20.4 mg/day, 15 subjects) or a placebo (15 subjects) for 8 weeks. There were no significant differences among the groups that ingested Th221 and the placebo group regarding the disease severities, total nasal symptom scores and total nasal sign scores examined by physicians. However, the disease severity examined by physicians significantly improved in the high-dose group at the end of the trial compared with the beginning (p < 0.05). The total score for nasal symptoms of subjects who received a high dose of Th221 also showed a significant improvement at the end of the trial compared with the beginning (p < 0.01). According to the subjects' diaries, significant improvements in sneezing and rhinorrhea were observed during some periods in the high-dose group. The change in serum total immunoglobulin E improved significantly at the end of the trial compared with the beginning in this group (p < 0.05). The safety of Th221 treatment was confirmed by laboratory tests and inspection of the general condition of each subject. Th221 can be expected to safely improve the symptoms of PAR.",

However, no large studies on the relationship between CRS and lower airway diseases have been reported to date in Japan. Additionally, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) in Japan is considered to be a subgroup of CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) characterized by eosinophil-dominant inflammation. However, the diagnostic criteria of ECRS have not been established. To investigate clinical and epidemiological features of patients with CRS from the aspect of their associations with lower airway diseases, 553 patients with CRS who visited one of six local university hospitals were examined and interviewed. Local eosinophilic infiltration was evaluated pathologically by exmining NPs. The prevalences of olfactory dysfunction (OD) in the patients with nasal polyps (NPs) and those without NPs were 57.0% and 13.7%, respectively (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of asthma in all patients was 23.1%. Furthermore, the prevalences of NPs and OD in the patients with asthma and those without asthma were 81.0% and 50.1% (p < 0.0001) and 64.2% and 35.7% (p < 0.0001), respectively. 97.4% of the patients with asthma had > 15% mucosal eosinophils, and 87.9% of the patients without asthma had < 15% mucosal eosinophilis. Similar to the relationship between nasal allergy and asthma, CRSwNP may be applicable to the concept of \"one airway, one disease\".",

Methods: Subjects were 103 patients with ACD including 40 patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), 20 patients with atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), and 43 patients with allergic conjunctivitis (AC). The 5-5-5 exacerbation grading scale consists of the following 3 graded groups of clinical observations: the 100-point-grade group (100 points for each observation) includes active giant papillae, gelatinous infiltrates of the limbus, exfoliative epithelial keratopathy, shield ulcer and papillary proliferation at lower palpebral conjunctiva; the 10-point-grade group (10 points for each observation) includes blepharitis, papillary proliferation with velvety appearance, Horner-Trantas spots, edema of bulbal conjunctiva, and superficial punctate keratopathy; and the 1-point-grade group (1 point for each observation) includes papillae at upper palpebral conjunctiva, follicular lesion at lower palpebral conjunctiva, hyperemia of palpebral conjunctiva, hyperemia of bulbal conjunctiva, and lacrimal effusion. The total points in each grade group were determined as the severity score of the 55–5 exacerbation grading scale. Results: The median severity scores of the 5-5-5 exacerbation grading scale in VKC, AKC and AC were 243 (range: 12–444), 32.5 (11–344), and 13 (2–33), respectively. The severity score of each ACD disease type was significantly different (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). The severity of each type of ACD was classified as severe, moderate, or mild according to the severity score. Conclusions: The 5-5-5 exacerbation grading scale is a useful clinical tool for grading the severity of each type of ACD.",

The aims of the present double blind, placebo-controlled trial were to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with house dust extract in pediatric patients with HDM allergic rhinitis.The study population comprised 31 subjects (21 males and 10 females) aged from 7 to 15 years old. Twenty patients (the active group) received house dust extract and 11 received placebo via sublingual administration. Extract or placebo (1 ml) was administered at 10-fold dilution once weekly for 40 weeks. During the study period, the subjects recorded their daily nasal symptoms and use (dose and frequency) of other medications in a nasal allergy diary.The symptom scores in the active group began to decrease about 24 weeks after initiation of treatment and significant differences between the active and placebo groups were observed after 30 weeks. The average scores for the last four weeks of the study were significantly lower than those for the first four weeks in the active group but not in the placebo group. The only local adverse effect was a bitter taste reported by one patient. There were no other local or systemic adverse effects associated with SLIT.Our results suggest that SLIT with house dust extract for more than 30 weeks is safe and effective treatment for HDM allergic rhinitis in children.",

    "abstract": "Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a rare and severe cutaneous reaction usually triggered by drugs. Other causative factors such as viral infections are rarely involved. In this study, we report a case of AGEP caused by a spider bite. A 56-year-old woman was referred to the allergy unit after a spider bite at the left popliteal fossa, while gardening, 5 days earlier. The offending spider was captured and identified by an entomologist as belonging to the Loxosceles rufescens species. No acute reaction was observed; however, after 24 hours, due to the occurrence of typical dermonecrotic skin lesions associated with erythema and edema, Cefuroxime and Clindamycin were administered intramuscularly after medical advice was given. Almost 72 hours after the spider bite, an erythematous and partly edematous eruption appeared locally in the gluteus area bilaterally, which progressively expanded to the trunk, arms and femors. Within 24 hours dozens of small, pinhead sized, non- follicular pustules were present, mainly in the folds. The patient complained of a burning sensation of the skin in addition to pruritus; and simultaneously had a fever of 38-39 °C as the eruption expanded. A spider bite may represent a possible causative factor of AGEP. A spider's venom contains sphingomyelinase that stimulates the release of IL8 and GM-CSF, which are involved in AGEP pathogenesis. Whether or not the con-current use of antibiotics has an effect in AGEP appearance when combined with a spider's venom, cannot be excluded.",

Atopic manifestations include atopic dermatitis-like skin lesion and extremely high serum IgE levels. Most of the extracellular bacterial infections are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which is associated with milder inflammation compared to normal. Recent studies have revealed that the most cases of the HIES are caused by dominant negative mutations in STAT3 gene. Cutaneous manifestations of HIES includes newborn rash, eczematoid dermatitis, cold abscesses, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and coarse texture of the facial skin. Impaired Th17 cell development due to the defective IL-6 signaling in T cells and impaired induced regulatory T (iTreg) cell generation due to defective IL-10 signaling in dendritic cells may, at least in part, account for the cutaneous pathology of HIES.",

    "abstract": "Allergic patients mount a Th2 response to common allergens, like house dust mite (HDM), pollens, molds and animal dander. Most inhaled antigens are immunologically inert, however if these antigens are accompanied by microbial or endogenous danger patterns (alarmins), they can be recognized by inflammatory cells. Dendritic cells are the most potent antigen presenting cells, which express a wide variety of receptors on their cell surface, recognizing these microbial patterns, damage induced molecules and cytokines. Dendritic cells become reporters of the microenvironment if exposed to the allergen, subsequently migrating to the draining lymph nodes where they activate naïve T lymphocytes. Dendritic cells could also be indirectly activated by epithelial cells, which express various receptors and secrete a variety of cytokines early after allergen exposure. Upon HDM exposure these cells secrete chemokines to attract monocytes and immature dendritic cells, and GM-CSF, TSLP and IL-33 to activate dendritic cells, mast cells and basophils. Danger signals which alert dendritic cells and epithelial cells comprise many proteins and molecules, contributing to an enhanced immune response to inhaled allergens. This review focuses on the role of dendritic cells and alarmins in the sensitization to inhaled allergens in allergic asthma.",

We investigated the preventative effect of enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (EMIQ), a flavonoid, to relieve the symptoms of Japanese cedar pollinosis. In a parallel-group, double-blind placebo-controlled study design, 24 subjects with Japanese cedar pollinosis took 100 mg EMIQ or a placebo for 8 weeks, starting 4 weeks prior to the onset of pollen release. Subjective symptoms, ADL scores and the usage of drugs were recorded daily, and the QOL score was obtained every 4 weeks. Blood sampling was performed before and after the study to measure serum levels of IgE and flavonoids. During the entire study period, ocular symptom + medication score for the EMIQ group was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of the placebo group. When limited to the period, ocular symptom scores (p < 0.05, weeks 5–6), and ocular congestion scores (p < 0.05, weeks 5–6) for the EMIQ group was significantly lower than that for the placebo group while other scores for the EMIQ group, such as ocular itching scores (p = 0.09, weeks 4–5), lacrimation scores (p = 0.07, weeks 5–6), and ocular congestion scores (p = 0.06, weeks 45), all tended to be lower. However no significant differences were found in nasal symptoms between the two groups. Serum concentrations of IgE were not significantly downregulated but the serum concentrations of quercetin and its derivatives were elevated significantly by the intake of EMIQ. Intake of the quercetin glycoside EMIQ proved to be effective for the relief of ocular symptoms caused by Japanese cedar pollinosis.",

Peak expiratory flow (PRF) was also measured from February to May. We surveyed 106 patients in February, 101 patients in March, and 103 patients in December. In February and March, Japanese cedar and/or cypress pollen was also in the atmosphere during ADS, but no pollen was identified during December survey. Worsening of upper or lower respiratory, ocular, or skin symptoms was noted by 20.8% of patients in February, 33.7% in March, and 16.5% in December. Worsening of symptoms was significantly more common in March than in February or December. Two patients needed emergency treatment for exacerbation during ADS in March, but no patient needed hospitalization in any period. There was no significant difference of the daily morning PEF/personal best PEF ratio between ADS days and control days. However, in patients with worsening of upper and/or lower respiratory tract symptoms, the daily morning PEF/personal best ratio was significantly associated with the atmospheric level of particulate matter, but not with levels of pollen or other air pollutants. Pollen augmented symptoms in adult asthma patients, but ADS on its own also were able to aggravate symptoms and pulmonary function.",

Although a large number of patients with asthma develop the disease later in life, these previous cluster analyses focused mainly patients with younger-onset asthma.Cluster analysis examined the existence of distinct phenotypes of late-onset asthma in Japanese patients with adult asthma. We then associated genotypes at the CCL5, TSLP, IL4, and ADRB2 genes with the clusters of asthma identified.Using the 8 variables of age, sex, age at onset of the disease, smoking status, total serum IgE, %FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and specific IgE responsiveness to common inhaled allergens, two-step cluster analysis of 880 Japanese adult asthma patients identified 6 phenotypes: cluster A (n = 155): older age at onset, no airflow obstruction; cluster B (n = 170): childhood onset, normal-to-mild airflow obstruction; cluster C (n = 119): childhood onset, the longest disease duration, and moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction; cluster D (n = 108): older age at onset, severe airflow obstruction; cluster E (n = 130): middle-age at onset, no airflow obstruction; and cluster F (n = 198): older age at onset, mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction.

As has been previously reported for all age groups, significantly higher rates of current asthma are observed in boys than in girls. The prevalence of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis exhibited a different pattern from that of asthma and atopic dermatitis, peaking at the age of 10 (34.8%). Prevalence of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis was 1.5 to 2-fold higher than the previous ISAAC studies that were performed in Tochigi and Fukuoka. In all age groups, symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis were more frequent from February to May, which coincides with the Japanese cedar pollen season, and were less frequent between June to September.

On the other hand, 71% (week 4) and 57% (week 12) of patients with concomitant using of tacrolimus ointment had blood levels above the detection limit of the assay. However, the maximum blood concentration was less than 2ng/mL. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 16 patients. These were disorders of the eye such as warmness, irritation, and a burning sensation.

All symptoms and signs improved over time.The good safety profile of 0.1% tacrolimus ophthalmic suspension based on the low blood concentration of tacrolimus, coupled with demonstrated efficacy, make it an important tool for treating severe allergic conjunctivitis.",

    "abstract": "The majority of patients with cholinergic urticaria presents with strong hypersensitivity to autologous sweat. Patients with severe cholinergic urticaria are frequently resistant to H1 antagonists which are used in conventional therapies for various types of urticaria. It has been reported that desensitization using partially purified sweat antigen was effective in a patient with cholinergic urticaria. The aim of this study is to determine the usefulness of rapid desensitization with autologous sweat in severe cholinergic urticaria, because rapid desensitization has proven to be a quick and effective immunotherapy for allergies to various allergens. Six patients with severe cholinergic urticaria who are resistant to H1 antagonists and have sweat hypersensitivity were enrolled in a rapid desensitization protocol. In all six patients, the responses for skin tests with autologous sweat were attenuated after rapid desensitization with autologous sweat. Two of the three cholinergic urticaria patients showed reduced histamine release with autologous sweat after the rapid desensitization with autologous sweat. Further, the rapid desensitization and subsequent maintenance treatment reduced the symptoms in five of the six patients. This study provides evidence that rapid desensitization with autologous sweat is beneficial for treating cholinergic urticaria patients resistant to conventional therapy who have sweat hypersensitivity.",

However, each guideline has its own characteristics and shows differences in areas such as the coverage of urticaria subtypes, nomenclatures, and hierarchy of the medications. In Japan, the Japanese Dermatological Association (JDA) published its first guideline for urticaria and angioedema in 2005. It established a new classification of urticaria and angioedema together with the definition of each subtype. It emphasized the importance of discriminating idiopathic urticaria, consisting of acute urticaria and chronic urticaria from inducible urticaria, such as allergic urticaria, physical urticaria and cholinergic urticaria. It contains several unique algorithms for diagnosis and treatment of urticaria from a view point of clinical practices, and was further enforced by a style of EBM in 2011. Nevertheless, these guidelines have not been recognized outside of Japan, because of a language barrier. In this article, the outline of the newest guidelines by JDA are introduced and compared with the guidelines in other countries published in English.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic or chronically relapsing, multifactorial skin disease that mainly occurs in children but affects also adults. AD usually begins early in life and often concerns people with a personal or family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis. AD is characterized by eczematous changes in the epidermis and originates from a late, T-cell mediated reaction associated to the formation and production of memory T-cell of TH2 type, occurrence of homing receptor at skin level and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated (CLA) antigens. Extrinsic or allergic AD, but not intrinsic AD, shows high total serum IgE levels and the presence of specific IgE for environmental and food allergens. A pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD is played by filaggrin, a protein contained in the granular layer of the epidermis regulating the aggregation of keratin filaments. Mutation in the filaggrin gene causes decreased barrier function of the corny layers of the epidermis. This favours the enter through the skin of environmental allergens, especially the house dust mite, that further facilitates such entering by the proteolytic activity of its major allergen Der p 1. In fact, recent advances suggest that the dust mite, more than foods, is the major cause of allergic AD. As far as the causal diagnosis of AD is concerned, there is notable evidence supporting the capacity of the atopy patch test (APT) to reproduce the pathophysiologic events of AD. This makes APT a valuable diagnostic tool for AD.",

    "abstract": "The burden of asthma is recognized as an important public health problem worldwide. In most countries, the prevalence of asthma has been reported to increase in the last few decades. However, more recent epidemiological studies have shown that the prevalence of asthma has been flat or even decreasing after the 1990s in some developed countries. The recent time trend in the prevalence of adult asthma in Japan is unknown. Population-based surveys were conducted three times in the same region, in 1985, 1999, and 2006, at Fujieda City, Shizuoka, Japan, and the results were reported previously. We compared the results of these surveys to reveal the time trend in the prevalence of adult asthma. Although the questionnaires used in these surveys were not exactly the same, the time trend was assessed by comparing the responses to relevant questions between questionnaires. The prevalences of wheeze following a common cold and dyspneal feeling at night increased significantly from 1985 to 1999 (4.2% to 7.6%, and 3.2% to 5.3%, respectively). The prevalences of lifetime asthma and current asthma also significantly increased from 1999 to 2006 (5.1% to 6.7%, and 1.5% to 3.4%, respectively). The prevalences of asthma among adults in Fujieda City consistently increased from 1985 to 2006. There was no evidence that the prevalences were in plateau or decreasing. These findings suggest that more efforts are required to stop the increase in the burden of this disease in Japan.",

    "abstract": "The clinical syndrome of aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) is characterized by aspirin/nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug intolerance, bronchial asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. AIA reactions are evidently triggered by pharmacological effect of cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors. Urine sampling is a non-invasive research tool for time-course measurements in clinical investigations. The urinary stable metabolite concentration of arachidonic acid products provides a time-integrated estimate of the production of the parent compounds in vivo. AIA patients exhibits significantly higher urinary concentrations of leukotriene E4 (LTE4) and 1,15-dioxo-9α-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetranorprostan-1,20-dioic acid (tetranor-PGDM), a newly identified metabolite of PGD2, at baseline. This finding suggests the possibility that increased mast cell activation is involved in the pathophysiology of AIA even in a clinically stable condition. In addition, lower urinary concentrations of primary prostaglandin E2 and 15-epimer of lipoxin A4 at baseline in the AIA patients suggest that the impaired anti-inflammatory elements may also contribute to the severe clinical outcome of AIA. During the AIA reaction, the urinary concentrations of LTE4 and PGD2 metabolites, including tetranor-PGDM significantly and correlatively increase. It is considered that mast cell activation probably is a pathophysiologic hallmark of AIA. However, despite the fact that cyclooxygenease-1 is the dominant in vivo PGD2 biosynthetic pathway, the precise mechanism underlying the PGD2 overproduction resulting from the pharmacological effect of cyclooxygenease-1 inhibitors in AIA remains unknown. A comprehensive analysis of the urinary concentration of inflammatory mediators may afford a new research target in elucidating the pathophysiology of AIA.",

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and comorbidity of allergic diseases in Japanese students.First-year students (n = 3,321; 2,209 male and 1,112 female) at Osaka University were asked about allergic diseases using postal interview sheets. Personal and family histories of doctor-diagnosed allergic diseases, clinical courses, and aggravating factors were included in the questionnaires.The lifetime prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR), atopic dermatitis (AD), bronchial asthma (BA), and FA was 35.7%, 16.5%, 9.9%, and 7.0%, respectively. Disease-specific family histories existed for AR, AD, and BA. There was a positive correlation between the number of family histories of allergic disease and comorbidity (R = 0.370, P <0.001). Comorbidity with AD significantly lowered the onset age of both BA (P = 0.010) and AR (P <0.001). In addition, the onset age of AD was remarkably lowered by comorbidity with FA (P <0.001). Comorbidity with FA was the highest risk factor for the progression of allergic march. Although most students showed improvement in AD, BA, and AR over time, the peak recurrence period was observed in adolescence.These findings indicate that AD associated with FA accelerates the subsequent progression of allergic march. Early appropriate management for genetically high-risk groups is important for the prevention of allergic march.",

    "abstract": "Previous family studies suggested that genetic variation contributes to COPD susceptibility. The only gene proven to influence COPD susceptibility is SERPINA1, encoding α1-antitrypsin. Most studies on COPD candidate genes except SERPINA1, have not been consistently replicated. However, longitudinal studies of decline in lung function, meta-analyses of candidate gene studies, and family-based linkage analyses suggested that variants in EPHX1, GST, MMP12, TGFB1, and SERPINE2 were associated with susceptibility to COPD. A genome-wide association (GWA) study has recently demonstrated that CHRNA3/5 in 15q25 was associated with COPD compared with control smokers. It was of interest that the CHRNA3/5 locus was associated with nicotine dependence and lung cancer as well. The associations of HHIP on 4q31 and FAM13A on 4q22 with COPD were also suggested in GWA studies. Another GWA study has shown that BICD1 in 12p11 was associated with the presence or absence of emphysema. Although every genetic study on COPD has some limitations including heterogeneity in smoking behaviors and comorbidities, it has contributed to the progress in elucidating the pathogenesis of COPD. Future studies will make us understand the mechanisms underlying the polygenic disease, leading to the development of a specific treatment for each phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Most infants and preschool children are not able to voluntarily perform the physiological maneuvers required to complete the pulmonary function tests that are used in adults and older children. Recently, commercial devices using forced oscillation technique (FOT) suitable for young children have become available. In devices with FOT, an oscillation pressure wave is generated by a loud speaker, is applied to the respiratory system, usually at the mouth, and the resulting pressure-flow relationship is analyzed in terms of impedance (Zrs). Zrs encompasses both resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs). Rrs is calculated from pressure and flow signals, and is a measure of central and peripheral airway caliber. Xrs is derived from the pressure in the phase with volume and is related to compliance (Crs) and inertance (Irs). These parameters individually indicate the condition of the small and large airways in each patient and indirectly suggest the presence of airway inflammation. It is agreed that the clinical diagnostic capacity of FOT is comparable to that of spirometry. One of the advantages of FOT is that minimal cooperation of the patient is needed and no respiratory maneuvers are required. The use of FOT should be considered in patients in whom spirometry or other pulmonary function tests cannot be performed or in cases where the results of other tests appear to be unreliable. In addition, this approach is effective in assessing bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Considering these qualities, FOT is a useful method to study pulmonary function in preschool children with asthma.",

The single most frequently reported drug was platinum compound and the incidence of anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock in platinum compounds users was 2.84 and 1.39 per 1000 patients use. Risk factors of anaphylactic shock among total anaphylaxis cases were identified as older age ≥70 years [Odd's ratio (OR), 5.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.70–20.14]. The use of iodinated contrast media (OR, 6.19; 95% CI, 1.87–20.53) and aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) (OR, 12.82; 95% CI, 1.50–109.92) were also a risk factor for the development of anaphylactic shock. Platinum compounds are the most commonly reported causative agents of in-hospital drug-induced anaphylaxis. Older age ≥70 years and drugs such as iodinated contrast media and aminosteroid NMBA are related with high risk of anaphylactic shock.",

In addition, 85% respondents were not satisfied with the current food allergen labeling law. In ELISA analyses, we clarified that pooled serum obtained from patients with fish parvalbumin-specific allergies exhibited IgE reactivity to the extracts of most fish species, and pooled serum obtained from patients with fish collagen-specific allergies displayed IgE reactivity to the extracts of all types of fish. Inhibition ELISA experiments revealed cross-reactivities of parvalbumin or collagen to extracts from all fish tested.Most patients with fish allergies displayed allergic symptoms following the intake of various fish species. In addition, fish parvalbumin and collagen were causative factors of fish allergy and were highly cross-reactive fish panallergens.

Although synovial mast cells (MCs) are activated by substance P (SP), the role of MCs in neural pathways in RA remains unknown. The aims of this study were to investigate 1) whether tachykinins are produced by synovial MCs and whether production differs in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients, and 2) what is the responsible receptor for SP in synovial MCs. Synovial tissues were obtained from patients with RA or OA undergoing joint replacement surgery. Cultured synovium-derived MCs were generated by culturing dispersed synovial cells with stem cell factor. SP expression was investigated using immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassays. Mas-related gene X2 (MrgX2) expression was reduced in human MCs using a lentiviral shRNA silencing technique. SP expression was localized around the cell membrane in 41% (median) of the MCs in synovium from RA but in only 7% of that from OA, suggesting the activation of MCs. Synovial MCs expressed tachykinin (TAC) 1 mRNA, the expression of which was upregulated by the aggregation of FcɛRI or the addition of aggregated IgG. However, the released SP appeared to be rapidly degraded by MC chymase. Synovial MCs were activated with SP through MrgX2 to release histamine without producing proinflammatory cytokines. Activated synovial MCs may rapidly degrade SP, which may downregulate the SP-mediated activation of synoviocytes in RA. On the other hand, SP activates MCs to induce inflammatory mediators, suggesting the dual regulation of SP-mediated inflammation by MCs in RA.",

However, a comparison of anaphylaxis for each cause has not been done. This study was conducted to identify common causes of anaphylaxis, characteristics of anaphylactic reaction for each cause and to analyze the factors related to the severity of the reaction. Medical records of patients who visited the emergency room of Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital from March 2003 to April 2016 and diagnosed with anaphylactic shock were retrospectively reviewed. We compared the clinical features of anaphylaxis according to the cause. In addition, the severity of anaphylaxis was analyzed and contributing factors for severe anaphylaxis were reviewed. A total of 199 patients with anaphylaxis were analyzed. Food was the most common cause (49.7%), followed by drug reaction (36.2%), bee venom (10.1%), and unknown cause (4.0%). Cardiovascular symptoms of syncope and hypotension were more common in drug-induced anaphylaxis. The incidence of severe anaphylaxis was the highest in anaphylaxis due to drugs (54.2%). Urticaria and other skin symptoms were significantly more common in food-induced anaphylaxis. Risk factors for severe anaphylaxis included older age, male, and drug-induced one. Epinephrine treatment of anaphylaxis was done for 69.7% and 56.9% of patients with food-induced and drug-induced anaphylaxis, respectively. More severe anaphylaxis developed with drug treatment and in males. Low rate of epinephrine prescription was also observed. Male patients with drug induced anaphylaxis should be paid more attention.",

    "abstract": "Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) is a treatment option for respiratory allergy that is complementary to pharmacotherapy, with a distinct mechanism of action. Alternative methods to subcutaneous administration of AIT that enable patients to safely self-administer AIT is considered an unmet clinical need. The sublingual immunotherapy tablet (SLIT-tablet) is an orally disintegrating pharmaceutical formulation (oral lyophilisate) containing standardized allergens. SLIT-tablets have been developed for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) of cedar-pollen, grass-pollen, ragweed-pollen, tree-pollen, and house dust mite allergies. It is a once-daily tablet treatment to be self-administered after the first dose has been provided under the supervision of a physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. Once the first dose is adequately tolerated, subsequent doses may be self-administered. SLIT-tablets have proven efficacy for allergic rhinitis (AR) with and without conjunctivitis (C) and allergic asthma (AA) in adults, children, and poly-sensitized allergic patients. Meta-analyses indicate that SLIT-tablets have superior or similar efficacy compared with anti-allergic pharmacotherapies for seasonal AR and superior efficacy for perennial AR. SLIT-tablets have also demonstrated clinically relevant improvements of asthma, with significant reductions in the following: daily inhaled corticosteroid use, risk of asthma exacerbations, and asthma symptoms. SLIT-tablets are generally well tolerated, with a low risk of systemic allergic reactions. The most common treatment-related adverse events are mild-moderate oral reactions. Current evidence supports SLIT-tablets to be considered as an alternative or add-on treatment to pharmacotherapy for AR/C and asthma. Future SLIT developments may include early intervention to prevent the development or progression of allergic disease in children.",

JAGL 2013 provides information on diagnosis by age group from infancy to puberty (0–15 years of age), treatment for acute exacerbations, long-term management by anti-inflammatory drugs, daily life guidance, and patient education to allow non-specialist physicians to refer to this guideline for routine medical treatment.

A management method, including step-up or step-down of long-term management drugs based on the status of asthma control levels, as in JAGL, is easy to understand, and thus the Guideline is suitable as a frame of reference for routine medical treatment. JAGL has also introduced treatment and management using a control test on children, recommending that the physician aim at complete control by avoiding exacerbation factors and by appropriate use of anti-inflammatory drugs.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with varying phenotypes and numerous risk factors. This condition results from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, and active smoking is one of these risk factors. The effects of aging should also be taken into account in these interactions. From an epidemiological standpoint, smokers and/or elderly patients with asthma are not small part in the total population with asthma. Furthermore, both smoking and aging are important risk factors for severe asthma. This review discusses the potential effects of smoking and aging on healthy subjects and patients with asthma, particularly from the perspective of inflammatory changes. First we show evidence that smokers and the elderly have increased neutrophil counts in their airways, which may have impacts on their clinical characteristics of elderly smokers with asthma. Secondly, on the basis of our recent findings on the interactions between smoking and aging in patients with asthma, we propose that IgE/eosinophilic inflammation should not be underestimated in elderly smokers with asthma, particularly those who are atopic. This review may expand our understanding of the effects of smoking and aging on asthma with a new perspective of an old issue.",

Then, IgE purified from many Liters of plasma, which had been donated from a patient with fatal myeloma, was distributed to researchers all over the world, and thus accelerated exploring the mechanisms involved in allergic reactions, particularly about the role of mast cells and basophils in the IgE-mediated reactions. Identification of mast cells as a progeny of a bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell in 1977 led us to successful in vitro culture of human mast cells. Along with the development of molecular biological techniques, the structure of the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) was determined in 1989. These findings and subsequent investigations brought deeper understanding of IgE-mediated allergic diseases in the past half century, especially where mast cells are involved. We have now even obtained the information about whole genome expression of FceRI-dependently activated mast cells. In sharp contrast to our comprehension of allergic diseases where IgE and mast cells are involved, the mechanisms involved in non-IgE-mediated allergic diseases or non-IgE-mediated phase of IgE-mediated diseases are almost left unsolved and are waiting for devoted investigators to reveal it.",

All 93 school nurses, 73 schoolteachers and 110 childcare workers participating in the study completed a questionnaire before and after the workshop. The SE of the participants was evaluated using an original 15-item questionnaire. Before the workshop, the SE of school nurses was the highest among the profession groups, and being involved with children prescribed an AAI was a common factor associated with a high SE. After the workshop, the SE increased in all groups, but most apparently in school nurses and those involved with children prescribed an AAI. The presence of an emergency plan was positively associated with the SE of schoolteachers only after the workshop, even though no such association existed beforehand. Practical instruction of school nurses and school personnel involved with children prescribed an AAI resulted in dramatic improvement of the SE.

    "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially aspirin, and food additives (FAs) may exacerbate allergic symptoms in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and food-dependent exercise- induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA). Augmentation of histamine release from human mast cells and basophils by those substances is speculated to be the cause of exacerbated allergic symptoms. We sought to investigate the mechanism of action of aspirin on IgE-mediated histamine release. The effects of NSAIDs, FAs or cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors on histamine release from human basophils concentrated by gravity separation were evaluated. Benzoate and tartrazine, which have no COX inhibitory activity, augmented histamine release from basophils similar to aspirin. In contrast, ibuprofen, meloxicam, FR122047 and NS-398, which have COX inhibitory activity, did not affect histamine release. These results indicate that the augmentation of histamine release by aspirin is not due to COX inhibition. It was observed that aspirin augmented histamine release from human basophils only when specifically activated by anti-IgE antibodies, but not by A23187 or formyl-methionyl-leucyl- phenylalanine. When the IgE receptor signaling pathway was activated, aspirin increased the phosphorylation of Syk. Moreover, patients with chronic urticaria and FDEIA tended to be more sensitive to aspirin as regards the augmentation of histamine release, compared with healthy controls. Aspirin enhanced histamine release from basophils via increased Syk kinase activation, and that the augmentation of histamine release by NSAIDs or FAs may be one possible cause of worsening symptoms in patients with chronic urticaria and FDEIA.",

Although multiple factors, including the genetic background, lifestyle and dietary habits, may account for the difference, the pathogenic mechanism of EoE has not been fully clarified in Japanese. To elucidate whether EoE's pathogenic mechanisms differ between those populations, we performed transcriptome analysis of esophageal biopsy specimens from Japanese EoE patients and compared the identified gene signatures with published microarray data for EoE patients in the US.We prospectively enrolled adult Japanese EoE patients (n = 4) according to the 2011 consensus guidelines for diagnosis of EoE. Age-matched healthy volunteer subjects (n = 4) were also enrolled as controls. We assessed the gene expression profiles of esophageal biopsies using microarray technology and then compared the identified gene signatures with earlier data generated in the US.Of 42,545 transcripts represented on the microarray, 385 were differentially expressed between the EoE and control samples (≥2 fold change and adjusted p-value of <0.05). Our microarray data showed strong overlapping with the data from US patients with EoE. An EoE-specific-transcript signature is typically composed of IL-13-inducible and eosinophil-related genes, including eotaxin-3/C-C chemokine ligand 26 (CCL26).This transcriptome study suggests that the pathogenetic mechanisms of EoE in Japan and Western countries are similar. Our findings may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of EoE and to more accurate diagnosis of this disease in Japanese individuals.",

    "abstract": "Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe adverse drug reaction characterized by necrosis of the epidermis. Its incidence is approximately 1 per million a year and average mortality rate is high at 25-50%. TEN has a flu-like prodrome, followed by atypical, targetoid erythematous or purpuric macules on the skin. These macules coalesce to form flaccid blisters that slough off as areas of epidermal necrosis. Drugs such as allopurinol, sulfonamides, and carbamazepine are the most common causes. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*15:02 in Asians being administered carbamazepine and the HLA-B*58:01 antigen in patients of all ethnicities being administered allopurinol are known to be high-risk factors. Rapid diagnosis, discontinuation of the causative drug, and supportive treatment are essential for better prognosis and improvement of sequelae. Till now, systemic corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins have been used as the most common active interventions; however, no gold standard has been established. In Japan, physicians follow a unique diagnostic criteria and treatment guideline to improve the diagnosis rate and streamline treatments. This may be a contributing factor for the lower mortality rate (14.3%). The efficacy of systemic corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, and plasmapheresis may have been beneficial as well. In Japan, TEN is defined as an epidermal detachment of over 10% of the body surface area (BSA), while the globally accepted definition established by Bastuji-Garin describes it as an epidermal detachment of over 30% of the BSA. In Japanese individuals, HLA-A*02:06, HLA-A*02:07, HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*51:01 may be linked to higher risks of TEN.",

Manifold trials were implemented; however, most of them failed to verify the effectiveness of their preventive measures. Recent advancement of epidemiological studies and cutaneous biology revealed epidermal barrier dysfunction plays a major role of allergen sensitization and development of atopic dermatitis which ignites the inception of allergy march. For this decade, therapeutic strategy to prevent the development of food allergy has been confronted with a paradigm shift from avoidance and delayed introduction of allergenic foods based on the theoretical concept to early introduction of them based on the clinical and epidemiological evidences. Especially, prevention of peanut allergy and egg allergy has been established with the highest evidence verified by randomized controlled trials, although application in clinical practice should be done with attention. This paradigm shift concerning food allergy was also due to the discovery of cutaneous sensitization risk of food allergens for an infant with eczema revealed by prospective studies. Here we have recognized the increased importance of prevention of eczema/atopic dermatitis in infancy. Two randomized controlled trials using emollients showed successful results in prevention of atopic dermatitis in infancy; however, longer term safety and prognosis including allergy march should be pursued. To establish more fundamental strategy for prevention of the development of allergy, further studies clarifying the mechanisms of interaction between barrier dysfunction and microbial milieu are needed with macroscope to understand the relationship between allergic diseases and a diversity of environmental influences.",

The levels of IgE Abs to crude DP, nDer p 1, rDer p 2, and rDer p 10 in patients who showed IAR (n = 41) were compared with those in patients who showed no IAR (n = 14).

The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for IgE to nDer p 1 and rDer p 2 as predictors of IAR were 0.913 and 0.906, respectively. The specificity of IgE to nDer p 1 and rDer p 2 was higher than IgE to crude DP even at low cut-off points. IgE to nDer p 1 and/or rDer p 2 was highly predictive of allergen-induced IAR.

    "abstract": "Allergic disorders commonly involve both chronic tissue inflammation and remodeling caused by immunological reactions to various antigens on tissue surfaces. Due to their anatomical location, vascular endothelial cells are the final responders to interact with various exogenous factors that come into contact with the epithelial surface, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and antigens. Recent studies have shed light on the important roles of endothelial cells in the development and exacerbation of allergic disorders. For instance, endothelial cells have the greatest potential to produce several key molecules that are deeply involved in allergic inflammation, such as periostin and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17). Additionally, endothelial cells were recently shown to be important functional targets for IL-33—an essential regulator of allergic inflammation. Notably, almost all endothelial cell responses and functions involved in allergic inflammation are not suppressed by corticosteroids. These corticosteroid-refractory endothelial cell responses and functions include TNF-α-associated angiogenesis, leukocyte adhesion, IL-33-mediated responses and periostin and TARC production. Therefore, these unique responses and functions of endothelial cells may be critically involved in the pathogenesis of various allergic disorders, especially their refractory processes. Here, we review recent studies, including ours, which have elucidated previously unknown pathophysiological roles of vascular endothelial cells in allergic inflammation and discuss the possibility of endothelium-targeted therapy for allergic disorders.",

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of Japanese cedar pollinosis in Japan is associated with a negative impact on the quality of life of patients, as well as significant loss of productivity among the workforce in early spring, thus representing a serious social problem. Furthermore, the prevalence is increasing, and has risen by more than 10% in this decade. Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 were identified as the major allergens in Japanese cedar pollen (JCP), and in 2004, the existence of other major and minor allergens were revealed by a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis. Allergenome analysis identified a chitinase, a lipid transfer protein, a serine protease, and an aspartic protease as novel IgE-reactive allergens in patients with JCP allergy. Thaumatin-like protein (Cry j 3) was shown to be homologous to Jun a 3, a major allergen from mountain cedar pollen. Isoflavone reductase-like protein was also characterized in a study of a JCP cDNA library. The characterization of component allergens is required to clarify the sensitizer or cross-reactive elicitor allergens for component-resolved diagnosis (CRD). Increasing evidence from numerous clinical trials indicates that CRD can be used to design effective allergen-specific immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the eight characterized JCP allergens and discuss the impact of CRD and characterization of novel allergens on allergen-specific immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common causes of chronic cough and often coexists with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, it is unknown whether there are differences in the effect of GERD on these diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the difference in the effect of GERD on cough-related quality of life and disease status in asthma and COPD in a real-world setting.Subjects were 132 patients with overall controlled asthma and 102 patients with stable COPD. They completed the frequency scale for symptoms of GERD (FSSG), a validated Japanese questionnaire for GERD, the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), and the Asthma Control Test (ACT) or COPD assessment test (CAT) questionnaires.We found that 29 (22.0%) patients with asthma and 22 (21.6%) patients with COPD had GERD. There was no difference in the FSSG scale between the diseases. The patients with GERD, regardless of having asthma or COPD, had lower LCQ scores affecting all health domains and lower ACT or higher CAT scores than those without GERD. Overall, the patients with COPD had lower LCQ scores regardless of the presence or absence of GERD. The FSSG scale was negatively correlated with the LCQ total score in asthma and in COPD. In contrast, the FSSG scale was positively correlated with the CAT score but not with the ACT score.Patients with GERD had impaired cough-related quality of life, poor asthma control or more symptoms and impacts of COPD.",

    "abstract": "Since the recognition of asthma as a syndrome with complex pathophysiological signs and symptoms, recent research has sought to classify asthma phenotypes based on its clinical and molecular pathological features. Psychological stress was first recognized as a potential immune system modulator of asthma at the end of the 19th century. The activation of the central nervous system (CNS) upon exposure to psychological stress is integral for the initiation of signal transduction processes. The stress hormones, including glucocorticoids, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, which are secreted following CNS activation, are involved in the immunological alterations involved in psychological stress-induced asthma exacerbation. The mechanisms underlying this process may involve a pathological series of events from the brain to the lungs, which is attracting attention as a conceptually advanced phenotype in asthma pathogenesis. This review presents insights into the critical role of psychological stress in the development and exacerbation of allergic asthma, with a special focus on our own data that emphasizes on the continuity from the central sensing of psychological stress to enhanced eosinophilic airway inflammation.",

However, these results were based on studies of subjects mainly characterized by high eosinophil counts, which may present as an obstacle for clarification in the identification of other factors associated with serum periostin levels. The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with serum periostin levels in healthy subjects. We also assessed some factors in asthmatic subjects to confirm their extrapolation for management of asthma. Serum periostin levels were measured in 230 healthy subjects. Clinical factors of interest included body mass index (BMI) and allergic rhinitis (AR). Additionally, we confirmed whether these factors were associated with serum periostin in 206 asthmatic subjects. We further evaluated several obesity-related parameters, such as abdominal fat distribution and adipocytokine levels. Smoking status, blood eosinophil count, total immunoglobulin E, and the presence of AR were associated with serum periostin in healthy subjects. There was a negative association between BMI and serum periostin in both healthy and asthmatic subjects, while there was a tendency of a positive association with AR in asthmatic subjects. There were no differential associations observed for subcutaneous and abdominal fat in relation to serum periostin in asthmatic subjects. Serum periostin was significantly associated with serum levels of adiponectin, but not with leptin. Our results provided clarity as to the factors associated with serum periostin levels, which could be helpful in the interpretation of serum periostin levels in clinical practice.",

Our aim was to assess the environmental factors associated with the prevalence of eczema among children using a web-based survey.In June 2012, we conducted a nation-wide web-based survey to identify the prevalence and characteristics of allergic diseases among Japanese children. The prevalence of allergic diseases including eczema was assessed using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood core questionnaire. The associations between eczema prevalence and environmental factors, as well as those between background characteristics and comorbid allergic diseases among 6-12 year old children were assessed.A total of 28,348 children were included in the analysis. The prevalence of current eczema was 13.0%. Current eczema was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of wheeze, rhinitis, and food allergy. In multiple logistic regression models, birth during autumn (aOR: 1.18 95%CI: 1.06-1.31) or winter (aOR: 1.21 95%CI: 1.08-1.34), duration of exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months (aOR: 1.14 95%CI: 1.06-1.23), and ownership of a pet from infancy (aOR: 2.61 95%CI: 1.68-4.07) were also associated with a higher prevalence of eczema.

    "abstract": "Many Japanese infants with food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) show eosinophilia, which has been thought to be a characteristic of food protein-induced proctocolitis (FPIP).To elucidate the characteristics of eosinophilia in Japanese FPIES patients, 113 infants with non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergy due to cow's milk were enrolled and classified into FPIES (n = 94) and FPIP (n = 19).The percentage of peripheral blood eosinophils (Eo) was increased in most FPIES patients (median, 7.5%), which was comparable with that in FPIP patients (9.0%). Among FPIES patients, Eo was the highest in patients who had vomiting, bloody stool, and diarrhea simultaneously (12.9%) and lowest in patients with diarrhea alone (3.2%). Eo showed a significant positive correlation with the incidence of vomiting (Cramer's V = 0.31, p < 0.005) and bloody stool (Cramer's V = 0.34, p < 0.0005). A significant difference was found in Eo between early- (≤10 days, n = 56) and late-onset (>10 days, n = 38) FPIES (median, 9.8% vs. 5.4%; p < 0.005). IL-5 production by peripheral blood T cells stimulated with cow's milk protein in early-onset FPIES was significantly higher than that in late-onset FPIES (67.7 pg/mL vs. 12.5 pg/mL, p < 0.01), and showed a significant positive correlation with Eo (rs = 0.60, p < 0.01).This study demonstrated two types of eosinophilia in Japanese FPIES infants: conspicuous and mild eosinophilia in early- and late-onset FPIES patients, respectively. Conspicuous eosinophilia in early-onset FPIES is suggested to be caused by abnormally high IL-5 production.",

We sought to determine the pathophysiological characteristics of IgG4-positive cells in sinonasal tissues in CRS, especially eosinophilic CRS (ECRS). IgG4-positive cells in uncinate tissues (UT) and nasal polyps (NP) were examined by immunohistochemistry. Associations between the number of IgG4-positive cells and clinicopathological factors were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the cut-off value of IgG4-positive cells in tissue that can predict the post-operative course. IgG4 was mainly expressed in infiltrating plasma and plasmacytoid cells, and the number of IgG4-positive cells was significantly higher in NP, especially those from severe ECRS patients, than in UT. In CRS patients, the number of IgG4-positive cells significantly and positively correlated with blood and tissue eosinophilia, radiological severity, and serum level of total IgE. The number of infiltrating IgG4-positive cells was significantly higher in patients with a poor post-operative course (sustained sinus shadow 6 months after surgery) than in those with a good one. The number of IgG4-positive cells in NP could discriminate patients with a good or a poor post-operative course (area under the curve: 0.769). Also, 73.3% sensitivity and 82.5% specificity were achieved when the cut-off value was set at 17 cells/high-power field. Our results suggest that the local expression of IgG4 on cells may be used as a biomarker that reflects the pathophysiology of CRS, including the post-operative course.",

We previously reported that recombinant fusion protein of murine IL-35 and human IgG1 Fc fragment (rIL-35) reduced Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) in vitro. However, it is unclear whether IL-35 can attenuate nasal allergic responses and symptoms of allergic rhinitis in vivo.To investigate the in vivo effect of IL-35 on allergic rhinitis in mice, mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA). Intranasal administration of rIL-35 and intranasal challenge of OVA were then performed. Nasal symptoms were estimated after the last nasal challenge. Nasal tissue and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) were collected. OVA-specific IgE in sera, OVA-specific T cell response, and the production of cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) stimulated by the OVA antigen were measured. The transcription level of Foxp3 and the frequency of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells were also measured.rIL-35 significantly inhibited the number of sneezes and nasal rubbing movements. It also reduced the number of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa and significantly decreased the level of OVA-specific IgE, the OVA-specific T cell proliferation, and the production of IL-4 and IL-5. Furthermore, rIL-35 significantly increased the production of IL-10, the transcription level of Foxp3, and the frequency of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.This study showed for the first time that rIL-35 inhibits nasal allergic responses and symptoms in mice, and that rIL-35 increases IL-10, Foxp3, and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in CLN. This study also suggests that intranasal administration of IL-35 can attenuate allergic rhinitis.",

The Japanese archipelago belongs to various climate categories due to its length from north to south which transverse the subarctic in the north to the subtropical in the south, suggesting substantial regional differences in dominant environmental allergens. However, few studies have assessed the regional differences in the prevalence of sensitization to environmental allergens.We requested three major clinical testing laboratories to provide us with summarized results of antigen-specific IgE-antibody (Ab) measurements. These measurements were collected for clinical purposes throughout Japan from 2002 through 2011. The prevalence of positivity for IgE-Ab against 19 environmental allergens was calculated for each prefecture in order to evaluate regional differences.Test data on specific IgE-Ab of 19,969,753 orders were analyzed. The prevalence of positivity for house dust mites was high and the regional difference was low, whereas apparent regional differences were found for pollen, insects, and fungi. The prevalence of positivity for Japanese cedar was low in Hokkaido and Okinawa, while those to alder was highest in Hokkaido. Higher prevalence for insects was observed in southern areas (Okinawa and prefectures in Kyusyu).Findings of this study clearly demonstrated regional differences in the prevalence of sensitization to environmental allergens in Japan and the study also provides useful information for the clinician when deciding which allergens should preferentially be measured for IgE-Ab after considering regional difference.",

In terms of sex, the prevalence of wheeze and rhino-conjunctivitis was higher in male PS while that of rhino-conjunctivitis and eczema was higher in female MS. In terms of prefecture, there was a two-fold difference in the prevalence of wheeze and eczema and a four-fold difference in the prevalence of rhino-conjunctivitis, with each disease showing different distribution patterns.We demonstrated the prevalence of allergic disease among PS and MS in 2015.

Allergic conjunctival diseases include allergic conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), and giant papillary conjunctivitis. In clinical practice of ACDs, an ocular allergy test using biomarker measurement is a crucial examination technique for diagnosing, evaluating severity, and determining the efficacy of medical treatment. The ocular allergy test includes the tear test for evaluating the concentration of biomarkers in tears and an ocular surface test for assessing the expression levels of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) biomarkers on the ocular surface. The clinical usefulness of several biomarkers has been demonstrated in patients with ACDs; specifically, eosinophil cationic protein and eotaxin-2 as eosinophilic inflammation biomarkers; interleukin-4 and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (CCL17/TARC) as Th2 inflammation biomarkers; eotaxin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and soluble IL-6 receptor as giant papillae biomarkers; and osteopontin and periostin as allergic inflammation and remodeling biomarkers. Furthermore, the ocular allergy test, quantitative evaluation methods using biomarkers have allowed for better understanding of the immunological and pathophysiological mechanisms of ACDs. Therefore, the search for a biomarker is important to make an ocular allergy test useful. In previous ocular allergy tests, the biomarkers for allergic inflammation in patients with chronic ACDs including VKC and AKC were substantial. However, the selection of biomarkers associated with the early phase reaction of immediate hypersensitivity and innate immunity responses needs to be addressed in future investigations.",

In the treatment for attacks, 82% of the patients were treated with the plasma-derived C1 inhibitor concentrate, and 69% of the patients reported experiencing a therapeutic effect.There is a long gap between first attack and diagnosis of HAE, and the number of non-treated attacks is high in Japan. Steps are needed to improve the diagnostic and treatment environments to address these issues.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced scleroderma-like lesion is a condition in which administration of a drug induces skin sclerotic lesions similar to systemic sclerosis or morphea. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced scleroderma-like lesion can be divided into two types: scleroderma-like lesions and morphea-like plaques. A wide variety of drugs can cause drug-induced scleroderma-like lesion. Bleomycin, L-tryptophan, vinyl chloride, and phytonadione (vitamin K1) have been reported, but in recent years, cases due to chemotherapeutic agents, such as taxane-based agents, gemcitabine, and tegafur-uracil, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have increased. Drug-induced scleroderma-like lesion differs from systemic sclerosis in that it does not include Raynaud's phenomenon, nail-fold capillary abnormality, organ involvement, such as reflux esophagitis, interstitial pneumonia, renal crisis, or anti-nuclear Abs. On the other hand, there are reports of cases in which Raynaud's phenomenon, positive conversion of anti-nuclear Abs, and development of skin sclerosis from the fingers developed after initiation of the drug. Whether the skin sclerosis improves after discontinuation of the drug depends on the patient. In patients with severe skin sclerosis, functional impairment, such as flexion contracture of the fingers, may occur, and systemic therapy, such as steroids, may be necessary. When treating patients with skin sclerosis, it is important to keep in mind the possibility that the sclerotic lesion may be induced by a drug.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicated the crucial role for interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling in the development of allergic asthma. Yet, the role of IL-6 signaling in toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced mixed granulocytic airway inflammation still remains unclear. Thus, the aims of this study were to dissect the role of IL-6 signaling and to evaluate the effect of tocilizumab on TDI-induced steroid-resistant asthma.TDI-induced asthma model was prepared and asthmatic mice were respectively given IL-6 monoclonal antibody, IL-6R monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab, 5 mg/kg, i.p. after each challenge) for therapeutic purposes or isotype IgG as control.TDI exposure just elevated IL-6R expression in the infiltrated inflammatory cells around the airway, but increased glycoprotein 130 expression in the whole lung, especially in bronchial epithelium. Moreover, TDI inhalation increased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to methacholine, coupled with mixed granulocytic inflammation, exaggerated epithelial denudation, airway smooth muscle thickening, goblet cell metaplasia, extensive submucosal collagen deposition, dysregulated Th2/Th17 responses, as well as innate immune responses and raised serum IgE. And almost all these responses except for raised serum IgE were markedly ameliorated by the administration of IL-6 neutralizing antibody or tocilizumab, but exhibited poor response to systemic steroid treatment. Also, TDI challenge induced nucleocytoplasm translocation of HMGB1 and promoted its release in the BALF, as well as elevated lung level of STAT3 phosphorylation, which were inhibited by anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-6R treatment.Our data suggested that IL-6 monoclonal antibody and tocilizumab might effectively abrogate TDI-induced airway inflammation and remodeling, which could be used as a clinical potential therapy for patients with severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Systemic autoimmune diseases are reportedly associated with a high frequency of drug allergies. In particular, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) have recently drawn attention. Based on previous reports, drug allergies have been reported in 17.1-63%, 7-40.1%, and 17.6-54% of patients with SS, SLE, and AOSD patients, respectively. Antimicrobial agents, including sulfa drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are the most common causative agents of drug allergies. However, few studies have examined in detail the relationship between drug eruptions, a major symptom of drug allergy, and systemic autoimmune diseases, and their actual status remains unclear. These autoimmune diseases commonly exhibit a diverse range of skin manifestations in the course of these diseases, rendering it may be difficult to determine whether it is a true drug eruption. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), a fatal, severe drug eruption, has also been associated with autoimmune diseases. The development of SS-like symptoms after SJS/TEN onset and high prevalence of anti-SS-A antibodies in SJS/TEN are intriguing observations. Although the presence of SLE is known to be a risk factor for SJS/TEN, common pathological conditions, such as excessive immune status, abnormal function of regulatory T cells, and neutrophil extracellular traps in autoimmune diseases such as SS and SLE, are potentially involved in the development of drug eruptions.",

Chronic eosinophilic airway/lung diseases including chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis, eosinophilic bronchitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis share clinical features with eosinophilic asthma and CRPwNP, which are mostly adult-onset and may develop simultaneously or consecutively. These eosinophilic airway/lung diseases respond well to initial treatment with systemic corticosteroids, but often recur when the corticosteroids are tapered. The management of these \"refractory\" cases is an unmet need for clinicians. We first reviewed the standard treatments for these chronic eosinophilic airway/lung diseases, followed by the definition and prevalence of refractory diseases and the role of biologics in their management. The available evidence varies from case reports and case series to randomized control trials, depending on the type of disease; however, these studies provide not only a direction for clinical practice, but also insights into the pathophysiology of each disease. Physicians should discuss the efficacy and costs of biologics in patients with refractory eosinophilic airway/lung diseases to minimize not only the current symptoms, but future risks as well.",

    "abstract": "Although eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) has been considered as a single disease entity belonging to anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, several studies have suggested that in addition to the mechanisms associated with ANCA, those associated with eosinophils play a vital role in tissue damage. Nevertheless, the morphological bases underlying eosinophil-associated lesions have not been completely elucidated.We investigated the electron microscopic findings of sural nerve biopsy specimens obtained from 18 patients with EGPA by focusing on the behavior of eosinophils, particularly the mode of secretion.Eosinophils tended to be located at sites close to endothelial cells within the lumina of epineurial small vessels. Attachment of eosinophils to endothelial cells was observed, particularly at the junction between neighboring endothelial cells, and some of these eosinophils appeared to escape from the vascular lumen to migrate into the extravascular interstitium. Furthermore, we observed eosinophil degranulation via piecemeal degranulation and cytolysis. Degranulating eosinophils were identified in both intravascular and extravascular compartments. Some of the small vessels appeared to be occluded by numerous eosinophils, and eosinophils attached by platelets were also observed, suggesting that coagulopathy occurs in EGPA.Both extravascular and intravascular eosinophils can induce tissue damage unrelated to classical necrotizing vasculitis associated with ANCA in patients with EGPA. Further research is necessary to elucidate the molecular basis of the induction of these fine structural changes, which will contribute to the development of targeted therapies based on specific mechanisms of eosinophil-related diseases.",

Therefore, we evaluated the association between atopic dermatitis (AD) and neurodevelopmental dysfunction in children.We analyzed 2,395,966 children born between 2008 and 2012 in Korea. All data were acquired from the databases of the Korean National Health Insurance System. AD was defined as five or more diagnoses before age 24 months. The outcome was suspected neurodevelopmental dysfunction in the gross motor skill, fine motor skill, cognition, language, sociality, and self-care domains of the Korean Developmental Screening Test for Infants and Children at age 6 years. The positive control outcome was defined as attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). The associations were assessed using ordinal logistic regression, adjusting for asthma and allergic rhinitis.Among the eligible children, 89,452 and 30,557 were allocated to the control and AD groups, respectively. In the weighted data, the AD group showed a higher risk of suspected neurodevelopmental dysfunction in the total score (weighted adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] 1.10 [1.05-1.16]), gross motor skills (1.14 [1.04-1.25]), and fine motor skills (1.15 [1.06-1.25]) than the control group. The AD with steroids or hospitalization groups showed an increased risk of suspected neurodevelopmental dysfunction. In addition, the AD group showed a significant association with mental retardation, psychological development disorder, and behavioral and emotional disorders as well as ADHD.AD before age 2 years may be associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental dysfunction including gross and fine motor skills in the young childhood period.",

The drug classification was based on the Japanese Standard Commodity Classification.There were 16,916 cases of anaphylaxis reported during the study period. Among them, 418 fatalities were registered. The incidence of drug-induced anaphylaxis and fatal cases was 1.03 cases/year per 100,000 population and 0.03 cases/year, respectively.

    "abstract": "Poorly controlled asthma is especially common in low resource countries. Aside from lack of access to, or poor technique with, inhaled beta-2 agonists and corticosteroids, the most problematic forms of asthma are frequently associated with both fungal allergy and exposure, especially in adults leading to more asthma exacerbations and worse asthma. The umbrella term 'fungal asthma' describes many disorders linked to fungal exposure and/or allergy to fungi. One fungal asthma endotype, ABPA, is usually marked by a very high IgE and its differential diagnosis is reviewed. Both ABPA and fungal bronchitis in bronchiectasis are marked by thick excess airway mucus production. Dermatophyte skin infection can worsen asthma and eradication of the skin infection improves asthma. Exposure to fungi in the workplace, home and schools, often in damp or water-damaged buildings worsens asthma, and remediation improves symptom control and reduces exacerbations. Antifungal therapy is beneficial for fungal asthma as demonstrated in nine of 13 randomised controlled studies, reducing symptoms, corticosteroid need and exacerbations while improving lung function. Other useful therapies include azithromycin and some biologics approved for the treatment of severe asthma. If all individuals with poorly controlled and severe asthma could be 'relieved' of their fungal allergy and infection through antifungal therapy without systemic corticosteroids, the health benefits would be enormous and relatively inexpensive, improving the long term health of over 20 million adults and many children. Antifungal therapy carries some toxicity, drug interactions and triazole resistance risks, and data are incomplete. Here we summarise what is known and what remains uncertain about this complex topic.",

HDM-SCIT for asthma is indicated in cases of HDM-sensitized allergic asthma with normal lung function. HDM-SCIT improves asthma symptoms and AHR, and decreases the medication dose. Importantly, AIT can improve other allergic diseases complicated by asthma, such as allergic rhinitis, which can also contribute to the improvement of asthma symptoms. Several studies have suggested that HDM-SLIT also attenuates the risk of asthma exacerbations, and improves lung function in asthma cases with allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, AIT can modify the natural course of allergic diseases, including asthma. For example, the effects of AIT are maintained for at least several years after treatment discontinuation. AIT can prevent the onset of asthma when introduced in allergic rhinitis, and can also inhibit or reduce new allergen sensitizations. Recent data have suggested that AIT may suppress non-targeted allergen-induced immune responses in addition to targeted allergen-induced responses, and suppress infections of the lower respiratory tract by enhancing IFN responses.",

In addition to the potential for severe allergic reactions from accidental ingestion, food allergies impose a significant burden on the quality of life, nutrition, cost of living, and social activities of both those afflicted and their caregivers. Strict avoidance of allergens and use of emergency medications to treat allergic reactions are the traditional management and treatment strategies; however, significant progress has been made in recent years toward better treatment of food allergies. Many clinical trials on food allergen immunotherapy (oral, epicutaneous, and sublingual) have revealed its efficacy in increasing reaction thresholds and desensitization. These positive results led to the first FDA approval of peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT). However, safer and more effective approaches are required, and adjunct treatments and allergen modifications are being considered. More than 100 facilities in Japan conduct OIT, and numerous studies on it have been reported. Unlike in Europe and the US, stepwise oral food challenges with dietary guidance are conducted separately from the OIT.

However, few studies have investigated the effect of topical application of AP-1 inhibitors in treating inflammatory skin disorders. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to detect phosphorylated AP-1/c-Jun expression of skin lesions in AD patients. In the in vivo study, 1 % T-5224 ointment was topically applied for 8 days to the ears of 2,4 dinitrofluorobenzene challenged AD-like dermatitis model mice. Baricitinib, a conventional therapeutic agent Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, was also topically applied. In the in vitro study, human epidermal keratinocytes were treated with T-5224 and stimulated with AD-related cytokines. AP-1/c-Jun was phosphorylated at skin lesions in AD patients. In vivo, topical T-5224 application inhibited ear swelling (P < 0.001), restored filaggrin (Flg) expression (P < 0.01), and generally suppressed immune-related pathways. T-5224 significantly suppressed Il17a and l17f expression, whereas baricitinib did not. Baricitinib suppressed Il4, Il19, Il33 and Ifnb expression, whereas T-5224 did not. Il1a, Il1b, Il23a, Ifna, S100a8, and S100a9 expression was cooperatively downregulated following the combined use of T-5224 and baricitinib. In vitro, T-5224 restored the expression of FLG and loricrin (LOR) (P < 0.05) and suppressed IL33 expression (P < 0.05) without affecting cell viability and cytotoxicity. Topical T-5224 ameliorates clinical manifestations of AD-like dermatitis in mice. The effect of this inhibitor is amplified via combined use with JAK inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The detection of drug-specific activation of T cells in the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) is mainly based on cell proliferation or cytokine secretion. However, the LTT presents with a varying sensitivity and specificity. The aim of our study was to analyse the genome wide gene expression of PBMC to identify drug allergy-specific gene regulation patterns. Additionally, gene expression differences related to the allergy-inducing drug or the type of allergy (immediate/delayed) were investigated. Blood samples from 40 patients with allergy to different drugs and from 40 non-drug-allergic controls were recruited. PBMC were isolated and stimulated with the culprit drug (\"LTT-platform\"). Transcriptome analyses of PBMC were conducted after 3.5 days. The concentration of IFN-γ and IL-5 in the culture supernatants was measured by ELISA after 6 days. The transcriptome analyses revealed an allergy type and drug-specific gene regulation in PBMC from patients. Importantly, in the corresponding control groups these genes were barely or even opposingly regulated. It was also shown that in particular cefuroxime exerted a strong effect on the gene regulation in PBMC. Quantitative RT-PCR of selected genes identified by the transcriptome analyses revealed that CCL17, CISH and CD25 were specifically upregulated in patients. Notably, a strong upregulation of CCL17, CISH or CD25 did not necessarily correlate with the ELISA outcome of the patients and controls. Our results could be helpful for the identification of one or a panel of regulated genes considering patient specific parameters like the type of the allergy-inducing drug.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD), a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disorder, is characterized by compromised skin barrier and heightened immune responses. The study investigates the therapeutic efficacy of catestatin (CST), a chromogranin A-derived antimicrobial peptide, in mitigating AD-like symptoms. Utilizing both keratinocyte cultures and a C57BL/6 mouse model, we examined CST's impact on skin barrier proteins, tight junction (TJ) integrity, inflammatory cytokines, and AD-like symptoms. CST administration led to a significant upregulation of skin barrier proteins and improved TJ function, counteracting the negative effects of Th2 cytokines on these parameters. In a 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced AD mouse model, CST treatment markedly reduced AD-like symptoms, including ear thickness, transepidermal water loss, and scratching behavior, and normalized barrier protein expression and TJ barrier function. Furthermore, CST was found to interact with the Notch1 receptor, activating the Notch1/PKC pathway, which may underlie its skin barrier-enhancing properties. Collectively, these findings suggest CST as a promising therapeutic agent for AD, capable of enhancing skin barrier function, modulating immune responses, and targeting the Notch1/PKC pathway, offering a novel approach to AD treatment focusing on barrier restoration and immune modulation.",

This study aimed to assess (i) the differential impact of allergic rhinitis symptoms on work performance, assessed by means of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) work; and (ii) the effect of asthma comorbidity on work productivity. We assessed data from the MASK-air mHealth app of patients with allergic rhinitis. We identified factors associated with the impact of allergic symptoms on work productivity through multivariable linear mixed effects models. We studied 260,378 days from 20,724 patients. In multivariable regression models, nasal symptoms showed the strongest association with VAS work (regression coefficient = 0.38 [95%CI = 0.38; 0.38]). Poor rhinitis control, measured by the combined symptom-medication score, was associated with worse VAS work (regression coefficient = 0.96 [95%CI = 0.96; 0.97]). The median VAS work in patients with probable or possible asthma (median = 9, interquartile range = 22 for probable and 23 for possible asthma) was greater than for patients with no evidence of asthma (median = 3, interquartile range = 12) (Cohen's d = 0.60). In patients with probable asthma, nasal and asthma symptoms showed a similar impact on work productivity (regression coefficient for VAS nose = 0.32 [95%CI = 0.31; 0.32]; regression coefficient for VAS asthma = 0.30 [95%CI = 0.29; 0.31]). Allergy symptoms, especially nasal symptoms, are associated with worse work productivity. In addition, patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma display more impairment in work productivity than patients with allergic rhinitis alone.",

    "abstract": "Basophils are the rarest granulocytes and play diverse roles, e.g., in protective immunity and allergic inflammatory reactions. However, the underlying molecules and mechanisms involved in basophil differentiation and functions, particularly in humans, remain largely unknown. This may be due to the lack of high-quality research tools. We established a novel, immortalized, human basophil cell line by introducing human papillomavirus 16-E6/E7, c-MYC, and BCL-xL gene expression systems into cultured basophils, and evaluated whether this cell line is useful as a research tool, compared with KU812, which is the most commonly-used human basophil cell line. This cell line expressed various basophil markers, including CD123, CD203c, and the high-affinity immunoglobulin (Ig)E receptor α-chain and can mature into more differentiated cells under specific culture conditions. The differentiated cells stimulated with anti-IgE antibodies showed increased CD203c expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the differentiated KU812 cells showed little activation after the stimulation. The established cell line also demonstrated increased sensitivity to allergic activation when stimulated with an allergen (NP-BSA) and allergen-specific IgE (anti-NP-IgE). Furthermore, histamine- and interleukin-4-releasing abilities were also confirmed. These allergic activation profiles were similar to those of basophils from healthy individuals, although the activation levels of the established cells were lower than those of basophils from highly-sensitive individuals. These findings suggest that the established basophil cell line has substantially different characteristics from a conventional cell line and could serve as a new tool for investigating basophil differentiation and functions, as well as for testing allergic reactions.",

The sensitivity of the association of specific HLA alleles with drug eruptions ranges from approximately 50 to 100%, indicating a significant influence of HLA alleles on the risk of developing such reactions. Consequently, HLA testing holds substantial clinical potential as a genetic diagnostic tool to avoid drug eruptions. For instance, when prescribing drugs like carbamazepine and lamotrigine, which are known to cause severe drug eruptions, preemptive HLA genetic testing can help predict an individual's risk. This approach enables clinicians to reduce the overall incidence of drug eruptions by selecting alternative therapeutic agents or adjusting dosages based on the results of HLA genetic testing.",

    "abstract": "Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are acute inflammatory disorders that affect the skin and mucous membranes, and in 40-84 % of SJS/TEN cases, the ocular complications that are often overlooked due to severe systemic symptoms. Specific ocular findings at the acute-phase include conjunctival hyperemia, pseudomembrane formation, and epithelial defects, and severe acute-phase ocular involvement strongly correlates with long-term visual impairment. Thus, it is vital to diagnose ocular involvement early at the acute stage and suppress inflammation on the ocular surface to protect corneal epithelial stem cells. As outlined in the official Japanese treatment guidelines for SJS/TEN cases with ocular involvement, corticosteroid pulse therapy and topical application of 0.1 % betamethasone eye-drops within four days of disease onset significantly reduces ocular sequelae. Early intervention with amniotic membrane transplantation helps reduce scarring and potential loss of vision. As for genetic-related factors, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and cold medications are major triggers for SJS/TEN with severe ocular complications, with genetic predispositions involving TLR3 and prostaglandin E receptor 3 (subtype EP3) contributing to disease susceptibility. These genetic-environment interactions influence disease onset and progression. At chronic phase, severe dry eye and visual impairment are major long-term sequelae, and both surgical and non-surgical interventions have been applied to obtain favorable long-term treatment outcomes. In summary, early ophthalmic intervention is critical in preventing SJS/TEN-related ocular sequelae, and further research into genetic and immunological mechanisms is essential for better diagnosis and treatment.",

However, standard scRNA-seq provides only static cellular snapshots, obscuring dynamic processes that unfold temporally, such as differentiation, reprogramming, and disease progression. RNA Velocity, introduced in 2018, offers a groundbreaking solution. By leveraging unspliced pre-mRNA and spliced mRNA information, RNA Velocity models infer instantaneous gene expression change rates and effectively predict future transcriptional states over hour-long timescales. This review charts the evolution of this powerful concept, beginning with foundational principles and mathematical models of transcriptional dynamics. We explore Velocyto's pioneering implementation, discuss successes and limitations, and then examine second-generation advanced computational tools that generalize the framework, including scVelo, dynamo, and CellRank. A dedicated section highlights growing applications in allergy and immunology research, where these methods reveal novel disease mechanisms in asthma, atopic dermatitis, and chronic inflammation by analyzing immune cell differentiation and state transitions. We explored modern frontiers, including RNA Velocity integration with spatial and multimodal data, and the latest deep learning-based methods. Finally, we addressed the current challenges and remaining limitations of RNA Velocity analysis, offering insights into best practices and future directions. Throughout, we emphasize applications to allergic and immune-mediated diseases-including asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prurigo nodularis-to guide researchers and clinicians in allergy and immunology. RNA Velocity is becoming indispensable for navigating the complex, dynamic cellular world and transforming our understanding of temporal biological processes from static observations to predictive, dynamic insights that illuminate cellular fate decisions and disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Allergic diseases are characterized by heterogeneity driven by complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Conventional classifications based solely on clinical phenotypes often fails to capture the underlying molecular diversity, thereby limiting therapeutic precision and patient outcomes. Integrative omics-encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics-has emerged as a powerful approach to redefine disease mechanisms and advance precision medicine. By integrating high-dimensional molecular data with clinical phenotyping, omics approaches enable the identification of disease endotypes, biomarker discovery, and patient stratification. This review highlights recent developments in clinical-omics integration, with a focus on atopic dermatitis (AD) as a prototypical allergic disease. Drawing from our studies, we illustrate how tissue-level transcriptomic profiling, combined with unbiased computational analysis, can uncover immunological heterogeneity and treatment-response patterns in AD. Additional examples in asthma and food allergy demonstrate how integrated multi-omics can uncover gene-environment interactions and elucidate mechanisms behind disease severity and health disparities. We also address practical and ethical challenges in data harmonization, privacy, and interoperability, and underscore the critical role of computational methods and infrastructure development in enabling clinically meaningful interpretation. Importantly, successful translation of multi-omics data into clinical practice requires iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration between clinicians, data scientists, and basic researchers. By bridging molecular complexity and clinical heterogeneity, integrative omics is reshaping the landscape of allergy research. As technologies evolve, this framework will be crucial for developing predictive models and personalized therapeutic strategies, ultimately bringing us closer to individualized, data-driven care in allergic diseases.",

It is a distinct entity, as determined from all classifications of systemic vasculitis. The poor prognostic factors in CSS are renal insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, severe gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and central nervous systems (CNS) involvement. The initial management of CSS should include a high dose of a corticosteroid: prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day or its equivalent for methylprednisolone with tapering over 6 months. In patients with severe or rapidly progressing CSS, the administration of methylprednisolone pulse at 1 g/body/day for 3 days is recommended. When corticosteroid therapy does not induce remission, or when patients have poor prognostic factors, immunosuppressive cytotoxic therapy is indicated. However, some patients with severe CSS often show resistance to conventional treatment. We think that IVIG therapy is a hopeful candidate for second-line treatment for CSS patients, particularly in the case of neuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy, which are resistant to conventional therapy. However, there is not much evidence supporting the effectiveness of IVIG in CSS, and the mechanisms underlying the action of IVIG remain unclear. Now we are performing clinical trials of IVIG therapy for CSS patients who are resistant to conventional treatment, through a nationwide double-blinded placebo-controlled study in Japan.",

    "abstract": "Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), a severe form of ocular allergic disease, is characterized by the formation of giant papillae at the upper tarsal conjunctiva and corneal lesions that threaten vision. Recent evidence indicates that resident fibroblasts function as immune modulators in the pathogenesis of the chronic allergic inflammation associated with VKC. The T helper 2 (Th2) cell-derived cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 stimulate the migration and proliferation of conjunctival fibroblasts as well as protecting these cells from apoptotic cell death, effects that likely underlie the hyperplasia of fibroblasts that contributes to the formation of giant papillae. Conjunctival fibroblasts also synthesize extracellular matrix proteins and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases as well as down-regulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases in response to these cytokines, effects that likely contribute to the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix that is characteristic of giant papillae. Stimulation of fibroblasts in the corneal stroma with the combination of a proinflammatory cytokine and either IL-4 or IL-13 results in up-regulation of the expression of the chemokine eotaxin and thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine as well as of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, which together mediate the infiltration and activation of eosinophils and Th2 cells. Fibroblasts therefore appear to play a central role in the induction and amplification of ocular allergic inflammation and the consequent development of giant papillae and corneal disorders in individuals with VKC. Fibroblasts and fibroblast-derived factors thus represent new and potentially important therapeutic targets for treatment of the giant papillae and corneal disorders associated with VKC.",

Delayed-type allergic mechanisms have been postulated to underlie these reactions. The tests most widely used to detect T-cell sensitization to drugs are the patch test and the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT), but their sensitivity is not sufficient. Simultaneous assessment of both the frequencies and the cytokine-producing phenotypes of allergen-specific T cells has become possible with the recently introduced carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) assay.Seven patients who presented with phenytoin-induced maculopapular exanthema with and without fever were included in this study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were labeled with CFSE and cultured with phenytoin for seven days. The cells were stained with anti-CD4 and cytokine-specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), and analyzed with FACSCalibur.The phenytoin-specific proliferation of CD4+ cells in patients was significantly higher than in the four controls exposed to phenytoin, and in seven healthy children with no previous phenytoin intake. A significant difference in the percentages of CD4+ IFN-gamma+ cells between patients and the seven healthy children was observed. The sensitivity and specificity of proliferation were 100% and 90.9%, and those of IFN-gamma secretion were 71.4% and 100%, respectively.Phenytoin-specific proliferation may be detected with greater sensitivity by the CFSE dilution assay than the conventional LTT. The assay revealed that both CD4+ and CD4- T cells proliferated and produced IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha after stimulation with phenytoin. The CFSE dilution assay might be useful for the diagnosis and understanding of drug hypersensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Psychological stress has long been recognized to be associated with asthma symptoms. There appear to be individual differences in the susceptibility to even the same kind of stress, and furthermore, stress responses are different between the types of the stress, acute and chronic, even in the same person. However, the mechanisms linking stress to asthma are not well defined. Psychological stress upregulates the expression of endogenous opioids. The opioids stimulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic and adrenomedullary system, through the activation of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) to release stress hormones, such as cortisol and catecholamines, respectively. These hormones can modulate immune responses via the induction of Th1 immunity. Female BALB/c and C57BL/6, wild and MOR-deficient, mice sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) were exposed to OVA with or without either acute or chronic restraint stress. Airway inflammation was evaluated by the measurement of the number of inflammatory cells and cytokine contents in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. In BALB/c mice, but not in C57BL/6 mice, the number of total cells, eosinophils and lymphocytes in the acute stress group were significantly decreased compared with those in the non-acute stress group. In contrast, chronic stress significantly increased the cell numbers and the contents of IL-4 and IL-5 in both mouse strains. Furthermore, these exacerbations were abolished in MOR-deficient mice. These results suggest that acute stress modifies the allergic airway responses distinctively depending on the genetic background, and MOR is involved in the chronic psychological stress-induced exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) is a distinct form of common food allergy characteristically induced by a combination of causative food ingestion and physical exercise. Recent investigations have documented that aspirin consumption, in place of exercise, also induces allergic symptoms. A 63-year-old man began low dose aspirin therapy on September 2005. Since January 2006, he had repeated episodes of generalized urticaria and lost consciousness while he was exercising after eating wheat. He was strongly positive for ω-5 gliadin in a cap-system fluorescent enzyme immunoassay. Therefore, a diagnosis of wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis was made. Patients with aspirin-provoked FDEIA have been reported previously as taking ordinary doses of aspirin for reducing pain, inflammation and fever. However, in our patient, low dose aspirin therapy for reducing cardiovascular risk possibility induced FDEIA. Growing numbers of elderly people take low doses of aspirin for prevention of cerebral or myocardial infarction. Therefore, physicians should remember that aspirin consumption, even at low doses, is a risk factor for FDEIA.",

    "abstract": "Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing multinuclear polykaryons essential for bone remodeling, formed through cell fusion of mononuclear macrophage/monocyte lineage precursor cells upon stimulation by the RANK/RANKL system. Recent studies have revealed that a family of tetraspanin proteins, such as CD9, is critically involved in the cell fusion/polykaryon formation of these cell types. Until now, however, there is limited knowledge about the types of tetraspanins expressed in osteoclasts and their precursors. The expression of different tetraspanin proteins in a monocyte/macrophage-lineage osteoclast precursor cell line, RAW264.7, was cyclopedically investigated using RT-PCR with specific primers and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The function of two kinds of tetraspanins, Tspan-5 and NET-6, whose expression pattern was altered by RANKL stimulation, was examined by transfecting gene-specific short-interfering RNAs into these cell types. Of the 17 tetraspanins in mammalian hematopoietic cells, RAW264.7 cells express mRNA for 12 different kinds of tetraspanins, namely, CD9, CD37, CD53, CD63, CD81, CD82, CD151, NAG-2, NET-6, SAS, Tspan-3, and Tspan-5. Interestingly, during their maturation into osteoclasts upon RANKL stimulation, the transcript for Tspan-5 is up-regulated, whereas that for NET-6 is down-regulated. Targeted inhibition of Tspan-5 by using gene-specific RNA interference suppressed RANKL-induced cell fusion during osteoclastogenesis, whereas inhibition of NET-6 augmented the osteoclastogenesis itself. These results suggest that Tspan-5 and NET-6 have a reciprocal function during osteoclastogenesis, i.e., positive and negative regulation by Tspan-5 and NET-6, respectively. RANKL regulates osteoclastogenesis by altering the balances of these tetraspanin proteins. These data indicate that a diversity of tetraspanins is expressed in osteoclast precursors, and that cell fusion during osteoclastogenesis is regulated by cooperation of distinct tetraspanin family proteins such as Tspan-5 and NET-6. This study indicates that functional alterations of tetraspanin family proteins may have therapeutic potential in diseases where osteoclasts play a major role, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis.",

The incidence of atopic dermatitis has dramatically increased during the past three decades in industrialized countries. We attempted to develop an improved method to induce an animal model of atopic dermatitis and to use it to evaluate the efficacy of a Tec family kinase inhibitor. We treated dermatitis-prone inbred mice, NC/Nga, by repetitive epicutaneous applications of a house dust mite allergen and staphylococcal enterotoxin B to induce atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions. We established a highly efficient protocol to induce skin lesions in NC/Nga mice, which were histologically and immunologically similar to human atopic dermatitis. Similar to human patients, serum IgE levels were increased in dermatitis-induced mice. Consistent with the proposed roles of infiltrated immune cells in the pathogenesis of human atopic dermatitis, skin lesions were treatable with terreic acid, an inhibitor of Tec family kinases, as well as dexamethasone. We established a highly efficient, highly reproducible protocol to induce skin lesions in NC/Nga mice and successfully applied it to show the efficacy of terreic acid in treating skin lesions. This mouse model of atopic dermatitis will be useful to study the pathogenetic processes of atopic dermatitis and to evaluate the efficacy of drug candidates.",

We hypothesized that increased smooth muscle bundles in the airway walls would disrupt airway lymphatics to impair airway clearance in these fatal asthmatics. The autopsy lungs of seven fatal asthmatics (three Type I, four Type II asthmatics) and five controls were examined by immunohistochemistry to reveal the lymphatics distributed in the airway walls. The total area of lymphatics around each cross-sectioned airway was measured and its airway radius was calculated using an image analyzer system. Finally, the distribution areas of lymphatics in the same level of airways of bronchial trees were compared among Type I, Type II asthmatics and controls. The total area of airway lymphatics in each lung was found to be positively correlated with the airway radius (R). The distribution areas of lymphatics in larger airways (1.5 < R < 2.0 mm) of both types of asthmatics were significantly decreased than controls, and Type I asthmatics contained much less lymphatics than Type II asthmatics in these airways. The lymphatics around smaller airways (0.5 < R < 1.0 mm) were also reduced in both phenotypes of asthmatics without statistic difference between them. The airway lymphatics of these fatal asthmatics were observed to be interrupted by thickened muscle bundle layers, and by fibrotic tissues developed around these airways as well. These results indicate that distribution of lymphatics were decreased in the airway walls of fatal asthmatics which contained muscle bundles and fibro-connective tissues both of which were augmented in these airway walls to disrupt lymphatics, impair airway clearance and accelerate mucosal edema which would cause refractory status of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is the most common chronic diseases in school-aged children in Japan. It is important to consider health-related quality of life (QoL) among children with chronic diseases when treatment decisions are made. A school-based survey was conducted in randomly selected public schools in Tokyo by using a KINDL® questionnaire for evaluating QoL and the international study of asthma and allergy on childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, which is designed for comparing the asthma prevalence in various countries, from May to June in 2005. We recruited approximately 10% of the total children 6–7-years-old and 13–14-years-old living in Tokyo for sampling. Response rate of this questionnaire was 86% (22,645 children) in the 6–7-year-old group and 64% (12,879 children) in the 13–14-year-old group. Comparing asthmatics with non-asthmatics in the same age, QoL of children with asthma was significantly impaired. The severity of QoL of children with asthma was significantly impaired. QoL of children with exercise-induced asthma (EIA) were more significantly impaired than ones without EIA and showed lower scores in the categories of physical functioning, emotional and school activities than those without EIA. Of note, QoL was more impaired in the EIA-positive group among severe asthmatics, suggesting that QoL of children with even severe asthma could be improved when EIA is appropriately controlled. Existence of EIA among asthmatic children most strongly impairs their QoL. We should be more cautious about the management of EIA.",

The aim of this study is to clarify the association of quality of life with the severity of asthma, perceived stress, and other factors such as the comorbidity of allergic diseases among young adults with asthma. The study participants were 695 asthma patients, aged 20-44 years, from 29 medical centers in Japan. We excluded from the analysis of the result of the study 116 patients with complications of serious diseases, cough-variant asthma or aspirin-intolerant asthma. The patients completed the 8-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8), the Airways Questionnaire 20 (AQ20), and the Japanese version of the Perceived Stress Scale (JPSS) and their doctors also provided clinical information including diagnosis, complications, severity of asthma, and results of pulmonary function and immunological tests. There was a weak correlation between the generic quality of life (SF-8) and the disease-specific quality of life (AQ20). The AQ 20 revealed almost no association with the results of pulmonary function and immunological tests, and only a slight association with comorbidity of allergic rhinitis and food allergy. The AQ20 showed a moderate relation with perceived stress (JPSS) but a weak association with the severity of asthma. The multiple logistic models demonstrated that there was no relationship between the severity of asthma and the AQ20 in females, and in the age group of 20-34 years. A major variable related to the disease-specific quality of life was perceived stress, followed by the severity of asthma. Stress management of patients with asthma may improve their quality of life.",

    "abstract": "As the key molecule of type-I-hypersensitivity, IgE provides specificity for the allergen and links it to the allergic effector functions. Antibodies are secreted by plasma cells and their precursors, the plasma blasts. The fate of plasma cells is a subject of controversy, with respect to their lifetime and persistence in the absence of allergen. In general, plasma cells were for a long time considered as short-lived end products of B-cell differentiation, and many of them are short-lived, although already for more than 20 years evidence has been provided that IgE-secreting plasma cells can persist over months. Today long-lived, \"memory\" plasma cells are considered to represent a distinct cellular entity of immunological memory, with considerable therapeutic relevance. Long-lived plasma cells resist current therapeutic and experimental approaches such as immunosuppression, e.g. cyclophosphamide, steroids, X-ray irradiation, anti-CD20 antibodies and anti-inflammatory drugs, while the chronic generation of short-lived plasma cells is sensitive to conventional immunosuppression. The seasonal variation in pollen-specific IgE can be suppressed by immunotherapy, indicating that component of the IgE response, which is stimulated with pollen allergen is susceptible to suppression. Targeting of the remaining long-lived, allergen-specific plasma cells, providing the stable IgE-titers, represents a therapeutic challenge. Here we discuss recent evidence suggesting, why current protocols for the treatment of IgE-mediated allergies fail: Memory plasma cells generated by inhalation of the allergen become long-lived and are maintained preferentially in the bone marrow. They do not proliferate, and are refractory to conventional therapies. Current concepts target plasma cells for depletion, e.g. the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, BAFF and APRIL antagonists and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

Each subject recorded their daily symptom scores in a diary. The primary efficacy variable was the mean weekly nasal symptom medication score during the study period. The nasal symptom medication score in the long-term intake group was significantly lower than that of the short-term intake group at the peak of pollen dispersal. The symptom scores for throat pain, nose-blowing, tears, and hindrance to activities of daily living were significantly better in the long-term group than the short-term group. In particular, the differences in the symptom scores for throat pain and nose-blowing between the 2 groups were marked. We conclude that drinking 'benifuuki' tea for 1.5 months prior to the cedar pollen season is effective in reducing symptom scores for Japanese cedar pollinosis.",

A relationship between non-immunoglobulin (Ig) E mediated allergic reactions and CMA in early infancy has been proposed, but the clinical features and pathogenesis have not been established. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical characteristics of the neonates found in the earlier study to have food-related symptoms that suggested CMA. A second questionnaire was sent to 53 NICUs, as a follow-up to the earlier study, to collect information on the background, onset age, clinical features, and results of clinical examinations. The median birth weight was 2614 g and the median gestational age was 36.9 weeks. Symptoms developed within 6 days after birth in 40% of cases. Gastrointestinal symptoms were seen in 90% of cases and were mainly vomiting, bloody stool and abdominal distention. A specific IgE test, a lymphocyte stimulation test, and a fecal eosinophil test were conducted in 88%, 23% and 55% of cases, respectively, and the positive rates were 30%, 84%, and 75%, respectively. An oral food challenge (OFC) test was performed in 26% for confirmation of the diagnosis. We confirmed that the clinical manifestations of food-related symptoms suggestive of CMA in neonates were distinctly different from those of common immediate type food allergy and were largely affected by underlying factors such as prematurity and gastroenterological surgery. Further OFC-based prospective accumulation of cases of CMA in neonates will be particularly important to reveal the full clinical features of this disease.",

Phl p 1 antibodies were detected in most pediatric and adult patients, however, the children were associated with higher RAST classes more often. Anti-Phl p 5-antibodies were found more frequently in adults. An increase was observed in the number of pediatric patients reacting to Phl p 7 and Phl p 12. There were no differences in concentrations of specific-IgE against Phl p 5, Phl p 7 and Phl p 12 depending on age. Almost 10% of allergic children produced antibodies directed exclusively against minor allergens or did not produce specific-IgE-antibodies against tested molecules.

Antibodies against Phl p 1 and Phl p 5 can be used as a marker of allergy to grasses in adult patients. Children reacted exclusively to minor allergens more frequently than adults. Prolonged allergen exposure is evidently necessary to induce sensitization to Phl p 5. A high level of homology between profilins and calcium-binding proteins enables only one allergen to be used for diagnostic purposes but a possibility of a reaction to species-bound epitopes should be taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) are a group of enzymes that hydrolyze the sn-2 position of phospholipids to release (typically unsaturated) fatty acids and lysophospholipids, which serve as precursors for a variety of bioactive lipid mediators. Among the PLA2 superfamily, secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) enzymes comprise the largest subfamily that includes 11 isoforms with a conserved His–Asp catalytic dyad. Individual sPLA2 enzymes exhibit unique tissue and cellular localizations and specific enzymatic properties, suggesting their distinct biological roles. Recent studies using transgenic and knockout mice for individual sPLA2 isofoms have revealed their involvement in various pathophysiological events. Here, we overview the current state of knowledge about sPLA2s, specifically their roles in mast cells (MCs) in the context of allergology. In particular, we highlight group III sPLA2 (PLA2G3) as an \"anaphylactic sPLA2\" that promotes MC maturation and thereby anaphylaxis through a previously unrecognized lipid-orchestrated circuit.",

    "abstract": "Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have emerged recently as an important component of the immune system and the cell type that regulates mucosal immune responses and tissue homeostasis. Group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), a subset of ILCs, reside in various tissues and are characterized by their capacity to produce type 2 cytokines and tissue growth factors. These ILC2s play an important role in allergic immune responses by linking signals in the atmospheric environment to the immune system. Fungi are one of the major allergens associated with human asthma, and animal and in vitro models using the fungal allergens have provided significant information toward our understanding of the mechanisms of allergic disease. In mouse models of fungus-induced allergic airway inflammation, IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP are released by airway epithelial cells. Lung ILC2s that respond to these cytokines quickly produce a large quantity of type 2 cytokines, resulting in airway eosinophilia, mucus production, and airway hyperreactivity even in the absence of adaptive immune cells. Evidence also suggests that ILC2s interact with conventional immune cells, such as CD4+ T cells, and facilitate development of adaptive immune response and persistent airway inflammation. ILC2s are also present in respiratory mucosa in humans. Further investigations into the biology of ILC2s and their roles in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases will provide major conceptual advances in the field and may provide useful information toward development of new therapeutic strategies for patients.",

However, the role of IL-33 in pulmonary eosinophilia has not been elucidated. We investigated the levels of IL-33 in eosinophilic pneumonia (EP) together with associated cytokines, and discussed the clinical significance of IL-33 in EP.Sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were obtained from 16 patients with EP, including acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP). Twelve patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were also included for comparison. The concentration of IL-33 and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The concentration of serum IL-33 was significantly higher in patients with AEP than in CEP. In CEP, only patients with atopic factors showed mild increase of serum IL-33. The concentration of BALF IL-33 was also significantly elevated in AEP, however, it remained quite low in CEP. Among Th2 cytokines, IL-5 was significantly increased in both serum and BALF in AEP, and the level of IL-5 was positively correlated with that of IL-33. ARDS showed no increase of serum and BALF IL-33.The remarkable increase of BALF IL-33 in AEP indicated the local production of IL-33 in lungs. IL-33 is considered to be a local key molecule for triggering pulmonary eosinophilia, together with IL-5. BALF IL-33 appears to be a useful marker for discriminating AEP from CEP and ARDS.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and its relationship with dietary habits and other risk factors among 6 to 7-year-old Turkish schoolchildren. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 11483 children aged 6-7 years were surveyed. The prevalence of symptoms of allergic rhinitis was assessed using the ISAAC protocol. Dietary information was collected using a food frequency questionnaire. Of them, 9875 (50.7% M 49.3% F) questionnaires were appropriately completed. The prevalence rates of lifetime rhinitis, current rhinitis, current rhinoconjunctivitis and physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis, were 44.3%, 29.2%, 8.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Consumption of rice, and cereals ≥ 3 times per week showed protective effect on physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis (aOR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.32-0.87 and aOR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.36-0.92).

Eating lollipops, candies and animal fats ≥ 3 times per week was positively associated with current rhinoconjunctivitis (aOR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.00-2.17 and aOR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.11-4.56). Protective effect of the Mediterranean diet was not significant. Frequent consumption of cereals, rice, pasta and chocolates may have beneficial effect on symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis. Although dietary habits may affect the prevalence of symptoms of current rhinoconjunctivitis, the Mediterranean diet alone may not be protective against rhinoconjunctivitis.",

To clarify the role of epicutaneous sensitization in food allergy, we investigated the clinical characteristics of adult patients with food allergies preceded by contact urticaria due to the same foods.We investigated clinical characteristics of 15 patients (20-51 years of age; 5 men and 10 women), who had food allergies preceded by contact urticaria.Fourteen patients were contact urticaria due to the causative foods during occupationally cooking, whereas 1 patient during face pack. In the occupational group, causative foods included rice, wheat, fruits, vegetables, fish, shrimp and cuttlefish; in the fresh cucumber paste case the cause was cucumber. In the 15 patients, the causative foods were fresh, not processed, and were tolerated by most (9/15, 60%) after heating. Regarding to symptoms after ingestion of the causative foods, the most frequently induced symptoms was oral symptoms (14/15, 93.3%), followed by urticaria (4/15, 26.7%), abdominal symptoms (3/15, 20%). The duration between the start of jobs or face pack, and the onset of contact urticaria was from 1 month to 19 years (mean, 8.7 years). The duration between the onset of contact urticaria and the onset of food allergy was from a few weeks to 6 years (mean, 11 months). One sushi cook experienced severe anaphylactic shock after ingestion of fish. In the occupational group, 13 of 15 patients (86.7%) had atopic dermatitis or hand eczema, indicating that the impaired skin barrier might be a risk for food allergies induced by epicutaneous sensitization.Epicutaneous sensitization of foods could induce food allergy under occupational cooking and skin-care treatment with foods in adults.",

In this study, AD-like disease was induced in NC/Nga mice so as to evaluate the antiallergic effects of Vernonia amygdalina leaf extracts (VAM). Methods: Forty NC/Nga mice were purchased for each of the two protocols (prophylactic and curative) of the study. Mice were randomly divided in groups of five or six after sensitization with 5% trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB): aqueous extracts (VAM1), methanolic extracts (VAM2), hydrocortisone (HCT), buffer for the control (TNCB) and the normal mice (NORM) groups. Results: As for HCT, VAM1 and VAM2-pretreated mice showed significantly lower number of scratching behavior episodes (p < 0.01; vs. TNCB) following TNCB challenge. In addition, VAM1, VAM2 exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the development of AD skin symptoms (vs. TNCB group; p < 0.001), the production of IgE, TNF-alpha (p < 0.05), IL-5 and IFN-gamma (p < 0.01) (vs. TNCB group) and on the increase in ear thickness (p < 0.05) in prophylactic protocol. In the AD curative protocol, topical VAM1, VAM2 markedly improved skin lesions such as erythema/hemorrhage (p < 0.05), scaling/dryness, erosion/excoriation (p < 0.01) (vs. TNCB mice). Furthermore, a significant decrease in ear thickness was noted in VAM1, VAM2, HCT groups (vs. TNCB group; p < 0.05) as well as the serum total IgE, MCP-1 (p < 0.01) and eotaxin (p < 0.05). VAM2 also improved chronic eczema dermatitis skin symptoms in a patient. Conclusions: Results from this report suggest that VAM extracts, known as ERK pathway inhibitor, prevent and improve atopic/eczema dermatitis syndrome.",

This report describes the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab in Japanese patients from MENSA. A post hoc analysis of the Japanese subgroup from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, Phase III MENSA trial (NCT01691521). Patients ≥12 years with severe eosinophilic asthma received mepolizumab 75 mg intravenously (IV), 100 mg subcutaneously (SC), or placebo, every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of exacerbations. Secondary and other endpoints included annualized rate of exacerbations requiring emergency department (ED) visit/hospitalization, morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score and eosinophil counts. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored. In the Japanese subgroup (N = 50), the rate of clinically significant exacerbations was reduced by 90% (rate ratio [RR]: 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02–0.57; P = 0.010) with mepolizumab IV and 62% (RR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.12–1.18; P = 0.094) with mepolizumab SC, versus placebo. No exacerbations requiring ED visit/hospitalization were reported with mepolizumab IV; exacerbations were reduced by 73% (RR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.06–1.29; P = 0.102) with mepolizumab SC versus placebo. Compared with placebo, mepolizumab IV and SC numerically increased morning PEF from baseline by 40 L/min and 13 L/min, improved quality of life by greater than the minimal clinically important difference (SGRQ: 9.5 [P = 0.083] and 7.9 [P = 0.171] points) and reduced eosinophil counts. AE incidence was similar between treatments. Results were broadly consistent with the overall population. Mepolizumab was efficacious and well tolerated in Japanese patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, producing similar responses to the overall MENSA population.",

The objective was to evaluate the association between IL-17A rs2275913 (-197G>A) polymorphism and post-bronchiolitis asthma and/or allergic rhinitis in a prospective 11–13 years post-bronchiolitis follow-up. 166 previously healthy full-term infants, hospitalized for bronchiolitis at age less than 6 months, were invited to follow-up visits at the ages of 5–7 years and 11–13 years. Asthma diagnoses and presumptive symptoms, allergic rhinitis and use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were registered. Blood samples for IL-17A rs2275913 (-197G>A) polymorphism were obtained during hospitalization or at the 5–7 years control visit. There were no significant differences between children with the wild GG and variant GA or AA genotype in the severity of bronchiolitis during hospitalization or in the outcomes until the age 5–7 years. At 11–13 years of age, children with the variant GA or AA genotype had significantly less often current asthma, use of ICSs during last 12 months or allergic rhinitis than those with the wild GG genotype. The ICS use during last 12 months retained the statistical significance in adjusted analyses (adjusted OR 0.25), whereas current asthma and allergic rhinitis marginally lost it. The IL-17A rs2275913 (-197G>A) polymorphism decreased the risk of post-bronchiolitis asthma at 11–13 years of age, but not earlier in life, in the present prospective, long-term follow-up study.",

We aimed to show the racial differences, especially among Caucasians and Asians, in the risk of EoE and EGE.We conducted a systematic review using PubMed in September 2012. All case reports and case series on EGID that involved human subjects and described race or ethnicity, as well as pathological findings, were included. For the comparison of reported cases between Caucasians and Asians, a chi-squared test was used.Among the 687 studies found in PubMed, 121 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. In total, 2621 patients were reviewed. Among Caucasian EGID patients, 94% had EoE; while among Asian EGID patients, 72% had EGE (p < 0.001). Among EoE, Asians were significantly less likely to have dysphagia and heartburn, but more likely to have vomit and abdominal pain, compared to Caucasians (p < 0.001). Further, among EGE, Asians were significantly more likely to have eosinophil-infiltrated colon than Caucasians (OR: 3.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.60-7.04), but were less likely to have eosinophil-infiltrated stomach (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.17-0.49).We found that EoE occurs more frequently in Caucasian EGID patients than Asian EGID patients, while the reverse is true for EGE. Also, racial disparities in symptoms and eosinophil-infiltrated tissues were observed. Our findings suggest further genetic and environmental studies to elucidate the etiology of EGID.",

Eosinophils are also involved in innate Th2-type immune responses mediated through endogenous danger signals, including IL-33, uric acid (UA), or ATP, in non-sensitized mice exposed to environmental allergens. However, the mechanism involved in eosinophil responses to these danger signals remains insufficiently understood.We examined migration, adhesion, superoxide production and degranulation of human eosinophils. Isolated eosinophils were incubated with monosodium urate (MSU) crystals and ATPγS, a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue. To determine the involvement of P2 or P2Y2 receptors in eosinophil responses to UA and ATP, eosinophils were preincubated with a pan-P2 receptor inhibitor, oxidized ATP (oATP), or anti-P2Y2 antibody before incubation with MSU crystals or ATPγS.MSU crystals induced adhesion of eosinophils to recombinant human (rh)-ICAM-1 and induced production of superoxide. oATP abolished eosinophil responses to MSU crystals, suggesting involvement of endogenous ATP and its receptors. Furthermore, exogenous ATP, as ATPγS, induced migration of eosinophils through a model basement membrane, adhesion to rh-ICAM-1, superoxide generation, and degranulation of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). oATP and anti-P2Y2 significantly reduced these eosinophil responses.ATP serves as an essential mediator of functional responses in human eosinophils. Eosinophil responses to ATP may be implicated in airway inflammation in patients with asthma.",

Here, we sought to examine the genetic contribution of this variant to the development of adult asthma.We performed a candidate gene case-control association study of 2 independent Japanese populations (a total of 3366 adults). The odds ratios (ORs) for association of the A allele at rs6967330 with adult asthma were calculated according to age at onset of asthma. In addition, the effect of the CDHR3 genotype on the development of specific asthma phenotypes was examined.The A allele was associated with asthma (OR = 1.56; Mantel-Haenszel p = 0.0040) when the analysis was limited to patients with early-onset adult asthma. In addition, when the analysis was limited to atopic individuals, a stronger association of the CDHR3 variant with early-onset asthma was found, and interaction of the CDHR3 genotype with atopy was demonstrated. Finally, a significant association of this variant was specifically found with a phenotype of asthma characterized by atopy, early-onset, and lower lung function.Our study supports the concept that the CDHR3 variant is an important susceptibility factor for severe adult asthma in individuals who develop the disease in early life. The interaction between the CDHR3 variant and atopy indicates that genetic predisposition to early respiratory viral infection is combined with atopy in promoting asthma.",

The first survey requested information on the implementation of OIT, whereas the second survey aimed to gather more detailed information on OIT, such as its safety.In total, 360 facilities (69%) responded to the survey; among them, 102 (28%) provided OIT to 7973 patients [1544 received OIT while hospitalized (inpatient OIT), whereas 6429 received OIT without hospitalization (outpatient OIT)]. Approval for OIT was obtained from an ethics committee or institutional review board in 89% and 31% of facilities for inpatient and outpatient OIT, respectively. In inpatient OIT, immediate allergic reactions requiring treatment occurred in 68% of patients while hospitalized, and in another 56%, following discharge. In contrast, 11% of patients developed immediate allergic reactions in outpatient OIT. Adrenaline injections at home were required in 2%. Sixteen patients developed adverse reactions other than immediate allergic reactions, among which eosinophilic gastroenteritis was most common.OIT is widely provided not only as clinical research but also as general practice in Japan. However, because there is a high risk of developing anaphylaxis at home, OIT should be conducted carefully as in a clinical research setting taking safety into consideration.",

    "abstract": "There is no curative treatment for wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). ω-5 Gliadin is one of the dominant allergens affecting WDEIA patients. The use of ω-5 gliadin-free wheat flour in the regular diet is considered one of the prophylactic approaches against the elicitation of allergic symptoms and sensitization to ω-5 gliadin. We sought to find hypoallergenic bread wheat (or common wheat) that lacked the genes encoding ω-5 gliadin and to evaluate its in vitro allergenicity. We also aimed to evaluate the sensitization ability of one of the selected hypoallergenic wheat lines by using a possible animal model of wheat allergy. We screened the deletion lines of bread wheat by western blotting to ascertain common wheat lines lacking the ω-5 gliadin locus. The deletion lines we used have partial deficiency of chromosome 1B (Endo and Gill, 1996). To assess sensitization ability of gluten from the selected deletion line, guinea pigs were fed with either the gluten from the selected deletion line or commercially available gluten, and allergic score was evaluated after challenging the same gluten preparations. We found that a deletion line 1BS-18 had the least deficiency of chromosome 1B among the deletion stocks lacking the ω-5 gliadin locus. The challenge test using the guinea pigs revealed that the symptoms induced by application of the 1BS-18 gluten were much less than that of commercially available gluten. The deletion line 1BS-18, which lacked the ω-5 gliadin locus, is likely to have a low sensitization capacity in the guinea pig. The use of the wheat products of the 1BS-18 line in daily life may provide a feasible solution for the onset of wheat allergy.",

We then examined the roles of calprotectin on Alternaria alternata (Alternaria)-induced production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and IL-25 in NHBE cells. The extracellular concentration and allergen-induced secretion of calprotectin in cultured primary nasal epithelial (PNE) cells were examined and compared between patients with ECRS and non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (NECRS).Alternaria, house dust mites, protease from Staphylococcus aureus, papain, trypsin, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid and lipopolysaccharide stimulated calprotectin production in the cultured NHBE cells. The combination of calprotectin and ATP stimulated the production of TSLP and IL-25 in NHBE cells, and calprotectin stimulated Alternaria-induced production of TSLP and IL-25, which was suppressed by blocking P2 purinergic receptors and by treatment with siRNA for S100A8, S100A9 or calprotectin receptors (Toll-like receptor 4 or receptor for advanced glycation end products). Allergen-induced calprotectin production was significantly stimulated in PNE cells from patients with ECRS.These results indicate that calprotectin enhances the allergen-induced Th2-type inflammatory responses in airway epithelial cells via the secretion of TSLP and IL-25, and that calprotectin secreted by the epithelial cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of ECRS.",

However, no clinical studies have analyzed serum levels of SCCA2 in larger series of AD patients or their association with various clinical characteristics. This study was performed to clarify whether serum levels of SCCA2 are associated with disease severity and clinical phenotypes of adult AD patients. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to examine serum SCCA2 levels in 240 adult patients with AD and 25 healthy controls in this study. Serum SCCA2 levels were analyzed with clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters including thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood eosinophils, total IgE, and specific IgE (Japanese cedar pollen, Dermatophagoides farina, Candida, malassezia, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B). Expression of SCCA2 in AD eruption was examined by immunohistochemistry. The effect of treatment on serum SCCA2 was also assessed. Serum SCCA2 level showed a positive correlation with disease severity, levels of TARC, LDH, eosinophil counts, and IgE levels. Robust expression of SCCA2 was detected in the supra basal keratinocytes in the epidermis of AD patients. Serial measurements of serum SCCA2 revealed decreased levels of SCCA2 after treatment for AD. Serum SCCA2 levels reflected disease severity and clinical type of AD. Serum SCCA2 may thus be a relevant biomarker for AD.",

However, few studies have investigated this relationship longitudinally, especially in middle-aged subjects. Although metabolic syndrome is a well-known risk factor for many non-communicable diseases, its contribution to asthma remains controversial.From 2008, specific health checkups for metabolic syndrome have been conducted throughout Japan. To seek relationships of obesity and metabolic syndrome with late-onset asthma in Japan, we analyzed data collected from health insurance claims and specific health checkups for metabolic syndrome at three large health insurance societies. Among subjects aged 40-64 years (n = 9888), multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationships of obesity and metabolic syndrome in fiscal year 2012 (from April 2012 to March 2013) with the incidence of late-onset asthma in the following two years (from April 2013 to March 2015).In women, BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2 or ≥30 kg/m2, waist circumference ≥90 cm, and waist-to-height ratio ≥0.5 were shown to be significant risk factors for asthma, with adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) of 1.92 (1.35-2.75), 2.24 (1.23-4.09), 1.89 (1.30-2.75), and 1.53 (1.15-2.03), respectively. Significance was retained even after adjustment for metabolic syndrome, and there were no significant relationships between metabolic syndrome itself and the incidence of asthma in men or women.Only the obesity measures, not metabolic syndrome, were shown to be significant risk factors for the incidence of late-onset asthma but only in middle-aged Japanese women, and not in men.",

The allergic reaction is clinically revealed by positive reactions in the intradermal skin test and the basophil histamine release assay by sweat. A major histamine-releasing antigen in sweat, MGL_1304, has been identified. MGL_1304 is produced at a size of 29 kDa by Malassezia (M.) globosa and secreted into sweat after being processed and converted into the mature form of 17 kDa. It induces significant histamine release from basophils of patients with AD and/or CholU with MGL_1304-specific IgE, which is detected in their sera. Patients with AD also show cross-reactivity to MGL_1304-homologs in Malassezia restricta and Malassezia sympodialis, but MGL_1304 does not share cross antigenicity with human intrinsic proteins. Malassezia or its components may penetrate the damaged epidermis of AD lesions and interact with the skin immune system, resulting in the sensitization and reaction to the fungal antigen. As well as the improvement of impaired barrier functions by topical interventions, approaches such as anti-microbial treatment, the induction of tolerance and antibody/substance neutralizing the sweat antigen may be beneficial for the patients with intractable AD or CholU due to sweat allergy. The identification of antigens other than MGL_1304 in sweat should be the scope for future studies, which may lead to better understanding of sweat allergy and therapeutic innovations.",

We here examined antibody production and skin barrier dysfunction in mice epicutaneously administered papain, a plant-derived occupational allergen belonging to the same family of cysteine proteases as mite major group 1 allergens. Methods: Papain and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease were patched on the backs of hairless mice. Tran- sepidermal water loss was measured to evaluate the skin barrier dysfunction caused by the proteases. Papain or that treated with an irreversible inhibitor specific to cysteine proteases, E64, was painted onto the ear lobes of mice of an inbred strain C57BL/6. Serum total IgE levels and papain-specific IgE and IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA. Results: Papain and V8 protease patched on the backs of hairless mice caused skin barrier dysfunction and increased serum total IgE levels, and papain induced the production of papain-specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b. Papain painted onto the ear lobes of C57BL/6 mice induced papain-specific IgE, IgG1, IgG2c, and IgG2b, whereas papain treated with E64 did not. IgG1 was the most significantly induced papain-specific IgG subclass among those measured. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the epicutaneous administration of protease not only disrupted skin barrier function, but also induced IgE and IgG responses in a manner dependent on its protease activity. These results suggest that protease activity contained in environmental sources contributes to sensitization through an epicutaneous route.",

    "abstract": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that mediates eosinophilic differentiation, migration and survival, causing respiratory tract inflammation. GM-CSF is also known to be secreted from respiratory tract structural cells. However, the mechanisms of GM-CSF secretion have not been well established.Human fetal lung fibroblasts and human primary asthmatic lung fibroblasts were used for the study of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-induced GM-CSF secretion. GM-CSF secretion and mRNA expression were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Knockdown of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in fibroblasts was carried out by using specific small interfering RNAs of CREB.Among respiratory tract structural cells, pulmonary fibroblasts exhibited increased GM-CSF secretion and mRNA expression after stimulation with TNF-α in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor controlled TNF-α-induced GM-CSF secretion, and roflumilast and rolipram, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase-4, suppressed TNF-α-induced GM-CSF secretion. Consistent with this, forskolin also completely blocked GM-CSF secretion, and similar results were observed in response to cAMP treatment, suggesting that cAMP signaling suppressed TNF-α-induced GM-CSF secretion in human lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, CREB was phosphorylated through p38 MAPK but not cAMP signaling after TNF-α stimulation, and GM-CSF secretion was inhibited by CREB knockdown. Finally, these effects were also demonstrated in human primary lung fibroblasts in a patient with asthma.CREB signaled independent of cAMP signaling and was phosphorylated by p38 MAPK following TNF-α stimulation, playing a critical role in GM-CSF secretion in human lung fibroblasts.",

Clock is a key circadian gene that is essential for endogenous clockworks in mammals. This study investigated whether Clock temporally regulated IL-33-mediated responses in mast cells. The kinetics of IL-33-mediated IL-6, IL-13, and TNF-α productions were compared between bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from wild-type and Clock-mutated mice (ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice). The kinetics of the neutrophil influx into the peritoneal cavity or expression of IL-13 and Gob-5 in the lung in response to IL-33 were compared between wild-type and ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice. We also examined the kinetics of ST2 expression in mast cells and its association with Clock expression. There was a time-of-day-dependent variation in IL-33-mediated IL-6, IL-13, and TNF-α production in wild-type BMMCs, which was absent in Clock-mutated BMMCs. IL-33-induced neutrophil infiltration into the peritoneal cavity also showed a time-of-day-dependent variation in wild-type mice, which was absent in ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice. Furthermore, IL-33-induced IL-13 and Gob-5 expression in the lung exhibited a time-of-day-dependent variation in wild-type mice. These temporal variations in IL-33-mediated mast cell responses were associated with temporal variations of ST2 expression in mast cells. In addition, CLOCK bound to the promoter region of ST2 and Clock deletion resulted in down-regulation of ST2 expression in mast cells. CLOCK temporally gates mast cell responses to IL-33 via regulation of ST2 expression. Our findings provide novel insights into IL-33/mast cell-associated physiology and pathologies.",

We review the role of lung Tpath2 cells in the development of allergic inflammation and, in the context of recent findings, propose a mechanism by which Tpath2 cells not only survive but also continue to function at the sites where antigens were encountered.

A TM allergy BALB/c mouse model was established, and two LAPB strains, Bifidobacterium longum (Bi) and Bacillus coagulans (Bc), were used for oral treatment in sensitized mice. The allergic mucosal disorders were assessed by histological analysis and ELISAs. Additionally, microbiota and metabolic modifications were determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and GC-TOF-MS, respectively. YSPB administration suppressed TM-induced intestinal mucosal disorders, restored allergenic Th2 cell over-polarization and dysbiosis, and regulated gut arginine and proline metabolism pathways. Statistical analysis suggested the metabolites aspartate and arginine, as well as several commensal flora groups, to be the critical mediators in the process. These data demonstrated the correlation between allergic mucosal disorder, T cell subtype differentiation, gut microbiota composition and intestinal metabolism especially the arginine and proline metabolism pathways. We also revealed the significant effects of LAPB in ameliorating food allergy and maintaining the mucosal ecosystem. This study confirmed the efficiency of LAPB in relieving food allergy, provided Bi and Bc as the potential treatment approaches, and suggested amino acid metabolism pathways might be the novel targets for potential clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is often comorbid with asthma and resistant to therapeutic interventions. We recently reported that excessive fibrin deposition caused by impairment of fibrinolysis might play pivotal role in forming nasal polyp. Nattokinase (NK), a serine protease produced by Bacillus subtilis, has been reported to be a strong fibrinolytic enzyme. NK could be a promising drug candidate for use in the treatment of both CRSwNP and asthma. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of NK on nasal polyp tissues from patients with CRSwNP. The nasal discharge from patients with CRSwNP and sputum from subjects with asthma were also used to investigate whether NK influences the viscosity of mucus.To examine the effects on NK on nasal polyp tissues, pieces of nasal polyps were incubated either with saline or NK (10-1000 FU/ml) at 37 °C for 24 h. We assessed the presence of fibrin in nasal polyp tissue incubated with NK by means of immunohistochemistry. To examine the effects of NK on nasal discharge and sputum from patients with CRSwNP and asthma, respectively, were incubated with NK solution at 37 °C for 1 h.NK effectively shrinks the nasal polyp tissue through fibrin degradation. We also found that the viscosity of the nasal discharge and sputum from patients with CRSwNP and asthma, respectively, was significantly reduced by incubation with NK solution.NK may be an effective alternative therapeutic option in patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma by causing fibrin degradation.",

The clinical observation that AA can occur after viral infection or IFN-α administration implies that IFN-α-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) may be involved in the AA pathogenesis.We generated AA in C3H/HeJ mice by intradermal injection of T cells derived from lymph nodes of AA-bearing syngeneic mice and stimulated IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15. Distribution of IFN-γ producing pDCs were immunohistochemically analyzed. Realtime PCR were also demonstrated to detect the expression of IFN-γ mRNA. Hair follicles were cultured with IFN-α in order to calculate the hair elongation. Imiquimod was employed to induce catagen stage. PDCs were injected into C3H/HeJ mice to initiate AA.In this mouse, IFN-α-producing pDCs densely infiltrated around HFs in not only AA lesional but also vicinity of AA lesion. Importantly, intradermal injection of pDCs induced AA lesions. Finally, IFN-α inhibited hair elongation of murine vibrissae and upregulated MHC class I and CXCL10 levels in vitro.These findings suggest that IFN-α-producing pDCs initiate AA by inducing apoptosis and increasing Th1/Tc1 chemokine production such as CXCL10, that accumulates Th1/Tc1 cells and result in autoimmune reactions against hair follicles.",

The severity-of-illness scoring system for TEN (SCORTEN) was widely used since 2000 as a standard prognostic tool consisting of seven clinical values.To evaluate the prognosis using current treatments and risk factors for mortality, we retrospectively analyzed 59 cases of TEN, including SJS/TEN overlap treated in two university hospitals from January 2000 to March 2020.The mortality rate of TEN was 13.6% (8/59). All patients treated with high-dose steroid administration in combination with plasma exchange and/or immunoglobulin therapy recovered. Logistic regression analysis showed nine clinical composite scores, namely: heart rate (≧120 bpm), malignancy present, percentage of body surface area with epidermal detachment (>10%), blood urea nitrogen (>28 mg/dL), serum bicarbonate level (<20 mEq/L), serum glucose level (>252 mg/dL), age (≧71 years), the interval between disease onset and treatment initiation at the specialty hospital (≧8 days), and respiratory disorder within 48 h after admission. The receiver operating characteristic curves confirmed a high potential for predicting the prognosis of TEN.Recent developments in treatment strategies have contributed to the improved prognosis of TEN patients. A modified severity scoring model composed of nine scores may be helpful in the prediction of TEN prognosis in recent patients. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm mortality findings to improve prognostication in patients with TEN.",

We investigated the role of IL-22 and its receptor, IL-22R1, in the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). IL-22 and IL-22R1 protein and mRNA expression in NP and in uncinate tissues (UT) from CRS and non-CRS patients was examined using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR, respectively. Dispersed NP and UT cells were cultured with the Staphylococcus aureus exotoxins, staphylococcal enterotoxin B and alpha-toxin, following which exotoxin-induced IL-22 levels and their association with clinicopathological factors were analyzed. Effects of IL-22 on MUC1 expression and cytokine release in NP cells were also determined. IL-22 and IL-22R1 in NP were mainly expressed in infiltrating inflammatory cells and in epithelial cells, respectively. IL-22 mRNA levels in NP were significantly higher than those in UTs from non-CRS patients whereas IL-22R1 levels were conversely lower in NPs. NP cells produced substantial amounts of IL-22 in response to exotoxins. Exotoxin-induced IL-22 production by NP cells significantly and negatively correlated with the degree of local eosinophilia and postoperative computed tomography (CT) score, whereas conversely it positively correlated with the forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio. IL-22 significantly enhanced MUC1 mRNA expression in NP cells. IL-22-induced MUC1 mRNA levels were significantly and positively correlated with IL-22R1 mRNA levels in NPs. These data suggest that imbalance of IL-22/IL-22R1 signaling regulates the pathogenesis of CRSwNP, including local eosinophilia, via alteration of MUC1 expression.",

    "abstract": "There is very limited evidence regarding long-term prognosis of chronic cough. We examined longitudinal outcomes among patients with chronic cough, and explored predictors of cough persistence. A retrospective cohort was constructed of adults who had newly visited a specialist cough clinic in 2012–2013. All had undergone systematic investigation for chronic cough. The Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire (HARQ) was administered to assess reflux cough symptoms. A follow-up survey was conducted in 2016–2017 to assess cough persistence. From 418 candidates, 323 participated in the follow-up study; main analyses focused on patients with chronic persistent cough (n = 64; 19.8%) and remitted cough (n = 193; 59.8%). Compared with remitted cough group, chronic persistent cough group had more family history of chronic cough (17.2% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.001) and cold air-sensitive cough (62.5% vs. 44.6%, p = 0.013). The total HARQ score did not differ; however, two items (cough with eating and cough with certain foods) scored significantly higher in chronic persistent cough. In multivariate analyses, a family history of chronic cough (adjusted odds ratio 4.27 [95% confidence interval 1.35–9.89]), cold air-sensitive cough (2.01 [1.09–3.73]), and cough with eating (1.22 [1.02–1.45]) were associated with chronic persistent cough at 4 years. Cough persists in about 20% of patients after 4 years following systematic assessment and treatments. Several cough characteristics, such as family history, cold air-sensitivity, or reflux cough, may be associated with cough persistence. Larger cohort studies are warranted to further understand long-term prognosis and confirm predictors of persistence in patients with chronic cough.",

Asthma has been proposed to be classified into various phenotypes by cluster analyses integrating clinical information and laboratory data. Recently, asthma has been classified into two major endotypes, Type 2-high and Type 2-low asthma, and various subtypes based on the underlying molecular mechanisms. In Type 2-high asthma, Th2 cells, together with group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), produce type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, which play crucial roles in causing airway inflammation. The roles of ILC2s in asthma pathogenesis have been analyzed primarily in murine models, demonstrating their importance not only in IL-33- or papain-induced innate asthma models but also in house dust mite (HDM)- or ovalbumin (OVA)-induced acquired asthma models evoked in an antigen-specific manner. Recently, evidence regarding the roles of ILC2s in human asthma is also accumulating. This minireview summarizes the roles of ILC2s in asthma, emphasizing human studies.",

However, biomarkers that predict therapeutic effectiveness must be determined for use in precision medicine. Herein, we elucidated the dynamics of various parameters before and after treatment as well as patient characteristics predictive of clinical responsiveness to mepolizumab after 1-year treatment. Twenty-seven patients with severe asthma were treated with mepolizumab for one year. Asthma control test scores, pulmonary function tests, fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels, and blood samples were evaluated. Additionally, we explored the role of CD69-positive mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells as a candidate biomarker for predicting treatment effectiveness by evaluating an OVA-induced asthma murine model using MR1 knockout mice, where MAIT cells were absent. The frequencies of CD69-positive group 1 innate lymphoid cells, group 3 innate lymphoid cells, natural killer cells, and MAIT cells decreased after mepolizumab treatment. The frequency of CD69-positive MAIT cells and neutrophils was lower and serum periostin levels were higher in responders than in non-responders. In the OVA-induced asthma murine model, CD69-positive MAIT cell count in the whole mouse lung was significantly higher than that in the control mice. Moreover, OVA-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation was exacerbated in the MAIT cell-deficient MR1 knockout mice. This study shows that circulating CD69-positive MAIT cells, neutrophils, and serum periostin might predict the real-world response after 1-year mepolizumab treatment. Furthermore, MAIT cells potentially have a protective role against type 2 airway inflammation.",

In the few preceding studies, a short follow-up duration was followed for a relatively small study population, and lifestyle behaviors were not adjusted for. Therefore, there is a need for large-scale observation studies on the association of allergic disease with PD risk after considering lifestyle behaviors. The study population consisted of 398,936 participants aged 40 years or older who underwent health screening before 1 January 2005 from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Starting from 1 January 2005, all participants were followed up until the date of PD event, death, or 31 December 2019. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of PD were calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Compared to non-allergic disease participants, allergic disease patients had a higher risk for PD (aHR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07–1.30) and especially, allergic rhinitis patients had a higher risk for PD (aHR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00–1.29). Allergic disease was associated with a higher risk for PD (aHR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01–1.52) among participants who were never smokers, did not consume alcohol, and exercised regularly. Allergic rhinitis was associated with a higher risk for PD compared to participants without allergic rhinitis. This risk-increasing association of allergic rhinitis with PD was preserved even among people with healthy lifestyle behaviors.",

Functional genomics is the analysis of whole gene expression profiling under given condition, and microarray technology is now the most powerful tool for functional genomics. Several attempts to clarify the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma have been carried out using microarray technology, providing us some novel biomarkers for diagnosis, therapeutic targets or understanding pathogenic mechanisms of bronchial asthma.

Although an increase in several mediators in the airway during RSV infection has been reported, the mechanisms involved in airway inflammation are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunological deviation associated with airway inflammation by measuring cytokine and chemokine levels in the airway during RSV infection.One hundred and ten children under 3 years of age with respiratory symptoms were enrolled in this study from November 2004 through January 2005. Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPAs) were gently aspirated and analyzed with RSV antigen, thereafter the concentrations of IL-4, IL-10, IFN-gamma, and RANTES were measured using an ELISA kit. We also investigated the prognosis of each child after 1 year by reference to clinical records or by interviews and re-evaluated the cytokine and chemokine levels.Of the subjects, 70 children were RSV positive and 40 were negative. Only 4 children were given a diagnosis of asthma by the pediatrician when NPAs were collected. The levels of IL-4, IL-10, and RANTES were significantly higher in the RSV-positive patients than RSV-negative patients with P values at 0.0362, 0.0007, and 0.0047, respectively. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the levels of IFN-gamma. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between IL-10 and RANTES.The increased production of IL-4, IL-10, and RANTES in the airway may play an important role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of RSV infection.",

Duodenal tissues were collected and then immunohistochemically stained with monoclonal antibodies to CCR4 and CCR5. The number of mast cells and the villus edema formation rate in the duodenum were determined by image analysis.The number of CCR4-positive cells increased significantly in Group 2 as compared with Group 1 and tended to decrease in Group 3 as compared with Group 2. Relatively few CCR5-positive cells were observed in the duodenum. FOS tended to reduce the number of CCR4-positive cells but significantly reduced the number of mast cells and the edema formation rate in the duodenum.This study demonstrated a correlation between the number of CCR4-positive cells and villus edema formation rate. Therefore, FOS, which we inferred to show antiallergic activity for food allergy in this study and which has already been established to be safe for use as food in humans, can be considered to be potentially useful for the prevention of food allergy in pediatric patients with allergy.",

Our aim was to characterize the IgE binding proteins of S. incanescens pollen extract and study its cross-reactivity with S. kali pollen allergens. Prick tests with S. kali and S. incanescens pollen extracts were performed on eight respiratory allergy patients from Mashhad, Northeast Iran. The antigenic profiles and IgE-binding patterns of S. kali and S. incanescens pollen extracts were compared by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, using individual sera from the salsola pollen-sensitive patients. Cross-reactivity of proteins in the two weeds was assessed by IgE- immunoblotting inhibition. S. kali and S. incanescens pollen extracts showed similar IgE-binding profiles in Western blotting. The IgE binding components of 39, 45, 66 and 85 kDa were detected in both pollen extracts. Furthermore, inhibition of the immunoblots revealed extensive inhibition of IgE binding to proteins and a close relationship between these two weeds allergens. S. incanescens pollen is a potent allergen source with several IgE binding components that shows a close allergenic relationship with S. kali. Our results suggest that in S. incanescens-rich areas, S. kali pollen extracts could be used as a diagnostic reagent for allergic patients to S. incanescens pollen.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic use of Kampo medicine, Sho-seiryu-to (SST) in allergic disorders is well known. As histamine plays a central role in allergic diseases, it is possible that SST affects the allergy-related histamine signaling. In this study, we investigated the effect of SST on allergy-related histamine signaling in the nasal mucosa of toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate (TDI)-sensitized nasal allergy model rats. Six-week-old male, Brown Norway rats were sensitized for 2 weeks with 10 μl of 10% TDI, and after a 1 week interval, provocation was initiated with the same amount of TDI. SST (0.6 g/rat) was given orally 1 hour before TDI treatment began for a period of 3 weeks. Nasal symptoms were scored for 10 minutes immediately after TDI-provocation. The genes expression in nasal mucosa was determined using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. SST significantly suppressed TDI-induced nasal allergy-like symptoms. TDI provocation showed a significant up-regulation of histamine H1 receptor (H1R) and histidine decarboxylase (HDC) gene expressions. Prolonged pre-treatment of SST significantly suppressed the mRNA levels of H1R and HDC that was up-regulated by TDI. SST also suppressed TDI-induced interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 mRNA elevation. However, SST showed no significant effect for TDI-induced mRNA elevation of IL-13. These results demonstrate that SST alleviates nasal symptoms by the inhibition of histamine signaling through suppression of TDI-induced H1R and HDC gene up-regulation. SST also suppresses cytokine signaling through suppression of IL-4 and IL-5 gene expression. Suppression of histamine signaling may be a novel mechanism of SST in preventing allergic diseases.",

However, the use of these agonists, at least for asthma, has generated some controversy because of their association with increased mortality. Pharmacogenetics is the study of genetically determined variation in response to medications, which might prove useful for target therapies in highly responsive patients, especially for more expensive therapies or those with increased risk of side effects. Variation in response to both SABAs and LABAs has been observed in patients with polymorphisms in the β2 adrenoceptor gene (ADRB2). This review summarizes results from various studies on the possible relationship between ADRB2 polymorphisms and the bronchodilator or bronchoprotective effects of inhaled β2-agonists. By assessing the ADRB2 genotype, the hope is that it will be possible to predict the responsiveness to chronic administration of β2-agonists. Genetic testing, however, is of limited usefulness at this stage for ADRB2 because the common variants identified thus far account for only a small proportion of the variation observed for given responses. Carefully performed and adequately powered clinical trials continue to be important for achieving the goal of pharmacogenetic approaches to therapy.",

Here, we tested whether polyclonal mouse and human IgE molecules affect survival and cytokine production in mast cells. Mast cells were cultured in the presence of polyclonal mouse and human IgE molecules, and cell survival and cytokine production were analyzed. Polyclonal mouse IgE molecules in sera from mice with atopic dermatitis-like allergic skin inflammation, enhanced survival and cytokine production in mast cell cultures. Similar to the effects of monoclonal IgE, the polyclonal IgE effects were mediated by the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcεRI. Human polyclonal IgE molecules present in sera from atopic dermatitis patients were also capable of activating mast cells, and inducing IL- 8 production in human cord blood-derived mast cells.

In the present study, we examined whether the nasal FeNO measurement might reflect the degree of local allergic inflammation as well as subjective symptoms. The FeNO measurement was performed using a handheld electrochemical analyzer (NObreath®) with a nose adaptor. In the cross-sectional study, 56 patients with perennial AR patients, 18 AR patients with bronchial asthma (BA), 12 patients with vasomotor rhinitis, and 30 normal subjects were enrolled. For the follow-up study, 12 seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients against Japanese cedar and 10 perennial AR patients who underwent laser surgery were examined. The AR patients and vasomotor rhinitis patients showed significantly higher oral FeNO levels as compared with the normal subjects. The nasal FeNO levels were significantly higher in the perennial AR patients with or without BA than in the normal subjects and vasomotor rhinitis patients. There were positive correlations between the nasal symptom scores and FeNO levels. The SAR patients showed a significant decrease in the nasal FeNO level after the pollen dispersion season. In addition, the therapeutic effects of laser surgery in the AR patients accompanied a significant reduction in the nasal FeNO levels one month after treatment. The nasal FeNO measurement by NObreath® is easy to perform and suitable for monitoring AR patients in various treatment modalities. Furthermore, it may have potential usefulness as a tool to improve daily clinical care.",

To clarify the relation between WDEIA and HWP-containing soap and their prognosis, we retrospectively studied the patients who visited Hiroshima University Hospital and were diagnosed as WDEIA from January 2010 to June 2011. We took detailed clinical histories, performed skin prick tests, serum immunoassays for antigen-specific IgE and basophil histamine release test, and followed up their clinical courses after the diagnosis. Among 36 patients with WDEIA, 30 patients had used only one type of HWP-soap. The patients with HWP-WDEIA were mainly women and had developed facial symptoms and angioedema. They suffered from blood pressure reductions less frequently than patients with conventional WDEIA. The levels of gluten-specific IgE were higher than those of omega-5 gliadin in patients with HWP-WDEIA (P < 0.05, One-way ANOVA). All patients with HWP-WDEIA were positive against HWP in histamine release test. Among the conventional wheat antigens, glutenins induced the highest histamine release from basophils of patients with HWP-WDEIA. The sensitivities of patients against glutens and glutenins were reduced over months along with the discontinuance of HWP-soap. The development of HWP-WDEIA is associated with the use of HWP-soap. The sensitivity to HWP that cross reacts with non-processed wheat may be reduced or possibly cured after the discontinuation of HWP-soap.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although mucoid impaction of the bronchi (MIB) is a well-known manifestation in allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM), when unknown samples or plural eumycetes are cultured from bronchial materials, several problems are encountered which can affect the definitive diagnostic process or successful treatment. Case Summary: The definitive diagnostic process of two patients [a 58-(Case 1) and a 70-(Case 2) year-old female] with MIB was: 1) to identify the existence of any allergic respiratory disorder, 2) to detect the fungi obtained from bronchial materials, with use of the 28S rDNA sequencing and analysis, 3) to investigate whether the detected fungus was a probable etiologic antigen, and 4) to make the final diagnosis based on the results of the inhalation examinations using the antigenic solution of the fungi. As a treatment strategy, bronchial toilet and low dose itraconazole therapy were planned according to the clinical manifestations of each patient. Discussion: The two patients with MIB were successfully diagnosed as ABPM caused by Schizophyllum commune (Sc-ABPM) accompanied with hyperattenuating mucoid impaction. The reliability of some allergological makers as a substitution for the bronchoprovocation test should be clarified in near future. Clinical manifestations demonstrated in our cases suggested that the allergic reaction such as eosinophilic bronchoalveolitis spreading around the mucus plug was a primary lesion underlying the Sc-ABPM. The success of the treatment for Sc-ABPM will be achieved by the strategy targeting to fundamental condition and by the control of the disease recurrence by means of effective environmental management.",

    "abstract": "Background: Autoimmune pancreatitis is characterized by diffuse swelling of the pancreas and a high serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 concentration. Histopathologically, dense infiltration of lymphocytes and IgG4-positive plasma cells with fibrosis are seen in the pancreas. Although allergic diseases complicating autoimmune pancreatitis have been reported, the clinical features of bronchial asthma complicated by autoimmune pancreatitis remain unclear. Case Summary: We report three cases of bronchial asthma preceding the onset of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis by 3 months to 30 years. All three cases were males with high serum IgG, IgG4, and IgE concentrations. The radioallergosorbent tests were positive for common allergens such as mites and house dust. One case had a pulmonary manifestation that proved to be an inflammatory pseudotumor of the lung with an accumulation of IgG4-positive plasma cells. The asthma symptom was ameliorated by oral prednisolone therapy for autoimmune pancreatitis, and when the corticosteroid doses were reduced, asthma became worse in all three cases. Discussion: It is possible that atopy and increased Th2 cell activity are related to a higher coincidence of IgG4-related diseases such as type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis. Because the present cases are few in number, further studies are necessary.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the allergenicity of the A. retroflexus pollen profilin. Using sera from twelve patients allergic to A. retroflexus pollen, IgE-binding proteins from the A. retroflexus pollen extract was identified by immunoblotting. The cDNA of A. retroflexus pollen profilin was amplified, then cloned into the pET-21b (+) vector, expressed in Escherichia coli, and finally purified by metal affinity chromatography. The IgE-binding capacity of the recombinant protein was then analyzed by the ELISA, immunoblotting, and inhibition assays, as well as by the skin prick test (SPT). Immunoblotting results indicated a 14.6 kDa protein with IgE-reactivity to 33% (4/12) among A. retroflexus pollen-allergic patients. Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 399 bp encoding for 133 amino acid residues which was belonged to the profilin family and designated as Ama r 2. A recombinant Ama r 2 (rAma r 2) was then produced in E. coli as a soluble protein which showed a strong IgEreactivity via ELISA confirmed by the SPT. Inhibition experiments revealed high IgE cross-reactivities with the profilins from other plants. The profilin from the A. retroflexus pollen, Ama r 2, was firstly identified as an allergen. Moreover, rAma r 2 was produced in E. coli as a soluble immunoreactive protein with an IgE-reactivity similar to that of its natural counterpart.",

Impaired axon reflex-mediated (AXR) sweating has been observed in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the mechanism of such abnormal sudomotor axon reflex remains to be revealed.To investigate this mechanism, sudomotor function was analyzed using a quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (acetylcholine iontophoresis) in patients with AD (n = 26) and healthy volunteers (n = 12). Correlation between sudomotor function and certain background factors, including Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory score, Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score, number of circulating eosinophils, and serum concentrations of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine and immunoglobulin E radioimmunosorbent test, was validated.Latency time was significantly prolonged in AD (p = 0.0352), and AXR sweating volume (mg/0-5 min) was significantly lower in AD patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.0441). Direct sweating volume (mg/0-5 min) was comparable in AD patients and healthy controls. A significant correlation between the evaluation results of quantitative sudomotor axon reflex tests and certain background factors was not observed. The latency time in non-lesioned and lesioned areas for AD patients versus continuous anxiety value in the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the AXR versus SCORAD showed significant correlations (p = 0.0424, p = 0.0169, and p = 0.0523, respectively).Although the number of study subjects was little, abnormal AXR sweating in patients with AD was observed. Correlative analysis suggests possible involvement of continuous anxiety and the immune system in such abnormal sudomotor function.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent worldwide. COPD is a treatable disease and it is important to identify COPD subjects, highlighting the need for an efficient screening measure. Although the COPD screening questionnaire (COPD Population Screener, COPD-PS) was developed as a screening tool, its validity is not clear in population-based studies. This study determines the validity of the COPD-PS in the general Japanese population. All registered residents living in the town of Hisayama aged above 40 were solicited to participate in a health check-up in 2012. All subjects aged 40–79 without physician-diagnosed asthma or lung resection were recruited, and 2357 subjects with the COPD-PS recorded and valid spirometry measurements were analyzed. Persistent airflow obstruction (AO) was defined by post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7. The sensitivity and specificity of the COPD-PS score for identifying AO was assessed by logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of AO in this population was 6.5%. The overall area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the continuous COPD-PS score was 0.748. A cut-point of 4-points is recommended, resulting in a sensitivity of 67.1% and specificity of 72.9% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.70. The positive predictive value was 14.6% and negative predictive value was 97.0%. The COPD-PS appears to be an adequate measure for large scale screening of possible airflow obstruction requiring further testing with spirometry.",

AXR in the cubital fossa decreased in AD subjects; it positively correlated only with water-holding capacity in healthy subjects but not in patients with in AD. Furthermore,AD subjects with lichenoid eczema and either prurigo or papules over the cubital fossa showed extremely decreased AXR. These results suggest that decreased sweating is a major source of water in the stratum corneum, and decreased sudomotor function may be involved in both the cause and aggravation of representative atopic eczema in the cubital fossa.",

The aim of this study was to test whether the thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) level in serum at an early stage of a drug eruption can serve as a prognostic biomarker of systemic inflammation. Study participants included 76 patients who received a diagnosis of a drug eruption, one of the following: drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, maculopapular exanthema, and erythema multiforme. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) was eliminated in this study because scoring system for evaluating the severity was established. Correlation coefficients between serum TARC levels and indicators of systemic inflammation, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Glasgow prognostic score, modified systemic inflammatory response syndrome (mSIRS) score, and C-reactive protein in serum were evaluated. Serum TARC levels positively correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Glasgow prognostic score, mSIRS score, C-reactive protein, albumin, white blood cell count, body temperature, and pulse rate. TARC levels negatively correlated with systolic blood pressure. Among these parameters, the mSIRS score showed strong correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.68). Serum TARC levels correlate well with indicators of systemic inflammation and of disease severity among patients with a drug eruption except SJS/TEN. Serum TARC may be a prognostic biomarker of severity of inflammation in drug eruptions.",

We designed a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled 12-week trial of EIT with mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) for Japanese cedar/cypress pollinosis (JCCP). A total of 50 JCCP patients received MFNS (200 ^g once daily: n = 25) or placebo (n = 25) starting on February 1, 2010. Treatments continued until the end of April. The primary endpoint was the comparison of the total nasal symptom score (TNSS) between the MFNS and placebo groups. The secondary endpoints included comparisons of QOL, daytime sleepiness, nasal ECP levels, and safety. Continuous dispersion of Japanese cedar pollen began on February 22. Although the placebo group showed a significant worsening of symptoms after the start of the continuous dispersion, no worsening occurred in the MFNS group. A significant difference in the TNSS between the two groups was seen starting at 4 weeks after the treatment. Similar results were seen for QOL and sleepiness. Nasal ECP levels in March were significantly lower in the MFNS group. A total of 56% of the MFNS group progressed to a persistent allergic rhinitis state in accordance with the ARIA classification, as opposed to 84% of the placebo group. MFNS was well tolerated, and the plasma cortisol concentrations were similar between the two groups. EIT with MFNS for JCCP is both safe and effective. This treatment can potentially lessen symptoms and help pollinosis patients remain in the intermittent state.",

Eosinophilic (E) CRS with nasal polyps (ECRSwNP) has a higher degree of disease severity and higher frequency of comorbid asthma. Epidemiologic studies in different ethnic populations have improved understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. Here we report the clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with medically refractory CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). We recruited a total of 210 CRS patients and assessed them by nasal endoscopy, the Lund-Mackay score using computed tomography (CT), peripheral eosinophilia and smoking status. We also examined the comorbidity of asthma, effects of age and lung functions in the patients. In this study, 13% of CRSwNP patients and 20% of CRSwNP patients with peripheral blood eosinophilia exhibited obstructive lung dysfunction (FEV1/FVC < 70%) despite the absence of an asthma diagnosis. Among elderly nonsmoker patients (≥ 60 years) who had never been diagnosed with asthma, 50% of CRSwNP patients with peripheral blood eosinophilia showed decreased FEV1/FVC < 70%. Our findings suggest that asthma is under-diagnosed in CRS patients who undergo ESS, especially the elderly. Although the association between CRS and asthma has been recognized, increased attention to the comorbidity of obstructive airway diseases such as asthma is still needed for management of medically refractory CRS.",

    "abstract": "Platelets play an essential role in hemostasis to minimize blood loss due to traumatic injury. In addition, they contain various immune-associated molecules and contribute to immunological barrier formation at sites of vascular injury, thereby protecting against invading pathogens. Platelets are also crucially involved in development of allergic diseases, including bronchial asthma. Platelets in asthmatics are more activated than those in healthy individuals. By using a murine asthma model, platelets were shown to be actively involved in progression of the disease, including in airway eosinophilia and airway remodeling. In the asthmatic airway, pathological microvascular angiogenesis, a component of airway remodeling, is commonly observed, and the degree of abnormality is significantly associated with disease severity. Therefore, in order to repair the newly formed and structurally fragile blood vessels under inflammatory conditions, platelets may be continuously activated in asthmatics. Importantly, platelets constitutively express IL-33 protein, an alarmin cytokine that is essential for development of bronchial asthma. Meanwhile, the concept of development of allergic diseases has recently changed dramatically, and allergy researchers now share a belief in the centrality of epithelial barrier functions. In particular, IL-33 released from epithelial barrier tissue at sites of eczema can activate the antigen-non-specific innate immune system as an alarmin that is believed to be necessary for subsequent antigen-specific acquired immunological responses. From this perspective, we propose in this review a possible mechanism for how activated platelets act as an alarmin in development of bronchial asthma.",

On the other hand, although degrees of CysLT2 receptors expression were variable among the 5 non-asthma subjects, the expression in the asthma lung was detected on bronchial smooth muscle, epithelium and alveolar leukocytes in 2 in 2 asthma subjects. In the non-asthma specimens, antagonism of CysLT2 receptors did not affect antigen-induced bronchial contractions, even after pretreatment with the CysLT1-receptor specific antagonist, montelukast. However, in the bronchus isolated from one of the 2 asthma subjects, antagonism of CysLT2 receptors suppressed contractions, and dual antagonism of CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors resulted in additive inhibitory effect on anaphylactic contractions.CysLT2 receptors were expressed in lung specimens isolated from asthma subjects. Activation of CysLT2 receptors may contribute to antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in certain asthma population.",

NFATc1 and PU.1 transactivate osteoclast-specific gene expression and a deficiency in NFATc1 or PU.1 genes causes osteopetrosis due to an insufficient development of osteoclasts. However, the existence of cross-regulation between NFATc1 and PU.1 is largely unknown. In the present study, the role of PU.1 in NFATc1 expression was investigated. Osteoclasts were generated from mouse bone marrow cells. PU.1 knockdown was performed with siRNA introduction. The mRNA levels in siRNA-introduced cells were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The involvement of PU.1 in the NFATc1 promoter was analyzed by using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and a reporter assay. Retrovirus vector was used for enforced expression of PU.1. Introduction of PU.1 siRNA into bone marrow-derived osteoclasts resulted in a decrease in NFATc1 mRNA level. A ChIP assay showed that PU.1 bound to the NFATc1 promoter in osteoclasts. NFATc1 promoter activity was reduced in PU.1 knockdown cells as assessed by a reporter assay. PU.1 siRNA introduction also downregulated the expression of osteoclast-specific genes and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity. Enforced expression of PU.1 using a retrovirus vector increased NFATc1 expression and TRAP activity. When NFATc1 expression was knocked down by using siRNA, the induction of osteoclast-specific genes and TRAP-positive cells was suppressed without affecting the expression level of PU.1.

    "abstract": "Patients with asthma show a steeper age-related decline in pulmonary function than healthy subjects, which is often alleviated after the initiation of treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). However, there still are patients who develop irreversible airflow limitations despite receiving adequate ICS treatment. The identification of the characteristics of such patients and biomarkers of progression for airflow limitation, a functional consequence of airway remodeling, is considered important in the management of asthma. A variety of biomarkers are associated with the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) in asthma in a cross-sectional fashion. However, few biomarkers are known to reflect the decline in pulmonary function, particularly in patients with asthma who receive ICS treatment. Recently periostin, a matricellular protein that prolongs Th2/eosinophilic inflammation and reflects airway remodeling, was reported to be detected in serum. In a Kinki Hokuriku Airway disease Conference multicenter cohort study, we demonstrated that among several serum markers, high serum periostin level, particularly ≥ 95 ng/mL, was the only marker associated with a greater annual decline in FEV1 and a decline in FEV1 of ≥ 30 mL-yr- 1∙ A variant (rs9603226) of the POSTN gene that encodes periostin was also involved in the frequency of a decline in FEV1 of ≥ 30 mL-yr- 1. Our results suggest that the serum periostin level is a useful marker reflecting pulmonary function decline in patients with asthma receiving ICS.",

They were then challenged twice with pollen in eyedrops, with clinical signs being evaluated at 15 min after the first challenge and the eyes, blood, spleen, and lymph nodes being isolated at 24 h after the second challenge.The number of eosinophils in the conjunctiva and the clinical score for conjunctivitis were both significantly lower in mice fed the transgenic rice than in those fed nontransgenic rice. Oral vaccination with transgenic rice seeds also resulted in a significant increase in the production of IFN-γ by splenocytes, whereas it had no effect on the number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in the spleen or submandibular or mesenteric lymph nodes.Oral administration of transgenic rice seeds expressing hypoallergenic allergens ameliorated allergic conjunctivitis in the established setting.

However, data on this in adults are limited. A few case-series studies has documented development of food allergy among kitchen workers with hand eczema after direct contact exposure to foods. To explore the significance of hand eczema as a risk factor for food allergies in adults at the epidemiological level, we performed a cross-sectional web-based questionnaire survey on kitchen workers whose exposures were classed as occupational (cooks and food handlers, n = 1592) or non-occupational (housewives, n = 1915). Logistic regression was used to explore the association between the presence/severity of hand eczema and the risk of food allergy after adjustment for potential confounders. Current hand eczema and current diagnosed food allergy were more common among occupational kitchen workers (OKW) than among non-occupational kitchen workers (NOKW) (32.3%-vs-29.9% and 9.9%-vs-3.8%, respectively). Current hand eczema was significantly associated with increased risk of current diagnosed food allergy in OKW (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.6–3.7). Those with more severe hand eczema were more likely to suffer from allergic symptoms for foods, and diagnosed food allergy. This study illustrates a significant public health problem in the adult population, documenting a major impact of hand eczema on the ongoing adult food allergy epidemic.",

The aim of this subgroup analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of benralizumab for Japanese patients in the CALIMA trial.CALIMA was a randomised, controlled trial of 1306 patients (aged 12-75 years; registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01914757) with severe asthma uncontrolled by medium- to high-dosage inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonists (ICS/LABA). Patients received 56 weeks' benralizumab 30 mg either every 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 8 weeks (Q8W; first three doses Q4W), or placebo Q4W. The primary analysis population was patients receiving high-dosage ICS/LABA with blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL. This subgroup analysis covered Japanese patients from this group.Of 83 patients randomised in Japan, 46 were receiving high-dosage ICS/LABA and had blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL.

All patients with natto allergy had positive results in skin prick test and basophil activation test with PGA. Of these, 92.3% had a marine sport hobby, especially surfing (84.6%). PGA sensitization was independently associated with marine sports (odds ratio, 278.0, 95 percent confidence interval, 36.9-6315.9, p < 0.001) adjusted for male sex and sea bathing, but not with male sex or sea bathing.

Although corticosteroid treatment dramatically resolves these inflammations, relapse is common during the course of the disease. Approximately 50% of patients with CEP experience relapse. Subsequent to persistent disease and repeated relapse, and in cases of combined severe asthma, some CEP patients are administered corticosteroids indefinitely. Similar to patients with severe asthma who are often steroid dependent, a number of CEP patients exhibit prolonged persistent impairment of pulmonary function. Thus, CEP should be considered a potentially chronic disease requiring long-term management, rather than an acute or sub-acute disease requiring short-time therapy only. This review summarizes previous CEP studies, as well as our own cohort data, and discusses the long-term management of CEP with a particular focus on relapse, the prevalence of maintenance therapy, and persistent impairment of pulmonary function.",

    "abstract": "Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by the accumulation of lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophage lineage cells that results in the formation of non-caseating granulomas. Thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)/CCL17 is an important chemokine in the amplification of Th2 responses, which are achieved by recruiting CCR4-expressing CD4+ T lymphocytes. TARC concentrations are known to increase in the serum of sarcoidosis patients; however, its role in the assessment of severity and prognosis of sarcoidosis remains unknown. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of TARC in sarcoidosis by investigating its expression in peripheral blood and at inflammatory sites. We also examined its relationship with clinical features.Serum levels of TARC, soluble interleukin 2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and lysozyme were measured in 82 sarcoidosis patients. The Th1 and Th2 balance in circulating CD4+ T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. The immunohistochemical staining of TARC and CCR4 was performed in order to identify the source of TARC in affected skin tissues.TARC serum levels were elevated in 78% of patients and correlated with disease severity. The percentage of CCR4+ cells and the CCR4+/CXCR3+ cell ratios were significantly higher in sarcoidosis patients than in normal subjects (P = 0.002 and P = 0.015, respectively). Moreover, TARC was expressed by monocyte/macrophage lineage cells within granulomas. The abundancy as well as distribution of TARC staining correlated with its serum levels.The present results suggest that elevations in TARC drive an imbalanced Th2- weighted immune reaction and might facilitate prolonged inflammatory reactions in sarcoidosis.",

    "abstract": "The characteristic phenotype of severe asthma in Japan seems to be distilled into the following two features: low incidence of obesity and high prevalence of patients with type 2 inflammation. Only 5–7% of Japanese severe asthma patients had a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2, and more than 80% of patients with severe asthma exhibited type 2 inflammation. Although the relationship between obesity and non-type 2 inflammation is complex, the low incidence of obesity might explain the prevalence of type 2 inflammation. Some asthma cohorts in Japan have investigated the roles of type 2 biomarkers extensively, including periostin, to identify a severe phenotype, suggesting the utility of combining biomarkers to identify an exacerbation-prone subgroup. Although the prevalence of severe asthma is comparable to Western countries, the rate of asthma death and disease burden seems to be lower in Japan. These trends might be due to the system of public health insurance for the whole nation, leading to good access to hospital and asthma specialists due to the geographically narrow country. In this review article, we will discuss the definition, epidemiology, comorbidities, biomarkers, specific phenotype, and current treatment for severe asthma in Japan.",

These r values were considered both clinically relevant (i.e., r > 0.85) and statistically significant (p < 0.0001). EDN measurements from both kits positively correlated with asthma symptom severity (p < 0.0001). No serious adverse events occurred during the study.The BioTracer™ K® EDN ELISA Kit was accurate and useful in measuring EDN levels in young asthma patient serum.

Approximately 36.2% of the adult patients thought that the treatments were effective. The main reasons for CAM use were safety, convenience and low price. However, the group who spent more than $1000 on CAM felt more dissatisfaction and anxiety related to treatment at the hospital. The situation of CAM practice was not consistent and was instead influenced by the backgrounds of the subjects.Many patients who receive CAM report feeling that the effects of treatment provided by hospitals are insufficient and have concerns about the side effects of such treatments. Information regarding standard treatments, as described in the guidelines, should become widely known and diffused, and strong communication with patients should be considered.",

The identification of severe type-2/eosinophilic asthma is important for improving the management of patients with asthma.

Currently, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and serum periostin levels are considered markers of type-2/eosinophilic inflammation in asthma. However, a single-marker approach has limited the ability to diagnose severe type-2/eosinophilic asthma accurately and predict disease outcomes precisely.

A questionnaire was provided to 6824 outpatient visitors and serum levels of specific IgEs against crude antigens and pan-allergen components were measured to study the relationship between the prevalence of OAS and pollinosis in the Fukui Prefecture where there is almost no dispersal of birch pollen. The prevalence of OAS was 10.8%. The rate of pollinosis complication in the OAS group was 67.4%, and OAS was observed in 16.8% of pollinosis patients. Causative foods in order of frequency were melon, pineapple, kiwi fruit, peach, and apple. A significantly higher number of patients from the OAS group were positive for birch, alder, and timothy grass-specific IgE. The rate of positivity for anti-component IgE corresponding to pollen in OAS group was also significantly higher. Of 34 patients with OAS caused by eating apples, 28 (82.4%) were positive for Mal d1-specific IgE. Of the 52 patients with peach-induced OAS, 41 (78.8%) were positive for Pur p1-specific IgE. The concordance rates between crude antigen-specific IgE and anti-PR-10 component-specific IgE were 87.1% and 93.3% for apple and peach respectively. In regions where birch pollen is not dispersed, OAS patients have a significant association with the onset of Bet v1-associated allergy. Anti-PR-10 component IgE was useful in diagnosing OAS, and crude antigen-specific IgE was also associated with apple and peach allergies.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial asthma is a common but important chronic disease in children in all over the world. To take measures against prevalence of childhood asthma, many researchers have surveyed the actual statuses of childhood asthma in developed countries, but in most Asia-Pacific developing countries including Mongolia such surveys have never been sufficiently conducted until now. We have thought that this survey, though performed in 2009, will give important and meaningful information even now in taking measures to prevent prevailing bronchial asthma in children in Mongolia or the countries under similar statuses.The asthma prevalence and patient background information in Mongolian children aged 6-7 living in Ulaanbaatar were examined using a written questionnaire modified for their parents from that prepared by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC).The estimated prevalence of asthma in Mongolian children was 20.9%. The following 3 risk factors were found to be related to asthma: (1) having allergic rhinitis symptoms, (2) mothers' smoking, and (3) history of severe respiratory infection before 1-year-old.The asthma prevalence in Mongolian children was higher than that in the world and Asia-Pacific countries reported by ISAAC. The higher prevalence was probably attributable to households' (especially mothers) smoking in draft-free houses designed for the cold area and severe air-pollution due to rapid industrialization and urbanization in Mongolia. Smoking prohibition in the mother (including family members) and a reduction of exposure to air pollutants are urgently needed to prevent developing childhood asthma.",

Management strategy is currently limited to 1) food avoidance and 2) carrying and using rescue intramuscular epinephrine/adrenaline and oral antihistamines in the case of accidental ingestion; there is no FDA approved treatment. Recently, oral, sublingual and epicutaneous immunotherapy have been developed as active treatment of food allergy, though none have completed phase 3 study. Efficacy and safety studies of immunotherapy have been variable, though there is clearly signal that immunotherapy will be a viable option to desensitize patients. The use of bacterial adjuvants, anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies, and Chinese herbal formulations either alone or in addition to immunotherapy may hold promise as future options for active treatment. Active prevention of food allergy through early introduction of potentially offending foods in high-risk infants will be an important means to slow the rising incidence of sensitization.",

    "abstract": "Histamine is a crucial mediator in the development of anaphylaxis. Although histamine is promptly degraded because of its short half-life in plasma, basophils, which release histamine, remain in the blood for days. To explore basophils as a potential marker and their involvement in the pathogenesis of anaphylaxis, we evaluated the intracellular histamine concentration and the degree of basophil activation in anaphylaxis patients.We conducted a case-control study enrolling anaphylaxis patients and healthy controls. Basophil activation was evaluated by flow cytometry using up-regulation of CD203c expression.We enrolled 23 patients and measured their blood histamine concentration. Basophil activation was analyzed in seven of 23 patients. The median intracellular histamine concentrations at admission were significantly lower in patients compared with controls (16.4 ng/mL [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.70 to 34.0] vs. 62.3 ng/mL [IQR, 46.0 to 85.1]; p < 0.0001). The median basophil number at admission was also significantly lower in patients compared with controls (2.21 cell/μL [IQR, 0.75 to 12.3] vs. 21.0 cell/μL [IQR, 19.5 to 28.9]; p = 0.027). CD203c expression was not up-regulated in any of the seven patients in vitro, but it was up-regulated in response to anti-IgE stimulation in vitro in two patients at admission and four patients at follow-up.Anaphylaxis is associated with a decrease in intracellular histamine, and a reduced number and reactivity of peripheral basophils. Impaired basophil function and a decrease in their number and intracellular histamine levels in the circulation may reflect the underlying mechanism, suggesting that basophils may be a marker of anaphylaxis.",

The utility of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement in the differential diagnosis of persistent cough has been reported, but the influence of atopic status, which is associated with higher FeNO levels, on the diagnostic utility of FeNO has been unknown.We retrospectively analyzed 105 non-smoking patients with prolonged and chronic cough that were not treated with corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes.CPA was diagnosed in 37 patients, CVA in 40, and non-asthmatic cough (NAC) in 28. FeNO levels were significantly higher in the CPA [35.8 (7.0-317.9) ppb] and CVA [24.9 (3.1-156.0) ppb] groups than in the NAC group [18.2 (6.9-49.0) ppb] (p < 0.01 by Kruskal-Wallis test). The optimal cut-off for distinguishing asthmatic cough (AC; CPA and CVA) from NAC was 29.2 ppb [area under the curve (AUC) 0.74, p < 0.01]. Ninety-one percent of subjects with FeNO levels ≥29.2 ppb had AC. Meanwhile, 40% of AC patients had FeNO levels <29.2 ppb. Stratified cut-off levels were 31.1 ppb (AUC 0.83) in atopic subjects vs. 19.9 ppb (AUC 0.65) in non-atopic subjects (p = 0.03 for AUC).Although high FeNO levels suggested the existence of AC, lower FeNO levels had limited diagnostic significance. Atopic status affects the utility of FeNO levels in the differential diagnosis of prolonged and chronic cough.",

Recent research has indicated that periostin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. To clarify the relationship between periostin and pathogenesis in chronic bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) and to reveal the usefulness of serum periostin levels in diagnosing and managing chronic bird-related HP.We measured serum periostin in 63 patients with chronic bird-related HP, 13 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 113 healthy volunteers. We investigated the relationship between serum periostin and clinical parameters, and evaluated if the baseline serum periostin could predict the prognosis.Serum periostin was significantly higher in patients with chronic bird-related HP compared to the healthy volunteers. In chronic bird-related HP, serum periostin had significant positive correlations with serum KL-6 levels, the CD4/CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and fibrosis score on HRCT, and a significant negative correlation with the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide. Chronic bird-related HP patients with serum periostin levels exceeding ≥92.5 ng/mL and ≥89.5 ng/mL had a significantly worse prognosis and significantly higher frequency of acute exacerbation, respectively. Higher serum periostin (92.5 ng/mL or higher; binary response for serum periostin) was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.Serum periostin may reflect the extent of lung fibrosis and play an important role in pathogenesis of chronic bird-related HP. Elevated serum periostin could be a predictor of prognosis in patients with chronic bird-related HP.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing public concern on food allergy and related anaphylactic reactions that occur mainly at the community level. The perception of the disease is huge among parents who believe that 1 out of 20 children suffers from severe food allergy. The discrepancy between this self-reported prevalence and the real one when a food challenge is performed, points out the gap in the implementation of guidelines for clinical practice. Health professionals as well show scarce adherence to the guidelines both at the Emergency Departments and at the primary care level. Anaphylactic reaction are not recognized, adrenaline is under-used and self-injectable devices are not prescribed. Although education and training are limited to local, spontaneous initiatives from patient's organization and few allergists, the data so far available demonstrate that improvement in knowledge and attitudes can be achieved further to a structured program. There is the need to establish good evidence -based practices for educational intervention that should be adopted in the context of public health policies for food allergy. This would imply a change in legislation in many countries to prevent prosecution for liability of lay people administering adrenaline when properly trained. In parallel an integrated clinical care pathway should be developed by multidisciplinary and multi-professional teams in the context of national Centres of Excellence -CoE. These CoE could drive the progression to digital health create, creating networks of CoE for best practices of care and for clinical trials",

It was presumed that these patients developed allergic reaction upon cross-reaction of their IgE antibodies raised against grass pollen allergens to wheat allergens. This study aimed to clarify clinical characteristics and wheat allergens of this phenotype of WDEIA/wheat allergy, which were tentatively diagnosed as grass pollen-related wheat allergy (GPWA).A total of six patients with GPWA were enrolled, and controls were 17 patients with grass pollen allergy but no episode of wheat allergy, and 29 patients with other wheat allergies: 18 with conventional WDEIA and 11 with hydrolyzed wheat protein allergy. Sensitization to wheat proteins was determined by basophil activation test (BAT). IgE-binding proteins in wheat flour were identified by immunoblotting followed by mass spectrometry. Wheat allergen-specific IgE tests were established by CAP-FEIA system.All the six patients with GPWA were sensitized to water-soluble wheat proteins in BAT and IgE-immunoblotting, and peroxidase-1 (35 kDa) and beta-glucosidase (60 kDa) were identified as specific IgE-binding wheat proteins. The binding of patient IgE to these proteins was inhibited by pre-incubation of patient sera with grass pollen. The peroxidase-1- and beta-glucosidase-specific IgE tests identified three and four of six patients with GPWA, respectively, but only two of 29 controls, indicating high specificity of these tests.Peroxidase-1 and beta-glucosidase are specific wheat allergens for GPWA among grass pollen allergy and other types of wheat-induced food allergies.",

FEV1 improvements were rapid (by Week 2) and sustained throughout treatment. Significant and/or numerical improvements vs placebo in asthma control and quality of life were also observed throughout treatment. For each endpoint, greater efficacy was observed in patients with elevated baseline levels of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers (blood eosinophils or FeNO). Dupilumab treatment significantly reduced levels of FeNO and total IgE, but not blood eosinophils.In this subanalysis of QUEST, the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in Japanese patients was comparable to that observed in the overall intention-to-treat population, suggesting no variability in efficacy on the basis of Japanese ethnicity.

    "abstract": "Airway mucus hypersecretion is an important pathophysiological feature of asthma. MUC5AC and MUC5B are the major secreted polymeric mucins in airways, and their compositions affect mucus properties. Despite the increasing appreciation of MUC5AC and MUC5B compositions in asthmatic airways, their pathophysiological relevance remains to be fully understood in humans.In this cross-sectional study, we prospectively enrolled newly referred steroid-untreated patients with mild asthma and healthy controls. We compared induced sputum MUC5AC and MUC5B levels between patients and controls. Subsequently, we assessed the correlation between MUC5AC and MUC5B levels and clinical indices in patients. Sputum MUC5AC and MUC5B levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.Sputum MUC5AC and MUC5B levels were significantly higher in patients (n = 87) than in controls (n = 22) (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.006, respectively). The ratio of sputum MUC5AC to MUC5B tended to be higher in patients than in controls (p = 0.07). Sputum MUC5AC levels significantly and positively correlated with fractional exhaled nitric oxide at expiratory flow of 50 mL/s (Spearman's rho = 0.29, p = 0.006), sputum eosinophil proportion (rho = 0.34, p = 0.0013), and airway sensitivity (rho = 0.39, p = 0.0005). By contrast, sputum MUC5B levels significantly and positively correlated with airway sensitivity (rho = 0.35, p = 0.002) and negatively correlated with airway reactivity (rho = -0.33, p = 0.004).Sputum MUC5AC is increased by protein levels and involved in airway type 2/eosinophilic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in steroid-untreated patients with mild asthma.",

    "abstract": "Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells represent a unique subset of helper CD4+ T cells in lymphoid follicles. Recently, Tfh cells were shown to play an important role in asthma through B cell differentiation. Conventional lung DCs are classified into two major subsets: conventional type 1 (cDC1) and type 2 (cDC2). Although the two subsets are different in driving particular T cell responses, the subset that induces Tfh cells in the asthmatic lung primarily has yet to be fully elucidated.We evaluated Tfh cells, defined by the expression of CD4 and CXCR5, in HDM-challenged mice. Next, we characterized cDC1 and cDC2 purified from antigen-primed lung and examined their Tfh cell-inducing capacity. Additionally, the ability of lung DC-induced Tfh cells to cause germinal center B (GCB) cells to produce antigen-specific IgE was assessed.In HDM-challenged mice, Bcl-6-expressing Tfh cells were significantly increased in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Lung cDC2, but not lung cDC1, increased after HDM priming, and cDC2 secreted larger amounts of IL-6 with higher ICOS-L expression than cDC1. In the co-cultures with OVA-specific naïve CD4+ T cells, cDC2 from OVA-primed lung induced Bcl-6-expressing Tfh cells more efficiently, together with larger amounts of IL-6 and IL-21, than cDC1. Blockage of IL-6 or ICOS-L significantly reduced Tfh cell induction. Finally, cDC2-induced Tfh cells enabled GCB cells to produce OVA-specific IgE.In asthmatic lung, cDC2 is the primary DC subset responsible for Tfh cell differentiation and plays an important role in humoral immunity in asthma by inducing Tfh cells.",

Food items were the most frequent trigger (73%), followed by exercise after food ingestion (4.3%), and drugs (2.2%). Egg (19%) and milk (17%) specifically were the most frequent among food triggers, while the largest proportional increase was observed in tree nuts from 6.0% in 2017 to 15% in 2019. Overall, 1647 (48%) cases were admitted to the hospital, of which 26 (0.8%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Drug-induced anaphylaxis was associated with the highest admission rate (71%). Of the 2493 food-induced anaphylaxis cases, 1107 (44%) were treated with adrenaline. Among them, 343 cases included previously prescribed adrenaline auto-injectors (AAI), with 225 (66%) usages prior to hospital arrival. There was no significant difference in the admission rate between the cases in which AAIs were used and those with adrenaline administered in the hospital (68% and 72%, respectively).The proportion of tree nuts in food-induced anaphylaxis increased significantly. Although prehospital AAI use has become widespread, it was not associated with lower admission rate compared to in-hospital adrenaline usage.",

    "abstract": "Airborne insect particles have been identified as an important cause of respiratory allergies, including allergic asthma and rhinitis. In the literature, the significance of respiratory exposure to insect particles as a cause of occupational allergy has been well-documented. Indeed, many cases of occupational allergy have been reported including allergy to the larvae of flies and moths in anglers and occupationally exposed workers, to grain pests in bakers or other workers handling grains, and to crickets and/or locusts in researchers and workers in aquaculture companies. Furthermore, the prevalence of sensitization to insect allergens is considerably high among patients with asthma and/or rhinitis who are not occupationally exposed to insects, suggesting the clinical relevance of exposure to insects in indoor and outdoor environmental non-occupational settings. Exposure to cockroaches, a well-studied indoor insect, is associated with cockroach sensitization and the development and exacerbation of asthma. Booklice, another common indoor insect, were recently identified as a significant sensitizer of asthmatic patients in Japan and India, and potentially of asthma patients living in warm and humid climates around the world. Lip b 1 was identified as an allergenic protein contributing to the species-specific sensitization to booklice. Moths are considered a significant seasonal outdoor allergen and their allergens are considered to have the highest sensitization rate among Japanese patients. However, other than cockroaches, allergenic insect proteins contributing to sensitization have not been fully characterized to date.",

    "abstract": "Non-HIV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (non-HIV IRIS) is associated with the recovery from an immunocompromised condition. It is defined as inflammatory disorders caused by antigens, including drugs or pathogenic microorganisms present prior to immune recovery, or by the exacerbation of an inflammatory disorder that was already present. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome is a prototype of IRIS, and the pathophysiology of non-HIV IRIS can be recognized in several disorders treated with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, molecular-targeted drugs, TNF-α antibody drugs, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. This review focuses on the relationship between the immune mechanism of non-HIV IRIS and drug allergies, especially severe drug eruption. The antigen recognition mechanism in drug allergy varies depending on the clinical type and the causative drug. The p-i concept is the main mechanism in severe drug eruption such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome/drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Lymphocytes activated by an antigen other than a drug, such as a virus, can also develop drug allergy by the loose binding of drugs with immune receptors of T cells or human leukocyte antigen. Therefore, fluctuations in the immune environment affect the onset of severe drug eruption. Novel agents that cause major changes in immunity have been marketed mainly for autoimmune diseases and malignant tumors; therefore, it is necessary to consider their effects when treating severe drug eruptions. Moreover, although a list of diagnostic criteria for this syndrome has been drafted, predictive and diagnostic biomarkers for this syndrome needs to be urgently developed.",

    "abstract": "Mast cell activation is crucial to the development of allergic disease. New studies have shown that both IgE-dependent and -independent mast cell activation is temporally regulated by the circadian clock, a time-of-day-keeping system that consists of transcriptional-translational feedback loops of several clock genes. For instance, the core clock gene Clock controls the expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) and interleukin-33 (IL-33) receptor ST2 on mast cells in a time-dependent manner. As a result, the threshold of IgE-dependent or IL-33-dependent mast cell activation differs between daytime and nighttime. This mechanism may underlie the observation that allergic disease shows a marked day-night change in symptom occurrence and severity. Consistent with this novel concept, environmental and lifestyle factors that disturb the normal rhythmicity of the circadian clock, such as irregular eating habits, can lead to the loss of circadian control of mast cell activation. Consequently, the degree of mast cell activation becomes equally strong at all times of day, which might clinically result in worsening allergic symptoms. Therefore, further understanding of the association between mast cell activation and the circadian clock is important to better manage patients with allergic disease in the real world, characterized by a \"24/7 society\" filled with environmental and lifestyle factors that disturb the circadian clock rhythmicity.",

We examined the 3-year prognosis after LD-OFC among patients who passed and failed LD-OFC. Children with immediate-type WA aged ≤6 years with a history of reaction to ≤390 mg of wheat protein underwent their first LD-OFC with 52 mg (baseline LD-OFC). After passing the LD-OFC, children stepped up to 390, 1300, and 5200 mg step-by-step every 3–6 months. After failing LD-OFC, children repeated LD-OFC every 6–12 months. We assessed wheat tolerance defined as consuming 5200 mg without symptoms for 3 years after baseline LD-OFC. The median age of 124 children was 2.4 years, and the wheat- and ω-5-gliadin-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels (kUA/L) were 23.6 and 2.1, respectively. Upon baseline LD-OFC, 57% passed (LD-tolerant), whereas 43% failed (LD-reactive). Within 3 years, 38% of the LD-reactive group passed re-administered LD-OFC, and 70% of all participants avoided complete elimination. The percentage of the participants who became capable of consuming 390 mg (87% vs. 18%), 1300 mg (78% vs. 13%), and acquired tolerance (70% vs. 13%) was significantly higher in the LD-tolerant group than in the LD-reactive group (p < 0.001). Predictors of persistent WA in the LD-tolerant group were older age (adjusted odds ratio, 1.63), ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE level (1.62 per 10-fold increase), and other food allergies (1.94). LD-tolerant patients frequently acquired wheat tolerance within 3 years. Even if once positive, one-third could pass the re-administered LD-OFC within 3 years.",

However, excessive or abnormal mucus can have pathophysiological consequences in many pulmonary diseases, including asthma. Patients with asthma are treated with agents that relax airway smooth muscle and reduce airway inflammation, but responses are often inadequate. In part, this is due to the inability of existing therapeutic agents to directly target mucus. Accordingly, there is a critical need to better understand how mucus hypersecretion and airway plugging are affected by the epithelial cells that synthesize, secrete, and transport mucus components. This review highlights recent advances in the biology of mucin glycoproteins with a specific focus on MUC5AC and MUC5B, the chief macromolecular components of airway mucus. An improved mechanistic understanding of key steps in mucin production and secretion will help reveal novel potential therapeutic strategies.",

Because of the inherent inability of some species to breathe through the mouth, including guinea pigs, mice and rats, an upper airway response may be substantially involved in experimental asthma induced by antigen inhalation. With this in mind, we evaluated three types of nebulizers (a hand-made glassware pressure nebulizer (GPN), a DeVilbiss nebulizer (DN) and an ultrasonic nebulizer (UN)) with respect to their ability to adequately sensitize/challenge guinea pigs by antigen inhalation in bronchial asthma. Several solutions and suspensions, including antigen and AI(OH)3, were atomized with these three nebulizers. The results obtained were as follows: irrespective of the type of solution or suspension used, of the three nebulizers, GPN generated mists with the smallest diameter. The rank order of median diameter of the mists generated was GPN (1.6-2.1 μm) < DN (2.2-3.5 μm) < UN (4.3-4.7 μm). When Evans blue mists produced by the GPN were presented to guinea pigs, 79% of the mist trapped in the whole airway was found in the lung, while 49 and 79% of mists produced by DN and UN, respectively, were already deposited in the upper airway. These results strongly suggest that GPN is more useful for inhalation challenge in experimental asthma in animals.",

Because its cross-reactivity is controversial, clinicians are often confused concerning education regarding its dietary elimination. The purpose of this study was to examine the cross-reactivity between SR and other kinds of fish roe, salmon, or chicken egg (CE). Methods: We measured the specific-lgE to SR, herring roe (HR), pollock roe (PR), salmon and CE using RAST in 27 patients with a fish allergy and 26 control subjects. Then, using the sera of 2 patients with SR anaphylaxis, an ELlSA inhibition study was performed to examine the cross-reactivity between SR and HR, PR, salmon or CE. We then compared the IgE binding patterns to SR between the anaphylaxis patients and fish allergy patients with immunoblotting. Results: There were positive correlations between SR and HR or PR, but none between SR and salmon or CE. In the ELISA study using sera from two patients with SR anaphylaxis, IgE-binding to SR was inhibited more than 50% only when the sera were pre-incubated with HR, inhibited almost 50% by PR in a dose-dependent manner, but not inhibited by CE or anisakis. Salmon inhibited the IgE binding to SR more than 50% in a SR- anaphylaxis patient. The IgE binding patterns to SR from anaphylaxis patients were almost identical and unlike those of patients with fish allergy. Conclusions: There was a cross-reactivity between SR and HR, but no relationship between SR and CE.",

However, there have been few epidemiological investigations of PMA in practice. In this study, we analyzed PMA based on a questionnaire survey carried out in Japan and compared the results with those of studies reported previously.For 8 weeks from September through October 2004, a questionnaire survey was administered to patients with bronchial asthma and their attending physicians. The questionnaire surveyed asthma control, asthma-related emergencies and satisfaction in daily life. The attending physicians were questioned about patient profiles and medications. All female patients who were menstruating during the survey period and who were known to have asthma exacerbation related to menstruation were allocated to the PMA group; those who were not were allocated to the non-PMA group.The rate of PMA in female patients who were menstruating during the survey period was 11.3% in this study. Characteristic features of the PMA group (n = 54) included more severe disease, worsened disease control and more aggressive patient management, including increased oral corticosteroid use compared with the non-PMA group. The rates of emergency episodes in the PMA group were higher than in the non-PMA group. There was a significant increase in aspirin intolerant asthma (AIA, 25.5%) in the PMA group compared with the non-PMA group (8.4%).Attention should be paid to the lack of knowledge regarding PMA in patients with asthma in actual clinical settings. The low rate of PMA reported in this study may be due to the study method using self-reports of PMA by patients without sufficient knowledge, and may not be an accurate representation of the actual incidence of the disease. The clinical similarity of PMA to AIA in this study may also provide a new insight into the mechanism of PMA.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DC) play key rolls in various aspects of immunity. The functions of DC depend on the subsets as well as their location or activation status. Understanding developmental lineages, precursors and inducing factors for various DC subsets would help their clinical application, but despite extensive efforts, the precise ontogeny of various DC, remain unclear and complex. Because of their many functional similarities to macrophages, DC were originally thought to be of myeloid-lineage, an idea supported by many in vitro studies where monocytes or GM-CSF (a key myeloid growth factor) has been extensively used for generating DC. However, there has been considerable evidence which suggests the existence of lymphoid-lineage DC. After the confusion of myeloid-/lymphoid-DC concept regarding DC surface markers, we have now reached a consensus that each DC subset can differentiate through both myeloid- and lymphoid-lineages. The identification of committed populations (such as common myeloid- and lymphoid progenitors) as precursors for every DC subsets and findings from various knockout (KO) mice that have selected lymphoid- or myeloid-lineage deficiency appear to indicate flexibility of DC development rather than their lineage restriction. Why is DC development so flexible unlike other hematopoitic cells? It might be because there is developmental redundancy to maintain such important populations in any occasions, or such developmental flexibility would be advantageous for DC to be able to differentiate from any \"available\" precursors in situ irrespective of their lineages. This review will cover ontogeny of conventional (CD8 +/- DC) DC, plasmacytoid DC and skin Langerhans cells, and recently-identified many Pre-DC (immediate DC precursor) populations, in addition to monocytes and plasmacytoid DC, will also be discussed.",

With the technical advancement of CT, together with the development of analysis software, it is now possible to analyze the lung parenchymal change and airway remodeling quantitatively using CT. This article reviews the role of CT in assessing the lung structure and functions of patients with asthma and COPD.",

    "abstract": "The influence of food avoidance due to allergic symptoms in infancy on the growth of children at school age has not been well evaluated. To determine the growth of schoolchildren who avoided eggs, milk, or wheat due to immediate allergic symptoms in infancy (food avoiders in infancy) (FAI), a questionnaire on the presence of allergic diseases, as well as present height and weight, was administered to the parents of 14,669 schoolchildren. 11,473 subjects had available data. The height and weight standard deviation scores (HtSDS and WtSDS) and body mass index percentile (BMI percentile) of each subject were calculated. FAI had significantly lower WtSDS than non-FAI (P = 0.01). Among those with avoidance at age 3 years, those who avoided two or more foods and those who avoided milk had significantly lower HtSDS than their counterparts (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). FAI had a significantly lower prevalence of obesity (P = 0.01) and overweight (P = 0.002), while there was no difference in the prevalence of underweight (P = 0.58), resulting in a significantly higher prevalence of appropriate weight (P = 0.01) compared to non-FAI. Significantly lower prevalence of obesity and overweight was observed even among those who terminated the avoidance by age 3 years. FAI were less likely to be obese or overweight, resulting in a higher prevalence of appropriate weight at school age. Further investigation should contribute to better management of food allergy and obesity.",

PGD2 is the major PG produced by the cyclooxygenase pathway in mast cells. Our and others findings indicate that PGD2 is one of the potent allergic inflammatory mediators and must be a target molecule of antiallergic agent. From our data, one of PGD2 receptor antagonists show clear inhibition of airway hypersensitivity caused by allergic reaction. Concerning the role of PGE2 in allergic inflammation, conflicting results have been reported. Many experimental data suggest an individual role of each PGE2 receptor, EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4 in allergic reaction. Our results indicate the protective action of PGE2 on allergic reaction via EP3. In addition, one of EP3 agonists clearly inhibits the allergic airway inflammation. These findings indicate the value of EP3 agonists as an anti-allergic agent. In addition, some investigators including us reported that PGI2 plays an important role for the protection of the onset of allergic reaction. However, the efficacy of PGI2 analogue as an anti-allergic agent is not yet fully investigated. Finally, the role of thromboxane A2 (TxA2) in allergic reaction is discussed. Our experimental results suggest a different participation of TxA2 in allergic reaction of airway and skin. In this review, the role of PGs in allergic inflammation is summarized and the value of PGs as a target molecule for developing a new anti-allergic agent will be discussed.",

In addition, various functions of these cells seem differently modulated.

We evaluated the clinical features of 4 cases with CN allergy and investigated the allergens involved.In order to investigate the cross-reactivity between CN and pistachios, we performed ImmunoCAP inhibition tests using sera of 4 cases with positive histories of CN allergy and positive results of specific IgE measurement (ImmunoCAP) and skin prick tests. Furthermore, we analyzed the molecular weights of allergens of CN and pistachios by IgE-immunoblotting.Of the 4 cases (male : female = 1:3), there were 3 cases (patient #2-4) and 1 case (patient #1) of anaphylaxis and oral allergy syndrome, respectively. The initial symptom was an oropharyngeal symptom in 3 of the 4 cases, of which 2 cases developed anaphylaxis within 10 minutes after eating only a few pieces of CN. All 4 cases reacted positively to the skin prick test with CN, although 1 case of anaphylaxis tested negatively for CN by ImmunoCAP. Additionally, in 2 cases, IgE-binding to CN and pistachio were inhibited with both pistachios and CN, indicating cross-reactivity between CN and pistachios. IgE-immunoblotting of CN using sera from the 4 cases revealed 2 bands at molecular weights of approximately 33 kd and 42 kd, whereas that of pistachios showed a single band at 36 kd. However, IgE in all 4 sera did not bind to rAna o 2.In CN allergy, a small amount of CN could induce a severe anaphylactic reaction. Moreover, in cases of suspected CN allergy, reactions to not only CN but also pistachio, which could be cross-reactive to CN, should be examined.",

However, because TGF-β is secreted extracellulary in latent complexes, it remains unclear whether the local TGF-β expression actually drives active signaling and affects the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis. The objective of this study is to investigate whether TGF-β signaling is activated in allergic rhinitis and plays a role in the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis. An ovabumin (OVA)-sensitized and -nasally challenged mouse model of allergic rhinitis was established and phosphorylation of Smad2 in the nasal mucosa was examined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the effects of the pharmacological inhibition of endogenous TGF-β signaling on the allergic rhinitis model were histologically examined. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Smad2 in the nasal mucosa samples obtained from patients with allergic rhinitis was also evaluated. In the mouse model of allergic rhinitis, OVA challenge induced phosphorylation of Smad2 predominantly in epithelial cells in the nasal mucosa. In addition, the administration of an inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor kinase activity during OVA challenge suppressed goblet cell hyperplasia in the nasal mucosa. Furthermore, phosphorylated Smad2 expression increased in nasal epithelial cells in patients with allergic rhinitis. These results suggest that TGF-β signaling is activated in epithelial cells in the nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis and may contribute to the development of goblet cell hyperplasia.",

However, few reports have compared the major allergen of HCWs to those in gloves that are routinely used in the hospital. The aim of this study was to evaluate the major NRL allergens in gloves used by HCWs. We studied 20 HCWs who were suspected to have latex allergy (LA). We performed a skin prick test (SPT) using NRL allergens. Serological testing was performed using the ImmunoCAP™. The total amount of protein and the antigenic protein concentrations extracted from NRL gloves were measured. Four different types of FITkit™ were used to measure the concentrations of Hev b 1, 3, 5, and 6.02 in the gloves. A SPT using NRL extract identified 14 cases with positive reactions. The sensitivity and specificity of the SPT scores to the NRL glove extract were 100%. The sensitivity of latex specific IgE was 100% but the specificity was 14.2%. The sensitivity and specificity of rHev b 6.02 specific IgE were 100% in the LA group. The total amounts of protein from the medical gloves for surgery and examination were 265 μg/g and 95 μg/g, respectively. The antigenic protein concentrations in the gloves were 24.9 μg/g and 1.0 μg/g, respectively. The total amounts of the specific four allergens in the NRL gloves were 2.18 μg/g and 0.45 μg/g, respectively. We concluded that the main allergen of HCWs who have been sensitized occupationally by NRL gloves was Hev b 6.02.",

Total RNA was extracted from CD4(+) T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and subjected to microarray analysis with Illumina Human Ref8 BeadChip arrays. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to identify genes whose expression was altered during allergen exposure. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on samples collected from SAR patients and controls to verify the microarray results.Microarray analysis showed that the expression of 3 genes was significantly altered during allergen exposure. Among these 3 genes, the expression of interleukin 17 receptor beta (IL17RB) was confirmed to be upregulated in SAR patients compared to that of the IL17RB gene in healthy, non-allergic controls. The average fold change of IL17RB expression in the real-time RT-PCR experiment was 3.9 (P = 0.003).The present study identified upregulation of IL17RB during natural allergen exposure in patients with SAR, which may further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying SAR.",

JAGL 2010 provides information on diagnosis by age groups from infancy to puberty, treatment for acute exacerbations, long-term management by medication, daily life guidance, and patient education to allow physicians, not specialized in childhood asthma, to refer to this guideline for routine medical treatment.

However, a management method, including step-up or step-down of long-term management agents based on the status of asthma symptoms, is easy to understand and thus JAGL is suitable for routine medical treatment.

A retrospective survey of 243 children admitted for bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and those who tested positive for a RSV test, were observed from a single institute in Japan. Primary outcome was set as the total days of wheezing in both the outpatient clinic and during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were as follows: 1) total days of fever (37.5 °C <) during hospitalization, and 2) days of drip infusion during hospitalization. Results: When the obesity ratio was 6 and less, days of wheezing showed significant negative association with obesity ratios. In contrast, when the obesity ratio was more than 6, days of wheezing, days of fever during admission and days of drip infusion showed significant positive association with obesity ratios.

There was a significantly increased proportion of IFN-γ-producing and IL-4-producing CD8 + T cells in patients with COPD compared with control subjects (median [IQR] 73.6% [63.9%-80.7%] vs 62.0% [45.6%-73.8%], p = 0.004; and 2.6% [1.1%-6.9%] vs 1.1% [0.6%-2.2%], p = 0.002, respectively).

To elucidate the role(s) of the IL-33/ST2 pathway in asthma in individuals who had been epicutaneously sensitized to an antigen, wild-type and ST2−/− mice were epicutaneously sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and then were intranasally challenged with OVA. The degree of airway inflammation, the number of leukocytes and the activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs), The levels of cytokines and chemokines in lungs and OVA-specific IgE levels in sera were determined by histological analysis, a hemocytometer, colorimetric assay, quantitative PCR or ELISA, respectively. The number of eosinophils in BALFs, the levels of Th2 cytokines and chemoattractants in the lungs and OVA-specific IgE in sera from ST2−/− mice were significantly reduced compared with wild-type mice. Although the number of neutrophils in BALFs and the pulmonary levels of IL-17 were comparable in both mice, the levels of MPO activity in BALFs and neutrophil chemoattractants in the lung were reduced in ST2−/− mice. The IL-33/ST2 pathway is crucial for Th2-cytokine-mediated eosinophilic, rather than Th17-cytokine-mediated neutrophilic, airway inflammation in mice that had been epicutaneously sensitized with antigens and then challenged with antigen.",

We studied the presence and clinical significance of CrBs in infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis contributing to the development of asthma. Aspirated sputum samples were collected from 33 infants admitted with acute RSV bronchiolitis. The samples were then examined for the presence (or absence) of CrBs and classified into the RSV-CrB group and RSV-non-CrB group. Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and neutrophil elastase (NE) concentrations in the sputum were compared between the two groups. History of wheeze and asthma was collected at 2 years and 5 years after their discharge from hospital. CrBs were detected in 23 of the 33 subjects (69.7%). No significant difference in the ECP and the NE concentration were observed between the RSV-CrB group and RSV-non-CrB group. A significant relationship was observed between CrBs detected with RSV bronchiolitis and the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma (after 2 years: relative risk [RR], 3.09; p = 0.002; after 5 years: RR 7.00; p = 0.019). These findings suggest that a high rate of CrBs in the sputum is present in infants with RSV bronchiolitis, and notably the CrBs are associated with the progression to recurrent wheezing and asthma.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis represents a worldwide health problem. The prevalence is increasing. The aim of this study was to analyse the correlation between the severity of allergic rhinitis and an adequate treatment dose of modern oral antihistamines. From a comprehensive databank containing data from ten different open-label prospective observational studies including raw data of 140,853 patients with allergic rhinitis, symptomatology variables were analysed and scored to study the effects of treatment with four antihistamines (Desloratadine, Ebastine, Fexofenadine, Levocetirizine) alone or in combination with intranasal corticosteroids. The patient data were collected in 23,606 study centres from Germany, mostly medical specialist and some primary care physicians in private practice. The analyses were performed via individual patient data meta-analysis techniques. Finally 92,900 patient data from nine of ten studies could be analysed. One study with data of 47,953 patients was excluded due to incomplete treatment documentation. Both monotherapy analysis subgroups (Total Symptom Score and Total Nasal Symptom Score) were significantly better than those of their combinations with intranasal steroids. Monotherapy with levocetirizine was determined to be significantly more effective in lowering the Total Symptom Score (p < 0.001) and the Total Nasal Symptom Score (p < 0.05) than the other antihistamines. In the next stage, a greater positive effect of levocetirizine was demonstrated in relation to the severity of the clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis (Total Nasal Symptom Score in cases with severe symptomatology [effect size = − 0.09]). Levocetirizine asserted itself as the only antihistamine compared with the others as significant in this analysis. The study authors recommend monotherapy with the new-generation antihistamine levocetirizine, especially in severe cases of allergic rhinitis.",

This drug delivery system ensures that the time at which the peak drug concentration in the blood is reached coincides with the morning dip in respiratory function. The use of the patch also prevents excessive increase in blood drug concentrations, thereby reducing the incidence of systemic adverse reactions. Since 1998, when it was first approved in Japan and worldwide, the tulobuterol patch has been used widely in the treatment of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and evidence collected since it was approved has confirmed its clinical efficacy and safety. Because the patch is easy to use and requires only once-daily application, treatment adherence of patients using the patch is good. In this article, we discuss the rationale behind the development of the tulobuterol patch, evaluate data on its clinical efficacy and safety in the treatment of asthma and COPD, and examine the treatment adherence in individuals using the patch.",

    "abstract": "Details of the comparisons between airway and peripheral blood regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with atopic asthma are still unclear. The objective of this study is to investigate the profiles of both airway and circulating Tregs in atopic asthma. We measured the numbers of Tregs and eosinophils in induced sputum and peripheral blood in 28 patients with mild atopic asthma and compared these with numbers in 18 healthy controls. The frequency (%) of Tregs (surface CTLA4+, intracellular Foxp3+, and CTLA4+Foxp3+ on CD25highCD4+ T cells) in sputum and blood was determined by intracellular 5-color flow cytometry. We also correlated the numbers with the level of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthmatics. The mean frequencies of cells expressing CTLA4+ (19.4 ± 2.1%, p = 0.075), Foxp3+ (16.4 ± 3.3%, p = 0.001), and CTLA4+Foxp3+ (7.0 ± 1.1%, p = 0.008) in induced sputum from asthmatics were significantly lower than controls (27.2 ± 3.7%, 37.4 ± 4.7%, and 18.2 ± 3.6%, respectively), whereas in peripheral blood, there was no inter-group difference in the frequencies of cells expressing CTLA4+ (7.1 ± 1.5% vs 5.7 ± 1.7%, p > 0.05), Foxp3+ (35.7 ± 3.2% vs 21.1 ± 3.9%, p > 0.05), and CTLA4+Foxp3+ (6.6 ± 1.5% vs 4.2 ± 1.0%, p > 0.05). Moreover, the frequency of CD25highCD4+ cells expressing CTLA4+, but not Foxp3+, in induced sputum was associated with AHR (r = 0.60, p = 0.009) and airway eosinophilic inflammation (r = − 0.60, p = 0.008) in asthmatics. Airway, but not circulating, Tregs are decreased in mild atopic asthmatics, and are negatively correlated to an increase of airway eosinophilic inflammation and AHR.",

We sought to investigate the association between the maternal diet during pregnancy and the risk of eczema in infancy in Japan. Methods: A birth cohort was set up at 2 hospitals in Chiba city. Dietary habits concerning fish, butter, margarine, yogurt and natto during pregnancy was obtained from mothers just after delivery. The intake frequencies of these foods were classified into four groups: 1) daily, 2) 2-3 times a week, 3) once a week and 4) once a month or less. Diagnosis of eczema at 6 months of age was made by the presence of an itchy rash that persisted more than two months. Results: Valid data on 650 mother-baby pairs were obtained. No relationship between frequencies of the maternal intake of fish, margarine and yogurt during pregnancy and the onset rate of the babies' eczema were observed. For butter consumption, the incidence of babies' eczema was significantly higher in the group with daily intake than in those with an intake 2-3 times a week or less (p = 0.044). For natto, incidence of babies' eczema was significantly lower in the group with everyday intake than those eating it 2-3 times a week or less (p = 0.020). Conclusions: High frequency intake of natto during pregnancy possibly reduces the incidence of eczema in children at 6 months of age.",

    "abstract": "An in vitro elicitation test employing human high-affinity IgE receptor-expressing rat mast cell lines appears to be a useful method for measuring mast cell activation using a patient's IgE and an allergen; however, such cell lines are sensitive to human complements in the serum. We have recently developed a new luciferase-reporting mast cell line (RS-ATL8) to detect IgE crosslinking-induced luciferase expression (EXiLE) with relatively low quantities of serum IgE. A total of 30 patients suspected of having egg white (EW) allergy were subjected to an oral food challenge (OFC) test; then, the performances of EW-specific serum IgE (CAP-FEIA), EW-induced degranulation, and EXiLE responses in RS-ATL8 cells were compared using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The patients' sera were diluted to 1:100, which causes no cytotoxicity when sensitizing the RS-ATL8 cells for the degranulation and EXiLE tests. The area under the ROC curves was highest in the EXiLE test (0.977), followed by CAP-FEIA (0.926) and degranulation (0.810). At an optimal cutoff range (1.648-1.876) calculated from the ROC curve of the EXiLE test, sensitivity and specificity were 0.944 and 0.917, respectively. A 95% positive predictive value was given at a cutoff level of 2.054 (fold increase in luciferase expression) by logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: In contrast to in vivo tests, the EXiLE test appears to be a useful tool in diagnosing patients suspected of having IgE-dependent EW allergy without the risk of severe systemic reactions.",

However, few studies have reported the relationship between pollen count levels and the prevalence of pollinosis. To evaluate the relationship between JC pollen count levels and the prevalence of pollinosis in children, we investigated the sensitization and development of symptoms for JC pollen in two areas of Akita in northeast Japan with contrasting levels of exposure to JC pollen. The study population consisted of 339 elementary school students (10–11 years of age) from the coastal and mountainous areas of Akita in 2005–2006. A questionnaire about symptoms of allergic rhinitis was filled out by the students' parents. A blood sample was taken to determine specific IgE antibodies against five common aeroallergens. The mean pollen count in the mountainous areas was two times higher than that in the coastal areas in 1996–2006. The prevalence rates of nasal allergy symptoms and sensitization for mites were almost the same in both areas. On the other hand, the rates of nasal allergy symptoms and sensitization for JC pollen were significantly higher in the mountainous areas than in the coastal areas. The rate of the development of symptoms among children sensitized for JC pollen was almost the same in both areas. These results suggest that pollen count levels may correlate with the rate of sensitization for JC pollinosis, but may not affect the rate of onset among sensitized children in northeast Japan.",

Pharmacological studies using CysLTs indicate that 2 classes of receptors exist, namely, CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors. The former class of receptors is sensitive to the CysLT1 antagonists currently used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis, and its localization has been previously examined by our group using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques. We investigated the expression and localization of the CysLT2 receptor in human nasal mucosa by western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Methods: Human turbinates were obtained after turbinectomy from 16 patients with nasal obstruction refractory to medical therapy. To identify the cells expressing the CysLT2 receptor, double immunostaining was performed by using anti-CysLT2 receptor antibody and anti-CD31 (endothelial cell) antibody or anti-smooth muscle actin antibody. A 39 kDa band was detected on the western blots of human turbinates samples by using the anti- CysLT2 receptor antibody. The expression level of the CysLT2 receptor in patients with nasal allergy was higher than that in patients with non-allergic rhinitis. The immunohistochemical study also showed an intense im- munoreactivity for CysLT2 receptor in both vascular endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscles. Conclusions: The results indicated that the CysLT2 receptor plays a primary role in the vascular responses in the upper respiratory tract.",

Early studies suggested that this might be explained by the presence of heterogeneous airway inflammation. We aimed to assess the predictors for identifying the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids on residual FEno elevations in severe asthma. Twenty severe asthmatics with persistent FENO elevation (≥ 40 ppb) despite maintenance therapy including high-daily-dose ICS were enrolled. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), lung function, blood eosinophils, and FENO were assessed before and after 14 days treatment with 0.5 mg/kg oral prednisolone/day. ACQ, blood eosinophils, FENO level, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and the slope of the single nitrogen washout curve (∆N2) were significantly improved by treatment with prednisolone. 70% of the subjects showed ≥ 20% reductions in the FENo levels. The reduction in FENo levels was significantly correlated with the improvements in ACQ p < 0.0001), FVC (p < 0.01), FEV1 (p < 0.0001), and ∆N2 p < 0.05). Among the measurements at baseline, the FENO levels and blood eosinophil numbers were identified as significant predictors of ≥ 20% reductions in the FEFENO levels by systemic steroid therapy. Systemic corticosteroids could suppress the residual FENO elevations in more than half of the patients with severe asthma and the reduction in FENO levels was associated with improvements in asthma control and airflow limitation. The FENO levels and blood eosinophil numbers were the predictors of improved residual airway inflammation by systemic steroid therapy in severe asthma.",

However, the role of CLCA in goblet cell degranulation is not fully investigated. Niflumic acid (NFA), a relatively specific CLCA inhibitor, inhibits goblet cell metaplasia, but the effect of NFA on goblet cell degranulation has not been determined in an asthma model. Methods: Guinea pigs were sensitized with ovalbumin (OA) twice and then challenged with saline, OA, histamine, and one of the Ca2 + -dependent secretagogues, UTP. The PAS/AB-stained mucus area in the tracheal epithelium was measured with a computer image analysis system, and the morphology of mucus granules was examined by transmission electron microscopy. In the in vitro experiment, goblet cells cultured with IL-13 at the air-liquid interface were stimulated with UTP in the presence or absence of NFA, and the MUC5AC level in cell lysates was measured by ELISA. Results: The mucus areas were smaller in the OA-, histamine-, and UTP-challenged animals than in the saline-challenged animals. NFA inhibited the decrease in mucus area and morphological changes in mucus granules. UTP caused swelling and exocytosis of mucus granules and MUC5AC secretion by cultured goblet cells, and NFA inhibited these changes. Conclusions: NFA inhibited the secretory response of mucus granules in an asthma model, suggesting that CLCA may be associated with goblet cell degranulation and that CLCA inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of hypersecretion in asthma.",

The expression of PD-1 in human mastocytosis cell lines was checked by RT- PCR, western blotting and flow cytometry. We stimulated human mastocytosis cell lines (LAD2 and HMC1.2) with recombinant ligand for PD-1, PD-L1 (rPD-L1), and tested the proliferative activity and the status of signal molecules by Cell Counting Kit-8 and ELISA, respectively. Ten of 30 human cutaneous mastocytosis cases (33.3%) expressed PD-1 protein. We also found that a human mastocytosis line LAD2 cells expressed PD-1 protein on their surfaces. The administration with rPD-L1 suppressed the stem cell factor-dependent growth of the LAD2 cells. And, rPD-L1 activated SHP-1 and SHP-2 simultaneously, and decreased the phosphorylation of AKT, in LAD2 cells. In contrast, we could not detect the expression of PD-1, and the significant effect of rPD-L1 on the mutated KIT-driven growth of HMC1.2 cells.

    "abstract": "Many patients with vocal cord dysfunction (VCD), with or without asthma, receive inappropriate treatment because they are misdiagnosed as having difficult-to-control asthma alone. We developed a clinical screening check list designed to aid the diagnosis of VCD.A prospective observational study involving 80 patients aged ≥18 years, diagnosed with severe asthma. After anamnesis and physical examination, physicians completed a check list with 6 questions to identify VCD, for which the answer \"yes\" counted one point. Then patients underwent spirometry and laryngoscopy. On the basis of the laryngoscopic findings, we created three patient groups: VCD (vocal cord adduction during inspiration, n = 14); unconfirmed VCD (inconclusive findings, n = 29); and control (normal findings, n = 37). We attempted to determine whether any of those groups were associated with the responses to individual questions or sets of questions on the check list.The proportion of affirmative answers to the question \"Does pulmonary auscultation reveal wheezing, predominantly in the cervical region, and/or stridor?\" was significantly higher for the VCD group than for the other two groups (P = 0.006), notably in elderly patients. The variable \"4 or more affirmative answers\" was more common in VCD and unconfirmed VCD groups in comparison to controls (P = 0.022).A finding of wheezing or stridor on auscultation of the cervical region is suggestive of vocal cord dysfunction, especially in elderly patients, and such dysfunction can be confirmed through laryngoscopy. Our VCD screening check list proved to be useful in the screening of VCD among patients with severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Several serological tests for specific precipitin or IgG are available to demonstrate type III hypersensitivity reactions to Aspergillus species and are essential for infectious fungal disease diagnosis. These assays are also important for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) diagnosis; however, their concordance in ABPA was not well studied.Fifty-two ABPA patients diagnosed based on ISHAM criteria were enrolled. Precipitins and IgG specific to Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, or Aspergillus terreus were measured using Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion tests and ImmunoCAP method, respectively. A. fumigatus-specific IgG was also determined using complement-fixation (CF) method.Forty-eight percent of cases were double-positive for A. fumigatus-specific precipitin and IgG (ImmunoCAP), whereas 3 (6%) and 14 (28%) cases were positive for precipitin or IgG alone, respectively. Kappa coefficient between these measurements was 0.32, suggesting poor concordance. Double-positive cases were more likely to present: Aspergillus sp. in sputum culture, lower pulmonary functions, peripheral blood eosinophilia, higher total IgE and A. fumigatus-specific IgG titer than precipitin-negative cases. A. fumigatus-specific IgG (CF) was positive only in 8 (15%) cases. The presence of A. fumigatus-specific precipitin or IgG was associated with antibodies specific for other Aspergillus spp., suggesting cross-reactivity.Positive rate of A. fumigatus-specific precipitin or IgG (ImmunoCAP) was superior to IgG (CF), but relatively poor concordance was noted between precipitin and IgG (ImmunoCAP). Positive precipitin for A. fumigatus suggests more active diseases. Cross-reactivity may exist between antibodies to different Aspergillus spp. Therefore, the type III hypersensitivity results in ABPA diagnosis should be carefully evaluated.",

However, its efficacy and safety in Japanese patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) are unknown.We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in adolescent and adult CSU outpatients aged 12 to < 65 years (JAPIC-CTI No. 152786). Overall, 94, 91, and 92 eligible patients orally received placebo, rupatadine 10 mg, and 20 mg once daily for 2 weeks, respectively. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to the second week of treatment in total pruritus score (TPS, sum of daytime and nighttime pruritus scores).The results yielded a least squares mean TPS difference of -1.956 between rupatadine 10 mg versus placebo, and -2.121 between rupatadine 20 mg versus placebo (analysis of covariance, both P < 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was 8.5% for placebo, 20.9% for rupatadine 10 mg, and 17.4% for rupatadine 20 mg. Somnolence was the only adverse drug reaction to rupatadine reported in 2 or more subjects. No serious or clinically significant adverse events were observed.The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints consistently favored rupatadine 10 and 20 mg doses over the placebo. No noteworthy dose-related increase in the incidence of adverse drug reactions was observed. Rupatadine is safe and effective at a dose of 10 mg once daily, and can be safely increased to 20 mg once daily, as necessary.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is the most prevalent allergic disease of the airway, which is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation, mucus hyperproduction, and airway hyper-responsiveness. Although these pathognomonic features are mainly mediated by antigen-specific Th2 cells and their cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, recent studies have revealed that other inflammatory cells, including Th17 cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), also play a critical role in the pathogenesis of asthma. IL-22, one of the cytokines produced by Th17 cells and type 3 ILCs, has distinct functional properties, as IL-22 exclusively acts on non-hematopoietic cells including epithelial cells of mucosal surface and exhibits a broad range of action in regeneration and host protection. In accordance with the fact that lung epithelial cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of asthma, we and other groups have shown that IL-22 is involved in the regulation of allergic airway inflammation. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the biology of IL-22 and its involvement in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation.",

Since distinguishing HAE from other causes of angioedema (AE) is a critical problem in emergencies, the objective of the present study was to clarify the differences between HAE and other forms of AE.Seventy-two patients with AE were enrolled in this study. The medical history and laboratory data of patients with HAE at the first visit were compared to those with other types of AE.Subjects included 23 patients with HAE, 33 with mast cell-mediated AE, 5 with drug-induced AE and 11 with idiopathic AE. The average age of HAE onset (19.5 ± 8.0 years old) was significantly lower than in other groups. A family history of AE was noted in 82.6% of HAE patients, which was significantly higher than other groups. Swelling affecting the extremities and gastrointestinal (GI) tract was observed in the majority (60 to 80%) of HAE patients. Life threatening laryngeal edema was observed in 30.4% of HAE patients. In 95.6% of HAE patients serum levels of C4 were less than the lower limit of the normal range. In our subjects, the sensitivity and specificity of low C4 for HAE were 95.6% and 93.8%, respectively.Early onset of AE, positive family history, recurrent AE in the extremities and GI tract, and suffocation are distinctive characteristics of HAE. A low serum level of C4 is a useful marker for making a differential diagnosis of HAE.",

    "abstract": "Hypersecretion of mucin in the airway epithelium is an important feature of allergic airway diseases. Of the 3 cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs; LTC4 LTD4 and LTE4), only LTE4 is sufficiently stable to be detectable in extracellular fluids. However, LTE4 has received little attention because it binds poorly to the CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors; therefore, little is known about the effects of LTE4 on mucous secretion. Recently, studies have focused on the P2Y12 receptor as a potential receptor for LTE4, because this receptor is required for LTE4-mediated pulmonary inflammation. In our previous study, we confirmed the expression of P2Y12 receptor in human airway epithelial cells. To clarify the roles of LTE4 in airway epithelial cells, we investigated mucus secretion by LTE4 in vitro.Confluent NCI-H292 cells were stimulated with LTE4 (0.01-1 μM) for 24 h. The release and production of MUC5AC protein, a gel-forming mucin, were evaluated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Western blot analysis revealed that NCI-H292 cells expressed P2Y12 receptor protein. LTE4 significantly induced the release of MUC5AC mucin in a dose-dependent manner. Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 (10 ng/mL) and IL-13 (10 ng/mL) accelerated the LTE4-induced release of MUC5AC protein. MRS2935, a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, partially inhibited the LTE4-induced release of MUC5AC protein in the airway. In contrast, MK571, a CysLT1 receptor antagonist, did not affect the release of MUC5AC protein elicited by LTE4.These results suggest that LTE4 may play some important roles in allergic mucus secretion partially via activation of P2Y12 receptor.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of coexistence of SAR-JCP upon control status of asthma using SACRA (Self-Assessment of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Questionnaire).The design was prospective, single-center, observational study. Asthmatic patients were classified into 3 groups, patients without rhinitis, those with perennial rhinitis or those with SAR-JCP from the results of SACRA. The control status of asthma were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in SACRA and Asthma Control Test (ACT) score. They were evaluated twice, from September to January (nonpollen-season) and February to April (pollen-season) and compared.451 patients were enrolled and 325 cases (72%) were diagnosed as having comorbidity of rhinitis, among which 173 with only perennial rhinitis, while 152 with SAR-JCP. There was no significant difference in asthma control level measured by VAS and ACT score among 3 groups during nonpollen-season. The asthma control level measured by VAS (1.91-2.95) and ACT score (22.7-21.6) got worse during pollen-season among patients with SAR-JCP, even though 84% received treatment for rhinitis. Although it differed according to criteria, asthma control during pollen-season was impaired in 18-38% asthmatic patients with SAR-JCP.It is possible to minimize the influence of AR on asthma control by obtaining an accurate diagnosis and providing sufficient treatment for rhinitis.",

The signals from the ST2 receptor are mediated by the two major pathways, including AP-1 and NF-κB molecules. The present study examined whether IL-33 induced ICAM-1 expression in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). BMMCs from C57BL/6J mice, cultured in media containing IL-3 (20 ng/ml), were treated with IL-33 (50 ng/ml) for up to 72 h. ICAM-1 expression with mRNA and protein, degranulation of siRNA ICAM-1 transfected BMMCs, and cell adhesion were analyzed. In the in vivo part of the experiment rIL-33 (500 ng) was injected intradermally into the ear pinnae of mice and any resulting pathological changes were assessed. ICAM-1 mRNA expression was increased one hour after IL-33 stimulation while ICAM-1 protein attained maximum expression levels 24 h after IL-33 stimulation. Moreover, IL-33-treated BMMCs showed increased cell adhesion to the LFA-1-coated plate. However, siRNA ICAM-1 transfected BMMCs did not affect Ag/IgE-mediated degranulation level compared to the wild control siRNA. Pre-treatment with a NF-κB inhibitor dramatically reduced ICAM-1 expression in IL-33-treated BMMCs, suggesting the involvement of NF-κB in the process. In vivo study, at 6 h after IL-33 treatment, MCs histologically showed up-regulated ICAM-1 expression though the number of tryptase-positive cells did not change. These data suggest that MCs increase ICAM-1 expression and activate LFA-1 positive cells in the early phase of skin inflammation in response to IL-33.",

Patients were divided into two groups according to their clinical reactivity to these allergens based on oral food challenge outcomes and/or convincing histories of immediate reaction to causative food(s). The sIgE levels were measured using 3gAllergy and ImmunoCAP. Predicted probability curves were estimated using logistic regression analysis.We analyzed 1561 patients, ages 0-19 y (egg = 436, milk = 499, wheat = 626). The sIgE levels determined using 3gAllergy correlated with those of ImmunoCAP, classifying 355 patients as symptomatic: egg = 149, milk = 123, wheat = 83. 3gAllergy sIgE levels were significantly higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (P < 0.0001). Predictive probability for positive food allergy was significantly increased and correlated with increased sIgE levels. The cut-offs for allergic reaction with 95% predictive probability as determined by the 3gAllergy probability curves were different from those of ImmunoCAP.Measurements of sIgE against egg, milk, and wheat as determined by 3gAllergy may be used as a tool to facilitate the diagnosis of food allergy in subjects with suspected food allergies. However, these probability curves should not be applied interchangeably between different assays.",

Good construct validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between the FAQLQ-PF-J and FAIM-J scores. It discriminated parents of children with FA from those without. The scores were significantly higher (lower QoL) for parents of FA children with a history of anaphylaxis than those without, for those with >6 FA-related symptoms experienced than those with less FA-related symptoms.The FAQLQ-PF-J is a reliable and valid measure of the parental burden of FA in children.",

Few comparative studies have evaluated the risk factors associated with exacerbations in Japanese patients with asthma.We performed the prospective 1-year follow up study in Japanese patients with adult asthma. A total of 189 patients with asthma were enrolled and followed up for 1 year. Finally, 181 patients completed the study protocol.Of 181 patients, 43 patients (23.8%) had exacerbations during the follow-up period. Among the 45 patients who had exacerbations during the preceding year, 32 patients (71.1%) had exacerbations. Prevalence of patients with previous exacerbations and those with previous admissions were significantly higher in patients with exacerbations than those with no exacerbation. Logistic regression analysis also identified a significant association between exacerbations during the follow-up period and exacerbations during the preceding year, admissions during the preceding 3 years, ACT score below 20, low %FVC (<80%), or low FEV1 (<70%), respectively. Of the 55 patients with severe asthma, 29 patients (52.7%) had exacerbations. Among the 36 patients with severe asthma with previous exacerbations, 26 patients (72.2%) had exacerbations. The history of exacerbations during the preceding year was associated with a significantly increased risk of exacerbations both among the patients with severe asthma and those with non-severe asthma.This study implicated that exacerbations during the preceding year reliably predict future risk of exacerbations in Japanese patients with asthma.",

The passive IgE sensitization assay using human IgE receptor-expressing rat cell line RBL-2H3 is a powerful tool to detect biologically active allergen-specific IgE in serum samples. However, one disadvantage is that RBL-2H3 cells are vulnerable to high concentrations of human sera. Only a few human cultured cell lines are easily applicable to the passive IgE sensitization assay. However, the use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate human mast cells (MCs) has not yet been reported.The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-responsive luciferase reporter gene was stably introduced into a human iPSC line 201B7, and the transfectants were induced to differentiate into MCs (iPSC-MCs). The iPSC-MCs were sensitized overnight with sera from subjects who were allergic to cedar pollen, ragweed pollen, mites, or house dust, and then stimulated with an extract of corresponding allergens. Activation of iPSC-MCs was evaluated by β-hexosaminidase release, histamine release, or luciferase intensity.iPSCs-MCs stably expressed high-affinity IgE receptor and functionally responded to various allergens when sensitized with human sera from relevant allergic subjects. This passive IgE sensitization system, which we termed the induced mast cell activation test (iMAT), worked well even with undiluted human sera.iMAT may serve as a novel determining system for IgE/allergens in the clinical and research settings.",

There were 18 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, of which 9 involved solely paediatric subjects. Overall, sublingual immunotherapy is safe and is efficacious in Asian populations in allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. House dust-mite SLIT is effective in both mono- and polysensitized AR patients. Efficacy of SLIT is comparable to subcutaneous immunotherapy. Data on long term efficacy is lacking. A disproportionate majority of research originates from China and Japan, reflecting an asymmetry of access to SLIT within Asia. Significant disparities exist in the development of the allergy speciality, prescription patterns of SLIT, and pharmacological potencies of different SLIT products within and between Asian nations. We conclude that current available evidence suggests SLIT is efficacious in Asians but data quality of evidence is hampered by non-placebo controlled studies with methodological limitations. More data is needed in South and Southeast Asian populations. Future efforts may be directed towards improving access to SLIT in developing countries, standardization of SLIT dosage, and evaluating long term clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to examine the immunological parameters, focusing IL-10 productivity, in prophylactic sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in asymptomatic subjects sensitized to Japanese cedar pollen (JCP). This study was conducted as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple center trial, and was performed for two consecutive pollen seasons in 2012 and 2013. The present results were based only on our institution. We recruited 29 participants with specific IgE against JCP of at class 2 and higher levels without history of the pollinosis symptoms at the time of JCP scattering. The SLIT group received standardized JCP extract for five months over the pollen season. We observed and judged development of the symptoms in the pollen season. The percentage of IL-10 producing CD4+ T (Trl) cells, B cells and monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. JCP specific IgE and total IgE were also measured. The ratio of development of cedar pollinosis was significantly lower in the SLIT group compared to the placebo group in 2013. In 2012, the percentage of circulating Tr1 cells and IL-10 producing monocytes significantly increased in the SLIT group. In 2013, the percentage of circulating Tr1 cells and IL-10 producing B cells increased significantly in the SLIT group. The percentage of circulating IL-10 producing monocytes significantly decreased in the placebo group. Prophylactic SLIT is effective for prevention of the development of pollinosis. Induction of IL-10 producing T cells, B cells and monocytes is an important mechanism of SLIT for prevention of pollinosis in asymptomatic but sensitized subjects.",

Sixty-five patients with idiopathic urticaria were divided into 3 groups by a difference of their titers. All patients in the high titer (≥40U/ml) group underwent endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract with antral biopsy for the Rapid Urease Test (RUT) or a culture test. We investigated the relationship between the efficacy of eradication therapy against H. pylori and urticaria.The positive rate for H. pylori was 100% (20/20) by RUT or culture test in the high titer group. A CR using antihistamines alone was 0% (0/20) in the high titer group, 27.2% (3/11) in the low titer group and 38.2% (13/34) in the negative group respectively. A CR or PR using antihistamines was 70% (14/20) in the high titer group, 81.8% (9/11) in the low titer group and 97.1% (33/34) in the negative group. After successful eradication therapy, the CR was increased to 56% (9/16) in the high titer group.Regardless of acute or chronic urticaria, a high titer of anti H. pylori IgG antibody can be an indicator for undergoing upper endoscopy, and eradication therapy is strongly recommended. It will be necessary to develop diagnostic criteria for urticaria associated with H. pylori.",

    "abstract": "Forestry and field workers who work outdoors are at high risk for Hymenoptera stings and may develop occupation-related allergies from being stung. However, clinical and immunological surveys of Hymenoptera stings in the occupational setting have rarely been reported. We surveyed the natural history of Hymenoptera stings in Japanese forestry workers (FWs) and electrical facility field workers (EFFWs), and we assessed the utility of measuring specific (s)IgE Ab to Hymenptera venom.Questionnaires on hornet and paper wasp stings were completed by 999 FWs, 354 EFFWs, and 365 office workers as controls between July and November 2009. Sera from these participants were tested for sIgE Ab levels to Hymenptera venom with a CAP system using a fluoroenzyme immunoassay.Of the participants who had experienced Hymenoptera stings, 914 (91.5%) were FWs, 293 (82.8%) were EFFWs, and 295 (80.8%) were controls. Of the participants who had experienced systemic reactions, 210 (21.0%) were FWs, 51 (14.4%) were EFFWs, and 39 (10.7%) were controls. sIgE Ab in response to hornet and wasp venom was positive (≥ class 2) in 42.4% and 41.4% of FWs, 30.1% and 31.4% of EFFWs, and 15.1% and 18.1% of controls, respectively. The likelihood of being sIgE-positive to wasp and hornet venom was significantly higher in FWs and EFFWs than in controls (P < 0.05).21% of FWs and 14% of EFFWs had experienced systemic reactions to Hymenoptera stings with a higher frequency compared with office workers in the same area. 40% of FWs and 30% of EFFWs had sera that were sIgE positive to Hymenoptera venom.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between airborne particulate matter (PM) and pulmonary function in children has not been consistent among studies, potentially owing to differences in the inflammatory response to PM, based on PM types and sources. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of airborne PM on pulmonary function in schoolchildren and its potential for an inflammatory response.Daily morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured in 339 schoolchildren in February 2015. Interleukin (IL)-8 production was assessed in THP1 cells stimulated by airborne PM collected every day during the study period, and these IL-8 concentrations are described as the daily IL-8 levels. A linear mixed model was used to estimate the association between PEF values and the daily levels of suspended PM (SPM), PM diameters smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and IL-8.The daily IL-8 levels were significantly associated with those of SPM and PM2.5. A 0.83 μg/mL increase in IL-8 levels was significantly associated with a -1.07 L/min (95% confidence interval, -2.05 to -0.08) decrease in PEF. A 12.0 μg/m3 increase in SPM and a 10.0 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 were associated with a -1.36 L/min (-2.93 to 0.22) and -1.72 L/min (-3.82 to 0.36) decreases in PEF, respectively. There were no significant relationships between PEF, SPM, and PM2.5.These findings suggest that the effects of airborne PM on pulmonary function in schoolchildren might depend more on the pro-inflammatory response than the mass concentration of the PM.",

    "abstract": "P2Y purinergic receptors (P2YR) are G protein-coupled receptors that are stimulated by extracellular nucleotides. They mediate cellular effects by regulating cAMP production, protein kinase C activation, inositol trisphosphate generation, and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The P2Y6 receptor of this family is selectively stimulated by UDP, and selectively inhibited by MRS2578. In the present study, we examined the effect of UDP/P2Y6 receptor signaling on IgE-dependent degranulation in human basophils.Basophils were purified from human peripheral blood. The mRNA expression of genes encoding P2YR and ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (ENTPDase) was measured by RT-PCR. Intracellular Ca2+ influx via UDP/P2Y6 receptor signaling in basophils was detected using a calcium probe. The effect of UDP/P2Y6 receptor signaling on IgE-dependent degranulation in basophils was confirmed by measuring CD63 expression by flow cytometry. Autocrine secretion of nucleotides was detected by HPLC analysis.We showed that purified basophils express P2Y6 mRNA and that UDP increased intracellular Ca2+, which was reduced by MRS2578 treatment. UDP promoted IgE-dependent degranulation. Furthermore, MRS2578 inhibited IgE-dependent degranulation in basophils. HPLC analysis indicated that basophils spontaneously secrete UTP. In addition, basophils expressed the extracellular nucleotide hydrolases ENTPDase2, ENTPDase3, and ENTPDase8.This study showed that UDP/P2Y6 receptor signaling is involved in the regulation of IgE-dependent degranulation in basophils, which might stimulate the P2Y6 receptor via the autocrine secretion of UTP. Thus, this receptor represents a potential target to regulate IgE-dependent degranulation in basophils during allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Patch testing of contact allergens to diagnose allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a traditional, useful tool. The most important decision is the distinction between allergic and irritant reactions, as this has direct implications on diagnosis and management. Our objective was to evaluate a new method of non-contact infrared reading of patch tests. Secondary objectives included a possible correlation between the intensity of the patch test reaction and temperature change.420 positive reactions from patients were included in our study. An independent patch test reader assessed the positive reactions and classified them as allergic (of intensity + to +++) or irritant (IR). At the same time, a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera attachment for an iPhone was used to acquire infrared thermal images of the patch tests, and images were analyzed using the FLIR ONE app.Allergic patch test reactions were characterized by temperature increases of 0.72 ± 0.67 °C compared to surrounding skin. Irritant reactions only resulted in 0.17 ± 0.31 °C temperature increase. The mean temperature difference between the two groups was highly significant (p < 0.0001) and therefore was used to predict the type of contact dermatitis.Thermography is a reliable and effective way to distinguish between allergic and irritant contact dermatitis.",

C1-INH-HAE cases with no mutation in the coding region of SERPING1 after conventional genotyping were examined for defects in the intronic or untranslated regions of the gene. Using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform targeting the entire SERPING1, 14 unrelated C1-INH-HAE patients with no detectable mutations in the coding region of the gene were sequenced. Detected variants with a global minor allele frequency lower than the frequency of C1-INH-HAE (0.002%), were submitted to in silico analysis using ten different bioinformatics tools. Pedigree analysis and examination of their pathogenic effect on the RNA level were performed for filtered in variants. In two unrelated patients, the novel mutation c.-22-155G > T was detected in intron 1 of the SERPING1 gene by the use NGS and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. All bioinformatics tools predicted that the variant causes a deleterious effect on the gene and pedigree analysis showed its co-segregation with the disease. Degradation of the mutated allele was demonstrated by the loss of heterozygosity on the cDNA level. According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics 2015 guidelines the c.-22-155G > T was curated as pathogenic. For the first time, a deep intronic mutation that was detected by NGS in the SERPING1 gene, was proven pathogenic for C1-INH-HAE. Therefore, advanced DNA sequencing methods should be performed in cases of C1-INH-HAE where standard approaches fail to uncover the genetic alteration.",

We conducted an epidemiological study involving the staff of the University of Fukui Hospital and its associated hospital in 2006. There were 1540 participants aged ≥20 years, and the rates of Japanese cedar (JC) pollinosis and mite-induced perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) were 36.8% and 15.8%, respectively. In 2016, we conducted a second survey. The rate of sensitization to JC pollen and mites and the prevalence of JC pollinosis and mite-induced PAR were analyzed based on data from questionnaires and antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. In the present study, we analyzed data of 1472 participants aged between 20 and 59 years. Total sensitization to JC pollen and total prevalence of JC pollinosis were 57.8% (851/1472) and 40.8% (601/1472), respectively. Total sensitization to mites and total prevalence of mite-induced PAR were 41.4% (610/1472) and 18.8% (276/1472), respectively. Total prevalence of JC pollinosis and mite-induced PAR increased significantly over a decade. Among the 334 people who participated in the 2006 and 2016 cross-sectional studies, 13% of JC pollinosis and 36% of mite-induced PAR experienced remission. However, since the number of new onset cases was higher that the number of remission cases, a slight increase in prevalence was observed over a decade. The prevalence of JC pollinosis and mite-induced PAR continues to show increasing trends, accompanied by an increase in antigen exposure. The remission rate of JC pollinosis was particularly low.",

In contrast, IL-33, together with retinoic acid, induces IL-10-producing immunosuppressive ILC2s. In this review, we discuss how the allergic cytokine milieu and other immune cells direct the generation of trained ILC2s with immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive recall capability in allergic diseases and infections associated with type 2 immunity. The molecular mechanisms of trained immunity by ILCs and the physiological relevance of trained ILC2s are also discussed.",

This post-marketing surveillance aimed to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of omalizumab in Japanese pediatric patients with severe allergic asthma in real-life setting.This 104-week, multicenter surveillance was conducted from September 2013 to May 2019 by central registration method. Patients with severe allergic asthma aged ≥6 and < 15 years at initiation of treatment who were first-time omalizumab users were included. The primary endpoints included incidence of adverse drug reactions and physician's Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness (GETE). The secondary endpoints included incidence of serious adverse events, adverse events and adverse drug reactions of special interest and asthma exacerbation-related events.Of the 128 patients enrolled, 127 completed the surveillance and were included for safety and effectiveness analysis. Thirteen patients experienced 20 adverse drug reactions with an incidence rate of 10.2%. The most frequent adverse drug reactions were pyrexia (2.4%) and urticaria (1.6%). In total, adverse events and serious adverse events occurred in 60 (47.2%) and 30 patients (23.6%) respectively. Two patients experienced anaphylactic reaction and 1 patient experienced type 1 hypersensitivity. 77.2% had an effective response to omalizumab according to GETE at final assessment, and frequency of all asthma exacerbation-related events decreased in post-treatment versus pre-treatment.Long-term omalizumab treatment showed no new safety signals in pediatric patients with severe allergic asthma. The observed safety and effectiveness profile was consistent with previous studies.",

This study aimed to elucidate the prevalence of allergen sensitization among the healthy population in Japan using serum samples stocked in the Japanese Red Cross for blood donation. Age- and gender-stratified serum samples (n = 800) from residents in Tokyo aged 20–59 years were randomly selected from the stocked serum obtained for blood donation in 2005. Total and specific IgE antibodies to 17 inhaled allergens were measured by the ImmunoCAP method. Individuals with positive (≥0.35 UA/mL) specific IgE antibodies to at least one inhaled allergen were defined as atopic. Stocked serums from donors aged 20–29 years in Sapporo, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Okinawa (n = 200 each) were also obtained for the measurement of IgE to six common inhaled allergens, to evaluate regional differences in the rate of positivity. Among residents in Tokyo, the prevalence of atopy was 78.0% and highest in men aged 20–29 years (94.0%), which decreased with age. The prevalence of specific IgE antibodies was highest for Japanese cedar pollen (66.8%), followed by cypress pollen (46.8%), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (38.3%), and moths (30.1%). Examination of IgE to Japanese cedar pollen, D. pteronyssinus, and moths identified 97.6% of atopic subjects in Tokyo. There were substantial regional differences in the prevalence of pollen IgE positivity. This study demonstrated an extremely high prevalence of positivity in inhaled allergen-specific IgE antibodies among healthy adults in Japan.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and phenotyping can facilitate understanding of disease pathogenesis and direct appropriate asthma treatment. This nationwide cohort study aimed to phenotype asthma patients in Japan and identify potential biomarkers to classify the phenotypes.Adult asthma patients (n = 1925) from 27 national hospitals in Japan were enrolled and divided into Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) steps 4 or 5 (GINA 4, 5) and GINA Steps 1, 2, or 3 (GINA 1-3) for therapy. Clinical data and questionnaires were collected. Biomarker levels among GINA 4, 5 patients were measured. Ward's minimum variance hierarchical clustering method and tree analysis were performed for phenotyping. Analysis of variance, the Kruskal-Wallis, and chi-square tests were used to compare cluster differences.The following five clusters were identified: 1) late-onset, old, less-atopic; 2) late-onset, old, eosinophilic, low FEV1; 3) early-onset, long-duration, atopic, poorly controlled; 4) early-onset, young, female-dominant, atopic; and 5) female-dominant, T1/T2-mixed, most severe. Age of onset, disease duration, blood eosinophils and neutrophils, asthma control questionnaire Sum 6, number of controllers, FEV1, body mass index (BMI), and hypertension were the phenotype-classifying variables determined by tree analysis that assigned 79.5% to the appropriate cluster. Among the cytokines measured, IL-1RA, YKL40/CHI3L1, IP-10/CXCL10, RANTES/CCL5, and TIMP-1 were useful biomarkers for classifying GINA 4, 5 phenotypes.Five distinct phenotypes were identified for moderate to severe asthma and may be classified using clinical and molecular variables (Registered in UMIN-CTR; UMIN000027776.).",

Gene expression profiles of nasal polyps obtained from patients with ECRS or NECRS were evaluated using RNA sequencing.S100A8 was identified as a significantly upregulated gene in nasal polyps associated with ECRS. Immunohistochemistry consistently revealed intense S100A8 staining in nasal polyps from patients with ECRS. Human nasal epithelial cells expressed the receptor for advanced glycation end products and Toll-like receptor 4. Recombinant S100A8 protein induced interleukin-1β secretion in human nasal epithelial cells.Our data demonstrate that S100A8 results in production of interleukin-1β in the nasal epithelium, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of ECRS.",

Polygamma glutamic acid (PGA) in the sticky substance around natto beans has been reported to be a causative allergen of natto allergy.

The sticky substance of natto beans contains a subtilisin family serine protease, nattokinase, along with PGA. In this study, we aimed to examine the antigenicity of nattokinase in natto allergy.Eight patients, who developed symptoms after ingesting natto and positively reacted to natto (seven to the sticky substance in natto and one to the whole natto product) in their SPT, were enrolled in this study. To analyze IgE reactivity, we performed immunoblotting, ELISA, and SPT for natto (bean and sticky substance), and/or PGA, and/or nattokinase and/or cultured B. subtilis var. natto extract.In the SPT, four cases each were PGA-positive and PGA-negative. Immunoblotting of the sera from PGA-negative patients showed a protein band at 30 kDa, which was identified as nattokinase. Three PGA-negative cases, but not three PGA-positive cases, showed a positive reaction to nattokinase in the SPT and had a history of atopic dermatitis. The ELISA for nattokinase revealed a positive reaction of PGA-negative cases and negative reaction of PGA-positive cases in the SPT.We identified a subtilisin family serine protease, nattokinase, as a novel allergen in natto allergy patients unsensitized to PGA.",

However, no study has identified the changes and effects in the changes of the blood eosinophil counts over time in both diseases. This study aimed to demonstrate blood eosinophil variability in patients with COPD and severe asthma based on these backgrounds.A total of 172 patients with COPD from the Hokkaido COPD cohort study and 96 patients with severe asthma from the Hokkaido Severe Asthma Cohort Study, whose blood eosinophil counts were measured annually over a 3-year period, were analyzed. The factors contributing to consistently high or low blood eosinophil counts were examined in each cohort. The stability of the eosinophil classification (<150, 150-299, ≥300 cells/μL) was compared based on the number of asthma-like features in patients with COPD and the smoking status in patients with severe asthma.Among all the patients, the most stable range of baseline blood eosinophil counts differed between the two diseases, with <150 cells/μL in COPD and ≥300 cells/μL in severe asthma. In COPD, the number of asthma-like features (bronchodilator reversibility, blood eosinophilia, and atopy) affects the blood eosinophil count variation patterns. In severe asthma, smoking status did not affect the blood eosinophil count variation patterns.We identified variations in the blood eosinophil counts and their contributing factors in patients with COPD and severe asthma.",

This study aimed at identifying fish allergens of salmon and grass carp and evaluating the sensitization pattern in fish allergic subjects from two distinct populations in Asia. One hundred and three fish allergic subjects were recruited from Hong Kong (67 subjects) and Japan (46 subjects). Western blot and mass spectrometry were used to identify allergens from salmon and grass carp. Fish allergens were purified and tested against 96 sera on ELISA to analyze patients' sensitization pattern. The protein profiles of salmon meat prepared under different cooking methods until core temperature reached 80 °C were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Three common allergens between salmon and grass carp, namely enolase, glycerldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and parvalbumin, and two salmon-specific allergens collagen and aldolase were identified. Parvalbumin was the major allergen for both fishes showing an overall sensitization rate of 74.7%, followed by collagen (38.9%), aldolase (38.5%) and enolase (17.8%). Japanese subjects showed more diverse allergen sensitization pattern and more frequent IgE-binding to heat-labile salmon allergens. Compared with steaming and boiling, cooking by baking and frying retained more fish proteins inclusive of heat-labile allergens. Fish allergic patients from different Asian populations show varying fish allergen sensitization profiles. The relevant extracts and components for diagnosis are population-dependent but parvalbumin and collagen are important biomarkers. Cooking methods modify allergen composition of salmon and appear to influence patients' allergic manifestations.",

Dupilumab is approved for severe/refractory asthma inadequately controlled by existing therapies, but knowledge of its effect on real-world disease burden is lacking. This study investigates real-world effects of dupilumab on asthma exacerbation risk and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in Japanese individuals with asthma.This retrospective, cohort study used a Japanese insurance claims database to identify patients who started dupilumab between 26 March 2019-31 May 2020. Patients were followed for ±365 days from dupilumab initiation. The study primarily assessed the annual incidence rate of severe asthma exacerbations occurring simultaneously with hospitalizations or OCS bursts. Secondary and exploratory endpoints assessed OCS dosage and duration, and healthcare resource utilization (HRU), respectively.At dupilumab initiation (N = 215), mean age was 57.2 years, 41.9% of patients were aged ≥65 years, and 59.5% were female. Dupilumab significantly reduced the annual incidence of severe asthma exacerbations from 1.29 to 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.76) per patient per year. Mean OCS dosage decreased from 10.4 to 7.2 mg/day in chronic OCS users; median frequency of OCS bursts decreased from 3 to 0. Both unscheduled outpatient visits (35.8% vs 29.8%) and hospitalizations (21.9% vs 12.1%) decreased. Mean (standard deviation) duration of hospitalization also decreased from 6.7 (27.6) to 2.2 (8.1) days.Japanese patients with asthma who received dupilumab had reduced incidence rates of severe asthma exacerbations, OCS use, and HRU over 12 months.",

Interestingly, reflecting their function in positive or negative regulation of immune cells, levels of some semaphorins are increased while others are decreased in patients with allergic diseases.

However, epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between child allergies and maternal intake of n-3 PUFAs or fish have yielded inconsistent results. Following exclusions from a dataset comprising 103,057 records from the Japan Environment and Children's Study, 72,105 participants were divided into five groups according to mothers' intake of n-3 PUFAs or fish during pregnancy to assess the risk of their children being diagnosed with allergy by 3 years old. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for child allergies were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analyses with reference to the lowest intake group. Levels of maternal intake of n-3 PUFAs or fish showed inverted associations (i.e., reduced risk) with the incidence of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or parent-reported symptoms of current rhinitis with eye symptoms at different time points and the cumulative incidence from birth to 3 years of age. Inverted associations were also found for current wheeze at 1-<2 years of age and current eczema at 1-<2 and 0-<3 years of age. However, for food allergies, no significant associations were observed in the incidence in each group compared with the lowest intake group at any age. The findings suggest that n-3 PUFA intake during pregnancy may reduce the risk of developing allergic diseases and symptoms in children. In addition, consumption of n-3 PUFAs or fish is very unlikely to increase the risk of allergy given that the results are from a country with high fish consumption.

Our study aimed to identify potential asthma phenotypes among adults divided by age as either younger or older than 65 years. We also compared differences in blood granulocyte patterns, occupational asthmagens, and asthma control-related outcomes among patient phenotype clusters. We recruited nonelderly (<65 years old) (n = 726) and elderly adults (≥65 years old) (n = 201) with mild-to-severe asthma. We conducted a factor analysis to select 17 variables. A two-step cluster analysis was used to classify subjects with asthma phenotypes, and a discriminant analysis was used to verify the classification of cluster results. There were three clusters with different characteristics identified in both the nonelderly and elderly asthmatic adults. In the nonelderly patient group, cluster 2 (obese, neutrophilic phenotypes) had a 1.85-fold significantly increased risk of asthma exacerbations. Cluster 3 (early-onset, atopy, and smoker with an eosinophil-predominant pattern) had a 2.37-fold risk of asthma exacerbations and higher oral corticosteroid (OCS) use than cluster 1 (late-onset and LMW exposure with paucigranulocytic blood pattern). Among elderly patients, cluster 2 had poor lung function and more ex-smokers. Cluster 3 (early-onset, long asthma duration) had the lowest paucigranulocytic blood pattern percentages in the elderly group. The novelty of the clusters was found in age-dependent clusters. We identified three distinct phenotypes with heterogeneous characteristics, asthma exacerbations and medicine use in nonelderly and elderly asthmatic patients, respectively. Classification of age-stratified asthma phenotypes may lead to precise identification of patients, which provides personalized disease management.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of compounds have been tested over the years in a search for adjuvants to incorporate with antigens or allergens to enhance the immune response. Despite this, aluminum salts have been the only adjuvants that have been both registered for clinical application and used on a large scale until recently. Salts of aluminum, such as aluminum hydroxide, have been used as general immunologic adjuvants for several decades. Some allergen vaccines used for the treatment of allergy are still formulated with aluminum-based adjuvants. These formulations have generally proved efficacious and have a good safety profile compared with simple aqueous extracts. However, there is reported sensitivity and toxicity associated with use of aluminum. In addition, aluminum salts are known to be potent stimulators of T helper (h) 2 cell activity. Because Th2 activity directs towards an allergic response, aluminum salts are potentially counterproductive when used as adjuvants in the immunologic treatment of type 1 hypersensitivity. Many soluble and insoluble molecules have been reported to have adjuvant activity in experimental systems. Some of these have been used clinically, but side effects, such as local granuloma formation, have led to their withdrawal from clinical use. Newer depot-type adjuvants, such as insoluble calcium salts, tyrosine (now registered) and coupled alginates, may eliminate some of the potential problems of aluminum salts and are currently used in some allergy vaccines but have not as yet formed a complete replacement. Liposomes, iscoms and biodegradable microspheres are now being considered for clinical use as adjuvants for both oral and parenteral routes. Soluble adjuvants that are capable of directing the immune response in a more selective way are currently in development for use in allergy vaccines. One of these, the Th1-directing adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL®; Corixa, Seattle, WA, USA), is now in clinical use in allergy vaccines formulated with the depot adjuvant L-tyrosine. Other ways of stimulating a Th 1 response using immunostimulatory DNA sequences (immunostimulatory DNA sequences (ISS) or CpG motifs) as 'built-in' adjuvants are being studied. Further interesting adjuvants reported in the literature, such as Montanide ISA 720, SAF-m, RC-529 and QS21, may also be applicable to allergy vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Background: In addition to parvalbumin, the well- known major allergen in fish, collagen was recently identified as a new allergen in the muscle of bigeye tuna and in the skin of several species of fish. The aim of the present study was to evaluate fish muscle colla- gens for their reactivity with IgE in fish-allergic patients and antigenic cross-reactivity. Methods: Collagen was purified from the white muscle of five species of fish (Japanese eel, alfonsin, mackerel, skipjack and bigeye tuna) by acid extraction and salt precipitation, whereas parvalbumin was purified from bigeye tuna by gel filtration and reverse- phase HPLC. The IgE reactivities to collagen and parvalbumin were examined by ELISA, whereas antigenic cross-reactivity among fish muscle collagens was investigated by ELISA inhibition experiments. Results: When 15 sera from fish-allergic patients were subjected to ELISA using bigeye tuna collagen and parvalbumin, 10 sera reacted only to parvalbumin, two reacted only to collagen, two reacted to both collagen and parvalbumin and one reacted to neither collagen nor parvalbumin. The sera containing specific IgE to bigeye tuna collagen also reacted to collagens from the other four species of fish. In the ELISA inhibition experiments, bigeye tuna collagen inhibited the binding of IgE not only to bigeye tuna collagen, but also to that from the other four species of fish, suggesting cross-reactivity among the collagens from five species of fish. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that some Japanese fish-allergic patients have specific IgE to fish muscle collagen and that fish muscle collagen is a cross-reactive allergen among various species of fish.",

Her diet diary revealed that symptoms occurred after ingestion of colorful sweets such as candies and jellybeans. Open challenge tests with food additives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were performed after elimination of these items. Skin prick tests using additives and NSAIDs, which were dissolved in saline, and prick- prick tests using candies and jellybeans, were carried out.Open challenge tests with Tartrazine, aspirin and acetaminophen were positive, whereas skin prick tests using additives and NSAIDs and prick-prick tests using candies and jellybeans were all negative. Consequently, intolerance to azo dyes and NSAIDs such as aspirin was diagnosed. However, she appeared to react to multiple chemical odors such as those of cigarette smoke, disinfectant, detergent, cleaning compounds, perfume, and hairdressing, all while avoiding additives and NSAIDs. On the basis of her history and the neuro-ophthalmological abnormalities, a diagnosis of severe MCS was made and she was prescribed multiple vitamins and glutathione.The present results suggest that in pediatric MCS, food and drug additives containing azo dyes might play important roles as elicitors.",

We compared cough sensitivity among patients with pure cough variant asthma who did not develop bronchial asthma after an observation period of at least 1 year, patients with bronchial asthma and healthy individuals. The continuous cough sensitivity test using the Astograph® was reproducible and reliable. Cough sensitivity in patients with pure cough variant asthma was significantly higher than that in healthy individuals.

Methods: A total 14 serum and 7 tissue samples from patients with Kimura's disease were studied. The concentrations of ECP and cytokines (interleukin-4 (IL-4), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin 5 (IL-5)) in sera from patients with Kimura's disease were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The density of eosinophils and the degree of activation of eosinophils in the tissue were also studied immunohistochemically. Results: The concentration of ECP in sera from patients with Kimura's disease was significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). At the time of the remission, a significant decrease of ECP was observed. In interfollicular areas, most infiltrated eosinophils were positive for EG2 antibody (64.0-94.0%) and the mean percentage of EG2-positive eosinophils was 75.7%. The concentrations of IL-4, gM-CSF, and IL-5 in sera from patients with Kimura's disease were within normal ranges or below the detectable level in all sera examined. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that eosinophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of Kimura's disease and ECP may be used as an additional parameter of disease activity.",

Mast cells (MCs) have been reported to play an important role in allergic diseases, such as urticaria and bronchial asthma. There is an increasing body of clinical evidence that MCs are recruited into allergic reactions by non-IgE-dependent mechanisms. Human MCs are activated and secrete histamine in response to neuropeptides, such as substance P and somatostatin, mediated by a GPCR, MRGX2. The microenvironment surrounding MCs in their resident tissues is likely to contain multiple factors that modify antigen-dependent MC activation. MCs express various GPCRs, and since the function of human MCs is modulated by various GPCR ligands, such as adenosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate, which are present in high levels in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic patients, the GPCRs expressed on MCs may play an important role in human allergic diseases. The GPCRs expressed on MCs may serve as drug targets for the treatment of allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophils play a pivotal role in allergic inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that they not only function as terminal effector cells but have potential to interact with allergen and initiate immune responses. We investigated cytokine production from eosinophils through direct interaction with a major allergen, house dust mite (HDM). Purified eosinophils from HDM-sensitized or non-sensitized donors were cultured with HDM extract or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 or 40 h. A panel of cytokine gene expression in eosinophils was examined by means of real-time RT-PCR. Released cytokines in the culture supernatants were assessed with a specific ELISA. In some experiments, HDM was pretreated with protease inhibitors, then added to the culture. Cytokines tested for gene expression were interleukin (IL)-2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16,17, 18, TGF-p1 and GM- CSF,. LPS induced small enhancement of GM-CSF gene expression at 18 h. At 40 h, HDM induced about 60-fold enhancement of IL-9 gene expression. IL-9 protein was also detected in the culture supernatants at 60 h. Those reactions were observed regardless of HDM sensitization status of the donors. HDM-induced IL-9 expression was completely inhibited with a serine protease inhibitor, AEBSF, not with a cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64. Accumulated eosinophils in the airways in asthma may directly react with HDM and produce IL- 9 to further promote Th2-type immune responses. Protease-activated receptor 2, a ligand for serine proteases, which contained in HDM, may be involved in the reaction.",

However, basophils of certain individuals do not release histamine, because of dysfunctions in their intracellular signal transduction (non-responder). To overcome potential shortcomings of the histamine releasing test, we applied surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to detect the activation of basophils. Basophils of patients with allergy, and those of non-allergic volunteers were isolated from peripheral blood. A batch of basophils obtained from a healthy volunteer was treated with lactic acid and IgE of a patient with atopic dermatitis in order to replace their endogenous IgE. They were fixed on the sensor chip of the SPR apparatus, pretreated with or without various inhibitors for intracellular signal transduction, and exposed to the antigens or anti-IgE antibody. When basophils were sensitized with antigen specific IgE, they immediately caused the increase of resonance angle (AR) in response to either anti-IgE antibody or corresponding antigens, even when they did not release histamine. Moreover, the dose dependent reactions of basophils were reflected by the increase of AR as well as the release of histamine. The increase of AR in response to anti-IgE antibody was reduced by pre-treatment of basophils with inhibitors for intracellular signal transduction, but not more than the level for his- tamine release. SPR biosensors may be superior to the histamine release test for studying functions of human basophils including those not releasing histamine.",

Seven patients with suspected hypersensitivity to fermented soybeans, from whom informed consent had been obtained, underwent skin prick-prick tests with fermented soybeans and challenge test with fermented soybeans. Additionally, specific IgE against fermented soybeans and the allergens of fermented soybeans were detected by ELISA and IgE-immunoblotting, respectively. Seven male patients, aged 26 to 42 years (mean age, 33.1 years), participated. All patients reported generalized urticaria and dyspnea; 5, loss of consciousness; 2, collapse; 2, vomiting; and 2, diarrhea after fermented soybean ingestion.

Various cells, inflammatory mediators and cytokines participate in the production of airway inflammation upon respiratory virus infection. Bronchial epithelial cells are a site of infection and replication of respiratory virus. They actively participate in the production of airway inflammation: 1) they produce various proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and mediators; and, 2) they undergo apoptosis, thereby impairing the repair process. It is therefore important to understand the role of bronchial epithelial cells in the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma.

(1) The airflow reversibility is usually important for the diagnosis of asthma. However, patients with long disease histories may have poor reversibility. The reversibility test in COPD is useful for predicting the treatment response. (2) In some of the stable asthmatic patients without attack, the concave downslope of flow- volume curve is present. In severe COPD, the flow in the second half of the curve is smaller than that of rest- breathing. (3) Inspiratory capacity (IC) is a good estimator of air trapping and of predicting the exercise capacity in COPD or persistent asthma. (4) Peak expiratory flow (PEF) can be an important aid in both diagnosis and monitoring of asthma. PEF is not used in COPD because the main disorder is in the peripheral airway. (5) Measurements of airway responsiveness may help to a diagnosis of asthma. However, many COPD cases also have it. (6) Impulse oscillation system (IOS) revealed that the predominant airway disorders in asthma and COPD are central and peripheral respiratory resistance, respectively. However, some asthma patients have larger values of peripheral component. (7) Dlco reflects the extent of pathological emphysema and it is useful for the follow-up of COPD, whereas Dlco is not decreased in asthma. (8) The patient with widened A-aDO2 and alveolar hypoventilation may lead to the life threatening hypoxia in severe asthma attack or severe COPD. When PaCO2 overcomes PaO2, the patient should immediately be treated by mechanical ventilation.",

Montelukast 5 mg, 10 mg or pranlukast 450 mg and the corresponding placebo were orally administered to patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis three times a day for 2 weeks. Non-inferior efficacy of montelukast 5 mg and 10 mg to pranlukast 450 mg was investigated by the change from the baseline in the composite nasal symptoms scores over the 2-week treatment period. Montelukast 5 mg, 10 mg once daily and the pranlukast 450 mg/day showed significant improvements in the change from the baseline in the composite, daytime and nighttime nasal symptom scores, and the improvement lasted for 2 weeks. Montelukast 5 mg and 10 mg were non-inferior to pranlukast 450 mg in the change from the baseline in the composite nasal symptoms scores. The incidence rates of adverse experiences and drug-related adverse experiences were not significantly different among the three treatment groups. The results indicate that administration of montelukast 5 mg and 10 mg once daily are potent alternatives for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis and demonstrated that the efficacy and the safety profiles are comparable with pranlukast 450 mg/day.",

Recombinant food allergens offer new perspectives to solve problems of clinical and molecular allergology in diagnosis, research, and therapy of food allergies. So far, superoxide dismutase (s) has been identified as a panallergen and studied in different allergenic sources. Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (MnSOD) has also been reported in pistachio that may cause allergic reactions in atopic subjects. The aim of this study was to describe the cloning, expression, and purification of MnSOD from pistachio nut. The pistachio MnSOD was cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using a vector pET-32b (+). A recombinant protein was purified by metal precipitation. The protein immunoreactivity was evaluated using patients' IgE binding by means of ELISA and immunoblotting assays. The MnSOD gene from pistachio was successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli. The purified pistachio MnSOD was recognized by IgE in 10 (40%) out of the 25 sera tested. Our results also showed that this protein might trigger some cross-reactions toward IgE antibodies and thus could be considered as a panallergen. For the first time recombinant manganese superoxide dismutase from nut source was expressed as a possible allergen. This pistachio allergen could be a possible basis for cross-reactivity with MnSOD from other sources.",

This intracellular pattern recognition receptor and its adaptor protein, called apoptosis associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment and activating domain (ASC), participate in the formation of a multi-protein complex termed the inflammasome. The inflammasome is responsible for activating caspase-1 in response to microbial and endogenous stimuli. From the analysis of cellular mechanisms of urticarial rash in CAPS, we have traced caspase-1 activated IL-1β in CAPS to a surprising source: mast cells. Recently, two groups have generated gene-targeted mice that harbored Nlrp3 mutations. These mice had very severe phenotypes, with delayed growth and the development of dermatitis, but not urticaria. The reason for the differences in the skin manifestations observed with CAPS and these knock-in mice relates to the findings that the inflammasome also plays a role in contact hypersensitivity, and that IL-18, another cytokine involved with inflammasome-activation of caspase-1, may be a major player in dermatitis development.",

Among them, 68% of the patients were diagnosed with AR. Among the patients with childhood BA, 68% showed AR symptoms and 60% were diagnosed with AR. On the other hand, 49% of AR patients showed BA symptoms and 35% of them were diagnosed with BA. The symptoms of both BA and AR in the BA and AR patients were frequent in two seasons, March and April, and September and October. In addition, BA and AR symptoms often co-occurred in the patients with BA and AR.Comorbidity of BA and AR was high in both populations of BA and AR. The symptoms of both BA and AR co-occurred on both a daily and seasonal basis. These results suggested that BA and AR share a common immuno-pathogenesis in the airway and need to be treated as a single airway disease.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis is the most prevalent type I allergy in industrialized countries. Pollen scattering from trees or grasses often induces seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is known as pollinosis or hay fever. The causative pollen differs across different areas and times of the year. Impaired performance due to pollinosis and/or medication used for treating pollinosis is considered to be an important reason for the loss of concentration and productivity in the workplace. Antigen-specific immunotherapy is an only available curative treatment against allergic rhinitis. Subcutaneous injection of allergens with or without adjuvant has been commonly used as an immunotherapy; however, recently, sublingual administration has come to be considered a safer and convenient alternative administration route of allergens. In this review, we focus on the safety and protocol of subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy against seasonal allergic rhinitis. We also describe an approach to selecting allergens for the vaccine so as to avoid secondary sensitization and adverse events. The biomarkers and therapeutic mechanisms for immunotherapy are not fully understood. We discuss the therapeutic biomarkers that are correlated with the improvement of clinical symptoms brought about by immunotherapy as well as the involvement of Tr1 and regulatory T cells in the therapeutic mechanisms. Finally, we focus on the current immunotherapeutic approach to treating Japanese cedar pollinosis, the most prevalent pollinosis in Japan, including sublingual immunotherapy with standardized extract, a transgenic rice-based edible vaccine, and an immunoregulatory liposome encapsulating recombinant fusion protein.",

It is our conclusion that a number of research areas, i.e., a new source of TSLP, effects of TSLP on non-haematopoietic and haematopoietic cells, synergistic interactions of cytokines including IL-25 and IL-33 and a regulation of TSLP expression and its function, are critically needed to understand the whole picture of TSLP involvement in allergic diseases.

The objective of this study is to characterize chronic urticaria with (CU +) and without sensitization (CU-) against the ubiquitous fish parasite A. simplex in a transversal and longitudinal evaluation. 16 CU + and 22 CU- patients were included and assessed for Urticaria activity score (UAS), fish-eating habits by standardized questionnaire and cytokine production (assessed by flow cytometric bead-based array) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after stimulation with A. simplex extract or Concanavalin A (Con A). Patients were randomly put on a fish-free diet for three months and UAS, as well as cytokine production were again assessed. A difference of ≥ 1 in UAS was defined as improvement. There was no difference in UAS in both groups. Anisakis induced IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ production was higher in CU +. Con A induced IL-6 and IL-10 production was higher in CU +. CU + was associated with higher total fish intake, whereas CU- was associated with oily fish intake. The correlation of UAS was positive with oily fish, but negative with total fish intake. There was a better UAS-based prognosis in CU + without diet. Improvement was associated with higher Con A induced IL-10/IFN-γ as well as IL-10/IL-6 ratios. Further, previous higher oily fish intake was associated with improvement. Our data confirm the different clinical and immunological phenotype of CU +. Our results show a complex relationship between fish-eating habits, cytokine production and prognosis, which could have important consequences in dietary advice in patients with CU. When encountering A. simplex sensitization, patients should not be automatically put on a diet without fish in order to reduce contact with A. simplex products.",

In this study, we compared the efficacy of intranasal BTX-A to cetirizine in the treatment of AR. Fifty AR patients at the age of 26.2 ± 9.1 years (64% females), were recruited to the trial according to the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) criteria. Participants randomly received either intranasal injection of BTX-A (75 IU Dysport®) or cetirizine (10 mg/day). Symptoms (based on the ARIA) and side effects were assessed every two weeks for two months. Quality of life was evaluated before and after the study using the Rhinasthma questionnaire. Total symptom severity score of patients significantly decreased (P < 0.001) and quality of life significantly improved (P < 0.001) at the same level in both groups. Side effects included nasal dryness (4%) and epistaxis (4%) in the BTX-A group. In the cetirizine group 44% sleepiness and 4% blurred vision was reported. Conclusions: Nasal injection of BTX-A shows the same therapeutic effects as cetirizine in the management of AR. Since BTX is expensive, we do not suggest it in the first line of treatment for AR. However, BTX-A is a potential treatment for patients who are resistant or not compliant to the routine medications of AR. Further studies are required to investigate implications and limitations of BTX-A in the treatment of AR.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial asthma is a common inflammatory disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. To discover the genes and cellular pathways underlying asthma, a large number of genetic studies have been conducted. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which comprehensively assess genes related to multifactorial diseases and drug reactivity, have enhanced understanding of human diseases. From 2007, GWAS of susceptibility to asthma in Caucasian, Mexican, and African-ancestry populations have been conducted and several susceptible loci were identified. Recently, much larger consortium-based GWAS analyses of collaborative samples with adequate statistical power were performed, and the implicated genes suggested a role for communication of epithelial damage to the adaptive immune system and activation of airway inflammation. Furthermore, GWAS identified candidate loci associated with natural variations in lung function, blood eosinophilia and eosinophilic esophagitis, which is inflammation of the esophagus with abnormal infiltration of eosinophils in an allergic reaction. Comparing GWAS in asthma and these clinical phenotypes might help to clarify the mechanisms underlying asthma. Pharmacogenomics analyses using GWAS regarding genetic factors related to the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy and inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonists are ongoing now. Although a more complete collection of associated genes and pathways is needed, biologic insights revealed by GWAS provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of asthma and contribute to the development of better treatment and preventive strategies.",

In 2009, the European Society of Cardiology and European Respiratory Society jointly created guidelines for practical pulmonary hypertension classifications and treatments based on the discussions at the 4th World Symposium. This classification is characterized by division into five groups: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease; Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia; Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; and Pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms. PAH is a common and fatal complication of connective tissue disease (CTD), but pulmonary hypertension in CTD consists of PAH, pulmonary hypertension caused by myocardial involvement, pulmonary veno-occlusive disorder, pulmonary hypertension due to interstitial lung disease. PAH has been studied widely in SSc and the estimated prevalence of 7-12%. Treatment of CTD associated PAH (CTD-PAH) consists of general therapeutic options and specific treatment. Specific treatment of CTD-PAH patients is targeted to produce vasodilatation. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are indicated in cases where a sufficient decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure is seen in vasoreactivity testing. If vasoreactivity is absent in CTD-PAH patients, the treatment consists of the endothelin receptor antagonists, the prostacyclin analogues and phosphodiesterase-type 5 inhibitors. Few data are available to support the use of immunosuppression in CTD-PAH. However, some case reports suggested that a minority of CTD-PAH patients could benefit from immunosuppressive therapy. The treatment of CTD-PAH patients may differ from the treatment of idiopathic PAH.",

Although mast cells and basophils are major targets of IL33 and play important roles in IL33-mediated Th2-type immune responses, the expression mechanism of ST2 in mast cells and basophils is largely unknown. In the present study, we analyzed regulation mechanism of the human ST2 promoter in the human mast cell line LAD2 and basophilic cell line KU812. Promoter activity was determined by reporter assay with plasmids carrying the wild-type ST2 promoter obtained from human genomic DNA and its mutant. The transcription factor binding to the identified cis-element was identified by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The effect of candidate transcription factor on ST2 expression was confirmed by analyzing ST2 mRNA level in siRNA-introduced cells. Results: Reporter assay demonstrated that a cis-element of typical Ets-family binding sequence was critical for promoter activity in LAD2 and KU812. An Ets-family transcription factor PU.1 bound to this element in an EMSA. When PU.1 expression was suppressed by siRNA, sT2 mRNA level was significantly reduced in KU812. These observations indicated that PU.1 positively regulates the ST2 promoter as a transcription factor that directly transactivates the ST2 promoter via Ets-family-related cis-element in mast cells and basophils.",

The present study was conducted to analyze and compare the performances of dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices of ICS and combined drug preparations. Methods: The particle size of individual aerosols was measured according to the time-of-flight principle in terms of their aerodynamic diameter by using the aerodynamic particle sizer spectrometer Model 3321. Percent aerosolization was measured using only stage #0 and backup filters of the Andersen non-viable sampler model AN-200. Results: The particle size distribution of aerosols generated from a Turbuhaler™ and Twisthaler™ showed a mono-modal distribution of less than 5 ^m. In contrast, Diskus™ showed a polydisperse distribution, ranging from 0.5 to 20 ^m. The percentages of DPI preparations converted into aerosols with a particle size less than 11 ^m at a suction flow rate of 28.3 L/min were 5.7-6.2% for Diskus, 37.5-47.0% for Turbuhaler, and 19.8% for Twisthaler. At a suction flow rate of 60 L/min, the conversion percentages for DPI preparations into aerosols with a particle size less than 7.6 ^m were 5.9-7.5%, 78.2-86.7%, and 43.5%, respectively. Conclusions: Because in vitro differences in the aerosolization among different DPI devices containing ICS and combined drug preparations were observed, prescribers of these preparations should consider whether the patients will benefit more from the treatment of the central airways versus the peripheral airways.",

Glucocorticoids (GCs) may suppress mucus production and diminish the harmful airway obstruction. We investigated the ability of GCs to suppress mRNA expression and protein synthesis of a gene encoding mucin, MUC5AC, induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-a in human mucoepidermoid carcinoma (NCI-H292) cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying the suppression. We determined if GCs such as dexamethasone (DEX), budesonide (BUD), and fluticasone (FP) could suppress MUC5AC production induced by a combination of TGF-α and double-strand RNA, polyinosinic- polycytidylic acid (polyI:C). MUC5AC mRNA expression and MUC5AC protein production were evaluated. The signaling pathways activated by TGF-α and their inhibition by GCs were tested using a phosphoprotein assay and MUC5AC promoter assay. DEX significantly suppressed the expression of MUC5AC mRNA and MUC5AC protein induced by TGF-α. The activation of the MUC5AC promoter by TGF-α was significantly inhibited by DEX. DEX did not affect activation of downstream pathways of the EGF receptor or mRNA stability of MUC5AC transcripts. DEX, BUD, and FP suppressed MUC5AC protein expression induced by a combination of TGF-α and polyI:C in a dose-dependent manner. GCs inhibited MUC5AC production induced by TGF-α alone or a combination of TGF-α and polyI:C; the repression may be mediated at the transcriptional but not post-transcriptional level.",

    "abstract": "While Japanese guideline recommends initial control treatment for preschool children with asthma symptoms more than once a month, Western guidelines do not. To determine whether control treatment with montelukast was more effective than as-needed β2-agonists in this population, we conducted a randomized controlled trial.Eligible patients were children aged 1-5 years who had asthma symptoms more than once a month but less than once a week. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive montelukast 4 mg daily for 48 weeks or as-needed β2-agonists. The primary endpoint was the number of acute asthma exacerbations before starting step-up treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. This study is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network clinical trials registry, number UMIN000002219.From September 2009 to November 2012, 93 patients (47 in the montelukast group and 46 in the no-controller group) were enrolled into the study. All patients were included in the analysis. During the study, 13 patients (28%) in the montelukast group and 23 patients (50%) in the no-controller group had acute exacerbations with the mean numbers of 0.9 and 1.9/year, respectively (P = 0.027). In addition, 10 (21%) and 19 (41%) patients received step-up treatment, respectively. Cumulative incidence of step-up treatment was significantly lower in the montelukast group (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.92; P = 0.033).Montelukast is an effective control treatment for preschool children who had asthma symptoms more than once a month but less than once a week.",

    "abstract": "Asthma and COPD overlap (ACO) is an important clinical phenotype, due to the low-health-related quality of life (QOL), rapid decline in lung function, frequent exacerbation, and high economic burden. However, no large-scaled therapeutic trials of ACO have been conducted. At present, ACO is treated according to asthma/COPD guidelines. The goals of ACO treatment are to relieve symptoms and improve QOL and lung functions. Treatment must also prevent disease progression, airway remodeling, exacerbation, complications, and comorbidities. To achieve these goals, ACO needs first to be assessed based on pathophysiological findings. Comprehensive long-term management includes medication, reduction of risk factors, environmental improvement, patient education, rehabilitation, and vaccination. Drug treatment for ACO employs a combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting bronchodilators; long-acting muscarinic antagonists and/or long-acting β2-agonists. The dose of ICS is determined according to ACO severity. Leukotriene receptor antagonists and theophylline are used as add-on drugs. Macrolides and expectorants are recommended for reduction of mucus hypersecretion. Anti-IgE and anti–IL-5 antibodies, oral corticosteroids, and oxygen therapy are additional treatments for the most severe ACO. The therapeutic effects are evaluated using lung function tests, eosinophil counts in sputum and blood, FeNO, and symptom questionnaires. ACO exacerbation is treated by inhalation of short-acting β2-agonist and systemic corticosteroids. The doses of corticosteroids are determined based on the asthma/COPD component of the exacerbation. Administration of antibiotics is recommended if sputum is purulent. Referral to specialists is necessary in cases of inability to control symptoms by medication, uncertain diagnosis with atypical features, or severe complications and comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Omalizumab, a humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, proved efficacious and well tolerated in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) refractory to H1 antihistamines (H1AH) in the POLARIS study (NCT02329223), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in East Asian patients. However, data in Japanese patients, who have specific baseline characteristics (e.g., low angioedema incidence, different background medications) that may impact clinical outcomes, are lacking. This pre-specified analysis presents additional patient-level data over time, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data for omalizumab and IgE, and efficacy and safety data for omalizumab in Japanese patients.Japanese patients (N = 105) were randomized 1:1:1 to omalizumab 300 mg, 150 mg, or placebo by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. Efficacy and safety were assessed primarily based on changes from baseline to Week 12 in weekly itch-severity scores (ISS7) and weekly urticaria activity scores (UAS7), and incidence of adverse events (AEs), respectively. Patient-level UAS7 data over time were also reviewed.At Week 12, least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline in ISS7 were greater with omalizumab vs. placebo (-9.54 and -7.29 for omalizumab 300 mg and 150 mg, respectively, vs. placebo [-5.17]). Corresponding LSM changes from baseline in UAS7 were -21.61 and -15.59 (vs. placebo [-10.88]). Most responders in the omalizumab 300 mg group displayed improvement of disease activity within 2-4 weeks and had well-controlled symptoms during the treatment period. Overall AE incidence was similar across treatment arms.This subgroup analysis demonstrated that omalizumab is a well-tolerated, beneficial option for treatment of CSU in H1AH-refractory Japanese patients.",

    "abstract": "IL-10 is a major anti-inflammatory cytokine that prevents inflammation-mediated tissue damage. We characterized the production of IL-10 by sinonasal tissue cells following exposure to Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), which elicits cellular responses and is associated with the pathogenesis of eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS).Dispersed nasal polyp (NP) cells and uncinate tissue (UT) cells were prepared from patients with CRS with and without NP, respectively. Cells were incubated with SEB, and then the levels of IL-10 in the cell supernatants were determined. The effect of neutralizing IL-10 on SEB-induced IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ, and IL-17A production was examined. Expression of IL-10 in NPs was also determined.IL-10 was expressed in infiltrating inflammatory cells in NPs. NP cells, especially non-adherent NP cells, produced substantial amounts of IL-10 in response to SEB. Although baseline production of IL-10 was significantly higher in NP cells than UT cells, the degree of IL-10 response to SEB was not significantly different between the cell types. The degree of IL-10 production was negatively correlated with the degree of eosinophilia both in tissues and peripheral blood whereas positively correlated with the 1-s forced expiratory volume/forced vital capacity ratio. Patients with severe ECRS displayed a significant decrease in IL-10 production compared with those with non-ECRS. IL-10 neutralization significantly augmented SEB-induced IL-13 and IFN-γ production by NP cells.Impaired IL-10 production in response to SEB in NP may exacerbate the pathophysiology of ECRS including eosinophilia and lower airway obstruction.",

    "abstract": "Omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, is currently indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe allergic asthma. To measure active IgE levels in sera from patients treated with omalizumab, the IgE subfraction in complex with omalizumab should be eliminated from total IgE, and free IgE levels can then be determined. With the aim of therapeutic monitoring for anti-IgE therapy, we developed a new ELISA for free IgE. We used recombinant human soluble FcεRIα as a capture antigen and a biotinylated polyclonal anti-IgE antibody for detection. Using the newly developed ELISA, we measured the serum free IgE levels weekly in four asthmatic patients after their first omalizumab injection. We also measured the serum free IgE levels in 54 patients treated with omalizumab for over 4 weeks. This assay was technically robust, the mean recovery rate in serum was 93.16% ± 5.34%. For all patients, omalizumab treatment significantly reduced serum free IgE levels prior to the second omalizumab injection. To maintain the benefit of omalizumab, serum free IgE concentrations should be < 50 ng/ml. However, in 14 of 54 patients treated with omalizumab for over 4 weeks, serum free IgE concentrations measured by our ELISA were > 50 ng/ml. Our data suggest that the measurement of free IgE levels using our newly developed ELISA would be useful for monitoring serum free IgE levels during omalizumab therapy.",

We developed new technology for analyzing breath sounds and assessed its clinical usefulness for monitoring asthmatic children. Eighty asthmatic children and 59 non-asthmatic children underwent breath sound analysis in an asymptomatic state. Their asthma control was assessed by the Asthma Control TestTM or Childhood ACTTM scores and divided into two groups, namely, well-controlled (perfect) (n = 19) and not well-controlled (not perfect) (n = 61). Breath sounds were recorded using two sensors, located on the right anterior chest and trachea. We calculated the acoustic transfer characteristics between the two points, which indicated the relationship between frequencies and attenuation during breath sound propagation. Two indices of sound parameters, the chest wall sound index (CWI) and the tracheal sound index (TRI), were calculated from the transfer characteristics and tracheal sounds. We also developed a new parameter, the breath sound index (BSI), on a 2-dimensional diagram of CWI and TRI and tried to determine whether BSI may clarify asthma control better than CWI or TRI alone. There was a significant difference in TRI and BSI between asthmatic and non-asthmatic children (p = 0.007, p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in CWI and TRI between the well-controlled and not-wellcontrolled groups (p < 0.001). BSI discriminated between the two groups accurately (p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of BSI for asthma control were 83.6% and 84.2%, respectively. Asthma control could be evaluated using a new index calculated from breath sound analysis.",

In Japan, rebamipide eyedrops have recently been approved for the treatment of dry eye disease. Some patients with allergic conjunctival diseases such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) or atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) manifest dry eye with decreased tear break-up time only. We report patients with VKC/AKC refractory to anti-allergic treatments who responded to the combination of rebamipide eyedrops and conventional anti-allergic treatments with anti-allergic- and/or immunosuppressive/steroid eyedrops. Four patients with allergic conjunctival diseases with giant papillae (VKC or AKC) instilled rebamipide eyedrops three or four times a day for varying periods. All had dry eye with decreased tear break-up time. We evaluated changes in the size of their giant papillae using Image J software. We observed attenuation of the giant papillae in all 4 patients. In 2 patients with severe disease, whose giant papillae had become larger despite the administration of tacrolimus and steroids, the addition of rebamipide contributed to their attenuation. In 2 patients with mild disease, the giant papillae had become larger or remained the same size despite the administration of anti-allergy drugs; the addition of rebamipide eyedrops also resulted in the attenuation of their giant papillae. Our findings suggest that rebamipide eyedrops might attenuate giant papillae in patients with allergic conjunctival diseases and that these eyedrops may be useful for the treatment of not only dry eye but also of allergic conjunctival diseases.",

    "abstract": "Airway accumulation of eosinophils and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) are prominent features of bronchial asthma, though the contribution of eosinophils to the development of BHR is controversial. Similar to Th2 cell-mediated pathology, Th9 cells, characterized by IL-9-producing activity, have been demonstrated to induce airway eosinophilia and BHR. In this study, we investigated the role of eosinophils in Th9-mediated BHR by employing Th9 cell-transferred murine airway inflammation model. Ovalbumin (OVA)-specific Th2 and Th9 cells were differentiated from CD4+ T cells of DO11.10/RAG-2−/− mice in vitro and cytokine-producing activity of those cells was examined. BALB/c mice were adoptively transferred with Th2 or Th9 cells and challenged with OVA. Then, the number of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine were determined. Both in Th2 and Th9 cell-transferred mice, substantial accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs and BHR were induced by challenge with specific antigen. Nevertheless, an essential and dispensable role of eosinophils in Th2- and Th9-mediated BHR, respectively, was demonstrated by employing eosinophil-deficient mice. The neutralization of IL-9 as well as deficiency of IL-10 in the donor cells did not affect Th9-mediated BHR. In contrast to Th2-mediated and eosinophil-dependent BHR, Th9 could induce BHR independently from eosinophils and its characteristic cytokines, IL-9 and IL-10.",

    "abstract": "Background: Immediate-type wheat allergy caused by a specific hydrolyzed wheat protein (HWP-IWA), Glu- pearl 19S (GP19S), typically develops food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA), but is different from conventional FDEIA, or simple wheat allergy in many aspects. The skin prick test (SPT) is considered to be the most effective method for diagnosis of HWP-IWA. As SPT is a relatively qualitative method, we developed quantitative and high-throughput test method for HWP-IWA. Methods: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based GP19S-specific IgE assay was tested using sera from 14 HWP-IWA and five conventional wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (CO- WDEIA) patients, as well as five healthy subjects. Then a validation study at five different institutions was carried out using sera from 10 HWP-IWA and five CO-WDEIA patients, as well as five healthy subjects different from the previous studies. Results: The mean unit values converted from measured absorbance of ELISA were 68.3, 1.3 and 1.1 respectively. Furthermore, the validation study revealed reproducible results across all five institutions, with the standard deviation (SD) being 0.3-0.4 for the healthy group, 0.2-0.6 for the CO-WDEIA group, and 3.8-9.6 for HWP-IWA group except for one case. One case of HWP-IWA was excluded from analysis due to the high SD of 53.3 units, indicating that samples with a unit value > 100.0 will affect inter-laboratory reproducibility. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the ELISA-based GP19S-specific IgE assay can be used to test HWP-IWA using venous blood samples, except for those with a unit value > 100.0.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability and validity of the MPIS for children with acute asthma, including those five years or younger in age. We evaluated the inter-rater reliability and internal consistency of the MPIS by having at least two trained physicians and a nurse—each of whom was blinded to the others' scores—simultaneously examine inpatients with asthma exacerbation and rate them according to the MPIS. We also evaluated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), kappa, Cronbach's α and correlations between the MPIS and other indicators associated with asthma severity. A total of 25 children (median age, five years; 13 patients were five years or younger in age) were enrolled in this study. The MPIS showed excellent inter-rater reliability (all ages: ICC = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.94-0.97; five years or younger: ICC = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.89-0.96) and good internal consistency (all ages: Cronbach's α = 0.87; five years or younger: Cronbach's α = 0.85). The MPIS showed good correlation with a visual analogue scale assessed by the physicians. The MPIS was a sufficiently reliable assessment tool for children with acute asthma, including those five years or younger in age.",

    "abstract": ": Japanese cedar pollen (JCP) is the most common allergen for seasonal allergic rhinitis in Japan. Little is known about local production of immunoglobulin (Ig)E in people with or without Japanese cedar pollinosis. The aims of this study were to measure levels of JCP-specific IgE in nasal secretions and determine correlations with levels in serum. : Forty-six subjects were enrolled in this study, comprising 24 symptomatic subjects, 9 asymptomatic subjects sensitized to JCP, and 13 subjects not sensitized to JCP. Nasal secretions were obtained during a period of Japanese cedar dispersal, and levels of JCP-specific IgE were measured with CAP-fluorescent enzyme immunoassay. Serum JCP-specific IgE and total IgE were also measured using the same method. Results: Among the 46 subjects enrolled, JCP-specific IgE in nasal secretions was measureable in 43 subjects. Irrespective of symptom development, sensitized subjects showed higher levels of JCP-specific IgE in nasal secretions than non-sensitized subjects. A significant moderate correlation was observed between JCP- specific IgE levels in nasal secretions and serum in all 43 subjects. With stratification by subject group, only symptomatic subjects showed a substantial correlation between JCP-specific IgE levels in nasal secretions and serum. : Our results imply a certain association between JCP-specific IgE in nasal secretions and sensitization of Japanese cedar pollinosis. Therefore, levels of allergen-specific IgE in nasal secretions can be used as an alternative diagnostic marker for allergic rhinitis patients.",

    "abstract": "An environmental challenge chamber (ECC), which we refer to as the α-chamber, was built at Chiba University in 2008. The aim of this study was to validate the functionality of the ECC.The stability of the pollen distribution and concentration in the ECC and symptoms of patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis induced by cedar pollen exposure were examined. Carryover effects of symptoms induced by different exposure protocols and correlations between symptoms induced in the ECC and those in the natural cedar pollen season were also determined. All the studies using the α-chamber were conducted out of the cedar pollen season.The severity of symptoms in the chamber reached a peak about 2 hours after the start of pollen exposure and plateaued thereafter. After subjects left the chamber, the symptoms persisted for several days. There was no significant difference between the severity of symptoms at exposure levels of 8000 and 12000 grains/m3. The symptoms were significantly increased by exposure for 3 consecutive days; however, there were no carryover effects in a study performed with a two-week interval. The total nasal symptom score (TNSS) in the natural pollen season showed a weak correlation with the mean TNSS on the day of exposure and the following 3 days. Symptoms in the ECC also had weak correlations with those in the early natural pollen season.The ECC under well-controlled conditions is suitable for clinical studies and might accelerate development of treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis. A complete evaluation requires inclusion of the persistent reaction after subjects leave the ECC.",

Our global health crisis and the pandemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is clearly rooted in complex modern societal and environmental changes, many of which have effects on developing immune and metabolic responses. It is intimately related to wider environmental challenges. And it is unsurprising that many NCDs share similar risk factors and that many are associated with a rising predisposition for inflammation. Allergy is one of the earliest signs of environmental impact on these biological pathways, and may also offer an early barometer to assess the effects of early interventions. There is dawning awareness of how changing microbial diversity, nutritional patterns, sedentary indoor behaviours and modern pollutants adversely affect early metabolic and immune development, but still much to understand the complexity of these interactions. Even when we do harness the science and technology, these will not provide solutions unless we also address the wider social, cultural and economic determinants of health - addressing the interconnections between human health and the health of our environment. Now more than ever, we need a wider vision and a greater sense of collective responsibility. We need long-range approaches that aim for life long benefits of a 'healthier start to life', and stronger cross-sectoral collaborations to prevent disease. We need to give both our hearts and our minds to solving these global issues.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in our understanding of proallergic cytokines and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) indicate their critical roles in type 2 immunity-mediated disorders. Proallergic cytokines, interleukin (IL)-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, are released from epithelial cells in inflamed tissues and drive type 2 inflammation by acting on innate and acquired immune systems. ILC2s are an innate immune population that responds to proallergic cytokines by producing type 2 cytokines. In line with allergic disorders in the lung, skin, and intestine, emerging evidence suggests the involvement of proallergic cytokines and ILC2s in allergic nasal diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps (CRSwNP), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, and allergic rhinitis (AR). In CRSwNP patients, both proallergic cytokine levels and ILC2s frequency are increased in the nasal mucosa. Increased proallergic cytokine levels correlate with poorer disease outcomes in CRSwNP. Levels of nasal proallergic cytokines are also elevated in AR patients. In addition, animal studies demonstrate that cytokines are essential for the development of AR. It is becoming clear that the proallergic cytokine/ILC2s axis participates in allergic diseases by multiple mechanisms dependent upon the inflammatory context. Thus, a thorough understanding of these cytokines and ILC2s including their tissue- and disease-specific roles is essential for targeting the pathways to achieve therapeutic applications.",

The expression of IL-17A in synovial mast cells (MCs) in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) has been reported, but the frequencies of IL-17A expression in synovial MCs have varied. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IL-17A expression is upregulated in human synovial MCs in RA and to elucidate the mechanism of IL-17A expression in synovial MCs.Synovial tissues were obtained from patients with RA or OA undergoing joint replacement surgery, and synovial MCs were enzymatically dispersed. Synovium-derived cultured MCs were generated by culturing synovial cells with stem cell factor. IL-17A expression was investigated using immunofluorescence in synovial tissues. IL-17A mRNA expression and its production from MCs were examined using RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively.The number of IL-17A-positive ((+)) synovial MCs and the percentage of IL-17A(+) MCs among all the IL-17A(+) cells from RA patients were not significantly increased compared with those from OA subjects. The synovium-derived cultured MCs spontaneously released small amounts of IL-17A. Neither IgE- nor IgG-dependent stimulation increased IL-17A production from the MCs. IL-33, tumor necrosis factor-α, C5a, lipopolysaccharide or IL-23 plus IL-1β did not affect IL-17A production in MCs.The synovial MCs are not a main source of IL-17A in RA.",

    "abstract": "Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has received attention as a method for allergen immunotherapy. However, the mechanism of SLIT has not yet been fully investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of SLIT in a murine asthma model, sensitized by intranasal administration of house dust mite (HDM) extracts. Female BALB/c mice were intranasally exposed to HDM for either 3 or 5 weeks (5 consecutive days per week). Mice were administered either low-dose (0.5 mg/day) or high-dose (5 mg/day) sublingual HDM extracts for 2 weeks, followed by an additional week of intranasal exposure. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell count, cytokine levels in the BALF and lymph node cell culture supernatants, and allergen-specific antibodies were measured. Lung histology was also investigated. In mice sensitized for 5 weeks, high-dose SLIT ameliorated AHR, airway eosinophilia and goblet cell metaplasia. In mice sensitized for 3 weeks, even low dose SLIT ameliorated AHR and airway eosinophilia. Th2 cytokine levels in culture supernatants of submandibular lymph node cells in high-dose SLIT mice decreased, whereas IL-10 levels increased. Total IgA in BALF increased in mice sensitized for 3 or 5 weeks, and high-dose SLIT also increased allergen-specific IgG2a in mice sensitized for 5 weeks. These data suggest that earlier induction of SLIT in HDM-sensitized mice provides superior suppression of AHR and goblet cell metaplasia. The modulation of allergen specific IgG2a and local IgA might play a role in the amelioration of AHR and airway inflammation.",

Blood samples were analyzed for levels of antigen-specific IgE against Japanese cedar pollen (JCP) and house dust (HD1). Fecal samples were analyzed for bacterial 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) using next generation sequencing. The percent composition of gut microbes was compared between patients sensitized and unsensitized group for JCP and HD1 to determine whether the rate of sensitization to inhaled antigens associates with specific bacterial orders composing the gut microbiota. In participants aged 20–49 years, the percent composition of Bacteroidales was significantly higher among participants sensitized to JCP than in those unsensitized. The percent composition of Lactobacillales was significantly higher in participants unsensitized to HD group than in those sensitized to that antigen. In addition, participants with low Bacteroidales and high Bifidobacteriales or Lactobacillales has low sensitization rates to HD compared with high Bacteroidales and low Bifidobacteriales or Lactobacillales. The presence of bacteria of order Lactobacillales, Bifidobacteriales, and Bacteroidales in the gut microbiota may affect sensitization to inhaled allergens.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of iNOS promoter gene polymorphisms and FeNO levels in Japanese asthmatics before the introduction of asthma treatment. Asthmatics were recruited from Fukushima Medical University Hospital. Genotyping of the pentanucleotide repeat (CCTTT)n and seven previously detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the iNOS promoter lesion was performed. The relationships between the genotypes and FeNO levels before the introduction of asthma treatment were compared. In 91 asthmatics, the number of microsatellite repeats ranged from 9 to 20 and showed a bimodal distribution. According to this distribution, asthmatics were divided into two groups: genotypes with at least one long allele with more than 14 repeats (L/s or L/L) and genotypes with both short alleles with 14 or fewer repeats (s/s). No significant differences were observed in each parameter between the two groups. The mean FeNO level before treatment was significantly higher in the L/s or L/L subjects than in the s/s subjects. After treatment, the lowest FeNO level did not differ between the two groups. Three SNPs detected in the Japanese subjects were not associated with FeNO levels. The number of CCTTT repeats in the iNOS promoter region was associated with FeNO levels in asthmatics before treatment, suggesting the importance of iNOS genotype in the clinical application of FeNO for asthmatics.",

The aim of this study is to examine the association of OCP use with childhood wheeze and allergic diseases in Japan.Relevant data were extracted from a hospital based birth cohort study named as Tokyo-Children's Health, Illness and Development Study (T-CHILD) of which questionnaire conducted during pregnancy included maternal history and duration of OCP use. To identify wheeze and allergic diseases in the children, the questionnaire of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) was used. Logistic regression models were applied to estimate those association and adjustments were made for maternal history of allergy, maternal education level, maternal age at pregnancy, maternal BMI, maternal smoking during pregnancy, mode of delivery, gestational age at delivery, daycare attendance, number of previous live births, and gender of child.OCP use was associated with ever wheeze (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.40), current wheeze (aOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.50), ever asthma (aOR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.02-2.65), and ever rhinitis (aOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.30-2.80). Compared with no prior OCP use, using OCP for more than three months statistically increased the odds of ever wheeze (P = 0.012), current wheeze (P = 0.035), and ever rhinitis (P = 0.002).Our findings suggest that maternal OCP use has a role in the development of wheeze, asthma and rhinitis in children. Extended use of OCP is likely to increase the risk of wheeze and rhinitis.",

In this study, we used bronchial epithelial cells to investigate in vitro the role of the microRNA miR-155 in the expression of chemokines associated with airway inflammation. miR-155 has previously been reported to regulate allergic inflammation. BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells were cultured and transfected with mimic or inhibitor oligonucleotides to overexpress or downregulate miR-155, as confirmed by real-time PCR. Cells were then stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-13 (IL-13), and a double stranded RNA that binds Toll-like receptor 3. Expression and secretion of the chemokines CCL5, CCL11, CCL26, CXCL8, and CXCL10 were then quantified by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), a target of the IL-13 receptor, was analyzed by ELISA. Results: miR-155 overexpression significantly suppressed IL-13-induced secretion of CCL11 and CCL26. These effects were specific, and were not observed for other chemokines, nor in cells with downregulated miR-155. miR-155 overexpression also suppressed CCL11 and CCL26 mRNA, but did not affect expression of the IL-13 receptor or phosphorylation of STAT6. Conclusions: miR-155 specifically inhibits IL-13-induced expression of eosinophilic chemokines CCL11 and CCL26 in bronchial epithelial cells, even though the 3'-untranslated region of these genes do not contain a consensus binding site for miR-155.",

    "abstract": "Allergen-specific sublingual immunotherapy is a potential disease-modifying treatment for allergic asthma. Galectin-9 (Gal-9), a β-galactoside-binding protein with various biologic effects, acts as an immunomodulator in excessive immunologic reactions by expanding regulatory T cells (Treg) and enhancing transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling. We investigated the efficacy of sublingually administered Gal-9 as an adjuvant to a specific allergen in a Dermatophagoides farinae (Df)-induced mouse model of chronic asthma. BALB/c mice were intranasally sensitized with Df extract 5 days/week for 5 weeks, and then sublingual Df-allergen extract for 2 weeks (5 days/week). Three days after the final sublingual treatment, mice were intranasally challenged with Df extract. The early asthmatic response (EAR) was evaluated 5 min after the last Df challenge. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was assayed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 24 h after the last allergen challenge. Serum IgE and cytokine levels, and number of inflammatory cells in the BAL fluid (BALF) were analyzed. Sublingual Df treatment in the presence of Gal-9, but not alone, significantly reduced AHR; EAR; number of eosinophils and interleukin-13 in the BALF; and serum IgE levels. BALF TGF-β1 levels were significantly increased in the presence of Gal-9 compared with Df alone. Treg depletion blocked the inhibitory effects of Gal-9 on the EAR, AHR, eosinophilic airway inflammation, and Df-specific serum IgE levels, and suppressed BALF TGF-β1 levels. Gal-9 exhibited beneficial effects of sublingual Df allergen-specific immunotherapy in a Df-induced mouse model of chronic asthma, possibly by Gal-9-induced TGF-β1 production in the lung.",

    "abstract": "Evidence for the risk and incidence of anticonvulsant-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in Japan is scarce.We conducted a matched case-control study using a large-scale Japanese claims database. SJS/TEN cases were identified using a claims-based algorithm developed in a previous study (sensitivity 76.9%, specificity 99.0%). Conditional logistic regression with Firth's bias correction to address an issue of rare events was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for SJS/TEN for each anticonvulsant use (90 days before the index date) versus non-use. 90-day cumulative incidence of SJS/TEN per 100,000 new users was calculated for 33 anticonvulsants. Causality between anticonvulsant use and SJS/TEN in each exposed case was assessed using the algorithm of drug causality for epidermal necrolysis (ALDEN) score.From 5,114,492 subjects, we selected 71 SJS/TEN cases and 284 controls. We observed significantly increased ORs for SJS/TEN among new users of carbamazepine (OR 68.00) and lamotrigine (OR 36.00) with ALDEN scores of \"probable\" or higher. Cumulative incidence of SJS/TEN was 93.83 for carbamazepine and 84.33 for lamotrigine. One case newly exposed to phenytoin which developed SJS/TEN was rated \"unlikely\" in ALDEN causality, resulting in cumulative incidence of 66.27. Cumulative incidence of SJS/TEN was 25.23 for levetiracetam, 7.52 for clonazepam, and 1.23 for diazepam, but their ALDEN scores were \"very unlikely\".This study is the first to document the differential risk of SJS/TEN for anticonvulsants in a real-world setting in Japan. Exposure to carbamazepine and lamotrigine was associated with an increased risk of SJS/TEN.",

    "abstract": "Decreased gut microbiota diversity is associated with gut dysbiosis and causes various diseases, including allergic diseases. We investigated the relationship between gut microbial diversity and sensitization to major inhaled allergens. Furthermore, the relationship of allergic symptom onset with bacterial composition in sensitized individuals was investigated.This study included 1092 local residents who had participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project in 2016. Blood samples were analyzed to ascertain specific IgE levels against major inhaled allergens (JCP, HD1, Grass-mix, Weed-mix). Nasal symptoms were estimated by questionnaires. Fecal samples were analyzed for bacterial 16S rRNA using next generation sequencing. The diversity index (α-diversity, β-diversity) and the composition of gut microbes in phylum/order levels were compared between patients sensitized or unsensitized to allergen, and symptomatic and asymptomatic groups.Some α-diversity metrics were significantly decreased in patients who were sensitized to any/all four allergens compared with the unsensitized group. β-diversity differed significantly between those unsensitized and sensitized to all allergens (aged 20-49 years), and between those unsensitized and sensitized to any/all four allergens (aged ≥50 years). The relative abundance of Bacteroidales was significantly lower in the unsensitized than in the sensitized group. The composition and diversity of gut microbiota were similar between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups.Our results suggest that lack of diversity in gut microbiota has an effect on sensitization to allergens. Bacteroidales in order level may affect sensitization; however, the onset of allergy symptoms was not significantly associated with bacterial composition and diversity.",

However, the determinants and typical range of these biomarkers have not been well studied in general populations of children. Therefore, we assessed the determinants and typical range of three Th2 biomarkers, including blood eosinophils, FeNO, and serum total IgE in 9-11-year-old children in a prospective birth cohort.We examined the pre- and postnatal factors associated with Th2 biomarkers using multivariable logistic regression analysis (n = 428) and extended the results to the original cohort (n = 17,009) using inverse probability weighting. We also measured typical Th2 biomarker distribution in all examined children and healthy participants without allergic diseases (n = 180).At age 9-11, wheeze (odds ratio (OR) 7.63), rhinitis (OR 3.14), and eczema (OR 2.46) were significantly associated with increased blood eosinophils. All three allergic conditions were associated with FeNO and total serum IgE, but the ORs were smaller than those for blood eosinophils. Secondhand smoking was inversely associated with the blood eosinophils (OR, 0.38). Similar results were found in the original cohort. Male sex and prenatal factors (maternal smoking and parental history of allergies) were not independent predictors of high Th2 levels.In addition to wheezing and rhinitis, eczema and secondhand smoke exposure are independent factors for Th2 biomarker interpretation in children. Furthermore, the typical values and cutoff values of blood eosinophils in adults may not be applicable to children.",

We further performed a systematic search of PubMed and Ichushi-Web, using the keywords \"Schnitzler syndrome\" and \"Japan\" then contacted the corresponding authors or physicians for further information.Excluding duplicates, a total of 36 clinically diagnosed cases were identified from 1994 through the spring of 2022, with a male to female ratio of 1:1. The median age of onset was 56.5 years. It took 3.3 years from the first symptom, mostly urticaria, to reach the final diagnosis. The current status of 30 cases was ascertained; two patients developed B-cell lymphoma. SchS treatment was generally effective with high doses of corticosteroids, but symptoms sometimes recurred after tapering. Colchicine was administered in 17 cases and was effective in 8, but showed no effect in the others. Tocilizumab, used in six cases, improved laboratory abnormalities and symptoms, but lost its efficacy after several years. Rituximab, used in five cases, was effective in reducing serum IgM levels or lymphoma mass, but not in inflammatory symptoms. Four cases were treated with IL-1 targeting therapy, either anakinra or canakinumab, and achieved complete remission, except one case with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Since Schnitzler syndrome is a rare disease, the continuous collection and long-term follow-up of clinical information is essential for its appropriate treatment and further understanding of its pathophysiology.",

We aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of long-term omalizumab treatment for adult patients with WDEIA.In this phase 2, multicentre single-arm trial, 20 adult patients with WDEIA were enrolled (UMIN 000019250). All patients were administered 150-600 mg of omalizumab subcutaneously and evaluations (basophil activation and blood examination) were performed at regular intervals during administration period (0-48 weeks) and observation period (48-68 weeks). Primary endpoint was proportion of the patients who achieved a basophil activation rate below 10% with fractionated wheat preparations, and secondary endpoint was proportion of the patients with no allergic reactions after wheat products ingestion.During the omalizumab treatment, more than 80% of the patients achieved the basophil activation rate less than 10% against all fractionated wheat preparations, and 68.8% of the patients who achieved the primary endpoint experienced no allergic reaction. During the observation period, the proportion of the patients who achieved a basophil activation rate below 10% decreased gradually, and the proportion of patients with positive allergic reactions increased gradually thereafter and reached maximum of 46.7%. Severe adverse events were not observed during the study.Long-term omalizumab treatment is safe and effective for adult patients with WDEIA when assessed by basophil activation rate with wheat allergens as well as allergic reactions after lifting of restrictions on wheat intake.

ILC2s are activated by epithelial cell-derived cytokines, including IL-33 and IL-25, and play a key role in parasite expulsion, allergic responses, tissue repair, and metabolism. In the first five years after the discovery of ILC2s, research mainly focused on their function through cytokine receptors. However, in recent years, their regulatory mechanisms through not only cytokine receptors but also lipids, neuropeptides, and hormones have become a hot topic. For ILC2s that do not recognize foreign antigens, receptor expression of such endogenous factors is important, and the diverse expression patterns create the individuality of ILC2s in each organ. By considering the mechanisms of differentiation and regulation of ILC2s and their role in disease while taking into account spatio-temporal information, it is expected that new therapeutic strategies targeting ILC2s will be developed. Herein, we summarize the current understanding of ILC2s in lung homeostasis and pathology and provide valuable insights that will help to guide the future development of therapeutic methods for ILC2-mediated lung diseases.",

However, an established quantifiable risk assessment method in the early postnatal period does not exist. TARC (or CCL17) is a Th2 chemokine used as an activity marker for atopic dermatitis (AD). Therefore, we evaluated the association between cord blood TARC (cTARC) and the development of allergic diseases in childhood.This is a high-risk birth cohort for allergy, consisting of children with a family history of allergy. We collected 263 pairs of maternal and child cord blood samples perinatally and child blood samples at ages 1, 2, and 5 years. TARC and allergen-specific immunoglobulin E levels were measured, and the relationship between allergic diseases was analyzed.The median cTARC was 989 pg/mL (interquartile range [IQR]: 667-1430 pg/mL). The cTARC levels in children who developed AD were higher than those in children who did not develop AD, and the association strengthened with younger age (median [IQR] at 1 year: 1285 [816-1965] vs. 933 [662-1330] pg/mL, p < 0.01; at 2 years: 1114 [787-1753] vs. 950 [660-1373] pg/mL, p = 0.02). In the multivariate analysis, cTARC was associated with AD, egg white sensitization, food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and Japanese cedar pollen sensitization.cTARC was associated with the development of allergic diseases and allergen sensitization in early childhood. These results suggest that, infantile AD-mediated atopic march starts during fetal life, and this immune status is reflected in the cTARC at birth.",

The hallmark features of both diseases are eosinophil infiltration into the airway mucosa caused by localized type 2 inflammation and concomitant viscid secretions in the airways. Eosinophilic mucin-induced compression of adjacent anatomic structures leads to bone erosion and central bronchiectasis in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, respectively. Although these diseases share common features in their pathogenesis, they also exhibit notable differences. Epidemiologic findings are diverse, with AFRS typically presenting at a younger age, exhibiting less complicated bronchial asthma, and displaying lower total immunoglobulin E levels in laboratory findings compared with ABPM. Furthermore, despite their similar pathogenesis, the rarity of sinio-bronchial allergic mycosis in both AFRS and ABPM underscores the distinctions between these two diseases. This review aims to clarify the similarities and differences in the pathogenesis of AFRS and ABPM to determine what can be learned about AFRS from ABPM, where more is known.",

However, differences in global molecular expression between these subtypes are unknown.We analyzed public microarray data of MC subtypes derived from various tissues and those of peripheral blood granulocytes by using hierarchical clustering methods to understand the global gene expression profiles.All the transcripts subjected to this clustering analysis were classified into two large clusters, i.e., MC-preferential or granulocyte-preferential. In the original works, MCs from tonsil, lung and skin had been cultured for more than several weeks to obtain highly viable and pure cell populations, and these MCs retained their typical profiles such as intensities of chymase protein expression. Most of the transcripts were commonly expressed by these MC subtypes. However, tonsil-derived MCs and skin-derived MCs but not lung-derived MCs expressed high levels of chymase (CMA1) as expected for the properties of MC(TC) and MC(T). These CMA1-high MCs and CMA1-low MCs respectively expressed distinct sets of transcripts as small gene clusters as well as CMA-1 even after being cultured in the absence of a tissue environment.The MC lineage seems to be far from the granulocyte lineages including basophils. CMA1-high MCs (MC(TC)) and CMA1-low MCs (MC(T)) can be regarded as differentiated MC subtypes. As such, importance of data analysis studies will be increasing along with the accumulation of global molecular data in the public database.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in basic and clinical researches of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are reviewed. Concerning arachidonic acid cascade, recent studies revealed that not only cyclooxygenase (COX) but also terminal enzymes such as prostaglandin E synthase are very important in the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammation and mechanisms of action of NSAIDs. We also found that some conventional NSAIDs and a selective COX-2 inhibitor exert pro-apoptotic effect on synovial fibroblasts and several cancer cells by COX-independent mechanisms. Clinical indications for use of NSAIDs are broad and include the following : rheumatic diseases ; painful and/or febrile conditions ; and prevention from thrombotic diseases such as myocardial infarction. In addition, recently developed selective COX-2 inhibitors have been found to be nearly as effective for the same conditions as conventional NSAIDs except with regard to the prevention of thrombosis. The incidence of severe gastrointestinal events in patients treated with selective COX-2 inhibitors has been proven to be lower than patients treated with conventional NSAIDs. However, there was no difference in renal complications between the two groups. Instead, an increased incidence of myocardial infarction after administration of selective COX-2 inhibitors may occur in patients with risk factors for atherosclerotic or thrombotic complications. Further basic and clinical studies remain to be investigated in the future.",

    "abstract": "Parvalbumin is the major and cross-reactive allergen in fish. Sufficient amounts of IgE-reactive recombinant fish parvalbumin are needed for diagnosis and immunotherapy of fish allergy. A DNA fragment corresponding to parvalbumin of the Pacific mackerel Scomber japonicus was synthesized and cloned into the expression vector pGEX-6p-3 to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion parvalbumin in Escherichia coli. The GST-free recombinant parvalbumin was purified using the RediPack GST Purification Module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Parvalbumins of seven species of fish (Japanese eel, horse mackerel, red sea bream, Pacific mackerel, skipjack, bigeye tuna and Japanese flounder) were purified by gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC. The IgE-binding capacity was examined by ELISA and antigenic cross-reactivity by inhibition ELISA. The GST-free recombinant Pacific mackerel parvalbumin was obtained in an electrophoretically pure state. Data from ELISA and inhibition ELISA revealed that the recombinant parvalbumin contains most of the IgE-binding epitopes of the natural counterpart. In addition, the recombinant parvalbumin inhibited the IgE reactivities of the pooled patient serum to parvalbumins purified from six species of fish in almost the same magnitude as the natural Pacific mackerel parvalbumin. Because the recombinant Pacific mackerel parvalbumin bearing the IgE-binding capacity of the natural counterpart is cross-reactive with various fish parvalbumins, it can be a useful tool for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of fish allergy.",

    "abstract": "The airway smooth muscle is the key determinant of airway narrowing in asthma but its function in the absence of disease is unknown. Evidence for an intrinsic abnormality in the muscle in asthma is only just emerging. The airway smooth muscle is not merely a contractile cell, but also one which determines the composition of, and interacts with the extracellular matrix, and which may participate in inflammatory and allergic reactions and viral infections. The reason for the differences which have been observed in the in vitro properties of airway smooth muscle derived from asthmatic individuals may result from an inherent “supercontractility”, an increased tendency to proliferate due to the absence of an inhibitory transcription factor c/EBP-α, the influence of an altered extracellular matrix and/or a decrease in release of factors such as PGE2 which would under normal circumstances inhibit both proliferation and contraction. Although long acting beta agonists and corticosteroids are successful treatments for inflammation and bronchoconstriction, the structural changes which constitute airway remodelling may require additional therapeutic intervention, the nature of which will be determined by thorough investigation of the mechanisms underlying the asthmatic phenotype.",

Significant advances have been made to reveal such links between innate immunity and Th1 type adaptive immune responses. By contrast, the role of innate immunity in the development of Th2 type adaptive immune responses is still not well understood. Production of IL-4, a key cytokine in the induction of Th2 immunity, by innate type cells represents an attractive mechanism for such an innate link to Th2 immunity. We have recently reported that in the course of infection with the intestinal nematode, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a robust basophil accumulation in the liver/spleen occurs and that these basophils display enhanced IL-4 production. Thus, the basophils is an attractive candidate to mediate the innate-adaptive link for Th2 responses and understanding the control of the tissue homing patterns and cytokine responses of basophils in the course of infections may shed important light on the in vivo induction of Th2 adaptive immunity.",

    "abstract": "Histamine synthesized by histidine decarboxylase (HDC) from L-histidine is a major chemical mediator in the development of nasal allergy which is characterized by nasal hypersensitivity. However the regulatory mechanism of histamine synthesis by HDC remains to be elucidated. The objectives of the present study were to examine the changes of histamine content, HDC activity and HDC mRNA expression in the nasal mucosa of allergy model rats sensitized by the exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and to investigate the effect of dexamethasone on the above mentioned allergic parameters. Rats were sensitized and provocated by TDI and the nasal allergy-like behaviors were scored during a 10 minute period after provocation. Histamine content and HDC activity in the nasal mucosa were determined using fluorometric high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of HDC mRNA in nasal mucosa was determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In TDI-sensitized rats, nasal allergy-like behaviors such as sneezing and watery rhinorrhea were induced. Histamine content, HDC activity and HDC mRNA expression in nasal mucosa were also significantly increased after TDI provocation. Pretreatment with dexamethasone significantly suppressed nasal allergy-like behaviors, up-regulation of histamine content, HDC activity and HDC mRNA induced by TDI in TDI-sensitized rats. These findings indicate that increased synthesis of histamine through up-regulation of HDC gene expression and HDC activity in nasal mucosa plays an important role in the development of nasal hypersensitivity. Repression of HDC gene expression and HDC activity by dexamethasone may underlie its therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergy.",

During pollen season from January to April in 2003, a daily dose of 4x1010 cfu L. paracasei strain KW3110 was fed for 12 weeks as a yogurt to 14 pollen allergy patients(mean age 39.0 years). A yogurt made with Lactobacillus delbrueckii strain B, shown to be a poor Th1 inducer and Th2 repressor in a former study, was also fed at a daily dose of 4x1010 cfu for 12 weeks to 14 pollen allergy patients(mean age, 39.0 years). Blood samples were collected every 4 weeks. Eosinophils, eosinophil cationic protein(ECP), non-specific serum IgE, cedar pollen specific serum IgE, and Th1/Th2 ratios were quantified. Twelve weeks after ingestion of the yogurts, the group that was fed L. delbrueckii group showed significant reductions in the Th1/Th2 ratios between the first observation in January and last observation in April, representing the four month study period, due to increases in Th2 cells. Significant increases in ECP were also observed in the group fed L. delbrueckii between January and April. In contrast, the group fed L. paracasei had no significant changes in the ECP and Th1/Th2 ratios. Our results suggest that ingestion of the L. paracasei strain KW3110 is associated with both repression of Th2 cell generation and eosinophil activation.

From recent studies on the U-LTE(4) associated with adult stable asthma we identified four factors for hyperleukotrieneuria, namely, aspirin intolerance, eosinophilic nasal polyposis (ENP), vasculitis, and severe asthma. In ENP, there is prominent infiltration of eosinophils in the sinus and polyp tissues, which is linked to adult asthma and aspirin sensitivity, and ENP is the most important factor for the overproduction of CysLTs in asthmatics. We also demonstrated that anaphylaxis and eosinophilic pneumonia (EP) are associated with a marked increase in the U-LTE(4) concentration. Under these disease conditions, U-LTE(4) may be one of the candidate biomarkers. Moreover, the changes in U-LTE(4) concentrations may provide valuable information concerning therapeutic targets.",

Therefore, the evidence was inadequate to infer the presence or absence of a causal relationship between various environmental exposures and allergic diseases. However, evidence is suggestive of positive associations of allergies with heredity. Because almost all the studies were performed in Western countries, the application of these findings to people in other countries, including Japan, may not be appropriate.

Thus it is important to evaluate the sedative properties of H1 antihistamines to avoid side effects. For this purpose, histamine H1 receptor (H1R) occupancy and proportional impairment ratios (PIR) are now being used. However, it is not easy to obtain these parameters. Here, we sought to evaluate the sedative properties of H1 antihistamines by means of a large-scale surveillance at health insurance pharmacies. The survey was conducted at 37 health insurance pharmacies. The therapeutic efficacy and the degree of sleepiness were quantified through a questionnaire using the visual analog scale (VAS) directly from 1742 patients who received H1 antihistamines. The degree of sleepiness caused by the first-generation antihistamines was significantly higher than that of the second-generation antihistamines. The high VAS score in case of efficacy was found in d-chlorpheniramine, olopatadine, and ebastine. Among the mean values of efficacy, all second-generation antihistamines except for loratadine, bepotastine, and mequitazine were significantly higher than that of clemastine. Regarding the degree of sleepiness, clemastine scored the highest VAS score, and significantly lower scores were obtained in all second-generation antihistamines. The sedative properties of the H1 antihistamines obtained from VAS analysis were very similar to those of H1R occupancy from positron emission tomography (PET) studies and PIR from meta-analysis. Our results indicate that large-scale surveillance using VAS might be useful to evaluate the profiles of H1 antihistamines.",

Thus it is a molecule currently being targeted for therapy. The natural intrinsic inhibitor of IL-18 receptor activation, IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), shows a great potential for the treatment of allergy. Expression and purification of recombinant human IL-18BP (rhIL-18BP) were performed using the baculovirus system to develop a therapeutic molecule for the treatment of IL-18-related diseases and to investigate the structural basis of its inhibitory mechanism. Purified rhIL-18BP potently inhibited the production of interferon-gamma by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence of lipopolysaccharide and by human myelomonocytic KG-1 cells in the presence of IL-18 (IC50 = 0.4 nM). Surface plasmon resonance showed a high affinity (Kd = 0.46 nM) for rhIL-18BP in binding hIL-18. Structural analysis indicated that the stoichiometry between IL-18 and IL-18BP is 1 : 1 in solution and the model structure of the complex suggests that the key residues on IL-18 (L5, K53, S55) and the estimated key residues on IL-18BP (F93,Y97, F104) could have interactions. The structural mechanism of IL-18BP inhibition might be a competition for Site 2 on rIL-18 so that IL-18BP can prevent IL-18 receptor alpha from binding to Site 2 and inhibit IL-18 receptor activation. IL-18BP has unique features with respect to its structure, binding mode and inhibitory mechanism. It is a molecule that has a great potential for the therapy of allergy.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic otitis media (EOM) is an intractable otitis media characterized by the presence of a highly viscous yellow effusion containing eosinophils. It mainly occurs in patients with bronchial asthma and is resistant to conventional treatments for otitis media. Here we discuss the role of IgE in the pathogenesis of EOM. In middle ear effusion, a significantly higher IgE level was detected in EOM patients than in control patients with common otitis media with effusion. This IgE level was significantly higher (about 10 fold) than the serum IgE level. In addition, many IgE-immunopositive cells were found in the middle ear mucosa. The IgE staining was mainly observed on mast cell surfaces, but also partially in the cytoplasm of cells that appeared to be plasma cells. These results suggested that IgE is produced locally in the middle ear mucosa. The existence of high-level IgE may exacerbate eosinophilic inflammation in the middle ear. One of the most distinct characteristics of EOM is the high incidence of sensory hearing loss independent of age. High-tone hearing loss is more frequently found and more severe in EOM patients than in control patients with common chronic otitis media. The concentration of IgE in middle ear effusion significantly and positively correlated with bone conduction hearing levels at 2 kHz and 4 kHz in EOM patients. Overproduction of IgE locally in the middle ear may be related to the pathological condition of EOM and eventually cause inner ear damage.",

    "abstract": "Differential expression of chemokine genes were investigated in various types of ocular surface cells. Primary cultures of human corneal epithelial cells (n = 3), corneal fibroblasts (n = 2), conjunctival epithelial cells (n = 2) and conjunctival fibroblasts (n = 2) were established and incubated with or without inter- leukin (IL)-4 (30 ng/ml) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (30 ng/ml) for 24 hours. Gene transcription levels of 33 chemokines and production of 4 chemokines were analyzed. After stimulation, chemokine expression increased for 18 of 33 coded chemokine gene transcripts. In stimulated conjunctival and corneal cells, CC chemokine genes increased in fibroblasts (expression of 6 out of 8 genes), while CXC chemokine genes increased in both epithelial cells (expression of 4 out of 9 genes in conjunctival epithelial cells and 7 out of 9 genes in corneal epithelial cells) and in fibroblasts (expression of 8 out of 9 genes in conjunctival and corneal fibroblasts). Except for MCP-1, gene transcription levels for most CC chemokines were inducible and, except for IP-10 and I-TAC, most CXC chemokines were constitutively expressed. Corneal epithelial cell and fibroblast production patterns for eotaxin-1, MCP-1 and IP-10 were comparable to the mRNA expression pattern. Corneal and conjunctival fibroblasts exhibited marked increases in the expression of chemokines upon stimulation with TNF-α and IL-4, suggesting that fibroblasts may be one of the primary sources of chemokines in allergic conjunctival diseases. Therefore, regulation of chemokine production from these cells may be an effective strategy for treating such diseases.",

    "abstract": "In previous studies, several strains of mice were used as chemical-induced skin irritation models to identify immunological hazards and elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which irritant dermatitis disease occur. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice have been used for most of these experiments. Although there are some differences in the immune response to chemical allergens between these strains, few studies have been conducted to determine what regulatory factors contribute to these variations. To investigate the cause of high responses to skin irritation in C57BL/6 mice that are widely used to study atopic dermatitis, changes in various immune-related factors such as ear thickness, myeloperoxidase activity, lymph node weight, IgE concentration and cytokine concentration were measured in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice following phthalic anhydride (PA) treatment. Based on analysis of the skin irritation, C57BL/6 mice showed a greater skin irritation to PA than BALB/c mice, although the IgE concentration and auricular lymph node weight did not contribute to this difference in the response. However, the concentration of several cytokines and chemokines (interleukin [IL]-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], keratinocyte-derived chemokine [KC] and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted [RANTES]) were significantly higher in C57BL/6 mice than BALB/c mice following treatment with PA. Our results suggest that several of the cytokines and chemokines secreted from irritant site could contribute to the regulation mechanism responsible for the difference in the skin irritation among various strains of mice following exposure to PA.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the factors that exacerbate asthma, based on a questionnaire completed by asthma patients in Niigata Prefecture. Based on questionnaires given to 3085 patients who visited the medical institutes in the Niigata Prefecture monthly from September through October 2006, groups stratified by sex, age, disease type and disease severity, were analyzed for factors contributing to asthma exacerbation, as described in the guideline of the Japanese Society of Allergology. The leading exacerbating factor chosen by patients was a change in the weather, followed by smoking, allergen exposure, fatigue, stimulants, and air pollutants. Respiratory infection, widely recognized as a critical factor of severe exacerbation, was ranked seventh. Allergen exposure and air pollutants were prominent in younger individuals, whereas respiratory infection tended to be more common in elderly subjects. Allergen exposure, air pollutants, and exercise were significantly more common in atopic-type patients, in contrast with respiratory infection in non-atopic-type patients. According to multiple regression analysis, poor asthma control during the last one year was associated with changes in the weather, whereas the non-atopic disease type was related to exacerbation by respiratory infection. Current smoking was associated with both factors. Many factors exacerbate asthma, depending on the individual case and his/her background. These data suggest that changes in the weather may be more important factor for patients in asthma exacerbation.",

Chest radiography showed small diffuse nodular shadows, and a computed tomographic scan showed thickening of the bronchi and bronchioles, with diffuse centrilobular nodules in both lung fields. A blood test and microscopic examination of the bronchoalveolar fluid revealed marked eosinophilia. Transbronchial lung biopsy and transbronchial biopsy showed eosinophilic bronchitis and bronchiolitis. After treatment with oral prednisolone (40 mg daily) and inhaled corticosteroids, the symptoms, blood eosinophilia, and radiographic findings improved. Recently, several similar cases of eosinophilic bronchiolitis have been reported.

In this study, we aimed to determine how prevalent AE cases appear, the characteristic features and the course of AE, and to evaluate whether corticosteroid therapy for AE is necessary or not. The patients whose blood samples showed an eosinophil count of ≥ 2,000/μL, among the samples tested for blood cell counts and differential counts between January 2006 and December 2010, in Japanese Red Cross Medical Center, were firstly included. Among these, patients with AE were extracted. All of the 11 patients were Japanese young females. One patient with arthralgia showed radioisotope accumulation in the joints by bone scintigraphy. The peak peripheral blood eosinophil count was 7,839 ± 6,008 (2,130-23,170)/μL after visiting our hospital. An increase in white blood cell count was only due to an increase in eosinophil count. Serum C-reactive protein and IgE levels remained almost normal. Peripheral blood eosinophil count decreased steadily for 8 weeks, regardless of corticosteroid use. Edema in all of the patients and arthralgia in 6 patients improved within 12 weeks. As far as followed, none of the patients had a recurrence of AE. AE developed in Japanese young females and likely showed a single course. In AE, the count of eosinophil of 104/μL was observed. Only eosinophil count increased among leukocyte series. Serum C- reactive protein and IgE levels remained almost normal. The eosinophil count in AE patients will return to the normal level within 8 weeks even without corticosteroid therapy.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of omalizumab on long-term disease control in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. An open-label, 48-week study was conducted in 133 Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. Omalizumab was administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks based on serum IgE level and body weight in each patient. Treatment with omalizumab significantly improved lung function. A subgroup of patients with inadequately controlled severe persistent asthma, despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids and other multiple controller therapies, which corresponds to the Japanese label (label population), showed greater improvements in morning PEF and FEV1 than the whole study population (full Analysis Set). Serum free IgE levels decreased to below the target and were maintained during the treatment period in almost all patients. The majority of adverse events were mild-to-moderate in severity and there was no trend toward an increase in incidence of adverse events with increase in duration of omalizumab. In addition, the profile of adverse events in this study was similar to that in a 16-week, placebo-controlled study which the present authors had conducted previously in Japan. There were no anaphylactic reactions and no anti-omalizumab antibodies were detected. Long-term treatment with omalizumab is effective and well tolerated in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma.",

All cases showed persistent itchy dry skin and eczematous lesions complicated by sicca symptoms including dry eyes and dry mouth with moderate joint pain. One case manifested annular erythema and another manifested widespread discoid erythema. To investigate the underlying cause of dry skin in these cases, sweating function was evaluated using a quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART) in which the axon reflex is stimulated by acetylcholine iontophoresis. The sweating latency time was significantly prolonged in eczematous skin of AD and AD/SS compared to normal controls. Axon reflex (AXR) sweat volume was also significantly reduced in AD (normal and eczematous skin) and AD/SS (normal and eczema) compared to normal control. In contrast, the direct sweat volume of lesional or non-lesional AD skin induced by direct stimulation with acetylcholine was only slightly reduced compared to that in normal controls, but not in SS and lesional skin of AD/SS patients. These results suggest that the impaired sweat response in AD is attributable to an abnormal sudomotor axon reflex, which is accelerated and modulated when complicated by SS resulting in dry skin in the present cases.",

The pathophysiological role of zinc in asthma, however, is not entirely clear. Mast cells have been implicated in atopic asthma, and zinc deprivation has been reported to reduce mast cell activation. Here, we investigate the effects of a zinc chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridyl-methyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), on asthmatic responses in mouse models of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and allergic airway inflammation.Mice were sensitized with OVA with or without the adjuvant aluminum hydroxide (alum) and subjected to OVA exposure with or without treatment of TPEN. Cell profiles and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, airway responsiveness to inhaled acetylcholine, and goblet cell hyperplasia after allergen exposure were assessed.In mice sensitized to OVA without alum, TPEN significantly suppressed airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia in BAL fluids. TPEN also attenuated the upregulation of TNFα, IL-13 and IL-4 in BAL fluids and goblet cell hyperplasia after OVA exposure. By contrast, in mice sensitized to OVA with alum, TPEN suppressed eosinophilia in BAL fluids but not airway hyperresponsiveness and goblet cell hyperplasia.In pulmonary allergic inflammation induced in mice immunized with antigen without alum, zinc chelator inhibits airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. These findings suggest that zinc may be a therapeutic target of allergic asthma.",

Analysis of twin cases may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of allergy. Though several studies have indicated the importance of a genetic contribution to the expression of allergic diseases based on twin analyses, very few data are available regarding twins with Food Protein-Induced Gastrointestinal Syndrome (FPIGS). Two pairs of identical and fraternal twins with FPIGS are presented.The twins were born with no abnormalities and fed breast milk and supplemental formula. The identical twins developed vomiting and bloody stool simultaneously. The fraternal twins developed prolonged vomiting and loose stools at different times. Since their symptoms disappeared with when formula feeding was stopped, the symptoms were thought to indicate the presence of an allergy to cow's milk. The clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of the four patients were highly suggestive of FPIGS. The identical and fraternal twins showed very similar symptoms, including their onset and clinical courses. However, a substantial clinical disparity existed in the clinical features of the two pairs of twins.Comparisons of the twins' similarities and disparities suggest a profound genetic effect on the patients' clinical features, along with individual environmental factors. The prevalence of FPIGS is increasing, and it is now a major topic of public concern in Japan. Further accumulation of data on twins with FPIGS is needed to clarify the genetic contributions to this disease.",

Preliminary evidence derives from recent rigorous trials on perennial allergens, like house dust mites, and specifically designed studies addressed the benefits on asthma. Emerging research suggests that SLIT may have a future role in other allergic conditions such as atopic dermatitis, food, latex and venom allergy. Efforts to develop a safer and more effective SLIT for inhalant allergens have led to the development of allergoids, recombinant allergens and formulations with adjuvants and substances targeting antigens to dendritic cells that possess a crucial role in initiating immune responses. The high degree of variation in the evaluation of clinical effects and immunological changes requires further studies to identify the candidate patients to SLIT and biomarkers of short and long term efficacy. Appropriate management strategies are urgently needed to overcome the barriers to SLIT compliance.",

The 41 children with variant genotypes were more often infected by multiple viruses (21.9%, p = 0.047) than children with wild-type A/A genotypes (9.1%). In addition, more children with variant genotypes (31.7%, p = 0.016) had used corticosteroids because of post-bronchiolitis wheezing, compared to those with wild-type A/A genotypes (13.6%). No other significant associations with viral findings or post-bronchiolitis outcomes were found. Preliminary evidence was found that the variant non-A/A genotypes may be associated with susceptibility to multiple viral infections and more severe post-bronchiolitis wheezing requiring treatment with corticosteroids.",

However, the relevant allergens of natto allergy have never been identified. A 38-year-old man developed an anaphylactic reaction accompanied by flashing, generalized urticaria, conjunctival redness, and dyspnea 3 hours after ingestion of commercial cold Chinese noodles. He had avoided natto for the past year due to developing several anaphylactic reactions half a day after natto ingestion. The results of skin prick tests (SPTs) were strongly positive for natto and the soup of cold Chinese noodles. Furthermore, SPTs showed positive for poly (γ-glutamic acid) (PGA), which is a major constituent of natto mucilage, alone among all the ingredients of the cold Chinese noodle soup. Therefore, he was diagnosed with late-onset anaphylaxis to PGA contained in natto and the cold Chinese noodle soup. These results indicated that in the present case, the relevant allergen of late-onset anaphylaxis may have been PGA in all episodes and that the patient had been sensitized by PGA through natto ingestion. PGA is produced by Bacillus subtilis during fermentation and is a high-molecular, biodegradable polymer. The late onset is therefore, hypothesized to be due to a delayed absorption of PGA, as PGA biodegrades to peptides sufficiently small to be absorbed in the bowel. PGA has recently been applied to a wide range of fields such as foods, cosmetics, and medicine. Therefore, patients with late-onset anaphylaxis to PGA of natto should avoid not only natto but also other materials containing PGA.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to clarify whether some environmental and genetic factors (food allergy, older siblings, early day-care attendance and parents' allergy history) are related to the development of allergic symptoms (wheezing in the previous 12 months [WP], eczema symptoms in the previous 12 months [EP], and rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms in the previous 12 months [RP]) in Japanese children.Using the modified version of the International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISSAC) questionnaire, we studied the prevalence of WP, EP and RP among six-year-old children attending 72 primary schools throughout Himeji City, Japan, during the two years from 2005 to 2006.Food allergy and parents' history of allergy showed a significant relationship with the prevalence of WP, EP and RP. Day-care attendance in the first two years of life and presence of older siblings showed a significant inverse relationship with the prevalence of RP. However, neither day-care attendance nor presence of older siblings was related to the development of W and ER.Among Japanese children, food allergy and parents' history of allergy are risk factors for WP, ES or RS. However, early day-care attendance and presence of older siblings might be protective factors against RS. Infections in early life may affect the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis in six-year-old children.",

    "abstract": "Reduced responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy is a major problem for patients with severe asthma. Although Th9 cells, along with Th2 cells, facilitate antigen-induced airway eosinophilia and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), the sensitivity of Th9 cell-mediated responses to steroid therapy remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of dexamethasone (Dex) on antigen-induced airway inflammation in Th9 cell-transferred mice.Ovalbumin (OVA)-specific Th2 and Th9 cells were polarized from the CD4+ T cells of DO11.10/RAG-2-/- mice. BALB/c mice were adoptively transferred with Th2 or Th9 cells and challenged with OVA. Dex treatment was performed twice, at 1 h before and at 24 h after the OVA challenge. Following treatment, the number of inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine were determined.In both the Th2 and Th9 cell-transferred mice, substantial accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs and BHR were induced by challenge with the specific antigen. In the Th2 cell-transferred mice, these responses were significantly diminished by Dex treatment. In contrast, neither cellular infiltration nor BHR was affected by Dex treatment in the Th9 cell-transferred mice, although the Th9 cells substantially expressed glucocorticoid receptor α. Accordingly, antigen-induced interleukin-9 expression in the Th9 cells was attenuated by Dex treatment at least in vitro. Antigen-induced lung infiltration of infused Th2 cells but not Th9 cells was significantly suppressed by Dex.In contrast to Th2-mediated responses, Th9-mediated airway inflammation was not affected by Dex. Th9 cells might be involved in the developmental mechanisms of steroid-resistant asthma.",

Saliva has recently been validated as novel, simple, and noninvasive method for investigating inflammation in patients with asthma. The aim of this study is to clarify the molecular species of CysLT in saliva and to evaluate the CysLT and LTB4 concentrations in saliva in AIA patients. We also examined how the CysLT concentration in saliva reflects that of their corresponding urinary metabolite.We preformed an analytical cross-sectional study. CysLT and LTB4 concentrations in saliva were quantified by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) following purification by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).1. When analyzed by EIA in combination with HPLC, saliva was found to consist of LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 in similar amounts. 2. In saliva analysis among the three groups (AIA patients, aspirin-tolerant asthma [ATA] patients, and healthy subjects), both the concentrations of CysLTs and LTB4 were significantly higher in AIA patients than in ATA patients and healthy subjects. 3. We found significant correlations between CysLT concentration and LTB4 concentration in saliva in each group. 4. No significant correlation was found between the concentration of LTE4 in urine and that of CysLTs in saliva.In this study, we found higher concentrations of CysLTs and LTB4 in saliva from AIA patients than in saliva from ATA patients, suggesting that the quantification of CysLT and LTB4 concentrations in saliva may be another diagnostic strategy for AIA.",

    "abstract": "Acute exacerbation of asthma is divided qualitatively into mild, moderate, and severe attacks and respiratory failure. This system is, however, not suitable for estimating small changes in respiratory condition with time and for determining the efficacy of treatments, because it has a qualitative, but not quantitative nature.To evaluate the usefulness of quantitative estimation of asthma exacerbation, modified Pulmonary Index Score (mPIS) values were measured in 87 asthmatic children (mean age, 5.0 ± 0.4 years) during hospitalization. mPIS was calculated by adding the sum of scores for 6 items (scores of 0-3 were given for each item). These consisted of heart rate, respiratory rate, accessory muscle use, inspiratory-to-expiratory flow ratio, degree of wheezing, and oxygen saturation in room air. Measurements were made at visits and at hospitalization and were then made twice a day until discharge.mPIS values were highly correlated among raters. mPIS values at visits were 9.1 ± 0.1 and 12.6 ± 0.4 in subjects with moderate and severe attacks, respectively (p < 0.001). mPIS values of subjects requiring continuous inhalation therapy (CIT) with isoproterenol in addition to systemic steroids were significantly higher than the values of those without CIT (12.0 ± 0.5 and 9.3 ± 0.2, respectively, p < 0.001). A score of 10 was suggested to be the optimal cutoff for distinguishing between subjects requiring and not requiring CIT, from the perspectives of both sensitivity and specificity. mPIS at hospitalization correlated well with the period until discharge, suggesting that this score was a useful predictor for the clinical course after hospitalization.mPIS could be a useful tool for several aspects during acute asthma attacks, including the determination of a treatment plan, and prediction of the period of hospitalization in admitted patients, although prospective studies would be required to establish our hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by local inflammation of the sinonasal tissues. CRS patients with nasal polyps and asthma often develop acute exacerbation of sinonasal symptoms after upper respiratory tract infections. However, the influence of concomitant asthma on the nasal immune response to viral infection remains unclear. Specimens of nasal polyp and mucosal tissues were obtained from 3 groups of CRS patients (n = 14 per group): 1) patients without asthma (CRS group), 2) patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA group), and 3) patients with aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA group). Nasal fibroblasts isolated from the specimens were stimulated with poly I:C. CXCL10 expression was analyzed by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay. Biopsy specimens from CRS patients without asthma were subjected to immunohistochemistry for detection of T-bet and GATA-3 expression in CD3 + T cells by double labeling. Nasal fibroblasts from the ATA and AIA groups showed significantly enhanced expression of CXCL 10 mRNA and protein after poly I:C stimulation compared with cells from the CRS group and the control group (normal nasal mucosa). In addition to T helper (Th)2 cells, there was more abundant infiltration of Th1 cells into tissues from the AIA and ATA groups. Our findings suggest that CRS associated with asthma may become intractable through the over-production of CXCL10 in response to viral infection.",

We therefore explored the association between age, respiratory viruses, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and cytokines/chemokines in acute exacerbations of childhood asthma.We investigated viruses in nasal secretions from 88 patients with acute exacerbation of childhood asthma by using antigen detection kits and/or RT-PCR, followed by direct DNA sequencing analysis. We also measured peripheral eosinophil counts, and the serum levels of ECP and 27 types of cytokines/chemokines in 71 virus-induced acute asthma cases and 13 controls.Viruses were detected in 71(80.7%) of the 88 samples. The three major viruses detected were rhinoviruses, RS viruses, and enteroviruses; enteroviruses were found to be dominant in patients aged ≥3 years. There was no change in the levels of rhinoviruses and RS viruses between the two age groups, defined as children aged <3 years and children aged ≥3 years. Serum concentrations of ECP, IL-5, and IP-10 were significantly elevated in virus-induced acute asthma cases compared with controls. Serum ECP values were significantly higher in patients with virus-induced asthma at age ≥3 years compared with those aged <3 years. Among the 27 cytokines/chemokines, serum IP-10 was significantly higher in virus-induced asthma in patients <3 years than in those ≥3 years. Serum ECP and IL-5 production correlated significantly with age, whereas serum IP-10 showed an inverse correlation with age.Age-related differences in cytokine profiles and eosinophil activation may be related to virus-induced acute exacerbations of childhood asthma.",

    "abstract": "Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) is currently used for several allergic disorders and IL-10- producing regulatory T cells (Tr1) induced by SIT suppress allergic reactions. We investigated the relation between IL-10 production and acquiring allergy. A prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of SIT on IL-10 production in T cells and other cell fractions in children with pollinosis. In addition, blood samples were collected from non-allergic healthy controls and patients with pollinosis to compare the levels of IL-10 production. PBMC were cultured with pollen peptides or control allergens, and the IL-10 production from monocyte and CD4 T cell was analyzed. Monocytes and CD4 T cells from SIT group of patients produced high levels of IL-10, suggesting that the induction of IL-10 is essential for inducing T cell tolerance. IL-10 production from monocytes and T cells was significantly increased in non-allergic controls compared to patients with pollinosis. This high IL-10 production was observed even when PBMC were stimulated with antigens other than pollen peptides. IL-10 is critical for induction of specific T cell tolerance, and increased production of IL-10 by monocytes and T cells during inflammatory responses or after SIT may influence effector cells in allergy. Present data implicates that the low productivity of IL-10 by monocytes and T cells is closely related with sensitivity to multiple allergens, and resistance to allergic diseases. Augmentation of constitutive IL-10 production from immune system is a potential therapeutic approach for allergic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Buckwheat (BW) is a potentially life-threatening allergen. Usefulness of BW-specific immunoglobulin-E (BW-sIgE) level for diagnosis of BW allergy is controversial, while the skin prick test (SPT) is widely used because of its less invasive procedure and immediate results. However, there are no data comparing usefulness of the SPT and BW-sIgE level. Therefore, our study aimed to clarify efficacy of the SPT for diagnosis of BW allergy. This retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated patients who underwent an oral food challenge (OFC) for diagnosis or confirmation of acquired tolerance using 3072 mg of BW protein between July 2006 and April 2014. We then compared the diagnostic performance of BW sIgE and SPT to predict positive OFC results. We analyzed 126 patients aged 2–16 years (median, 7.7 years), 18 (14%) of whom showed positive OFC results. Between patients with positive and negative OFC results, there was no significant difference in BW-sIgE level. However, patients with positive OFC results had a larger SPT wheal diameter. Area under the curve for positive OFC results for BW-sIgE level and SPT wheal diameter were 0.583 and 0.791, respectively. The 5%, 10%, 50%, and 90% positive predictive values of SPT wheal diameter were 2.0 mm, 5.2 mm, 14.7 mm, and 24.1 mm, respectively. Our study revealed that the SPT was more useful than BW-sIgE level for diagnosis of BW allergy. Thus, an OFC may be avoided if the patient's SPT wheal diameter is at least 24.1 mm.",

A spirogram and/or forced oscillation technique were performed in all subjects.On a sound spectrogram, wheezing was confirmed in seven of nine patients. All wheezing on the image was polyphonic, and they almost disappeared after β2 agonist inhalation. An analysis of the breath sound spectrum showed that PT, P3/PT, P4/PT, RPF50 and RPF75 were significantly increased after β2 agonist inhalation.Children with CVA showed a high rate of inaudible wheezing that disappeared after β2 agonist inhalation.

Although significance of cutaneous manifestations of SS has been gradually recognized in rheumatologists, sudomotor function has not been fully evaluated and recognized in the diagnosis of SS except for dermatologists. SS is a relatively underestimated collagen disease in contrast to SLE, systemic sclerosis, or dermatomyositis, special care should be needed not to make misdiagnosis of SS when we see the patients with common skin disease such as, drug eruption, infections skin disease or xerosis in the daily practice. In contrast to pathomechanisms of dry skin observed in SS, we recently reported that reduced sweating function and dry skin seen in atopic dermatitis (AD) are mediated by histamine or substance P, those are usually restored to normal levels after improvement of the dermatitis by topical corticosteroid ointment with or without oral anti-histamine. Therefore, xerotic skin lesions seen in SS and AD might be attributable to different pathomechanisms with similar dry skin manifestations. We recently reported that SS promotes dry skin when complicated with AD possibly due to acceleration of hypoidrosis. In this review, we would like to summarize our recent understanding of regulatory mechanism of impaired sweating function in allergic inflammatory skin diseases by introducing clinical presentations of AD/SS overlap cases as the model of hypoidrotic inflammatory skin diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation. Lung fibroblasts activated by IL-13 serve as important sources of chemokines, such as eotaxins, contributing to persistent eosinophilic inflammation. Src-homology 2-containing protein (CISH), belonging to the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, acts as a negative regulator of cytokine induction. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of CISH in the production of eosinophil chemotactic chemokines in human lung fibroblasts.Normal human lung fibroblasts were stimulated by IL-13, and global gene expression profile was assessed by cDNA microarray. Expression changes and downstream of IL-13 signaling were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA or western blotting. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses of CISH were performed by small interfering RNA and vector overexpression, respectively.Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that IL-13 induced chemokine signaling, including the eotaxin family, while significantly suppressing IFN-α/β signaling. Among eight SOCS family members, CISH was most strongly induced by IL-13 via phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). Loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrated that CISH negatively regulated the expression of CCL26.These findings suggest that CISH plays a key role in the eosinophilic inflammation associated with bronchial asthma by regulating IL-13-induced CCL26 production. Augmentation of CISH function could be a novel approach for treating eosinophilic inflammation in severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "CXCR5+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells primarily promote B cells to produce an antigen-specific antibody through germinal centers (GCs). TFH cells exist in circulation, and circulating(c) TFH2 cells, a subset of cTFH cells, are able to help naïve B cells produce IgE in healthy individuals. Conversely, IL-10-producing regulatory B (Breg) cells inhibit an accelerated immune response.We investigated the roles of cTFH cells and cBreg cells based on a TH2 response in patients with atopic asthma (AA). Thirty-two patients with AA and 35 healthy volunteers (HV) were enrolled. We examined cTFH cells including their subsets, their expression of ICOS and PD-1, and cBreg cells by flow cytometry and their associations with clinical biomarkers. Plasma levels of CXCL13, which is a counterpart of CXCR5, were also measured using ELISA.In patients with AA, cTFH2 cells were increased and cTFH1 cells were decreased compared with those in HV. The expression levels of ICOS on cTFH and their subset cells were elevated and Breg cells were greatly decreased. The plasma levels of CXCL13 in patients with AA were significantly elevated and correlated well with the cTFH2/cBreg ratio. These cells were examined in 10 patients AA before and after inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment. Interestingly, the percentages and numbers of TFH2 and ICOS+ cTFH cells declined after ICS treatment together with improvements in symptoms and clinical biomarkers.The percentages and numbers of cTFH2 and ICOS+ cTFH cells might be useful as biomarkers of TH2 typed airway inflammation in patients with AA.",

Although the daily eating habits and food are relatively similar to that on the mainland, the living environment is quite different. The prevalence of allergic diseases in the Ogasawara Islands is unknown. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of allergic diseases in the Ogasawara Islands.A survey was conducted among all children belonging to preschool, elementary school, and junior high school in the Ogasawara Islands. A questionnaire was prepared in accordance with the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) core written questionnaire in bronchial asthma (BA) and the West Japan Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood core written questionnaire for atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR), and food allergy (FA). At the same time, height, weight, duration of dwelling on the island, home environment, lifestyle, and exercise habits were also asked.The target population comprised 352 children, of whom 284 (80.6%) completed the questionnaires. The current prevalence was 9.3% for BA, 4.3% for AD, 17.8% for AR, and 3.0% for FA. Significantly lower rates of current BA and AD were observed compared to previous reports from Japan. The percentage of children belonging to sports clubs, and exercising more than 3 times per week at the Ogasawara Islands is higher compared with the national average.The lower prevalence of BA and AD in the Ogasawara Islands implies the influence of differences in the living environment and exercise habits.",

However, anti-Ascaris IgE has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of asthma symptoms. We examined the association between serum levels of anti-Ascaris IgE and bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) in children living in rural Bangladesh.Serum anti-Ascaris IgE level was measured and the BHR test done in 158 children aged 9 years selected randomly from a general population of 1705 in the Matlab Health and Demographic Surveillance Area of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. We investigated wheezing symptoms using a questionnaire from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. BHR tests were successfully done on 152 children (108 'current wheezers'; 44 'never-wheezers'). We examined the association between anti-Ascaris IgE level and wheezing and BHR using multiple logistic regression analyses.Of 108 current-wheezers, 59 were BHR-positive; of 44 never-wheezers, 32 were BHR-negative. Mean anti-Ascaris IgE levels were significantly higher (12.51 UA/ml; 95% confidence interval (CI), 9.21-17.00) in children with current wheezing with BHR-positive than in those of never-wheezers with BHR-negative (3.89; 2.65-5.70; t test, p < 0.001). A BHR-positive test was independently associated with anti-Ascaris IgE levels with an odds ratio (OR) = 7.30 [95% CI, 2.28-23.33], p = 0.001 when adjusted for total IgE, anti-Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus IgE, pneumonia history, parental asthma, Trichuris infection, forced expiratory volume in one second, eosinophilic leukocyte count, and sex.Anti-Ascaris IgE level is associated with an increased risk of BHR among 9-year-old rural Bangladeshi children.",

    "abstract": "An important aspect of sand dust emissions in association with respiratory disorders is the quantity of particulate matter. This is usually expressed as particulate matter less than 10 μm (PM10) and 2.5 μm (PM2.5). However, the composition of PM10 and PM2.5 varies. Light detection and ranging is used to monitor sand dust particles originating in East Asian deserts and distinguish them from air pollution aerosols. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the daily levels of sand dust particles and pulmonary function in schoolchildren in western Japan.In this panel study, the peak expiratory flow (PEF) of 399 schoolchildren was measured daily from April to May 2012. A linear mixed model was used to estimate the association of PEF with the daily levels of sand dust particles, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and PM2.5.There was no association between the daily level of sand dust particles and air pollution aerosols, while both sand dust particles and air pollution aerosols had a significant association with SPM and PM2.5. An increment of 0.018 km(-1) in sand dust particles was significantly associated with a decrease in PEF (-3.62 L/min; 95% confidence interval, -4.66 to -2.59). An increase of 14.0 μg/m(3) in SPM and 10.7 μg/m(3) in PM2.5 led to a significant decrease of -2.16 L/min (-2.88 to -1.43) and -2.58 L/min (-3.59 to -1.57), respectively, in PEF.These results suggest that exposure to sand dust emission may relate to pulmonary dysfunction in children in East Asia.",

The key factors in EOM pathogenesis remain unclear. The purpose of this study is to identify the important factors involved in EOM pathogenesis.Middle ear effusion samples were collected from 12 patients with EOM and 9 patients with secretory otitis media (SOM), as controls. Multiple cytokines in the effusion were measured using a Bio-Plex™ Human Cytokine 27-Plex panel. Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and elastase were measured by ELISA. The concentrations of EDN, elastase, and each cytokine were compared between the EOM and SOM groups. Furthermore, in the EOM group, each cytokine was examined for correlation with EDN and elastase.EDN and elastase concentrations were significantly higher in the EOM group than in the SOM group (p < 0.05). IL-5, IL-1β, MIP-1α, G-CSF, IL-1ra, IL-4, IFN-γ, MIP-1β, IL-10, TNF-α, VEGF, and IL-2 concentration was significantly higher in the EOM group than in the SOM group (p < 0.05). Significant positive correlations were found between EDN and IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, eotaxin, MIP-1α, PDGF-BB, and RANTES in the EOM group (p < 0.05).Our study showed that IL-5, IL-2, MIP-1α, and IL-1ra are the important factors involved in EOM pathogenesis. Furthermore, not only eosinophil, but also neutrophil are involved in middle ear inflammation of EOM.",

Particularly, the incidence of allergic diseases has been increased tremendously within the last decades. This world-wide trend clearly indicates the demand for new approaches in the investigation of early allergy development. Recent studies underlined the basic postulate of the hygiene hypothesis that early exposure to microbial stimuli plays a crucial role in the prevention of chronic inflammatory conditions in adulthood. There is ample evidence that, both, exogenous microbes and endogenous microbial communities, the human microbiota, shape the developing immune system and might be involved in prevention of pathologic pro-inflammatory trails. According to the Barker hypothesis, epidemiological studies pointed to transmaternal transmission from the mother to the offspring already in prenatal life. Experimental data from murine models support these findings. This state of the art review provides an overview on the current literature and presents new experimental concepts that point out to future application in the prevention of allergic diseases.",

Viral infection is a major cause of asthma exacerbation, and the expression of IFN-γ-inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) is up-regulated in virus-induced asthma. As β2-adrenergic agonists, such as formoterol or salbutamol, are used to treat asthma exacerbation, we examined whether formoterol or salbutamol could modify eosinophil functions such as adhesiveness, particularly those activated by cysLTs or IP-10.Eosinophils were isolated from the blood of healthy subjects and were pre-incubated with either formoterol or salbutamol, and subsequently stimulated with IL-5, LTD4, or IP-10. Adhesion of eosinophils to intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 was measured using eosinophil peroxidase assays. The generation of eosinophil superoxide anion (O2(-)) was examined based on the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome C. Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) release was evaluated by ELISA as a marker of degranulation.Neither formoterol nor salbutamol suppressed the spontaneous adhesion of eosinophils to ICAM-1. However, when eosinophils were activated by IL-5, LTD4, or IP-10, formoterol, but not salbutamol, suppressed the adhesion to ICAM-1. Formoterol also suppressed IL-5, LTD4, or IP-10 induced eosinophil O2(-) generation or EDN release.These findings suggest that formoterol, but not salbutamol, suppresses eosinophil functions enhanced by IL-5, LTD4, or IP-10. As these factors are involved in the development of asthma exacerbation, our results strongly support the hypothesis that administration of formoterol is a novel strategy for treating asthma exacerbation.",

    "abstract": "Asthma has a higher prevalence in athlete populations such as Olympic athletes than in the general population. Correct diagnosis and management of asthma in athletes is important for symptom control and avoidance of doping accusations. However, few reports are available on asthma treatment in the athlete population in clinical practice. In this study, we focused on the clinical efficacy of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for asthma in a Japanese athlete population. The study subjects included athletes who visited the Niigata Institute for Health and Sports Medicine, Niigata, Japan for athletic tests and who were diagnosed with asthma on the basis of respiratory symptoms and positive results in a bronchodilator or bronchial provocation test such as exercise, hypertonic saline, or methacholine provocation. The athletes received ICS alone for at least 3 months, and the clinical background, sports type, and treatment efficacy were analyzed. The study population comprised 80 athletes (59 men and 21 women) with a median age of 16.0 years. Regarding sports type, 28 athletes engaged in winter sports (35%), 22 in endurance sports (27.5%), and 25 in indoor sports (31.3%). Although ICS is the primary treatment in athlete asthma, 16.3% of the athletes showed an unsatisfactory response to treatment according to the Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness (GETE). These subjects were characterized by a decreased response to methacholine and lower values for FEV1/FVC and type 2 helper T cell (Th2)-associated biomarkers relative to responsive athletes. In multivariate analysis, FEV1/FVC and the logarithm to the base 10 of the IgE level were independently associated with the ICS response. These data suggest that ICS is effective for asthma in most athletes. However, certain asthmatic athletes are less responsive to ICS than expected. The pathogenesis in these subjects may differ from that of conventional asthma characterized by chronic allergic airway inflammation.",

However, PM10 and PM2.5 consist of various substances besides AD. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems can selectively measure the quantity of AD particles to distinguish non-spherical airborne particles from spherical airborne particles.

A linear mixed model was used to estimate the association of PEF with sand dust particles detected by LIDAR. Increases in the interquartile range of AD particles (0.018 km−1) led to changes in PEF of −0.42 L/min (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.85 to 0.01). An increase of 11.8 μg/m3 in suspended particulate matter and 6.9 μg/m3 in PM2.5 led to decreases of −0.17 L/min (−0.53 to 0.21) and 0.03 L/min (−0.35 to 0.42), respectively. A heavy AD day was defined as a day with a level of AD particles >0.032 km−1, which was the average plus one standard deviation during the study period, and six heavy AD days were identified.

We conducted a nationwide questionnaire survey for patients and medical professionals.A questionnaire survey was conducted of adult patients on inhaled drugs (ages 18-92 years, 820 individuals) and medical professionals (pharmacists or nurses) who provided instruction on inhalation therapy to these patients in 23 institutions in Japan to investigate the technique and the level of understanding (knowledge) of the inhalation therapy. Changes in the recognition of performance of inhalation technique and inhalation knowledge with increasing age were analyzed.According to patients' subjective assessment, there was no deterioration in the performance of the inhalation technique or loss of the knowledge with increasing age. On the other hand, medical professionals' objective assessment revealed a significant loss of both inhalation technique and knowledge with increasing age. Not many elderly patients noticed their own problems themselves, revealing a great perception gap between elderly patients and medical professionals. Thus, there was concern that patients would unconsciously practice the inhalation procedure improperly. On the other hand, in comparison with non-elderly patients, elderly patients were less resistant to continuation of therapy, suggesting that they would be more likely to accept instruction on inhalation therapy.Elderly patients are apt to assume that they \"understand well\", therefore, in order to recognize and close the perception gap between elderly patients and medical professionals, it is necessary to provide them with more aggressive (frequent) instructions on inhalation therapy.",

The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the association between sPD-L1 levels with eosinophil count as well as disease severity in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients.90 patients with AR were selected. Disease severity was determined by a modified Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) classification as mild, moderate and severe. Whole blood samples were collected. Then eosinophil count and serum sPD-L1 were detected by a hematologic analyzer and a commercial ELISA kit.13 (14.44%), 31 (34.44%), and 46 (51.12%) of patients had mild, moderate and severe disease, respectively. The mean levels of sPD-L1 and eosinophil count were ascertained 18.38 ± 14.42 ng/ml and 422.43 ± 262.26 cell/μl. A significant inverse correlation was determined between sPD-L1 levels and eosinophil count (r = -0.364, P < 0.001). Moreover, we detected a significant negative association between sPD-L1 levels and disease severity (r = -0.384, P < 0.001).It is deduced that sPD-L1 can be used as a helpful marker to determine the severity of AR. Furthermore, this study indicated that sPD-L1 may have an inhibitory role in AR development, and its modulation may be considered as a useful accessory therapeutic approach for reduction of AR progression.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining high treatment adherence levels is critical for effective management of chronic diseases. The Adherence Starts with Knowledge 20 (ASK-20) questionnaire is the only linguistically validated patient-reported treatment adherence tool available in Japan. We conducted additional analyses on ASK-20 data from Japanese adults with asthma.This was a prospective, non-interventional, single-visit, multi-centre study in Japanese adults (n = 300) with asthma receiving long-term treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or ICS/long-acting beta-agonists. We tested the reliability, validity and the relationship between different adherence conditions and ASK-20 score. At one centre, ICS adherence prescription rate was calculated retrospectively based on 2-year percentage ICS adherence data contained within medical records.The ASK-20 had good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.76; n = 290). Discriminant validity was demonstrated with significant correlations between the percentage ICS adherence rates and both the mean ASK-20 total score and mean total barrier count (TBC) (r = -0.51 and -0.58, p < 0.001; n = 111). The ASK-20 total score discriminated between subjects with good and poor adherence measured by patients' reported questionnaire and between those of high and low percentage ICS adherence rates. All other factors that possibly affect adherence were correlated with the mean ASK-20 total score and mean TBC in addition to the number of medicines taken every day.The Japanese ASK-20 is a reliable tool for assessing possible medication adherence barriers and adherence behaviour in Japanese adults with asthma. Furthermore, our results are comparable with those obtained using the ASK-20 in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is exacerbated by sweating, and the skin of most patients with AD are resided by Malassezia (M.) fungi. Recently, MGL_1304 produced by Malassezia globosa was identified as the major histamine releasing antigen in human sweat.The full length cDNA of the counterpart of MGL_1304 in Malassezia restricta (Mala r 8), was cloned by degenerate PCR and rapid identification of cDNA ends (RACE). Recombinant MGL_1304, and its counterparts, Mala s 8 (produced by Malassezia sympodialis) and Mala r 8 were prepared, and compared in their allergenicities by dot blot analysis and histamine release tests with sera and basophils of patients with AD.The identities between MGL_1304 and Mala s 8, MGL_1304 and Mala r 8, and Mala s 8 and Mala r 8 were 68%, 78%, and 76%, respectively, in protein sequences. Dot blot analysis revealed that the level of IgE binding to Mala s 8 was higher than that of MGL_1304. However, histamine release tests revealed that MGL_1304 and Mala r 8 possessed higher activity than Mala s 8. In addition, the crude lysate of M. globosa showed higher histamine release ability than that of M. sympodialis.Patients with AD showed hypersensitivities against MGL_1304 and its homologs. However, the allergenicities of the homologs are variable and the histamine release activities may be different from the solid-phase binding activities for IgE. Sweat allergy should be carefully evaluated with biological activities of MGL_1304 and its homologs of other Malassezia fungi residing on the skin.",

This study aimed to determine which factors modify the effect of SLIT through post hoc analysis of a previous phase 3 trial of standardized Japanese cedar (JC) pollen extract (CEDARTOLEN®).The study included 482 patients who had previously completed a phase 3 trial during two seasons. The SLIT and placebo groups each contained 241 subjects. Because pollen dispersal differed in the two seasons, we identified good and poor responders from the SLIT group in the 2nd season. We compared patient baseline characteristics, changes in serum immunoglobulin, and severity of symptoms in the 1st season between good and poor responders, as well as between SLIT and placebo groups.When we compared the baseline characteristics of good and poor responders, a significant difference was observed in body mass index (BMI) such that the patients with BMI ≥25 presented with lower treatment efficacy. No significant difference was observed in correlation with any other factors or treatment-induced alterations of serum immunoglobulin levels. We found that 75.3% of the patients with moderate symptoms and 50.9% of the patients with severe or very severe symptoms in the 1st season met our criteria for good responders in the 2nd season.BMI might modify the effect of SLIT; however, other factors were not related clearly. The severity of symptoms in the 1st season of treatment does not predict that in the 2nd season.",

Two hundred and sixty-six cases were collected from March 2014 to March 2016.The cases included 240 events of immediate-type food allergies caused by cow's milk (n = 100), hen's egg (n = 42), wheat (n = 40), and peanuts (n = 11). Exercise-related events were reported in 19 cases; however, the diagnosis of food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis with a specific causative food was only made in 4 cases (wheat, n = 2; fish, n = 1; squid, n = 1). The frequent reasons for the causative intake included programmed intake (n = 48), failure to check the food labeling (n = 43), and consuming an inappropriate food (n = 26). AAIs were used at schools or nurseries in 67 cases, with school or nursery staff members administering the AAI in 39 cases (58%). On arriving at the hospital, the symptom grade was improved in 71% of the cases, while grade 4 symptoms remained in 20% of the cases. No lethal cases or sequelae were reported.AAIs were used effectively, even by school teachers. The need to visit a hospital after the use of an AAI should be emphasized because additional treatment might be required.",

Cultured decidua-derived MCs were generated by culturing decidual cells with stem cell factor. An ultrastructural analysis of primary decidual MCs and cultured decidua-derived MCs was performed using a transmission electron microscope. Receptor and protease expression was analyzed using FACS. Histamine released from MCs was measured using enzyme immune assays.A larger proportion of tryptase positive(+) MCs in decidua was present on the maternal side. Both enzymatically dispersed decidual MCs and cultured decidua-derived MCs showed an FcεRIα+Kit+tryptase+chymase+ phenotype. Their granules contenting particles exhibited variable amounts of electron-lucent space separating electron-dense particles. Both enzymatically dispersed decidual MCs and cultured decidua-derived MCs released comparable amounts of histamine following FcεRI aggregation.The isolation method for MCs from decidua during early pregnancy and the culture system for decidua-derived MCs may enable the roles of decidual MC during pregnancy to be explored.",

The relationship between the severity of non-IgE-GI-FAs and both clinical and laboratory findings were examined.Elevation of C-reactive protein levels and a decrease in total protein and albumin were observed in accordance with allergy severity. In an endoscopic examination, inflammatory findings were confirmed in large areas of the colonic mucosa in case of higher severity levels, and infiltration of inflammatory cells other than eosinophils was found in the severest grade. Extensively hydrolyzed milk or amino acid-based milk was required for all patients with the severest grade. In addition, the timing of acquiring tolerance tended to be late for this grade.Classification and determination of the severity of non-IgE-GI-FAs in neonates and infants may not only contribute to elucidation of the pathogenesis but may also be useful in the clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is an established efficacious approach for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). However, SLIT requires a long administration period to establish stable and adequate responses. This study investigated the efficacy of the sublingual administration of an allergen with liposomes enclosing α-GalCer (α-GC-liposome) as a potential adjuvant in mice with AR. Mice with AR induced by OVA received the sublingual administration of OVA, α-GC-liposomes, or OVA plus α-GC-liposomes for 7 days. After nasal re-challenge with OVA, nasal symptoms were evaluated. The serum levels of OVA-specific Ig, the cytokine production of CD4+ T cells in the cultures of cervical lymph node (CLN) cells, and the gene expression of CLNs were analyzed. Although IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 production from CD4+ T cells in CLN cells was significantly inhibited by the sublingual administration of OVA alone in mice with AR induced by OVA, their nasal symptoms were not significantly diminished. However, the combined sublingual administration of α-GC-liposomes and OVA completely suppressed nasal symptoms, downregulated Th2 and Th17 type cytokine production in CD4+ T cells as well as Th2 and Th17 gene expressions, and upregulated Th1 type cytokine production as well as Th1 gene expressions in CLN cells. Additionally, the serum levels of specific IgG2a were promoted, and specific IgE and IgG1 were inhibited. Our findings suggest that the sublingual administration of an allergen with α-GC-liposomes as an adjuvant might increase the therapeutic efficacy and effectiveness of this treatment method.",

    "abstract": "Although the guidelines in most countries do not recommend continuous inhalation of l-isoproterenol to treat pediatric patients with acute severe exacerbation of asthma, lower dose of l-isoproterenol has been widely used in Japan. To determine whether the efficacy of low-dose l-isoproterenol was superior to that of salbutamol, we conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Hospitalized patients aged 1–17 years were eligible if they had severe asthma exacerbation defined by the modified pulmonary index score (MPIS). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive inhalation of l-isoproterenol (10 μg/kg/h) or salbutamol (500 μg/kg/h) for 12 hours via a large-volume nebulizer with oxygen. The primary outcome was the change in MPIS from baseline to 3 hours after starting inhalation. Trial registration number UMIN000001991. From December 2009 to October 2013, 83 patients (42 in the l-isoproterenol group and 41 in the salbutamol group) were enrolled into the study. Of these, one patient in the l-isoproterenol group did not receive the study drug and was excluded from the analysis. Compared with salbutamol, l-isoproterenol reduced MPIS more rapidly. Mean (SD) changes in MPIS at 3 hours were −2.9 (2.5) in the l-isoproterenol group and −0.9 (2.3) in the salbutamol group (difference −2.0, 95% confidence interval −3.1 to −0.9; P < 0.001). Adverse events occurred in 1 (2%) and 11 (27%) patients in the l-isoproterenol and salbutamol groups, respectively (P = 0.003). Hypokalemia and tachycardia occurred only in the salbutamol group. Low-dose l-isoproterenol has a more rapid effect with fewer adverse events than salbutamol.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), especially eosinophilic CRS (ECRS), is an intractable upper airway inflammatory disease. Establishment of serum biomarkers reflecting the pathophysiology of CRS is desirable in a clinical setting. As IgG4 production is regulated by type 2 cytokines, we sought to determine whether serum IgG4 levels can be used as a biomarker for CRS. Association between the serum IgG4 levels and clinicopathological factors was analyzed in 336 CRS patients. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the cut-off value of serum IgG4 levels that can be used to predict the post-operative recurrence. Serum IgG4 levels were significantly higher in patients with moderate to severe ECRS versus those with non to mild ECRS. The levels were also significantly higher in asthmatic patients and patients exhibiting recurrence after surgery compared to controls. ROC analysis determined that the best cut-off value for the serum IgG4 level to predict the post-operative recurrence was 95 mg/dL. The corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 39.7% and 80.5%, respectively. When we combined the two cut-off values for the serum IgG4 and periostin, patients with high serum levels of either IgG4 or periostin exhibited a high post-operative recurrence (OR: 3.95) as compared to patients having low serum levels of both IgG4 and periostin. The present results demonstrate that the serum IgG4 level is associated with disease severity and post-operative course in CRS. In particular, the combination of serum IgG4 and periostin could be a novel biomarker that predicts post-operative recurrence.",

Although human IgE cross-reactivity has been reported between HDM and Ascaris antigens, it remains unclear whether it contributes to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. We herein investigated the induction of cross-reactive antibodies and T cells in mice and effects of airway exposure to HDM antigens after preimmunization with Ascaris antigens.Mice were intraperitoneally immunized with HDM or Ascaris antigens with Alum, followed by the intranasal administration of HDM antigens. Serum antigen-specific IgE and IgG were measured by ELISA. Cytokine release in splenocytes from Ascaris-immunized mice upon in vitro restimulation with HDM antigens were measured by ELISA.Immunization with Ascaris or HDM antigens induced cross-reactive IgG1. Splenocytes from Ascaris-immunized mice released IL-5 and IL-13 in response to the restimulation with HDM antigens. Subsequent airway exposure to HDM antigens promoted the induction of HDM-specific IgE and upregulation of HDM-specific IgG1 in Ascaris-immunized mice, whereas these responses were not detected or smaller without the Ascaris presensitization.We demonstrated that the immunization of naïve mice with Ascaris antigens induced production of antibodies and differentiation of Th2 cells, which were cross-reactive to HDM antigens, and accelerated induction of serum HDM-specific IgE upon subsequent airway exposure to HDM antigens in mice. These results suggest that sensitization to HDM towards IgE-mediated allergic diseases is faster in individuals with a previous history of Ascaris infection than in those without presensitization to Ascaris.",

It is thought that CCR3 plays an important role in the recruitment and activation of eosinophils in nasal polyposis. We examined nasal polyp extract-induced eosinophil chemotaxis and the effect of a CCR3 antagonist using EZ-TAXIScan, a novel real-time chemotaxis assay device.Nasal polyps were obtained from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients during surgery. The polyps were homogenized and eotaxin levels in the extracts were measured. Eosinophils were purified from human peripheral blood by the CD16 negative selection method. Nasal polyp extract-induced eosinophil chemotaxis, with or without CCR3 antagonist, was assessed by EZ-TAXIScan.There was a significant positive correlation between the eosinophil counts in nasal polyp and eotaxin levels in the nasal polyp extracts. Using EZ-TAXIScan, eosinophil chemotactic responses were observed following stimulation with nasal polyp extracts. There was a significant positive correlation between the chemotactic index toward the nasal polyp extracts and their eotaxin levels. Nasal polyp extract-induced chemotaxis was completely inhibited by CCR3 antagonist but not by chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) antagonist which inhibited PGD2-induced eosinophil chemotaxis.The CCR3 pathway may play an important role in the pathogenesis of eosinophil recruitment in nasal polyps through selective eosinophil chemotaxis.",

    "abstract": "Viral infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbation. Virally infected epithelial cells undergo apoptosis. Although in healthy conditions, apoptosis may have a host-defensive role in limiting virus spread, this process may have a detrimental effect on damaged epithelium in asthma. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the receptors for various pathogens, and viruses possess several components that can activate TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8. However, as it has not been determined as to which component is responsible for virus-induced epithelial cell apoptosis, we comprehensively analyzed the effects of all TLR ligands on apoptosis. BEAS-2B cells or primary cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) were stimulated by TLR 2, 3, 4, 5, 7/8, and 9 ligands and cell death was analyzed by flow cytometry. Chemokine generations induced by these ligands were also analyzed. The TLR3 ligand polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) specifically induced chemokine generation and apoptosis, while other TLR ligands including those for TLR5, 7/8, and 9 had no effect. The response to poly I:C had two phases, which included rapid secretion of chemokines and subsequent apoptosis in a later phase. Poly I:C induced apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner and functionally upregulated the expression of Fas. Previous findings indicating that viruses induced caspase-dependent death and upregulated Fas expression were reproduced by poly I:C, suggesting the central role of dsRNA/TLR3 in virus-induced apoptosis. Since these processes may have detrimental effects on pre-existing epithelial damage, the dsRNA/TLR3 pathway may be potential novel treatment target for virus-induced exacerbation of asthma.",

    "abstract": "An orosomucoid-like 3 (ORMDL3)/gasdermin B (GSDMB) gene locus on chromosome 17q is consistently associated with childhood-onset asthma, which is highly atopic. As some evidence suggests the relationship between asthma and allergic sensitization reflects asthma patient susceptibility to augmented IgE responses driven by common environmental allergens rather than an increased asthma risk after allergen exposure, we aimed to determine any relationships between this locus region and childhood-onset adult asthma with regard to serum total IgE levels or allergic sensitization. We conducted a case–control association study using three independent Japanese populations (3869 total adults) and analyzed the ORs for association of rs7216389, an expression quantitative trait locus for ORMDL3/GSDMB, with adult asthma according to onset age. Additionally, associations between the rs7216389 genotype and total serum IgE levels or allergic sensitization was examined. Rs7216389 was associated with both childhood-onset adult asthma (OR for asthmatic patients afflicted at the age of 10 years or younger = 1.61, p = 0.00021) and asthmatic patients with higher levels of total serum IgE (OR for asthmatic patients with IgE ≥1000IU/mL = 1.55, p = 0.0033). In both healthy controls and in the combined healthy and asthmatic individuals, rs7216389 was correlated with increased total serum IgE levels (p < 0.0005), but not allergic sensitization (p > 0.1). ORMDL3/GSDMB is an important susceptibility gene for childhood-onset adult asthma in Japanese populations and this association is linked to elevated total serum IgE levels but not to allergic sensitization.",

    "abstract": "Cholinergic urticaria (CholU) manifests small, itchy and/or painful wheals occurring upon perspiration and mechanically involving acetylcholine (Ach). Although a considerable number of studies have been conducted, the pathomechanisms underlying perspiration-associated release of histamine remain to be elucidated. We have proposed that CholU can be categorized into two major subtypes: Ach-indirectly induced, sweat allergic type and Ach-directly induced, depressed sweating type. In the former type, Ach evokes perspiration, and some sweat antigen(s) leaking from the sweat ducts to the dermis may stimulate mast cells to release histamine. In this scenario, the ducts might be damaged or obstructed for sweat leakage, and patients frequently exhibit positive autologous sweat skin test, representing \"sweat allergy (hypersensitivity)\". On the other hand, the latter Ach-mast cell directly interacting type, typically seen as \"CholU with anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis (CUAH)\", eccrine sweat gland epithelial cells lack cholinergic receptor M3 expression. The expression of cholinergic receptors is completely absent in the anhidrotic areas and only slightly expressed in the hypohidrotic areas. In the hypohidrotic area, where pinpoint wheal occurs, it is hypothesized that released Ach cannot be completely trapped by cholinergic receptors of eccrine glands and overflows to the adjacent mast cells, leading to wheal formation. Thus, sweat allergy is not a requirement in this depressed sweating type. Although some additional complications, such as angioedema, anaphylaxis, and cold urticaria, have been documented, these two types represent the modes of action of Ach in this enigmatic urticaria.",

Population-based data on hazelnut and concomitant birch-pollen allergy in children are lacking. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of primary and pollen-associated hazelnut allergy and sensitization profiles in school-aged children in Berlin, Germany.1570 newborn children were recruited in Berlin in 2005-2009. The school-age follow-up (2014-2017) was based on a standardized web-based parental questionnaire and clinical evaluation by a physician including skin prick tests, allergen specific immunoglobulin E serum tests and placebo-controlled double-blind oral food challenges, if indicated.1004 children (63.9% response) participated in the school-age follow-up assessment (52.1% male). For 1.9% (n = 19, 95%-confidence interval 1.1%-2.9%) of children their parents reported hazelnut-allergic symptoms, for half of these to roasted hazelnut indicating primary hazelnut allergy. Symptoms of birch-pollen allergy were reported for 11.6% (n = 116 95%-CI 9.7%-13.7%) of the children. Both birch-pollen allergy and hazelnut allergy associated symptoms affected 0.6% (n = 6, 95%-CI 0.2%-1.3%) of children. Assessment of allergic sensitization was performed in 261 participants and showed that almost 20% of these children were sensitized to hazelnut, being the most frequent of all assessed food allergens, or birch-pollen, the majority to both.Based on parental reports hazelnut-allergic symptoms were far less common than sensitization to hazelnut. This needs to be considered by physicians to avoid unnecessary changes in diet due to sensitization profiles only, especially when there is a co-sensitization to hazelnut and birch-pollen.",

However, dermal pain evoked by sweating stimuli has been under investigated.To clarify characteristics of tingling dermal pain on sweating, we retrospectively evaluated clinical and histopathological manifestations in 30 patients having the main problem of dermal pain on sweating, and the efficacy of treatments.Dermal pain upon sweating affected mostly young males. It accompanied eruptions upon sweating and/or hypohidrosis in 24 patients, while 6 patients had dermal pain independently of hypohidrosis or eruptions. Dermal pain appeared immediately upon exposure to sweating stimuli, and disappeared within mostly 30 or 10 min. Hypohidrosis was not necessarily generalized but localized or absent. Histological analysis revealed that dermal pain could occur even without morphological changes and inflammation of sweat glands. Hypersensitivity to sweat contents was found only in 26% of patients. Sweat histamine and increase of plasma histamine after thermal induction in patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. Effectiveness of steroid pulse therapy was demonstrated for dermal pain with hypohidrosis. Medications acting on nervous systems and regular sweat-inducing activities for promoting perspiration were also effective.Short-lasting tingling dermal pain appears immediately upon exposure to sweating stimuli, regardless of developing eruptions and/or presence of hypohidrosis, but possibly in association with sweat and plasma histamine.",

Overall, 235 of 280 patients completed the study. Most patients were aged ≥ 18 and < 65 years; adolescents (≥ 12 and ≤ 18 years) accounted for 9.6% of the total population. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) duration of CSU at baseline was 1.6 ± 3.1 years; 46.1% of patients had had CSU for < 6 months. At baseline, the mean ± SD of Urticaria Control Test (UCT) score, Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were 5.1 ± 3.2, 25.2 ± 11.9, and 8.4 ± 5.9, respectively. The mean ± SD duration of the observation period was 330.3 ± 86.2 days. Relapse was reported in 65 patients, 51, 9, and 5 of whom required retreatment with omalizumab 1, 2, and ≥ 3 times, respectively. The incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was reported in 11.8%, 1.4%, and 3.9% of patients, respectively. The most common AEs were urticaria (1.8%) and eczema (1.1%). No adolescents experienced ADRs.

    "abstract": "Platelets play a modulatory role in inflammatory response by secreting a vast array of granules and disintegrating into membrane-bound microparticles upon activation. The interplay between eosinophils and platelets is postulated to be implicated in the pathology of allergic airway inflammation. In this study, we investigated whether activated platelets can induce eosinophil extracellular trap (EET) formation, a cellular process by which activated eosinophils release net-like DNA fibers. Platelets were stimulated with the calcium ionophore, A23187, and the platelet agonists, thrombin and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Platelet cultures were fractionated into conditioned medium (CM) and pellet, which were then overlaid on eosinophils to examine EET formation. The CM and pellet from A23187-activated platelets stimulated eosinophils to generate EET, whereas those from thrombin- or ADP-activated platelets failed to induce such generation. The EET-inducing activity of the A23187-activated platelet culture was linearly proportional to the number of activated platelets. Interestingly, while EET formation induced by the direct stimulation of eosinophils with A23187 was NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent, EET formation induced by A23187-activated platelets was NOX-independent and significantly inhibited by necroptosis pathway inhibitors. Activated platelets and their products may induce EET formation, thereby potentiating their role in eosinophilic airway inflammation.",

This review will describe the process by which antigens or allergens are recognized by the GALT and the characteristic immune responses induced thereafter. Orally administered antigens induce distinct immune responses in the Peyer's patches, lamina propria and the intestinal epithelium. In addition to these local immune responses in the gut, ingested antigens are known to affect systemic immunity. These may induce a suppressed state of systemic immune responsiveness, which is called oral tolerance, or in some cases they may elicit a systemic IgE antibody response which may lead to allergic reactions. Information on the regions on food allergens recognized by T cells and IgE antibodies is important in understanding the fates of food allergens after being recognized by the GALT. The structure of T and B cell epitopes on food allergens and the possibility of modulation of allergic reactions by amino-acid substituted analogs of allergen- derived peptides will also be discussed.",

Although mushrooms are commonly used as food throughout the world, food allergy to mushrooms is not very common. A severe case of anaphylaxis in a 32-year-old woman who experienced facial edema and generalized urticaria minutes after eating mushroom curry is presented herein. The purpose of the present study was to identify the putative allergen in the cultivated mushroom Agaricus bisporus. A combination of biochemical fractionation/ analytical techniques (gel filtration, ultrafiltration, ion-moderated cation-exchange chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS)) and allergy diagnostic tests (skin prick test (SPT), allergen-specific IgE) were used. The SPT with mushroom extract was strongly positive; however, allergen-specific IgE could not be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The SPT was also positive with cooked, steamed or dried mushroom extracts, suggesting the presence of a heat-stable allergen. Gel filtration of mushroom extract on Sephadex G-25, as analyzed by SPT, indicated the presence of a low molecular weight (< 1 kDa) allergen. Using ion-moderated cation-exchange chromatography, the allergen was isolated and identified as mannitol based on skin reactivity. Mannitol was confirmed by GC-MS analysis. This is the first report of food allergy to cultivated mushroom A. bisporus and also the first report describing a low molecular weight allergen (mannitol) in mushroom.",

To confirm the role of mast cells as a source of MMPs, we investigated the production of MMP and its pathway in human cultured mast cells (HCMC). We also investigated the production of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs).HCMC was stimulated with phorbor 12-miristate 13-acetate (PMA) and/or calcium ionophore A23187 (A23187), and the resulting MMP production was evaluated by gelatin zymography and western blotting. Expression of MMP and TIMP mRNA was also examined. Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was measured by ELISA and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was evaluated by western blotting.We detected the de novo synthesis of MMP-9 in HCMC after stimulation with PMA and found that the synthesis was mediated through protein kinase C-mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-ERK pathway. The MMP-9 production induced by PMA was suppressed by simultaneous treatment with A23187, whereas GM-CSF production was potentiated. We also detected the expression of mRNA for membrane-type 1 (MT1)-MMP, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 after stimulation with PMA. Glucocorticoids and flavonoids inhibited MMP-9 production, and TIMPs and MMP inhibitors inhibited the gelatinolytic activity of mast cell-derived MMP-9. Furthermore, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a protease inhibitor, inhibited the conversion from proMMP-9 to active MMP-9.These results suggest that the human mast cell is a leading member of MMP production, and the production, activation and activity are controllable by pharmacological agents.",

One of the forms of management is self-care (preventive care), which can be categorized as 'indoor' and 'outdoor'. Outdoor self-care is usually emphasized, but indoor self-care is also important. Considerable pollen is found in indoor dust and this is thought to be one of the factors that worsens pollinosis and enables it to persistent for a long time, even after the pollinating period has finished. Taking this into consideration, we investigated the dynamic state of indoor pollen. Floating indoor house dust was collected in Petri dishes. The amount of pollen in the house dust samples collected was measured using an LCD laboratory highly sensitive Cry j1 assay kit. The results showed that, indoors, a lot of Japanese cedar pollen (JCP) was found on the floor (tatami mats, carpets), sofas and curtains. The number of JCP in living rooms peaked in April after the pollinating period and decreased gradually; however, JCP was still found indoors, even as late as the following February. Floating JCP in the house was one-tenth of the JCP levels on the floor. Floating JCP increased on days with low humidity. Air conditioning temporarily increased levels of floating JCP in houses with an air conditioner, but the level of floating JCP decreased rapidly compared with the level of that in houses without an air conditioner. Nasal signs and symptoms disappeared completely at a level of 30 floating pollen counts/day per Petri dish. Considerable JCP was found floating indoors with house dust after a pollinating season.",

We enrolled 36 children with asthma (7 years of age or younger; mean, 3.8) in this study under an informed consent. After enrolling the 24 patients for the home visit, 12 families were enrolled as controls for the regular clinical guidance. Between June 1995 and June 1996, we visited the homes of 24 children with asthma enrolled in this study every month and performed a thorough HDM-avoidance counseling of more than 60 minutes (home visit counsel) at each visit. We compared the effects of this counseling with those of the regular clinical guidance given (10 minutes per patient) to the remaining 12 children with asthma. We also evaluated the effect of home visit counseling on children of two subgroups, i.e., an atopic (with positive IgE antibody against HDM) and a non-atopic (without detectable IgE antibodies against 8 common allergens) subgroup.Home visit counseling markedly reduced the frequencies of asthma attacks (p < 0.000001), the required theophylline dosages (p < 0.0005), and the levels of HDM allergens (p < 0.0005) in the atopic subgroups, whereas the effect of regular counseling on these 3 items was relatively less (p < 0.05 or not significant). Surprisingly, home visit counseling also markedly reduced the asthma attacks (p < 0.00001) and theophylline dosages (p < 0.00001) of children with non-atopic asthma.These results suggest that thorough allergen avoidance counseling is effective for children with non-atopic asthma as well as atopic asthma.",

    "abstract": "Clinical choice of β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (β2-agonists) is based on the parameter of receptor selectivity, potency, and duration of action. The guidelines for asthma management describe nothing about intrinsic efficacy concerning the use of β2-agonists. Since intrinsic efficacy refers to the ability to activate β2-adrenergic receptors independent of agonist concentration, β2-adrenergic desensitization may be associated with intrinsic efficacy. However, little is currently known whether chronic administration of high intrinsic efficacy drugs interferes with the effects of β2-agonists as a reliever medication. In this review, the causal relationship between intrinsic efficacy and desensitization to β2-agonists is examined in tracheal smooth muscle using isometric tension records. Reasonable clinical use of these agonists based on these observations is discussed. When β2-agonists intrinsic efficacy was measured as relaxation response (the maximum inhibitory effects against 1 μM methacholine-induced contraction), their rank order was : isoproterenol = procaterol = formoterol > salbutamol > salmeterol >> tulobuterol. Next, the subsequent response to short-acting β2-agonists (procaterol, salbutamol) was examined after continuous exposure to long-acting β2-agonists (formoterol, salmeterol, tulobuterol). β2- adrenergic desensitization induced by these long-acting β2-agonists was enhanced in proportion to their intrinsic efficacies. On the other hand, under the conditions of impairment of β2-adrenergic receptors, reduced responsiveness to these short-acting β2-agonists was enhanced in inverse proportion to the intrinsic efficacy. Although the clinical relevance of these results is still unclear, our data may provide evidence that weak partial agonists are useful as a controller medication, whereas full or strong agonists are useful as a reliever medication.",

    "abstract": "Hypersensitivity reactions to fish are a common food allergy, but IgE-binding activity to fish species have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to identify fish with high binding activity to IgE in sera from Japanese fish-hypersensitive individuals. 38 children with a history of at least one episode of hypersensitivity after ingestion of fish were enrolled and 34 children with no history of reactions and negative IgE results for at least five kinds of fish antigen were included as controls. Using a radioallergosorbent test, we examined IgE-binding to each fish species using sera from fish-hypersensitive subjects. Fish were then graded according to IgE-binding activity. Many fish species, including red salmon, silver salmon, yellowfin tuna, big eyed tuna, Atlantic tuna, saurel, skipper, yellowtail, Japanese sardine, bonita and mackerel had high IgE-binding activity. All of these fish are abundantly consumed in Japan. The hypersensitivity reactions experienced by many subjects occurred after ingestion of species with high IgE-binding activity. Only halibut (Osteichthyes) and sharks (Chondrichthyes) had low IgE-binding activity. A correlation was observed between IgE levels and expression of symptoms after fish ingestion. High consumption of salmon, tuna, scad (including saurel), skipper, yellowtail, sardine, bonita and mackerel in Japan might be the cause of the high IgE-binding activity of these species. The grades of fish species consumed widely in Japan are likely to be useful for nutritional instruction of fish-allergic patients.",

    "abstract": "We report two cases of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) in patients in whom systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) had initially been diagnosed or suspected. One patient, given a diagnosis of systemic JIA, was a 10-year-old boy who had presented with recurrent episodes of spike-fever, skin rash, arthritis, and myalgia. The other patient was his 7-year-old sister, who presented with similar symptoms and was suspected of having systemic JIA. Serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor super family 1A (TNFRSF1A), TNF-alpha, In- terleukin (IL) -6, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in two siblings and JIA patients. In addition, DNA sequencing of the TNFRSF1A gene in two siblings was also performed. A detailed family history showed that their mother had an episode of recurrent fever, arthritis, and myalgia with an increased serum CRP after the delivery of a daughter. Both siblings had serum levels of soluble TNFRSF1A that were below the normal reference range, and that did not reach a level corresponding to that of systemic JIA. On TNFRSF1A gene analysis, a single missense mutation resulting in C30Y was found in both siblings. Based on the clinical features and the TNFRSF1A mutation, both siblings were given a diagnosis of TRAPS. The serum levels of soluble TNFRSF1A, measured along with the CRP level, may be a useful screening marker for differentiating TRAPS from systemic JIA.",

The aim of our study was to examine whether polymorphisms or haplotypes in RIP2 were associated with childhood atopic asthma in a Japanese population. We screened the RIP2 gene for polymorphisms by direct sequencing and characterized the linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping of the gene. Seven variants were genotyped in childhood atopic asthma (n = 300) and normal controls (n = 637). We conducted case-control and case-only association studies between the variants and asthma-related phenotypes. Haplotype association analyses were also performed. A total of 31 variants were identified and none of the alleles or haplotypes of RIP2 were associated with asthma susceptibility. In the case-only study, an association between an RIP2 promoter polymorphism and childhood severe asthma (P=0.0032;odds ratio (OR) 3.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-7.87) was observed. Although polymorphisms in RIP2 are not likely to be associated with the development of asthma, the genetic variants might contribute to asthma severity in the Japanese population.",

Interestingly, Vα14 NKT cells are not essential for the induction of specific IgE response but they instead tend to induce suppression of specific IgE upon α-GalCer activation in vivo. The suppression in the IgE production is not detected either in Va14 NKT cell-deficient mice or in IFN-γ-deficient mice. Therefore, activated Vα14 NKT cells are able to exert a potent suppressive activity on Th2 cell differentiation and subsequent IgE production by producing a large amount of IFN-γ. In an OVA-induced asthma model, α-GalCer administration inhibited airway inflammation and airway hyperreactivity by IFN-γ from activated Vα14 NKT cells, thus suggesting the negative regulation of Th2-responses by the activated Vα14 NKT cells.",

These structural changes were induced in guinea pigs by repetitive inhalations of LPS, and the effects of theophylline and dexamethasone were examined.Male Hartley Guinea pigs weighing about 300 g were exposed to a nebulized solution of LPS (30 microg/mL) for 1 hour. Exposure to LPS was performed 15 times at 48-hour intervals. Histological analysis was performed, and infiltration of leukocytes in BALF, airway hyperreactivity and hydroxyproline content of the lung were measured 24 or 48 hours after the final exposure of LPS. Drugs were administered every day until 30 minutes before the final exposure.Repetitive exposure to LPS induced an influx of inflammatory cells into the BALF. Histological changes such as accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lung parenchyma, enlargement of alveoli, swelling of the alveolar walls and goblet cell hyperplasia in the airways were observed. Airway hyperreactivity and increased lung hydroxyproline content were also found in this model of chronic inflammatory lung injury. Some of these changes induced by repetitive LPS exposure were improved by treatment with theophylline or dexamethasone.Theophylline improved airway injury as well as airway hyperreactivity induced by repetitive exposure of the guinea pigs to LPS. These results suggest that theophylline treatment has ameliorative effects on airway disease with chronic inflammation.",

AD-like skin lesions were induced on the pinnae and backs of NC/Nga mice by daily application of Dp for 4 weeks. Mice were fed cow's milk casein (control), WPH or casein protein hydrolysate (CPH) diets for 2 weeks prior to Dp application. Clinical skin conditions were evaluated periodically by a clinical severity score, total serum IgE and soluble E-selectin levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). WPH-fed mice showed significantly less AD-like skin lesions than those fed casein diets at 2 and 4 weeks after Dp application. In contrast, CPH-fed mice had manifestations in a similar manner as casein-fed mice did, and did not show an inhibitory effect. Serum soluble E-selectin levels, known as a marker of disease activity in AD patients, were significantly lower in the WPH diet group. Our results suggest that in addition to its hypoallergenicity an anti-inflammatory function, dietary WPH might be useful for reducing the severity of AD-like skin lesions.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic disease prevalent in children which threatens their quality of life (QOL) through unexpected asthma attacks and/or the burden of daily self-management. As some conditions of chronic illness make it difficult for a child to accomplish normal developmental tasks, there may be fewer opportunities for the child to obtain a sense of achievement. This study investigated the reliability and validity of the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Japanese School-aged Children with Asthma Version 3 (JSCA-QOL v.3). This questionnaire includes 25 items with a 5-point Likert Scale format over five domains:\"asthma attack triggers\", \"change in daily life\", \"family support\", \"satisfaction with daily life\" and \"restriction in participating in daily activities\", and one summary scale. In the present study, 2,425 children with asthma aged from 10 to 18 years were investigated in Japan. The internal consistency reliability of each domain was investigated with Cronbach's α reliability coefficient, and test-retest reliability with Spearman's correlations coefficient. Factorial validity by factor analysis using maximum-likelihood extraction with promax rotation was performed. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 12.0J. The final number of effective replies was 2,097 (the rate of effective data was 86.5%). \"Asthma attack triggers\", \"change in daily life\", \"family support\", \"satisfaction with daily life\" and \"restriction in participating in daily activities\" showed a high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.66–0.86) as well as good test-retest reliability (Spearman's rho = 0.60, p < 0.01). The factorial validity was appropriate (KMO value = 0.90), because it was conceivable that the five factors extracted from factor analysis would be the same as in our hypothesis and support constructive validity. In addition, there was good correlation between the summary scale and the total QOL score (Spearman's rho = 0.58, p < 0.01). The present study showed that the JSCA-QOL v.3 is a reliable and valid measurement tool that can be used to appropriately assess QOL in school-aged children with asthma. As the JSCA-QOL v.3 can be easily completed in about 10 minutes, it can contribute as an efficient evaluation tool of the outcome of medical treatment through continual utilization in the outpatient clinic. The JSCA-QOL v.3 allows a health provider to help school-aged children with asthma to achieve their developmental tasks.",

    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of allergy to specific fungal species is confounded by the variability in allergens occurring with different diagnostic systems. We compared the halogen immunoassay (HIA), which uses allergens expressed by freshly germinated spores that are bound to protein binding membranes (PBM), with the commercial Pharmacia UniCap® assay (CAP) and with skin prick tests (SPT). Serum from 60 subjects was used; 30 were SPT positive and sensitized to at least one of Alternaria alternata or Aspergillus fumigatus and the other 30 were SPT negative to these fungi but known to be sensitized to non-fungal allergens. All sera were analyzed by CAP against A. alternata, A. fumigatus, Cladosporium herbarum and Epicoccum purpurascens. For HIA, spores from reference cultures belonging to these four species were germinated on PBM, laminated and then probed with each serum. Two independent observers using an ordinal ranking system quantified the intensity and occurrence of the resultant immunoglobulin E (IgE) immunostained haloes around spores and this was statistically compared with the results of the two conventional immunodiagnostic techniques. Germinated conidia of each species expressed detectable allergen in the HIA. The agreement between the ordinal rank scores assigned by the pair of observers was very good (k ≥ 0.8) and only differed for A. fumigatus (k = 0.66). Between 3% and 7% of SPT negative sera was identified by HIA to have specific IgE towards A. fumigatus and A. alternata. For all four species tested there were strong correlations between HIA and CAP (P < 0.0001). However the correlation of both HIA and CAP to SPT was weaker for A. alternata (rs = 0.44, P < 0.0153) and absent for A. fumigatus. Overall, the HIA is a new immunodiagnostic technique for the detection of sensitization to fungal allergens that correlates significantly with CAP and to a lesser extent with SPT. This may be due to extract variability and system differences. The significance of this derives from the unique ability of the HIA to measure IgE antibodies to the undegraded allergens that are actively secreted by germinating conidia and hyphae. These are the natural agents of exposure to fungi, and as such, are most likely to be relevant to clinical disease.",

    "abstract": "An imbalanced prevalence of allergic diseases occurs in the region of South East Asia. It has been suggested that a change in lifestyle associated with improved hygiene and modernization has altered the composition of human gastrointestinal microbiota, and hence susceptibility to allergy. This cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the differences between fecal microbiota in children living in areas with contrasting socioeconomic development. Fecal samples from 73 young children (age 3.0 ± 0.5) from rural Thailand and 69 age-matched children from urban Singapore were collected and studied using selective culture. Clinical data were also collected using modified ISAAC questionnaires, aiming to identify the key differences in the demographic as well as clinical features between the two study groups. The two contrasting populations studied differed significantly in multiple lifestyle factors such as family size, antibiotic use and sources of drinking water in the households. Rural children harbored significantly higher counts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) [7.1 (6.4, 8.3) us 6.0 (5.3, 7.0) logCFU/g, p < 0.001)], coliforms [8.9 (7.3, 10.2) us 6.9 (5.7, 7.7) logCFU/g, p < 0.001)] as well as staphylococci [5.3 (4.8, 6.3) us 4.3 (3.6, 5.0) logCFU/g, p < 0.001)] than their urban counterparts. However, enterococcal counts did not differ between the two groups. No single lifestyle factor could be identified to have caused such differences. Certain fecal microbial counts were higher in rural children compared with urban children in South East Asia. Several contrasting home environmental conditions and practices were also identified. These may serve as a basis for future investigation of lifestyle factors underlying the global gradient of the increasing trends of allergic diseases.",

We defined cedar asthma as a patient who satisfied the 2 criteria mentioned above. We found 6 adult asthma patients who fulfilled the two criteria. Five patients suffered from cedar pollinosis in addition to asthma, and 1 patient had no pollinosis. The cedar pollinosis preceded asthma in 3 cases and occurred at almost the same time in the other 2 cases. Pulmonary function was normal in these cases (FEV 1%, mean ± SD, 76.5 ± 10%), with a high threshold value in the non-specific airway hypersensitivity test (Ach-PC20, 2,696 to 20,000 Mg/ml, 9294 ± 2) and low total IgE (101 ± 86 IU/ml).

In the mouse, its gene expression is down-regulated by inter-leukin (IL)-5 and -9, and up-regulated by IL-10. However, the precise role of UGRP1 in human inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma has not been clarified. The objectives of this study were to establish an ELISA system to quantify UGRP1 protein, and to examine whether plasma UGRP1 levels are associated with the G-112A polymorphism, asthma susceptibility, and its severity. 152 asthma patients and 103 normal controls were involved in this study. Mice were immunized with recombinant UGRP1 and hybridoma cell lines were established. A sandwich ELISA system was established by using two monoclonal antibodies recognizing different epitopes. Plasma UGRP1 levels were measured with the ELISA system and the G-112A allele was detected by using real-time PCR. An ELISA system was established that allowed determination of UGRP1 levels within the range of 9.6–1250 pg/ml. The mean plasma UGRP1 levels for subjects with -112A allele were significantly lower than those without it (p = 0.025). Although there was no significant difference in the plasma UGRP1 levels between asthma patients and controls (p = 0.13), severe asthma patients without oral corticosteroid had significantly lower plasma UGRP1 levels compared to mild- or moderate-asthma patients and controls (p = 0.004, 0.03 and 0.003, respectively). The ELISA system for quantifing UGRP1 protein was established, and plasma UGRP1 levels were associated with the G-112A UGRP1 gene promoter polymorphism and the severity of asthma.",

To determine the in vivo effect of short-course AIC immunotherapy on CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in the nasal mucosa of ragweed-sensitive subjects. 19 ragweed-sensitive patients with allergic rhinitis were randomly assigned to receive either 6 escalating doses of AIC (0.06-12 μg; n = 12) or placebo (n = 7) at weekly intervals immediately before the 2001 ragweed season.

    "abstract": "Asthma and COPD are complex diseases with strong genetic and environmental components. These common pulmonary diseases have both different and similar clinical features. Molecular genetic techniques are being used to improve understanding of these common late onset disorders. Recently, several genes and genetic loci associated with increased susceptibility to asthma and COPD have been described. Many of these genes are expressed in the lung tissues, indicating that events in lung tissues might drive disease processes. Lung tissues are rich sources of innate danger signals, and an increased understanding of how the lung tissues communicate with the immune system to maintain healthy tissue might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory lung diseases in which injury and repair are in disequilibrium. Given that the innate immune system is at the interface between the airways and environmental insults, genetic polymorphisms in genes related to the innate immune system are likely to affect susceptibility to both asthma and CopD. In addition, some findings from genetic studies provide molecular support for the point of view proposed in the Dutch hypothesis regarding the relationship between asthma and COPD, which highlights the complexity of the pathways that can induce small airway disease and suggests that there is a continuum between asthma and COPD.",

    "abstract": "The inhalation of Salsola kali pollen is an important cause of pollinosis during summer and early fall throughout desert and semi-desert areas. Sal k 1 has been previously reported as a major allergen of S. kali pollen. In this study, we produced the recombinant Sal k 1 and also its low IgE-binding mutant form. We further compared the IgE binding ability of these two recombinant molecules. The recombinant Sal k 1 and its low IgE-binding variant, obtained by three amino acid exchanges (R142→ S, P143→ A, D144→ V), were cloned and expressed in E. coli, as proteins fused with thioredoxin and Histags, and then purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The IgE-binding capacity of the wild-type and mutated rSal k 1 was compared using immunoblotting, ELISA and inhibition assays by ten sera from S. kali allergic patients. Moreover, in vivo IgE-reactivity was investigated by the skin prick test. Both the recombinant and the mutated form of Sal k 1 were expressed in E. coli at a relatively high amount and soluble form. All sera recognized rSal k 1 via immunoassay analysis. In addition, inhibition assays demonstrated that the purified rSal k 1 was similar to its counterpart in the crude extract. The mutated rSal k 1 exhibited a reduced IgE-binding capacity against wild-type rSal k 1. This study demonstrates that purified rSal k 1 is comprised of IgE-epitopes similar to that of its natural counterpart and that the mutated variant showed a reduced IgE-binding capacity based on in vitro assays and in vivo provocation testing.",

    "abstract": "To initiate, monitor, and complete effective immunotherapy, biomarkers to predict and visualize the immune responses are needed. First, we need to identify the right candidate for immunotherapy. Secondly, the immune responses induced by immunotherapy should be monitored. For the first objective, analysis of polymorphisms of candidate genes may be helpful, but still be in development. Regarding biomarkers for immune responsese, there are numerous reports that evaluate immunotherapy-induced immune changes such as suppression of effector cells, deviation to Th1 cytokine production, and induction of regulatory T cells. No standardized methods, however, have been established. Among them, a functional assay of blocking IgG activity, the IgE-facilitated allergen binding assay, may be useful. We quantitated induced expression of an activation marker, CD203c, on basophils and found that the assay efficiently predicts sensitivity to particular allergen and severity of the allergen-induced symptoms. In patients who received rush immunotherapy for Japanese cedar pollinosis, reduction in CD203c expression after the therapy was observed, suggesting the utility of the test for monitoring immunotherapy.",

Many patients with pollinosis have specific IgE to both allergens from Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress pollen. We set out to identify T cell epitopes in Cha o 2, the second major allergen of Japanese cypress pollen.T cell lines (TCL) and T cell clones (TCC) specific to Cha o 2 were generated from allergic patients cross-reactive to Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress pollen. T cell epitopes in Cha o 2 were identified by responses of TCL stimulated with overlapping peptides. Abilities of IL-4/IFN-gamma production by TCC were evaluated using enzyme immunoassay.Using TCL, 11 dominant and subdominant T cell epitopes were identified in Cha o 2. The subsets of TCC were predominantly of T helper 2-type. A T cell epitope p141-160 in Cha o 2 and corresponding peptide in Cry j 2 showed high homology. Although TCC PC.205.159 responded to stimulation with p141-160 in Cha o 2, it did not respond with corresponding peptide in Cry j 2, therefore, the T cell epitope was unique to Cha o 2.Eleven T cell epitopes that were identified are unique to Cha o 2. Cha o 2 is a putative aeroallergen that can potentially sensitize human T cells. We concluded that generation of T cells specific to Cha o 2 in allergic patients acts as one of the causes of continuous allergic symptoms in April.",

The levels of cytokines in supernatants of spleen cells cultured in the presence of OVA for 4 days and the levels of total and OVA-specific IgG1, IgG2a and/or IgE in sera from these mice were determined by ELISA. Results: Administration of cimetidine to OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice promoted Th2 cytokine secretion by OVA-stimulated spleen cells in vitro and increased serum levels of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a.

All of these patients had received antibiotics to prevent postoperative infection. Since 2005 we adopted a protocol of targeted probiotic therapy prophylaxis.Eighteen patients received probiotic therapy, while twelve did not. One infant among those eighteen patients and eight patients among those twelve developed CMPI, a significantly lower rate for the group with probiotic therapy than that without it (p < 0.001). Patients with positive cultures for gram positive and gram negative organisms increased in number before and after surgery but then decreased after probiotics treatment. Poor weight gain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and rise in C reactive protein (CRP) levels were observed in all of those nine CMPI patients. Specific IgE antibodies were elevated in four of the nine subjects, and total IgE levels were elevated in seven of them. All CMPI patients had increased level of CRP without proven infections.CMPI was induced in newborns after surgery on their small intestines and antibiotics treatment with presentation of symptoms that mimic postoperative infection. Development of CMPI in this population possibly involves disruption of intestinal flora. Administration of probiotics can reduce the incidence of CMPI after small intestine surgery. The elevated CRP level may be useful in the diagnosis of CMPI.",

To date, there have been no published studies on the influence of underweight on asthma control.The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of underweight, as defined by the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity (JASSO), on asthma control in Japanese asthmatic patients. Using data from questionnaire surveys administered by the Niigata Asthma Treatment Study Group, we compared asthma control, as measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT), between a normal weight group (18.5kg/m2 =< BMI < 25kg/m2) and an underweight group (BMI < 18.5kg/m2).Of the asthmatic patients who completed the 2008 and 2010 surveys, 1464 and 1260 cases were classified as being in the normal weight group, and 174 and 155 cases were classified as being in the underweight group. The ACT score (median, [interquartile range]) in the underweight group in 2008 (22, [19-24]) and 2010 (23, [19-25]) was significantly lower than that in the normal group in 2008 (23, [20-25]) and in 2010 (24, [21-25]).This study is the first, large-scale investigation of the influence of underweight on asthma control, and we have confirmed an adverse influence in a clinical setting. A potential mechanism for this interaction was unknown. Further investigation will be required.",

We tested various chemicals in the environment and found that xylene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene induced the production of TSLP in vivo. These findings prompted us to search for additional chemicals that induce TSLP production. In this study, we examined whether fatty acids could induce the production of TSLP in vivo and exacerbate allergic inflammation. Various fatty acids and related compounds were painted on the ear lobes of mice and the amount of TSLP in the homogenate of ear lobe tissue was determined. The effects of nonanoic acid on allergic inflammation were also examined. Octanoic acid, nonanoic acid, and decanoic acid markedly induced TSLP production, while a medium-chain aldehyde and alcohol showed only weak activity. Nonanoic acid induced the production of TSLP with a maximum at 24 h. TSLP production was even observed in nonanoic acid-treated C3H/HeJ mice that lacked functional toll-like receptor 4. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist β-naphthoflavone did not induce TSLP production. Nonanoic acid promoted sensitization to ovalbumin, resulting in an enhancement in the cutaneous anaphylactic response. In addition, painting of nonanoic acid after the sensitization augmented picryl chloride-induced thickening of the ear, which was reversed in TSLP receptor-deficient mice. Nonanoic acid and certain fatty acids induced TSLP production, resulting in the exacerbation of allergic inflammation. We propose that TSLP-inducing chemical compounds such as nonanoic acid be recognized as chemical allergo-accelerators.",

The moderate/severe AR patients showed significantly higher nasal NO in the IT area (104.4 vs. 66.2ppb) and lower MM/IT ratios than those in the mild AR patients. The analysis of nasal brushing cells revealed significantly higher eosinophil cationic protein and nitrotyrosine levels in the AR groups.Nasal NO assessment in the IT area directly reflects persistent eosinophilic inflammation and may be a valid marker to estimate the severity of AR.",

We sought to characterize S. aureus alpha-toxin-induced cellular responses in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Dispersed nasal polyp cells and uncinate tissue cells were prepared from patients with CRS with and without nasal polyps, respectively. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of alpha-toxin or staphylococcal enterotoxin B and then the levels of IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-10 in the cell supernatants were determined. The pathophysiological significance of alpha-toxin-induced cytokine production was also determined including radiological severity of rhinosinusitis, tissue and blood eosinophilia, serum total IgE level, and 1-s forced expiratory volume_forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1_FVC). Nasal polyp cells produced substantial amounts of IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-10 in response to alpha-toxin. Cytokine production was higher in nasal polyp cells than in uncinate tissue cells. The potency of alpha-toxin in stimulating IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10 production was comparable to that of enterotoxin. Alpha-toxininduced IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-10 production significantly and negatively correlated with the degree of eosinophil infiltration into nasal polyps. Conversely, alpha-toxin-induced IFN-γ and IL-10 production significantly and positively correlated with FEV1/FVC. IL-10 production was significantly lower in asthmatic patients compared to non-asthmatics S. aureus-derived alpha-toxin can provoke cellular responses in nasal polyps. These responses, especially failure to synthesize IL-10, may play a role in the pathophysiology of CRSwNP.",

However, it is unknown whether ICS dose reduction in adult asthmatics is compatible with maintaining asthma control. Moreover, there are no predictors of efficacy in maintaining asthma control upon ICS reduction. We recruited 90 adult patients with moderate or severe asthma but no clinical symptoms of asthma for at least 6 months. All patients reduced their ICS doses by half but continued taking other asthma-related medications. As a primary outcome, we measured asthma exacerbations during the 12 months following ICS reduction. We also further monitored patients from the above study who had maintained total asthma control for 12 months after ICS reduction and who had continued on their reduced doses of ICS or had further reduced, or stopped, their ICS. Forty of ninety patients (44.4%) experienced exacerbations after ICS reduction (time to first exacerbation: 6.4 ± 3.6 months). Multivariate logistic regression modeling revealed a rank order of predictors of success in ICS reduction while retaining asthma control: acetylcholine (ACh) PC20 (p < 0.01); length of time with no clinical symptoms before ICS reduction (p < 0.01); FeNO (p = 0.028); and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1; % predicted) (p = 0.03). Finally thirty-nine of 50 patients maintained total asthma control for at least 2 years after the initial ICS reduction. In asthma patients with normalized AChPC20 of 20 mg/mL or 10 mg/mL and no clinical symptoms for at least 12 or 24 months it may be possible to successfully reduce ICS without increasing exacerbations for long time.",

However, protease production by eosinophils is not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the production of eosinophil-specific proteases/proteinases by transcriptome analysis.Human eosinophils and other cells were purified from peripheral blood by density gradient sedimentation and negative/positive selections using immunomagnetic beads. Protease/proteinase expression in eosinophils and release into the supernatant were evaluated by microarray analysis, qPCR, ELISA, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining before and after stimulation with eosinophil-activating cytokines and secretagogues. mRNAs for extracellular matrix proteins in human normal fibroblasts were measured by qPCR after exposure to recombinant protease serine 33 (PRSS33) protein (rPRSS33), created with a baculovirus system.Human eosinophils expressed relatively high levels of mRNA for metalloproteinase 25 (MMP25), a disintegrin and metalloprotease 8 (ADAM8), ADAM10, ADAM19 and PRSS33. Expression of PRSS33 was the highest and eosinophil-specific. PRSS33 mRNA expression was not affected by eosinophil-activating cytokines. Immunofluorescence staining showed that PRSS33 was co-localized with an eosinophil granule protein. PRSS33 was not detected in the culture supernatant of eosinophils even after stimulation with secretagogues, but its cell surface expression was increased. rPRSS33 stimulation of human fibroblasts increased expression of collagen and fibronectin mRNAs, at least in part via protease-activated receptor-2 activation.Activated eosinophils may induce fibroblast extracellular matrix protein synthesis via cell surface expression of PRSS33, which would at least partly explain eosinophils' role(s) in airway remodeling.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported the results of lung sound analysis in patients with bronchial asthma and demonstrated that the exhalation-to-inhalation sound pressure ratio in the low frequency range between 100 and 200 Hz (E/I LF) was correlated with the presence of airway inflammation and airway obstruction. We classified asthma patients by airway inflammation phenotype using the induced sputum eosinophil and neutrophil ratio and determined whether this phenotype could be predicted using E/I LF and fractional exhaled nitric oxide values.Steroid-naive bronchial asthma patients were classified into four phenotypes, including \"Low inflammation\" (35 patients), \"Eosinophilic type\" (58 patients), \"Neutrophilic type\" (15 patients), and \"Mixed type\" (15 patients) based on the results of induced sputum examinations. The E/I LF data and FeNO levels were then evaluated for the four phenotype groups; the prediction powers of these two indices were then analyzed for each phenotype.The median E/I LF value was highest in the \"Mixed type\" and lowest in the \"Low inflammation\" group. FeNO differentiated between the \"Low inflammation\" and \"Eosinophilic type\" groups, \"Low inflammation\" and \"Neutrophilic type\" groups, and \"Neutrophilic type\" and \"Mixed type\" (p < 0.0001, p = 0.007, and p = 0.04, respectively). E/I LF differentiated between the \"Low inflammation\" and \"Eosinophilic type\" groups (p = 0.006). E/I LF could distinguish the \"Mixed type\" group from the \"Low inflammation\" and \"Eosinophilic type\" groups (p = 0.002).A combination of the E/I LF value and FeNO may be useful for the classification of the airway inflammation phenotype in patients with bronchial asthma.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the histamine H1 and H4 receptors mRNA (H1R and H4R, respectively) expression on the ocular surface of patients with chronic forms of allergic conjunctival diseases to determine whether they can serve as biomarkers for allergic inflammation in the conjunctiva.We examined 19 patients with vernal or atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC/VKC group) and 15 healthy volunteers (control group). The AKC/VKC group was divided into active and stable stage subgroups. Specimens were obtained from the upper tarsal conjunctiva of each participant using a modified impression cytology method. H1R, H4R, and eotaxin-1, -2, and -3 mRNA (eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, eotaxin-3, respectively) expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis for eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil major basic protein (MBP), eotaxin-2, and histamine H4 receptor (H4R) were performed using conjunctival smears.The number of H4R-positive patients was higher in the active than the stable stage subgroup and control group, whereas no difference was observed for H1R. H1R levels were higher in the active than in the stable stage subgroup, while those of H4R were higher in the active stage subgroup than in the control group. H1R and H4R levels were correlated with eotaxin-2 level. In immunohistochemical analysis, H4R revealed their expression on eosinophils in conjunctival smears of patients with AKC/VKC.H4R is useful as biomarkers of allergic inflammation on ocular surfaces. Most notably, H4R expressed on eosinophils is useful as a biomarker of eosinophilic inflammation of the ocular surface.",

It is used for treating allergic rhinitis in more than 80 countries. This study investigated its efficacy and safety in Japanese patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study conducted at 4 medical institutions in Japan (JapicCTI-152785). Adolescent and adult SAR outpatients aged 12–64 years entered a 1-week placebo run-in period. After eligibility was confirmed, patients orally received placebo, rupatadine 10 mg, or 20 mg once daily for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline to second week of treatment in total 4 nasal symptom score (T4NSS). Nine hundred patients were randomly assigned to placebo, rupatadine 10 mg, or rupatadine 20 mg (302, 298, and 300 patients, respectively). The least squares mean difference in the primary endpoint between rupatadine and placebo was −1.085 for 10 mg, and −1.415 for 20 mg (analysis of covariance, both P < 0.001). The rates of adverse events were 6.6%, 14.1%, and 15.0% for placebo, rupatadine 10 mg, and rupatadine 20 mg, respectively. Somnolence was most frequently reported: 7.0% for rupatadine 10 mg and 7.3% for rupatadine 20 mg. No serious adverse drug reactions were observed, and no adverse events resulted in premature discontinuation. Rupatadine 10 and 20 mg were significantly superior to placebo in improving nasal and ocular symptoms of SAR, and were well tolerated.",

Primary predictor of interest was urban/rural setting, with race/ethnicity and age also evaluated. Associations between ED visit rates and urban/rural setting were evaluated by multivariable hierarchical negative binomial regression with state and year fixed effects.ED visit rates (per 100,000) for food-induced anaphylaxis were 12.31 and 4.60 in urban and rural settings, respectively. Rates were highest among Blacks (15.26) younger urban children (17.29) and older rural children (6.99). Compared to rural, urban children had significantly higher anaphalaxis ED visit rates (IRR 2.77).Food-induced anaphylaxis ED visit rates were highest among younger urban children and Black children, with a notable contrast in age distribution between urban and rural rates. Higher urban rates may be attributed to Hygiene Hypothesis, though racial, economic and emergency care access disparities may also influence these outcomes.",

However, there have been no reports on the component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) of hazelnut allergy using an oral food challenge (OFC) for diagnosis in Asia. We hypothesized that CRD would improve the accuracy of diagnosing hazelnut allergies in Japanese children. We recruited 91 subjects (median age: 7.3 years) who were sensitized to hazelnuts and had performed a hazelnut OFC at the National Hospital Organization Sagamihara National Hospital between 2006 and 2017. All subjects were classified as allergic or asymptomatic to 3 g of hazelnuts. The sIgE levels (hazelnut/Cor a 1/Cor a 8/Cor a 9/Cor a 14/alder pollen) were measured using ImmunoCAP. We aimed to determine the predictive factors of hazelnut allergy. Nine subjects (10%) were allergic to ≤3 g of hazelnuts. Levels of sIgE for Cor a 9 in hazelnut-allergic subjects were significantly higher than those in asymptomatic subjects (4.47 vs. 0.76 kUA/L, p = 0.039). Levels of sIgE to alder pollen and Cor a 1 in hazelnut-allergic subjects were significantly lower than those in asymptomatic subjects (<0.10 vs 13.0 kUA/L, p = 0.004; <0.10 vs 5.03 kUA/L, p = 0.025). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for hazelnut/alder/Cor a 1/Cor a 9 was 0.55/0.78/0.72/0.71, respectively, with p = 0.651/0.006/0.029/0.040, respectively. The findings of a high sIgE level for Cor a 9 and a low sIgE level for Cor a 1 can improve the diagnostic accuracy to better identify Japanese children sensitized to hazelnuts.",

This study aimed to determine the clinical effects of outpatient sub- mucosal IT surgery (OSITS) on patients with severe AR. Between January 2008 and August 2012, 95 patients with severe AR who underwent OSITS at the Department of Otolaryngology, Hyogo College of Medicine, were retrospectively analyzed. There were 53 men and 42 women. Their mean age was 27 years (11–75 years). OSITS was bilaterally performed using a bipolar radiofrequency electrocautery under local anesthesia. Symptoms, QOL, and physical findings were evaluated using scores from both pre- and postoperative periods (average: 12.4 months), according to Practical Guideline for the Management of AR in Japan 2009. In perennial AR, all mean scores of nasal symptoms, QOL, and physical findings significantly improved after OSITS (p < 0.05, n = 83). Nasal obstruction, sleep problems, and IT congestion were the most strongly affected. Eye symptoms were not influenced by OSITS. OSITS also showed significant effects on nasal obstruction and IT congestion in seasonal AR (p < 0.05, n = 12), but not sneezing, nasal discharge, and QOL. In terms of the efficacy, OSITS was beneficial in 90% of perennial AR cases and 75% of seasonal AR cases. Epistaxis (1%), vestibulitis (1%), and IT atrophy (4%) were observed after OSITS. These data indicate that OSITS using radiofrequency electrocautery could be a beneficial therapeutic option in patients with severe AR.",

Those who disclosed hypersensitivity reactions due to Hymenoptera stings in this initial survey were called again and given another questionnaire. Those who were suspected of experiencing hypersensitivity reactions to Hymenoptera stings were invited for a clinical investigation with in vivo and in vitro diagnostic tests.According to the first questionnaire, a total of 1171 (9.9%; 95% CI: 9.38-10.47%) were suspected of having a hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera stings. 51.75% (n: 606) answered the second questionnaire and 21% (n: 128) of these were still suspected of having a hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera stings (1.1%; 95% CI: 0.9-1.29%). The confirmed prevalence of hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera stings according to skin tests and in vitro sIgE levels was 0.2% (95% CI: 0.14-0.30%). Nearly all of the participants with systemic reactions were admitted to the emergency department, although only one tenth of them received adrenaline in the emergency room. 2.3% carried an adrenaline injector, whereas none of the patients received venom immunotherapy.The prevalence of Hymenoptera sting reactions in our geographical region is comparable with other European studies. There is a need to increase the awareness of adrenaline in the emergency management of insect sting anaphylaxis and venom immunotherapy in the prophylaxis.",

A multicenter, open-label, single-arm study on 12-week ICS (budesonide Turbuhaler®) monotherapy was undertaken in subjects aged 5–15 years with bronchial asthma not treated with ICS during the previous 3 months. At 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after start of ICS administration, Japanese Pediatric Asthma Control Program (JPAC) scores, and CTS scores were summated and lung function measured. At weeks 0 and 12, questionnaires on caregiver anxiety were also assessed. Seventy-five patients were enrolled, and 69 assessed. Ninety percent of subjects had been treated with asthma controller medication except ICS before study enrollment. JPAC score and CTS score were improved significantly at weeks 4, 8, and 12 (p < 0.001). With regard to CTS, more than half of caregivers showed a perfect score at weeks 8 and 12. There was a significant correlation between JPAC score and CTS score. Lung function and caregiver anxiety were also improved, and good compliance with treatment was observed during the intervention. If treating ICS-untreated school-aged asthmatic children with uncontrolled symptoms, ICS monotherapy can improve CTS along with improving asthma control.",

We investigated whether SHS or overweight/obesity were also associated with allergic or non-allergic rhinitis. Cross-sectional data were obtained during the second SAPALDIA Study. Interviewer administered questionnaires were completed by 8047 participants from 8 communities in Switzerland. Blood was collected from 5841 participants and tested for allergen specific IgE. Allergic rhinitis was defined as nasal symptoms with detectable IgE. Data were analysed by multinomial logistic regression with four outcome categories defined according to the presence or absence of rhinitis and/or atopy. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis was 885 (15.2%) and non-allergic rhinitis 323 (5.5%). The risk of allergic rhinitis was increased in subjects with physician diagnosed asthma (Relative Risk Ratio 6.81; 95%CI 5.39, 8.6), maternal atopy (1.56; 1.27, 1.92) and paternal atopy (1.41; 1.11, 1.79). Older subjects were at lower risk (0.96; 0.95,0.97 per year), as were those raised on a farm (0.64; 0.49,0.84), with older siblings (0.92; 0.86,0.97 per sib) or from rural areas. The risk of non-allergic rhinitis was also increased in subjects with physician diagnosed asthma (4.02; 2.86, 5.67), reduced in males (0.59; 0.46, 0.77), but not associated with upbringing on a farm or older siblings. There were no significant associations of SHS or overweight/obesity with either form of rhinitis. Allergic and non-allergic rhinitis have different risk factors apart from asthma.

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental factors are proposed to be involved in cedar pollen allergy sensitization and onset. The impact of these factors will provide key information for the prevention of cedar pollen sensitization and allergy onset, which we investigated in this cross-sectional study. Subjects were 382 young adult volunteers who completed a self-administered questionnaire on self-reported subjective symptoms of pollinosis, physician-diagnosed pollinosis, and background factors. We also measured their serum IgE antibody titers specific for cedar, cypress, and mites. Factors associated with subjective symptoms, physician diagnosis, and the three specific antigens were determined using both univariate and multivariate analyses. Sensitization to cedar, cypress, and mites, defined as specific IgE levels of class 1 or above, was found in 78.8%, 64.4%, and 56.0% of subjects, respectively. The prevalence of cedar pollinosis was 41.2% based on subjective symptoms and 22.2% based on physician diagnosis. Factors associated with increased cedar pollen sensitization were mite sensitization, comorbid allergic rhinitis, and family history of cedar pollinosis. Risk-reducing factors for cedar pollen sensitization were keeping a cat, number of common colds, and hours of sleep. Risk-increasing factors for both subjective pollinosis symptoms and physician-diagnosed pollinosis were comorbid allergic rhinitis and family history of cedar pollinosis. Sensitization to cedar pollen in this population was extremely high. Both common and distinct factors were associated with sensitization to pollen and with the development of pollinosis. The distinct factors were associated with sensitization to cedar and cypress antigens.",

    "abstract": "To diagnose and treat respiratory allergic diseases, it is important to identify the specific allergens involved. Many differences exist between common inhalant allergens depending on the residential environment and demographic factors. This study aimed to compare common inhalant allergens between Koreans and non-Koreans according to their residential region, age, and sex. This study evaluated 15,334 individuals who underwent serum tests for multiple allergen-specific immunoglobulin E at a tertiary academic medical center between January 2010 and December 2016. The individuals included 14,786 Koreans and 548 non-Koreans. The AdvanSure™ Allostation assay (LG Life Science, Korea) was used to test for 33 inhalant allergens. The house dust mite (HDM) was the most common allergen in both Koreans and non-Koreans, although the proportion of individuals with HDM sensitization was greater among Koreans. High sensitization rates for various pollen types were detected among Koreans in Gangwon region, whereas Japanese cedar pollen was unique among Koreans in Jeju region. Grass pollen and animal dander were relatively common among individuals from the Americas, whereas weed and grass pollen accounted for the 10 most common allergens for individuals from Central Asia. The total sensitization rate, sensitization to HDM, and sensitization to animal dander peaked among adolescents and young adults, then subsequently decreased with age. This large-scale study demonstrates that various regional and age-related differences exist in the allergen sensitization rates of Koreans and non-Koreans. These data could be useful for development of avoidance measures, immunotherapy for causative allergens, and policymaking regarding allergic diseases.",

This case-crossover study aimed to examine the association between the chemical components of PM2.5 and night-time primary care visits (PCVs) due to asthma attacks. The subjects were 1251 children aged 0–14 years who received medical care for asthma at a municipal emergency clinic. We measured daily average concentrations of hydrogen ion, sulfate ion, nitrate ion and water-soluble organic compounds (WSOCs), which are components of PM2.5. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of PCVs per unit increment (inter quartile ranges) in each chemical component of PM2.5 for the subgroups of warmer months and colder months separately. No association was seen between PCVs and PM2.5 mass concentrations the day before the PCVs in either warmer or colder months. In the warmer months, an association was seen with the concentrations of WSOCs and hydrogen ion the day before the PCVs (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.00–1.76, OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02–1.36, respectively). Furthermore, a negative association was seen between sulfate ion and PCVs (OR = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.74–0.98). No associations were observed in the colder months. We observed a positive association between PCVs and certain concentrations of WSOCs and hydrogen ions in warmer months. In contrast, sulfate ion showed a negative association.",

    "abstract": "The deterioration of pulmonary function, such as FEV1-decline, is strongly associated with poor prognosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, few investigations shed light on useful biomarkers for predicting the decline of pulmonary function. We evaluated whether thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), a Th2 inflammation marker, could predict rapid FEV1-decline in COPD patients. We recruited 161 patients with stable COPD and performed pulmonary function test once every six months. At the time of registration, blood tests, including serum levels of TARC were performed. We assessed the correlation between changes in parameters of pulmonary function tests and serum levels of TARC. The rapid-decline in pulmonary function was determined using 25th percentile of change in FEV1 or FEV1 percent predicted (%FEV1) per year. In the FEV1-rapid-decline group, the frequency of exacerbations, the degree of emphysema, and serum levels of TARC was higher than in the non-rapid-decline group. When using %FEV1 as a classifier instead of FEV1, age, the frequency of exacerbations, the degree of emphysema and serum levels of TARC in the rapid-decline group was significantly greater than those in the non-rapid-decline group. In univariate logistic regression analysis, TARC was the significant predictive factor for rapid-decline group. In multivariate analysis adjusted for emphysema, serum levels of TARC are independently significant predicting factors for the rapid-decline group. TARC is an independent predictive biomarker for the rapid-decline in FEV1. Measuring serum TARC levels may help the management of COPD patients by predicting the risk of FEV1 decline.",

The retrospective study had been conducted for 236 egg allergic children (51.3 months in mean), 127 milk allergic children (53.4 months), and 96 wheat allergic children (42.6 months). The retrospective analysis of serum nonspecific and antigen-specific IgE levels, SPT, and OFC had been conducted for each allergic patient.

Results: The OFC was positive in 61 (25.8%) hen's egg allergies, 34 (26.8%) milk allergies and 33 (34.4%) wheat allergies. The greatest AUC for each allergen is as following; hen's egg for egg white specific IgE at 0.745, milk/histamine (wheal) index at 0.718, and wheat for wheal size at 0.597. For the predictive decision points, the highest accuracy rate was at 25.8% for an egg white wheal of 9.5 mm, at 26.8% for a milk wheal of 9.5 mm, and at 34.4% for a wheal of 6.5 mm. As a result of this analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of SPT had not been satisfactory to judge the acquisition of tolerance in allergic children for eggs, milk and wheat. Therefore, this is not a strong evidence to testify the tolerance of the immediate type food allergy.",

Although a large number of autoAbs have been discovered to date, there is a limited number of autoAbs whose pathogenic roles have been clearly determined. However, intriguing evidence has recently been provided of possible pathogenic roles for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic Abs (ANCAs) against myeloperoxidase (MPO) in ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) and for anti-citrullinated protein Abs (ACPAs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Of note, these autoAbs are thought to display both direct and indirect effects on organ failure. Additionally, some autoAbs have been reported to play pathogenic roles in brain damage in patients with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE), which is one of the most refractory autoimmune disorders. Thus the binding of autoAbs to a certain sequence of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit NR2 (anti-NR2 Abs) may directly induce hippocampal neuronal injury. On the other hand, anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) Abs might be pathogenic by inducing neurotoxic inflammatory mediators intrathecally. Such autoAb measurements are also clinically meaningful for treatment selection.",

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be associated with the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). VEGF is produced by a variety of cells including fibroblasts. It was recently reported that prostaglandin (PG) E2 induces VEGF release by nasal polyp fibroblasts. However, little is known regarding possible regulation of VEGF by other PGs. We have reported that molecules that regulate PGD2 metabolism play roles in the pathogenesis of CRS including in local eosinophilia and type 2 cytokine production. In the present study, we sought to determine whether PGD2 regulates VEGF release by nasal polyp fibroblasts. Nasal polyp fibroblasts were established from nasal polyps. These fibroblasts were stimulated with serial dilutions of PGD2 or PGD2 receptor (DP/CRTH2)-selective agonists in the presence or absence of receptor-selective antagonists. The concentration of VEGF in the culture supernatants was determined using ELISA. 5 μM of PGD2 significantly induced VEGF release by nasal polyp fibroblasts. VEGF release was also obtained by stimulation with a DP receptor-selective, but not with a CRTH2 receptor-selective agonist. In addition, PGD2-induced VEGF release was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment with DP receptor-selective antagonists. In contrast, pre-treatment with a CRTH2 receptor-selective antagonist significantly enhanced PGD2-induced VEGF release. PGD2 stimulates VEGF production via DP but not CRTH2 receptors in nasal polyp fibroblasts.",

It has been reported that IL-21 expression is upregulated in acute skin lesions in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients; however, little is known about the serum IL-21 levels of AD patients. The aim of this study was to quantify the serum IL-21 levels of AD patients and to evaluate the relationships between the serum IL-21 level and disease severity, laboratory markers, and eruption type in AD patients.We measured the serum IL-21 levels of adult AD patients and healthy control subjects using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The adult AD patients exhibited significantly higher serum IL-21 levels than the healthy control subjects. A comparison of the patients' serum IL-21 levels based on the clinical severity of their AD revealed that the patients with severe AD demonstrated significantly higher serum IL-21 levels than those with mild AD and the healthy control subjects. The serum IL-21 levels were significantly correlated with the skin severity score, and especially with the degree of acute lesions such as erythema and edema/papules. The serum IL-21 level was not associated with laboratory markers, such as the serum IgE level, the serum thymus and activation-related chemokine level, blood eosinophilia, and the serum lactate dehydrogenase level.These results suggest that IL-21 might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, especially the development of acute skin lesions.",

This strategy was established by a multi-disciplinary committee consisting of administrators of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, young and senior experts from various research societies and associations, and representatives of patient and public groups. Whereas the issues of transition, integration, and international collaboration have yet to be solved in this research realm in Japan, identification of unmet needs, digitization of information and transparent procedures, and strategic planning for complex problems (a process dubbed MIERUKA by the Toyota Way) are crucial to share and tackle the same vision and goals. The committee developed three specific actions focusing on preemptive treatment, interdisciplinarity and internationality, and life stage. The real success of Strategy 2030 is made by the spontaneous contributions of doctors, dentists, veterinarians, and other medical professionals; basic and clinical research scientists, research supporters, and pharmaceutical/medical device companies; manufacturers of food, healthcare, and home appliances; and patients, their families, and the public. The hope is to establish a stable society in which people can live long, healthy lives, as free as possible from allergic and immunological diseases, at each individual life stage.

Although such distinct characteristics of IgE among Ig classes are well-known, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been understood until recently. Somatic or genetic defects of such mechanisms can lead to pathogenesis of allergic diseases. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that control the production of IgE and formation of IgE-type humoral memory, focusing on the B cell immune responses.",

    "abstract": "The effects of bronchial thermoplasty (BT) on smooth muscle (SM) and nerves in small airways are unclear.We recruited 15 patients with severe refractory asthma, who received BT treatment. Endobronchial optical-coherence tomography (EB-OCT) was performed at baseline, 3 weeks' follow-up and 2 years' follow-up to evaluate the effect of BT on airway structure. In addition, we divided 12 healthy beagles into a sham group and a BT group, the latter receiving BT on large airways (inner diameter >3 mm) of the lower lobe. The dogs' lung lobes were resected to evaluate histological and neuronal changes of the treated large airways and untreated small airways 12 weeks after BT.Patients receiving BT treatment had significant improvement in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores and significant reduction in asthma exacerbations. EB-OCT results demonstrated a notable increase in inner-airway area (Ai) and decrease in airway wall area percentage (Aw%) in both large (3rd-to 6th-generation) and small (7th-to 9th-generation) airways. Furthermore, the animal study showed a significant reduction in the amount of SM in BT-treated large airways but not in untreated small airways. Protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5)-positive nerves and muscarinic receptor 3 (M3 receptor) expression in large and small airways were both markedly decreased throughout the airway wall 12 weeks after BT treatment.BT significantly reduced nerves, but not SM, in small airways, which might shed light on the mechanism of lung denervation by BT.",

    "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux may be associated with the worsening of asthma by increasing cough reflex sensitivity. Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire (HARQ) consists of 14 prevalent reflux-related symptoms. It may be useful in predicting the presence of cough reflex hypersensitivity in asthma.From August 2018 to July 2020, 266 asthmatic patients completed the HARQ. They underwent blood analysis, spirometry, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement, and the capsaicin cough challenge test. Patients were considered to have reflux-related symptoms if their HARQ scores were 13 points or higher. We evaluated the association between reflux-related symptoms and clinical asthma outcomes. Finally, we performed a multivariate analysis to determine the clinical significance of the HARQ for asthma. This study was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000040732).The mean HARQ scores were 13.1 (standard deviation 12.0). Patients in the high HARQ scores group (HARQ ≥13, n = 105) showed a lower prevalence of atopic predisposition, lower levels of FeNO, heightened capsaicin cough reflex sensitivity, poorer asthma control, and more frequent admissions due to asthma than those in the low HARQ groups (all p values < 0.05). The HARQ was useful in selecting patients with poor controlled asthma and those with severe cough when the cut-off value was set at 13. Multivariate analysis revealed that heightened capsaicin cough reflex sensitivity affected reflux-related symptoms, as well as lower levels of FeNO and younger age.Higher HARQ scores (≥13) may be useful in predicting not only poor asthma condition but also the presence of airway neuronal dysfunction in patients with asthma to some extent.",

The primary objective of this phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was to assess the safety and tolerability of gefapixant in Japanese participants with RCC or UCC (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03696108; JAPIC-CTI, 184154).Participants aged ≥20 years with chronic cough lasting ≥4 months and a diagnosis of RCC or UCC despite treatment in accordance with Japanese Respiratory Society guidelines were randomized 1:1 to receive gefapixant 15 or 45 mg BID for 52 weeks. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of gefapixant, including adverse events (AEs) and discontinuations due to AEs. Cough-specific quality of life was assessed using the Leicester Cough Questionnaire as a secondary objective.Of 169 randomized and treated participants, 63% were female and mean age was 58 years. Adverse events were reported by 79 (94%) and 82 (96%) participants in the 15- and 45-mg BID groups, respectively. Most treatment-related AEs were taste related. Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 6 (7%) and 17 (20%) participants receiving gefapixant 15 or 45 mg BID, respectively. There were no serious treatment-related AEs or deaths. Leicester Cough Questionnaire total scores improved from baseline through Week 52.Gefapixant had an acceptable safety profile, with no serious treatment-related AEs in Japanese participants.",

We compared the relationships between peripheral blood eosinophil level, serum periostin level, histopathological findings, clinical and laboratory findings, nose findings, diagnostic score of the Japanese Epidemiological Survey of Refractory Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis Study, and postoperative recurrence of nasal polyps in each group.In the ECRS group, a positive correlation was found between peripheral blood eosinophil level and serum periostin level (rs = 0.49, P < 0.01: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate the serum periostin level that could predict postoperative recurrence of nasal polyps in the ECRS group: the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.95, sensitivity was 92%, and specificity was 100%; the serum periostin cutoff value for postoperative recurrence of nasal polyps was 130 ng/ml. In ROC curve analysis to evaluate peripheral blood eosinophil level, the AUC was 0.73, sensitivity was 69.2%, and specificity was 85.0%; the cutoff value was 8.8%.periostin was implicated in the pathophysiology of ECRS.

However, existing classification criteria are all designed to classify EGPA among vasculitis and there is no established method distinguishing EGPA from other eosinophilic disorders. The aim of the present study was to propose a scoring system to differentiate EGPA among eosinophilic disorders.Non-supervised hierarchical clustering using Ward's method and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed for 19 clinical parameters of 58 patients with eosinophilia-related diseases at a tertiary university hospital. The newly proposed scoring system was externally validated in 40 patients at another tertiary institution.Two distinct clusters were identified, and clinical features including peripheral neuropathy, asthma, skin involvement, lung involvement, rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, myeloperoxidase (MPO)-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positivity, IgE elevation, C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation, and vasculitis pathological findings were predominantly observed in one of these clusters (p < 0.05). Ten features defining the cluster with a high rate of vasculitis were weighted by PCA to create the E-CASE (EGPA classification among systemic eosinophilia) scoring system, on a 16-point scale. Based on the distribution of scores in the primary cohort, we defined an E-CASE score ≥12 as positive, ≤ 8 as negative, and 9-11 as undeterminable. The sensitivity and specificity of the E-CASE score in the validation cohort were 93.3% and 100%, respectively.We developed and verified a novel scoring system for differentiating EGPA from other types of eosinophilic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP has attracted more attention in recent years, due to its association with more severe disease and reduced steroid responsiveness. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) has been found to modulate neutrophils infiltration in other neutrophilic inflammation including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. The aim was to evaluate the expression and regulator role of LCN2 in neutrophilic inflammation in CRSwNP, and its role as a potential biomarker predicting non-eosinophilic CRSwNP (neCRSwNP). Bioinformatic analysis, immunostainings, real-time PCR and ELISA were used to analyze the expression and location of LCN2 in nasal tissues. The expression of proinflammatory mediators were assessed in nasal tissues and secretions. LCN2 production in human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) and neutrophils, as well as its role in neutrophilic inflammation was evaluated by in vitro experiments. LCN2 was mainly located in neutrophils and HNECs of nasal polyps. LCN2 expression was also significantly higher in the polyp tissue and nasal secretions from patients with neCRSwNP. The LCN2 levels were positively correlated with type 3 inflammation markers, including G-CSF, IL-8, and IL-17. LCN2 expression could be upregulated by IL-17 A and TNF-α in HNECs, and LCN2 could also promote the expression of IL-8 in dispersed polyp cells and HNECs. LCN2 could serve as a novel biomarker predicting patients with neCRSwNP, and the increased expression of LCN2 may participate in the pathogenesis of neCRSwNP.",

NOVELTY is a global prospective observational study of patients with asthma and/or COPD from real-world practice. In this subanalysis, we compared patient characteristics of obstructive pulmonary diseases between the Japanese population (n = 820) and the overall population excluding Japanese patients (n = 10,406). The Japanese population had fewer exacerbations than the overall population across most of the physician-assessed disease severities and all diagnoses. The difference in exacerbation frequencies was more prominent in patients with COPD and asthma + COPD. The Japanese population was older, had higher former smoking rates, lower BMI, fewer respiratory symptoms, and better health-related quality of life compared with the overall population across all diagnoses. We clarified differences in patient characteristics among patients with asthma and/or COPD in Japan compared with non-Japanese patients. Importantly, we found that Japanese patients with asthma and/or COPD had significantly fewer exacerbations compared with patients overall. The results from our study may contribute to the development of precision medicine and guidelines specific to Japan.",

Generalized estimating equations and generalized linear modeling were used to evaluate the association. Data from 1448 participants were used for analyses. Household dog ownership during gestation, early infancy, and 18 months of age significantly reduced the risk of current eczema. Household cat ownership also reduced the risk of current eczema, albeit without statistical significance. The combined evaluation of children from households with pets, be it cats, dogs or both, the risk of current eczema at 1–5 years of age was lower in those with household pet exposure ownership during gestation (RR = 0.59, 95 % CI 0.45–0.77) and at 6 months (RR = 0.49, 95 % CI 0.36–0.68). , Reduced risks of eczema were also observed at 2–5 (RR = 0.52, 95 % CI 0.37–0.73) and 3–5 years of age (RR = 0.50 95 % CI 0.35–0.74) when the respective household pet ownership were evaluated at 18 months and 3 years of age. These protective associations of reduced risk of eczema were only observed in children without FLG mutations. Household dog and pet (dog, cat, or both) ownership was protective against early childhood eczema in a birth cohort dataset. This protective association was observed only in children without FLG mutations, which should be confirmed in studies with larger cohorts.",

It is essential to survey the pollen and mold around the patient's environment for the diagnosis and treatment of airborne allergy. Rotorod samplers were installed at well-ventilated places in seven collecting stations in Seoul, the capital of Korea, which has a population of 12 million. Airborne particles carrying allergens were collected daily from each station for 2 years (1 October 1995 to 30 September 1997). After being stained with Calberla's fuchsin, they were identified, counted and recorded. The weather in Seoul was also recorded. Pollen was found from the middle of February through to the end of December. The peak date for pollen was 12 May (peak mean daily count: 701 grains/m3/day) and for mold it was 23 June (peak mean daily count: 936 spores/m3/day). Alder, birch, pine, oak, maple, elm, juniper, willow, and gingko trees were prevalent during the tree season, lasting from the middle of February to late July. Then sagebrush, ragweed, Japanese hop, and pigweed followed during the weed season, which lasts from the middle of July to the end of December. In skin prick test results, house dust mite was the most common positive allergen in Seoul, followed by cockroach. Among the pollens, mugwort was the most common positive, followed by ragweed mix, alder, birch, and grasses mix. Among the molds, there were high counts of Cladosporium and Alternaria during the year, excluding January. Ascospore of Leptospheria was highest during the monsoon season.",

Some BP-allergic patients complain ‘I can’t tolerate any fruit’. The main aim of the present study was to answer the question, ‘can BP-allergic patients tolerate some of the exotic fruit, not at present common in Sweden?’ Consecutive patients (n = 397) visiting the participating Allergy Clinics, who had a BP allergy and reported a food hypersensitivity, were asked to fill out questionnaires regarding 66 different fruits and vegetables. Subjects had three alternatives as an answer to each of the food questions: (i) ‘I tolerate it’; (ii) ‘I get symptoms from it’; or (iii) ‘I have not tried this food’. Skin prick tests were performed with pollen allergens. Most patients had experienced reactions to several foods; only 31 patients (8%) reported hypersensitivity to one food only. Some of the fruit had been tried by only a few patients. In addition to earlier well- known BP-related foods, more than 40% of patients who had knowingly eaten Japanese pear and pomegranate said that they had experienced symptoms after eating the fruit. Most patients tolerated pineapple, melon, grapes and citrus fruits, as well as zucchini, lychee, rambutan, mangosteen, ugli, melon pear and cherimoya. Although an allergy to fruit is common among BP-allergic patients, there are several widely available fruits that most patients tolerate; for instance, pineapple, melon, grapes and citrus fruit. Furthermore, there are many exotic fruits that most patients have not yet tried.",

The rate and number of recent asthma deaths in Japan have been decreasing rapidly. Most asthma deaths were of patients aged 70–90 years and there has been a marked trend for increased asthma deaths in the elderly. As for the circumstances surrounding the deaths, sudden death, unstable sudden aggravation and intermittent aggravation were mainly noted. Respiratory infections, fatigue and stress were the major courses of fatal attacks contributing to deaths due to asthma. Many of the patients who died from asthma had been diagnosed as having as moderate to severe asthma and many had non-atopic asthma. There are some reports that suggest that the recent decrease in asthma deaths in Japan is correlated with the use of inhaled cortico- steroids.",

LPS stimulates T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine expression, potentially suppressing Th2 immune responses involved in IgE-mediated allergic diseases. Previous studies have reported that -159C/T, a promoter polymorphism of CD14, is associated with total serum IgE levels and atopy, but other studies have shown conflicting results. To examine possible associations of CD14 polymorphisms with asthma susceptibility, we performed transmission disequilibrium tests (TDTs) of 137 Japanese families identified through children with atopic asthma. We found no association between -159C/T polymorphism and asthma (p = 0.37). Quantitative TDT and ANOVA showed no association between the -159C/T genotype and total serum IgE levels. We also performed a meta-analysis of data from all available studies. Neither a fixed-effects model nor a random-effect model showed a significant odds ratio for the -159C/T polymorphism (p > 0.1). Our data indicate that CD14 does not contribute substantially to susceptibility to asthma. Further studies examining both genotypes and environmental factors will be necessary to elucidate the role of CD14 in the development of allergic diseases.",

The efficacy and the safety of montelukast added to low-dose ICS therapy were compared with those of sustained-release theophylline added to low-dose ICS therapy in asthmatic children in the present study. Following the 2-week run-in period, 6-to 14-year old patients receiving treatment with ICSs were randomized to treatment for 4 weeks with either montelukast 5 mg once daily or sustained release theophylline 5–8 mg/kg (dry syrup) or 100–200 mg (tablet) twice daily. Patients also received a fixed dose of ICS throughout the run-in and treatment periods. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in peak expiratory flow (PEF) at Week 2. A significant increase in morning PEF was observed in the add-on montelukast group as compared with the add-on theophylline group at Week 2 (change from baseline of 22.8 L/min vs. 8.7 L/min; p = 0.041 for between-group difference) and at Week 4 (31.0 L/min vs. 9.8 L/min; p = 0.012). A significant increase in evening PEF was observed in the add-on montelukast group as compared with the add-on theophylline group at Week 4 (24.7 L/min vs. 8.7 L/min; p = 0.027). There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in incidences of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences. The results indicate that montelukast added to low-dose ICS is an effective and safe option for the treatment of asthma in children.",

    "abstract": "Background: Previous studies show that 6-9% of young adults in Reykjavik are sensitised to the house dust mite (HDM) Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D. pteronyssinus). However, only negligible amounts of HDM and HDM allergens were detected in their homes. The study investigates what characterizes these individuals. Methods: We investigated all participants in the European Community Respiratory Health Surveys I and II (ECRHS I and II) with D. pteronyssinus specific IgE, in the years 1991–92. A grass positive but D. pteronyssinus negative control group was recruited from the same cohort. A detailed questionnaire was administered and the specific IgE (Pharmacia CAP system) against six D. pteronyssinus cross-reactive allergens was measured. Results: Of 601 ECRHS I participants with available IgE results, 88% returned for ECRHS II, 8.4 years later. Of 49 individuals with D. pteronyssinus specific IgE in ECRHS I, 24 had become negative in ECRHs II. Compared with controls, HDM sensitive subjects were more often men who had lived on farms or kept aquaria fish in childhood. Of those with specific IgE against D. pteronyssinus in ECRHS I and II, 75% had detectable IgE antibodies (> 0.35 kU/l) to cross-reactive allergens compared with none in the control group (p < 0.0001): Lepidoglyphus destructor (L. destructor) (67%), shrimp (58%), cockroach (33%), mosquito (17%), tropomyosin (17%) and blood worm (4%). Conclusions: Icelanders with specific IgE to D. pteronyssinus are more often men who spent time on farms in childhood and today have high prevalence of IgE antibodies cross-reactive to D. pteronyssinus.",

    "abstract": "Background: A pollen exposure chamber (OHIO Chamber) was built in central Tokyo, Japan, in order to study seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Since satisfactory outcomes were obtained from the controlled pollen exposure at the chamber, we conducted preliminary studies in volunteers with SAR. Methods: Ten volunteers with SAR sensitive to Japanese cedar (JC) pollen were enrolled in this study. In order to investigate the intranasal and intraocular pollen number, volunteers were initially exposed to a low concentration of JC (2500 grains/m3) for at most 1 hour in this chamber. Before and after the exposure, nasal cavities and eyes were washed with 100 ml and 25 ml of saline, respectively. Nasal and eye washing solutions were collected and the number of JC pollen was counted. After 3 hours the volunteers were subsequently exposed to a moderate concentration of JC (4500 grains/m3) for 2 hours. Subjective nasal and ocular symptoms were recorded and the amount of nasal secretion was measured during the allergen exposure periods. Results: During the initial exposure, all volunteers except one stayed in the chamber for 1 hour without any nasal or ocular symptoms. The number of pollen in the nose and eyes was 249.2 ± 120.9 and 13.6 ± 13.6 grains, respectively. During the subsequent 2-hour exposure to JC pollen, nasal and ocular symptoms developed gradually in a time dependent manner in all the volunteers except one. Conclusions: This is the first clinical study using Japanese cedar pollen under well-controlled conditions in the OHIO chamber in which the induction of allergic symptoms was observed. The OHIO chamber will be useful for studying allergic rhinitis in Japan.",

Occlusive pneumonia was repeatedly observed in the right S6 area, and bronchoscopy revealed a polyp in the right B6 orifice, which was later identified as a fibroepithelial polyp after transbronchial endoscopic polypectomy. Two months later, pneumonia involving the right inferior lobe developed. Systemic erythema and pigmentation with bleb formation were also observed on the skin, and were thought to be drug-induced exanthema following a biopsy. Serum levels of IgM and IgG4 were extremely low at 3.0 mg/dl and less than 2.0 mg/dl, respectively. Circulating CD20 positive B cells were mildly reduced and memory B cells were markedly decreased. The majority of B cells expressed IgM on their surface. There were no abnormalities in cell counts of neutrophils, T cells, NK cells and monocytes.

However, many patients who do not live in the area show positive birch pollen Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST). Therefore, being sensitized by another tree pollen which is closely related to birch may result in showing a specific IgE antibody to birch. Alder is a one of these trees and in the past it grew widely in Japan. However, there is no available RAST data as to the correlations between alder and alder-related trees. We measured the alder specific IgE (CAP-RAST, Phadea) in stored sera which was positive in birch RAST (228 samples), beech RAST (36 samples), oak RAST (152 samples) and cedar RAST (411 samples) and examined correlations between the RAST of alder and other trees. The correlation coefficient value of birch was very high (0.971). The other coefficient values of beech and oak were high (0.884 in beech and 0.895 in oak) but were slightly lower than that of the birch. This means that in terms of allergenicities, birch pollen is almost the same as alder and beech and oak are partly different from the alder. The Japanese respond to alder pollen just same as they do to birch pollen in forming specific IgE antibody. In clinical practice, positive alder RAST has the same meaning as positive birch RAST.",

Participants in these studies had experienced decrease in morning PEF to < 80% of the predicted value at least twice a week. Study 1: In the TP group, improvement of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and decrease in percentage of sputum eosinophils both indicated a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively). These findings were not observed in the control group. Study 2: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and PEF markedly increased after treatment with TP compared with treatment with SRT or LTRA.

    "abstract": "Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is characterized by febrile illness, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia. The pathogenesis is not well understood. We report a case of 22-year-old men who never smoke presented with AEP 2 days after acute passive smoke exposure. He developed acute respiratory failure despite having no history of the disease. Computed tomography of the lung revealed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Lung biopsy specimens revealed marked eosinophil infiltration in the alveolar septa without signs of vasculitis. Two days prior to the disease, he was exposed to cigarette smoke for 2 hours in a closed area. In the absence of other causes, passive smoking may cause lung inflammatory responses. The level of urinary cotinine, which is a biomarker of smoke exposure, was considerably higher (0.198 μg/ml [201 ng/mg Creatinine]) than that in nonsmokers, but never detected following period. This case suggests that short-term passive smoking may cause AEP.",

    "abstract": "Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic respiratory disorders involving obstructive airway defects. There have been many discussions on their similarities and differences. Although airflow limitation expressed as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) has been considered to be the main diagnostic assessment in both diseases, it does not reflect the functional impairment imparted to the patients by these diseases. Therefore, multidimensional approaches using multiple measurements in assessing disease control or severity have been recommended, and multiple endpoints in addition to FEV1 have been set recently in clinical trials so as not to miss the overall effects. In particular, as improving symptoms and health status as well as pulmonary function are important goals in the management of asthma and COPD, some patient-reported measurements such as health-related quality of life or dyspnea should be included. Nonetheless, there have been few reviews on the long-term clinical course comparing asthma and COPD as predicted by measurements other than airflow limitation. Here, we therefore analyzed and compared longitudinal changes in both physiological measurements and patient-reported measurements in asthma and COPD. Although both diseases showed similar long-term progressive airflow limitation similarly despite guideline-based therapies, disease progression was different in asthma and COPD. In asthma, patient-reported assessments of health status, disability and psychological status remained clinically stable over time, in contrast to the significant deterioration of these parameters in COPD. Thus, because a single measurement of airflow limitation is insufficient to monitor these diseases, multidimensional analyses are important not only for disease control but also for understanding disease progression in asthma and COPD.",

    "abstract": "IL-13 is a major stimulator of inflammation and tissue remodeling at sites of Th2 inflammation, and common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in IL13 are associated with allergic phenotypes in several ethnically diverse populations. In particular, IL13Q110 is the non-conservative replacement of a positively charged arginine (R) with a neutral glutamine (Q) at position 110 of IL-13, and as we already know, individuals homozygous for glutamine (Q110/Q110) are strongly associated with asthma and IgE. IL13Q110 has been demonstrated to show that increased allergic inflammation depended on the enhanced IL-13-mediated Th2 effector function. Therefore, we investigated whether Q110/Q110 accelerated the decline in pulmonary function and development of airway remodeling of asthmatic patients in the general population. A total 336 asthmatic subjects living in Japan were recruited, genotyped, and had a pulmonary function test performed on them. To analyze airway inflammation and remodeling, bronchial lavage fluid (BLF) and endobronchial biopsy specimens were examined. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), %predicted, forced expiratory volume/forced vital capacity ratio, and forced expiratory flow 25-75%, % predicted were significantly decreased in Q110/Q110 compared to R110/R110, and the decline in FEV1 was increased significantly in Q110/Q110 compared to R 110/R110. The concentration of IL-13, IL-23, IL-11, GM-CSF, hyaluronic acid, and CCL8 in BLF were increased in Q110/Q110 compared to R110/R110 and the thickness of the subepithelial layer was thicker. Our study demonstrates that Q110/Q110 increases, at least in part, allergic inflammation and the propensity for airway remodeling, thus resulting in low lung function.",

To evaluate the alteration of certain proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and clarify the causative role in the processes of ILD in systemic sclerosis (SSc), we compared a BALF protein profile between 5 patients with systemic sclerosis with pulmonary fibrosis (SSc-fib +) and 4 patients with systemic sclerosis without pulmonary fibrosis (SSc-fib-) using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). We analyzed spots over the range of 10.1 kDa to 207.4 kDa. SSc-fib + patients showed increased 3 proteins compared to SSc-fib- including α2-macroglobulin, α1-antitrypsin, and pulmonary surfactant protein A and decreased 2 proteins including α2 heat shock protein (HSP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) compared to SSc-fib- patients. In conclusion, we identified several interesting proteins that might have roles in ILD of SSc patients. Further studies are warranted to clarify the role of these proteins in the processes of pulmonary fibrosis in SSc.",

To examine the role of interaction between Th2 cells and bacterial infection in tissue eosinophilia, we determined the effects of Th2 cytokines and peptidoglycan derived from the cell wall of S. aureus on corneal fibroblasts.Chemokine concentrations and the cell surface expression of adhesion molecules were determined by ELISAs, and chemokine and adhesion molecule mRNAs were quantitated by real-time PCR analysis. Signaling by the transcription factor NF-κB was evaluated by immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses as well as by assay of DNA binding activity.Among Th2 cytokines tested, only interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 induced a low level of eotaxin release by corneal fibroblasts, as did peptidoglycan. However, the combination of peptidoglycan and either IL-4 or IL-13 induced a marked synergistic increase both in eotaxin release (without affecting that of IL-8) and in the abundance of eotaxin mRNA. The combination of peptidoglycan and IL-4 or IL-13 also synergistically increased the surface expression of VCAM-1, but not that of ICAM-1. Peptidoglycan activated NF-κB in corneal fibroblasts, and inhibitors of NF-κB attenuated eotaxin release induced by peptidoglycan alone or in combination with IL-4 or IL-13.Interaction of innate and adaptive immunity, as manifested by synergistic stimulation of eotaxin and VCAM-1 expression in corneal fibroblasts by peptidoglycan and Th2 cytokines, may play an important role in tissue eosinophilia associated with ocular allergy.",

    "abstract": "Psychological stress has a recognized association with asthma symptoms. Using a murine model of allergic asthma, we recently demonstrated the involvement of μ-opioid receptors (MORs) in the central nervous system in the stress-induced exacerbation of airway inflammation. However, the involvement of MORs on neurons and immunological alterations in the stress asthma model remain unclear. MOR-knockout (MORKO) mice that express MORs only on noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons (MORKO/Tg mice) were produced and characterized for stress responses. Sensitized mice inhaled antigen and were then subjected to restraint stress. After a second antigen inhalation, bronchoalveolar lavage cells were counted. Before the second inhalation, bronchial lymph node (BLN) cells and splenocytes from stressed and non-stressed mice were cultured with antigen, and cytokine levels and the proportions of T cell subsets were measured. Stress-induced worsening of allergic airway inflammation was observed in wild-type and MORKO/Tg mice but not MORKO mice. In wild-type stressed mice, IFN-γ/IL-4 ratios in cell culture supernatants and the proportion of regulatory T cells in BLN cell populations were significantly lower than those in non-stressed mice. These differences in BLN cells were not observed between the stressed and non-stressed MORKO mice. Restraint stress had no effect on cytokine production or T cell subsets in splenocytes. Restraint stress aggravated allergic airway inflammation in association with alterations in local immunity characterized by greater Th2-associated cytokine production and a reduced development of regulatory T cells, mediated by MORs.",

We report on a case with DIHS-like symptoms following human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) infection complicated with encephalopathy. An 11-month-old girl suffered from a human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) infection (exanthema subitum) complicated with encephalopathy. We treated the patient with continuous infusion of thiopental, assisted mechanical ventilation, methylprednisolone pulse therapy, and γ-globulin infusion therapy starting on the fifth day of the illness and started phenobarbital administration on the eleventh day. The patient developed a fever, systemic erythematous exanthema, lymphadenopathy, and eosinophilia two weeks after the start of phenobarbital administration. Steroid therapy, methylprednisolone (4 mg/kg/day) followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), was started on the 28th day and was tapered off on the 72nd day after admission. Serum anti-HHV-6 IgG antibody elevation and the presence of HHV-6 DNA in the peripheral blood detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis suggested reactivation of HHV-6 after the primary infection of HHV-6. Lymphocyte transformation test for phenobarbital was positive three weeks after the DIHS crisis. HHV-6 reactivation is a unique feature in DIHS. In general one develops DIHS accompanied by reactivation of HHV-6 which has been residing in the body since the initial infection (exanthema subitum) in early childhood. This is the first report of a patient with DIHS-like symptoms which developed immediately following the primary infection of HHV-6.",

Methods: In this pragmatic, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial, 51 Japanese cedar pollinosis patients (age, 16–85 years) were randomly divided and administered FP 100 mcg twice daily as an initial drug with FEX 60 mg twice daily as an additional drug and the same treatment in the reverse order. Nasal symptoms were evaluated in a daily dairy using a 4-point scale. The primary outcome was area under curve of the line representing the daily total nasal symptom score in the pollen season on a graph. Results: Initial treatment with FP was significantly (P = 0.0015) more effective than initial treatment with FEX in improving the primary outcome. The average daily total nasal symptom score in the initial treatment with FP group was better than that in the initial treatment with FEX group throughout the pollen season. Conclusions: Initiating treatment with FP and adding FEX might lead to improved outcomes for nasal symptoms in comparison with the same drugs administered in the reverse order.",

    "abstract": "Atopy is a phenotypically heterogeneous condition, and the extent to which atopy accounts for asthma is controversial. In this study, we aimed to identify the presence of distinct sensitization patterns to common inhaled allergens and their association with asthma, allergic rhinitis and TSLP genotypes. We studied 1683 adults from Tsukuba, a city in central Japan and 297 adults from Kamishihoro, a cedar-free, birch-dominant town in northern Japan. Levels of total serum IgE and specific IgE antibodies towards 14 major inhaled allergens were measured. With the use of these measures, cluster analysis was applied to classify the subjects' sensitization patterns. We also examined the genetic effects of 2 TSLP functional SNPs on the development of each sensitization pattern. In the Tsukuba study, cluster analysis identified four clusters, including \"Dust mite dominant\", \"Multiple pollen\", \"Cedar dominant\", and \"Low reactivity\". In the Kamishihoro study, \"Dust mite dominant\", \"Multiple pollen\" and \"Low reactivity\" clusters were also identified, but a \"Cedar dominant\" cluster was not formed. The association with asthma was strongest for the \"Dust mite dominant\" cluster in both the Tsukuba and the Kamishihoro studies. In never smokers, both SNPs were associated with the \"Dust mite dominant\" cluster (OR > 1.2). In contrast, in current or past smokers, these alleles were inversely associated with the \"Multiple pollen\" cluster (OR < 0.5). Cluster analysis identified the presence of distinct sensitization patterns to common inhaled allergens. TSLP may cause asthma by promoting innate allergic responses to indoor allergens and this contribution is significantly modified by smoking.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was found to be the primary cause of death in mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). This led to investigation of the prevalence of PH in other connective tissue diseases (CTD). In 1998, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's MCTD Research Committee revealed complication of PH diagnosed by physicians in 5.02% MCTD patients, 0.90% systemic lupus erythematosus patients, 2.64% systemic sclerosis patients, and 0.56% polymyositis/dermatomyositis patients. These results have been supported by a similar survey performed in North America. As quite a few rheumatologists find right heart catheterization difficult to perform, doppler echocardiography is frequently used for screening and diagnosing PH. The MCTD Research Committee set the revised criteria for MCTD-PH, in which the threshold of estimated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure value for diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is set at 36 mmHg, as proposed by the European Society of Cardiology. Right heart catheterization is strongly recommended for commencing the treatment. Since PH due to thromboembolism can potentially be cured surgically, lung perfusion scintigraphy should be performed for all patients diagnosed with PH. Most CTD-PH are PAH, and since idiopathic PAH (IPAH) patients sometimes have immune disorders, treatment for IPAH may be applicable to CTD-PH. The greatest difference between the treatment strategy for CTD- PH and IPAH is the usage of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants. The MCTD Research Committee updated its therapeutic guidelines for MCTD-PH in 2011. Validation of these guidelines is also needed.",

However, few large-scale studies have investigated the efficacy of the Japanese version ACT (J-ACT) in actual use during clinical care. Methods: The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of the J-ACT in a clinical care setting. Using data from a 2008 questionnaire survey including the J-ACT by the Niigata Asthma Treatment Study Group, we compared the ACT scores of 2233 patients with respect to multiple parameters, including the severity by Japanese Society of Allergology and the attack frequency. Using the definition of asthma control partially referred to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines from the survey data, the accuracy screening and determination of optimal ACT cutpoints were performed by retrospective analysis. Results: Cronbach's a for the J-ACT was 0.785. Patients with more severe asthma and more frequent asthma attacks had lower ACT scores than did patients with less severe, less frequent attacks. The optimal ACT cutpoints were 24 for the controlled asthma and 20 for the uncontrolled asthma. Conclusions: Our study, the first large-scale investigation of the efficacy of the J-ACT, determined that this evaluation tool is highly efficacious in establishing the level of asthma control. However, the determination of accurate cutpoints for the J-ACT will require more clear definitions of asthma control in future prospective studies.",

Subjects recorded nasal and ocular symptoms before challenge and every 15 min after challenge initiation. The minimum cross-sectional area in the nasal cavity was measured using acoustic rhinometry before and after challenge as an indicator of nasal obstruction. Inflammatory markers in nasal lavage fluid and serum were also measured before and after challenge. Nasal and ocular symptoms were significantly exacerbated after challenge on all days of the single and 3-consecutive-day challenge tests, particularly on the third day of the consecutive challenge test. Nasal and ocular symptoms were also quickly induced with challenge immediately after the end of pollen season. No significant changes in inflammatory markers were seen. Care is needed with regard to pollen challenge conditions in the ACC, including timing of the challenge, to induce pollinosis symptoms that accurately reflect chronic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular nucleotides such as ATP and UTP are released from essentially all cells, and they interact with cell surface P2 receptors to produce a broad range of physiological responses. P2Y12 receptor is the major platelet receptor that mediates ADP-induced aggregation, P2Y12 receptor inhibitors such as clopido- grel and prasugrel inhibit platelet aggregation, and thus, they are used in the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease. Recently, studies have focused on the P2Y12 receptor as a receptor for leukotriene E4 (LTE4), because this receptor is required for LTE4-mediated pulmonary inflammation. To establish the presence of P2Y12 receptor in human nasal mucosa, we investigated the expression and the localization of the P2Y12 receptor in human nasal mucosa. Human turbinates were obtained by turbinectomy from 12 patients with nasal obstruction refractory to medical therapy. The expression of P2Y12 receptor was evaluated by RT-PCR, western blotting, and immu- nohistochemical analysis. RT-PCR analysis of total RNA extracted from human nasal turbinate, primary cultured human nasal epithelial cells and nasal vascular endothelial cells demonstrated the expression of P2Y12 receptor mRNA. A band of approximately 55 kDa was detected in human turbinates by western blot analysis using anti-P2Y12 receptor antibody. We could not find any differences between P2Y12 receptor levels in allergic and non-allergic nasal mucosa. An immunohistochemical study revealed that epithelial cells, submucosal glands and vascular endothelial cells showed intense immunoreactivity for the P2Y12 receptor. The results may have important clinical implications for understanding the role of P2Y12 receptor in upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and non-allergic rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and post-streptococcal reactive arthritis (PSRA) are immune-mediated consequences of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. ARF has declined in developed nations. No prevalence survey of PSRA has been conducted. This study evaluated the incidence and characteristics of ARF and PSRA in Japanese children.From 2010 to 2015, ARF and PSRA were evaluated using clinical data retrospectively collected by chart review from 528 hospitals.From 323 hospitals (61% response rate), 44 cases of ARF and 21 cases of PSRA were reported. Patients with ARF and/or PSRA were mainly from large cities in Japan. The mean age of ARF occurrence was 8.5 years, and the ratio of female/male patients was 16:28. Major manifestations in the acute phase included carditis, 27 cases (61.4%); polyarthritis, 22 cases (50%); erythema marginatum, 7 cases (15.9%); Sydenham chorea, 3 cases (6.8%); and subcutaneous nodules, 1 case (2.3%). Twenty-one (58.3%) patients had migratory arthritis. During the follow-up period, 6 patients (13.6%) showed mild carditis. For PRSA, the mean age was 8.2 years, and the ratio of female/male patients was 12:9. Six (28.6%) patients had monoarthritis, and 4 (19%) patients had migratory arthritis. No patient had carditis.Although ARF and PSRA are rare in the Japanese pediatric population, substantial numbers of patients with both conditions were identified in this study. We observed a high incidence of arthritis and carditis in ARF patients. No PSRA case was complicated with carditis. General pediatricians need to have updated information about ARF and PSRA, even in industrialized countries.",

    "abstract": "The emedastine patch was developed in Japan as the first transdermal drug delivery system of emedastine difumarate for allergic rhinitis. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison was conducted in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients were administered Emedastine patches (4 or 8 mg), placebo, or levocetirizine hydrochloride (5 mg tablet) once daily for 2 weeks (double-dummy technique). The primary objective was superiority to placebo by the change of the total nasal symptom score (sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion) in Week 2. Levocetirizine was a reference drug and not a comparator in this study. A total of 1276 patients were randomized to receive the 4 mg emedastine patch (n = 384), 8 mg emedastine patch (n = 382), placebo (n = 384), or levocetirizine (n = 126). The least squares mean (LSM) of the change from baseline of the total nasal symptom score (TNSS) in Week 2 was significantly larger in both emedastine patch groups than in the placebo group (adjusted p < 0.0001). In secondary analysis, LSM of the change in the TNSS was −1.20, −1.49, −0.44, and −1.32 in the 4 mg emedastine patch, 8 mg patch, placebo, and levocetirizine, respectively. Reductions in the number of episodes and scores of individual nasal symptoms were all significantly larger throughout the day in the emedastine patch groups than the placebo group (all p < 0.05). No clinically significant safety problems occurred. The emedastine patch (4 and 8 mg) effectively and safely controlled symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis with sustained action throughout the day. Study registration: JapicCTI-153092.",

    "abstract": "The development of methods to predict the clinical effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergic diseases is a crucial matter. We sought to determine whether whole saliva, which is the first body component that contacts allergen extracts during SLIT, is associated with the clinical effectiveness of SLIT in Japanese cedar pollinosis.Blood monocytes or monocytic THP-1 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of either whole saliva or pure saliva with or without treatments including filtration and blockade of TLR2 and/or TLR4 signaling. IL-10 levels in the supernatants were then measured. Whole saliva-induced IL-10 production by THP-1 cells was compared between asymptomatic and disease-onset patients during peak pollen dispersal after SLIT.Both monocytes and THP-1 cells produced substantial amounts of IL-10 in response to whole saliva. IL-10 production was significantly reduced in response to pure saliva and 0.2 μm-filtered saliva. Simultaneous treatment with polymyxin B and TL2.1, a neutralizing antibody against TLR2, also reduced IL-10 production. IL-10 levels produced by THP-1 cells in response to whole saliva collected prior to SLIT were significantly higher in asymptomatic patients determined by symptom-medication scores than disease-onset patients following SLIT. Such differences were not seen in saliva collected 3 months after the initiation of SLIT or saliva collected during peak pollen dispersal.Our results provide a basis for why the sublingual route is effective and preferable in allergen immunotherapy. Saliva-induced IL-10 levels produced by THP-1 cells may be a predictive marker for clinical remission after SLIT.",

Histological analysis was carried out to enumerate eosinophils/basophils in the conjunctival tissue. Th2 cytokine expression was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and microarray analysis was performed to elucidate genes differentially expressed in POSTN-KO and wild-type mice in the RW-EAC model.Upregulation of POSTN expression and eosinophil infiltration was observed in subconjunctival tissue of RW-EAC in the wild-type mice. The number of infiltrating eosinophils in the conjunctivae of RW-EAC was diminished in POSTN-KO mice compared to wild-type mice. Q-PCR analysis of conjunctival tissue showed induction of Th2 cytokine (Ccl5, Il4, Il5, Il13) expression in the RW-EAC and attenuated Ccl5, Il4, Il13 mRNA expression in the conjunctivae of the RW-EAC using POSTN-KO mice. Microarray analysis and immunohistochemical analysis showed diminished basophil marker (Mcpt8) expression and reduced numbers of infiltrating basophils in the conjunctivae of RW-EAC in POSTN-KO mice.POSTN expression in conjunctival tissue plays an indispensable role in the late-phase reaction of the RW-EAC model by facilitating eosinophil/basophil infiltration and augmenting Th2 cytokine expression.",

In a previous study we have reported a high incidence of positive allergy tests for NMBAs in patients with a positive history of non-anaesthetic drug allergy, a larger prospective study being needed to confirm those preliminary results. The objective of this study was to compare the skin tests results for patients with a positive history of antibiotic-induced immediate type hypersensitivity reactions to those of controls without drug allergies.Ninety eight patients with previous antibiotic hypersensitivity and 72 controls were prospectively included. Skin tests were performed for atracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium, and suxamethonium.We found 65 positive skin tests from the 392 tests performed in patients with a positive history of antibiotic hypersensitivity (1 6.58%) and 23 positive skin tests from the 288 performed in controls (7.98%), the two incidences showing significant statistical difference (p = 0.0011). The relative risk for having a positive skin test for NMBAs for patients versus controls was 1.77 (1.15-2.76). For atracurium, skin tests were more often positive in patients with a positive history of antibiotic hypersensitivity versus controls (p = 0.02). For pancuronium, rocuronium and suxamethonium the statistical difference was not attained (p-values 0.08 for pancuronium, 0.23 for rocuronium, and 0.26 for suxamethonium).Patients with a positive history of antibiotic hypersensitivity seem to have a higher incidence of positive skin tests for NMBAs.

We developed a new technology for analyzing lung sounds and assessed its clinical usefulness in asthmatic children.Forty-four children underwent lung sound recording with simultaneous airflow measurement using a sensor on the upper right anterior chest. We calculated a sound parameter index from the amplitude of inspiratory lung sounds at 700 Hz (ic700). ic700 were compared depending on flow and body size. In addition, 184 asthmatic children and 16 non-asthmatic children underwent lung sound analysis and lung function test in an asymptomatic state. In the asthma group, 135 children received treatment continually. The untreated asthma group included 28 children who had never received treatment continually and 21 children who had not been treated for at least 1 year. The asthmatic children were divided into four classes according to asthma severity. ic700 were compared depending on spirometric parameters and asthma severity classification.The influences of flow and body size were negligible for ic700. ic700 correlated with FEV1%, MMF and FEF50 (r = -0.436, -0.339 and -0.302, respectively). There was a significant difference of ic700 between asthmatic and non-asthmatic children (p < 0.001), and ic700 correlated with the classification of asthma severity (p < 0.001). The ic700 scores of the severe group were higher than those of the intermittent group and non-asthmatic children.It was possible to evaluate airway dysfunction of asthma using ic700, which was calculated non-invasively by analyzing lung sounds alone, without measuring body size and airflow.",

Here, we assessed the epitopes related to the cross-reactivity between Cry j 2 and Cha o 2 using in vitro analyses. Peptides were synthesized based on Cry j 2 sequential epitopes and relevant Cha o 2 amino acid sequences. Four representative monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Cry j 2 were used according to their epitope recognitions. Serum samples were collected from 31 patients with CJ pollinosis. To investigate cross-reactivity between Cry j 2 and Cha o 2, ELISA and inhibition ELISA were performed with mAbs and sera from patients with CJ pollinosis. Two of four mAbs had reactivity to both Cry j 2 and Cha o 2. Of these two mAbs, one mAb (T27) recognized the amino acid sequence 169KVVNGRTV176 on Cha o 2. This is related to the core epitope 169KWVNGREI176 on Cry j 2, which is an important IgE epitope. In addition, we found that these correlative sequences and purified allergens showed cross-reactivity between Cry j 2 and Cha o 2 in IgE of CJ patients. We demonstrated the importance of 169KVVNGRTV176 in Cha o 2 for cross-reactivity with the Cry j 2 epitope 169KWVNGREI176, which plays an important role in allergenicity in CJ pollinosis. Our results are useful for the development of safer and more efficient therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CJ and CO pollen allergies.",

The aim of this study is to define the characteristics of RML atelectasis in asthma during childhood. Children with asthma who had recently developed RML atelectasis were included; anti-inflammatory medications, clarithromycin, and inhaled salbutamol were prescribed, chest-physiotherapy (starting on the sixth day) was applied. Patients were reevaluated on the sixth, fourteenth, thirtieth, and ninetieth days, chest X-rays were taken if the atelectasis had not resolved at the time of the previous visit. Twenty-seven patients (6.8 (4.8–8.3) years, 48.1% male) with RML atelectasis were included. Symptoms started 15 (7–30) days before admission. The thickness of the atelectasis was 11.8 ± 5.8 mm; FEV1% was 75.9 ± 14.2 and Childhood Asthma Control Test scores were 11.8 ± 5.6 at the time of admission. The atelectasis had been resolved by the sixth (n = 3), fourteenth (n = 9), thirtieth (n = 10), and ninetieth days (n = 3). The treatment response of the patients whose atelectasis resolved in fourteen days was better on the sixth-day (atelectasis thickness: 4.7 ± 1.7 vs. 11.9 ± 7.3 mm, p = 0.021) compared to those whose atelectasis resolved later. Nearly half (54.5%) of the patients whose atelectasis had resolved by fourteen days were using controller medications at the time of admission. However, only two patients (13.3%) were on controller treatment in the latter group (p = 0.032). Regression analysis didn't reveal any prognostic factors for the early resolution of atelectasis. Early diagnosis and treatment of RML atelectasis prevents complications. Patients who had early resolution of atelectasis had already been on anti-inflammatory medications, and responded better to aggressive treatment within the first week.",

    "abstract": "The characteristics of phenotypes of elderly patients with asthma are unknown. The aim of this study was to classify these phenotypes using lung function tests and images from high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and to identify associations between clinical characteristics and phenotypes. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 165 elderly patients (>65 years of age) who underwent a multidimensional assessment of clinical and functional status and comorbidity. The patients were divided into three phenotypes: (1) asthma-predominant, (2) asthma-obstructive airway disease (OAD) overlap without emphysema, and (3) asthma-OAD overlap with emphysema (asthma-emphysema overlap) based on chest HRCT. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate the cutoff for differentiating between the two OAD phenotypes. Multivariate analysis was also used to distinguish between these two phenotypes. The phenotypes were asthma-predominant in 48 patients (29%), asthma-OAD without emphysema in 36 (22%), and asthma-emphysema in 81 (49%). Patients with asthma-emphysema were more frequent smokers. In multivariate analysis, smoking status (odds ratio 2.92: 95% CI 1.21–7.00, P = 0.03) and % predicted FEV1 ≤70% (odds ratio 3.18: 95% CI 1.13–8.92, P = 0.03) differed significantly between the asthma-emphysema and asthma-OAD without emphysema phenotypes. Half of elderly patients with asthma are characterized by asthma-emphysema overlap. Our results showed that elderly patients with asthma who are smokers and have moderate or severe OAD are also likely to have emphysema.",

However, no scale of this kind exists in Japan. The aims of this study were to validate the Japanese Culturally Modified Version of the CADIS (JCMV-CADIS) and to describe the family impact of children with AD in a Japanese context.Participants included primary-caregivers for children with AD between 2 and 6 years of age. Interviews were conducted, and new items for the Japanese version were drafted. Reliability and validity were evaluated and compared with the original CADIS, and unique features of the Japanese version were analyzed.Exploratory factor analysis revealed the following factors: \"Symptoms\" and \"Activity Limitations and Behavior\" in the Child domain, and \"Emotions Related to Social Factors,\" \"Emotions Related to the Child's Condition,\" \"Family and Social Function,\" \"Complexity of Care,\" and \"Approaches to Management of AD in Daily Life\" in the Parent domain. The latter two factors were unique to the JCMV-CADIS and were not derived from the Original. \"Emotion\" was split into two independent factors. All factors showed good reliability (internal consistency and stability) and validity (concurrent validity and discriminant validity), except for the concurrent validity of \"Approaches to Management of AD in Daily Life.\" This factor seemed to reflect characteristics similar to the family-related function.The JCMV-CADIS is a QoL scale developed for Japanese children with AD and their families. Further evaluation of clinical applicability is needed.",

    "abstract": "Psychological stress is one of the major risk factors for asthma exacerbation. Although histamine in the brain acts as an excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter associated with psychological stress, the contribution of brain histamine to psychological stress-induced exacerbation of asthma remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of histamine receptors in the CNS on stress induced asthma aggravation.We monitored the numbers of inflammatory cells and interleukin (IL)-13 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine, mucus secretion in airway epithelial cells, and antigen-specific IgE contents in sera in a murine model of stress-induced asthma treated with epinastine (an H1R antagonist), thioperamide (an H3/4R antagonist), or solvent.All indicators of stress-induced asthma exacerbation were significantly reduced in stressed mice treated with epinastine compared with those treated with solvent, whereas treatment with thioperamide did not reduce the numbers of inflammatory cells in the stressed mice.These results suggest that H1R, but not H3/4R, may be involved in stress-induced asthma exacerbations in the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Although antibody deficiency (AD) is a well-known cause of recurrent respiratory infections, there are few data on its impact in adults with asthma. The objective of the present study was to assess outcomes in adults with severe asthma and AD after treatment with either azithromycin or subcutaneous immunoglobulins (SCIg). We performed a 5-year, prospective, observational, two-centre study of adults with severe asthma and AD in France. Bronchiectasis was ruled out by high-resolution computed tomography. Patients were treated for one year with either azithromycin (250 mg every other day) or SCIg (0.4–0.6 g/kg/months, weekly). All patients were evaluated for exacerbations, asthma control and lung function at baseline and then one year after treatment initiation. Thirty-nine patients with severe asthma were included in the study: 14 had been treated with azithromycin and 25 had been treated with SCIg. Before the initiation of treatment for AD, all patients had an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score > 1.5 (mean ± SD: 2.71 ± 0.53) despite treatment at GINA step 4 or 5, and had a high exacerbation rate requiring oral corticosteroids and/or rescue antibiotics (∼7.2 ± 2.1/patient/year). One year after treatment initiation, we observed a significantly higher FEV1 (mean: 0.18 ± 0.22 L) and ACQ-7 score (1.26 ± 0.68), and a significantly lower exacerbation rate (1.63 ± 1.24/patient/year). Treatment of AD dramatically improved asthma outcomes - suggesting that adults with severe asthma and recurrent respiratory infections should be screened and (if appropriate) treated for AD.",

Although precipitation is traditionally used to document IgG Abs, anti-Af serum IgG levels can also be measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). However, there are insufficient data on the optimal cut-offs to assess diagnostic performance of the EIA method. This study aimed to determine cut-off levels of IgG binding crude Af extracts or recombinant Asp f 1 (by ImmunoCAP®) and to compare their efficacy for ABPA diagnosis with Af-precipitating Abs. The age distribution of levels of IgG to crude extracts of Af (Af-IgG) and recombinant Asp f 1 (Asp f 1-IgG) was established using sera from 694 healthy controls (HC). Receiver operating characteristic analysis for Af-IgG and Asp f 1-IgG levels for the purpose of ABPA diagnosis was performed in 306 Af-sensitized asthma patients (including 49 ABPA), and cut-offs were determined. An age-dependent decline in the levels of Af-IgG was observed in HC. Thus, cut-offs for Af-IgG levels were determined separately by age as 60 mg/L for patients aged <55 years, and 45 mg/L for those aged ≥55 years. For Asp f 1-IgG, 6.6 mg/L was set as the cut-off regardless of age. Although such IgG testing by EIA allowed a sufficiently good diagnostic performance, Af-precipitating Abs had better diagnostic applicability for ABPA. We determined cut-offs for Af-IgG and Asp f 1-IgG measured by EIA, which can be useful in clinical settings where precipitating Abs are unavailable.",

Although propolis has been reported to inhibit mast cell functions and mast cell-dependent allergic responses, the effect of propolis on basophil biology remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of propolis on FcεRI-mediated basophil activation.To determine the inhibitory effect of propolis on basophil activation in vitro, cytokine production and FcεRI signal transduction were analyzed by ELISA and western blotting, respectively. To investigate the inhibitory effect of propolis in vivo, IgE-CAI and a food allergy mouse model were employed.Propolis treatment resulted in the suppression of IgE/antigen-induced production of IL-4, IL-6 and IL-13 in basophils. Phosphorylation of FcεRI signaling molecules Lyn, Akt and ERK was inhibited in basophils treated with propolis. While propolis did not affect the basophil population in the treated mice, propolis did inhibit IgE-CAI. Finally, ovalbumin-induced intestinal anaphylaxis, which involves basophils and basophil-derived IL-4, was attenuated in mice prophylactically treated with propolis.Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of propolis to suppress IgE-dependent basophil activation and basophil-dependent allergic inflammation. Therefore, prophylactic treatment with propolis may be useful for protection against food allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.",

In this study, we analyzed the sensitivity to venom specific (s)IgE by spiking with rVes v 5 and rPol d 5 in Japanese patients suspected of Hymenoptera venom allergy.Subjects were 41 patients who had experienced systemic reactions to hornet and/or paper wasp stings. Levels of serum sIgE against hornet and paper wasp venom by spiking with rVes v 5 and rPold d 5, respectively, as improvement testing, compared with hornet and paper wasp venom, as conventional testing, were measured by ImmunoCAP.Of the 41 patients, 33 (80.5%) were positive (≥0.35 UA/ml) for hornet and/or paper wasp venom in conventional sIgE testing. sIgE levels correlated significantly (P < 0.01) between hornet (R = 0.92) or paper wasp venom (R = 0.78) in improvement testing and conventional testing. To determine specificity, 20 volunteers who had never experienced a Hymenoptera sting were all negative for sIgE against these venoms in both improvement and conventional testing. Improved sensitivity was seen in 8 patients negative for sIgE against both venoms in conventional testing, while improvement testing revealed sIgE against hornet or paper wasp venom in 5 (total 38 (92.7%)) patients.The measurement of sIgE following spiking of rVes v 5 and rPol d 5 by conventional testing in Japanese subjects with sIgE against hornet and paper wasp venom, respectively, improved the sensitivity for detecting Hymenoptera venom allergy. Improvement testing for measuring sIgE levels against hornet and paper wasp venom has potential for serologically elucidating Hymenoptera allergy in Japan.",

    "abstract": "The activation of liver X receptor (LXR) α or LXRβ negatively regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in mammalian cells. We recently reported that 25-hydroxycholesterol, a representative LXR-activating oxysterol, suppresses IL-6 production in mouse mast cells (MCs) following its engagement of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI). This finding suggests that murine MCs express functional LXRs; however, the mechanisms underlying the LXR-dependent repression of the MC-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, are poorly understood. Therefore, we employed the synthetic LXR ligand GW3965 to examine the functions of LXRα and LXRβ in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by murine bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs).We prepared BMMCs from wild-type (WT), LXRα(-/-), and LXRα/β(-/-) mice. Each group of BMMCs was pretreated with GW3965 and then stimulated with IgE+antigen (Ag) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cytokine production was then analyzed using specific ELISA kits.The activation of LXRs by GW3965 significantly attenuated the production of IL-1α and IL-1β, but not of IL-6, in the WT and LXRα(-/-) BMMCs stimulated with IgE+Ag. However, GW3965 treatment decreased the production of IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in WT and LXRα(-/-) BMMCs upon stimulation with LPS, while the GW3965-mediated suppression of cytokine production was nearly absent from the LXRα/β(-/-) BMMCs.These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that the activation of LXRs by GW3965 attenuates the antigen- or LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α and IL-1β, in murine MCs and that LXRβ plays an important role in the LXR-mediated repression of cytokine production.",

    "abstract": "Depression has been linked to poorer asthma control in asthmatic patients. Although the Japanese version of the Asthma Control Test (ACT-J) is frequently used as a simple, practical evaluation tool in clinical care settings in Japan, knowledge regarding its efficacy for assessing asthma control in asthmatic patients with depression is limited. Thus, we retrospectively investigated cut-off values of the ACT-J for well-controlled asthma, and explored depression's influence on the test with a questionnaire survey.Data were analyzed on 1,962 adult asthmatic patients who had completed both the ACT-J and the Japanese version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (J-PHQ-9) in 2008 questionnaire survey conducted by the Niigata Asthma Treatment Study Group. Patients were classified into low (LD: J-PHQ-9 score of 0-4) or high depression (HD: J-PHQ-9 score of 5-27) groups. In both groups, the efficacy of the ACT-J was confirmed. We then compared the optimal cut-off points for uncontrolled asthma in both groups by performing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, using the original classification referred to the GINA classification as the \"true\" classification.Cronbach's alpha in the LD and HD group was 0.808 and 0.740 respectively. In both groups, the sub-group with existence of work absenteeism or frequent attacks during the previous 12 months scored lower on the ACT-J. The area under the curve and optimal cut-off point for patients with LD and HD were 0.821 and 0.846, and 23 and 20 respectively.The efficacy of the ACT-J was confirmed in depressive patients with asthma. Because asthma control as evaluated with the ACT-J can be worse than actual control under depressive states, physicians should also pay attention to a patient's depressive state at evaluation. Further investigations focus on the association between the ACT-J and depression are required.",

However, a treatment regimen has not been established. In the present study, we examined a new OIT regimen with a build-up phase and extended the maintenance phase of OIT to the peak period of the pollen season to enhance the therapeutic effect and safety of OIT. A prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted over a period of 4 months. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. The OIT group comprised 23 subjects. The build-up phase was initiated 1 month before the expected pollen season. The maintenance phase was continued for 51 days during the peak pollen season. The control group comprised 24 subjects. The symptoms and medication score, levels of allergen-specific serum antibodies throughout the pollen season, and adverse effects with OIT were evaluated. Participants receiving OIT showed significant improvements in total symptom scores, medication score, and total symptom-medication scores throughout the pollen season compared with the control group. The levels of allergen-specific serum IgG4 were significantly increased in the OIT group but not in the control group throughout the cedar pollen season. Importantly, no severe adverse effects were observed with OIT. The new regimen of short-term OIT using the Cry j1-galactomannan conjugate for Japanese cedar pollinosis is effective, relatively safe and induces immune tolerance. Thus, OIT using allergen–galactomannan conjugates may provide a rapid, effective, and thus convenient immunotherapy for pollinosis instead of SLIT or SCIT.",

This study evaluated the association of symptom control with changes in lung function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) after ICS treatment in asthmatic children.A total of 33 children aged between 5 and 12 years with mild to moderate persistent asthma were treated with 160 μg ciclesonide per day for 3 months. At days 0 and 90, the following parameters were assessed: asthma symptom scores; lung function, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of forced vital capacity (FEF25-75%); BHR to methacholine and adenosine 5-monophosphate (AMP); and eNO.Asthma symptom scores, lung function parameters, BHR to methacholine and AMP, and eNO levels at day 90 were significantly improved versus day 0 (all p < 0.001). Symptom scores at day 90 were not correlated with changes in lung function and BHR to methacholine during the follow-up period, whereas those at day 90 were more closely correlated with changes in BHR to AMP (r = 0.511, p = 0.003) than with eNO (r = -0.373, p = 0.035). Additionally, changes in PC20 AMP were correlated with changes in PC20 methacholine (r = 0.451, p = 0.011) and eNO (r = -0.474, p = 0.006).Changes in the BHR to AMP, and to a lesser extent eNO, correlate with asthma symptom control after ICS treatment. BHR to AMP may better reflect the relationship between improved airway inflammation due to ICS treatment and asthma symptoms.",

IFN-γ showed limited effects on TGF-α and polyI:C-induced activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that Sp1 bound to its cognate sequence located on the MUC5AC promoter. The Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A inhibited MUC5AC mRNA expression, implying a critical role for Sp1 in MUC5AC induction. Importantly, IFN-γ impeded Sp1 binding to the MUC5AC promoter.These results suggest that IFN-γ represses MUC5AC expression, disturbing binding of Sp1 to its target sequences.",

    "abstract": "The neural and immune systems are closely connected, and recently, their molecular mechanisms and relationships with diseases have attracted substantial attention. Particularly, it has been increasingly reported that ILC2s, which produce type 2 cytokines independent of acquired immunity, are regulated by neuropeptides such as catecholamines, acetylcholine, vasoactive intestinal peptide, neuromedins, and calcitonin gene-related peptide. However, the regulatory mechanisms in this regard are only partially understood, implying that further studies are still needed to clarify the complete mechanisms and processes. In this review, we summarize current reports on the regulatory effect of neuropeptides on ILC2s, some of which have conflicting results, possibly owing to the complexity of G-protein coupled receptors. By summarizing the current evidence, we hope to be able to identify what is currently unknown as well as what needs to be clarified in the future.",

This birth cohort study investigated a general population in the Tokyo Children's Health, Illness, and Development Study (T-Child Study) until children reached the age of 13 years. Eczema was assessed using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. Allergen component specific IgE antibody titers were measured using a multiplex array ImmunoCAP ISAC. Persistent eczema phenotype until adolescence was strongly associated with allergic march symptoms, such as wheezing and hay fever, and oral allergy symptoms, and IgE component sensitizations of airborne (Japanese cedar, house dust mite, Timothy, cat, and dog) and cross-reactive allergens (Bet v 1 family) compared to early-remission and late-onset eczema. On the other hand, late-onset eczema did not show any strong associations with allergic symptoms and IgE sensitization. Adolescents with persistent eczema have high comorbidity of symptoms of pollen-food allergy syndrome. Early-onset eczema is deeply connected with the later allergic march, and late-onset eczema differs from the phenotype of allergic march. Early-onset eczema characterizing IgE sensitization was likely to be an extrinsic type, and late-onset eczema, which was not related to IgE sensitization, was likely an intrinsic type. Pollen-Food Allergy Syndrome is one of the allergic features in allergic march.",

Specifically, we discuss a novel mAb in the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by recurrent unpredictable swelling attacks. HAE is mediated by dysregulation of plasma kallikrein activity leading to overproduction of bradykinin. Current prophylactic treatment for HAE includes androgens or replacement of the endogenous plasma kallikrein inhibitor, C1 inhibitor. However, there remains an unmet need for an effective, less burdensome treatment option. Lanadelumab is a fully human mAb targeting plasma kallikrein. Results from clinical trials, including a pivotal Phase 3 study and its ensuing open-label extension study, demonstrated that lanadelumab is associated with few treatment-related adverse events and reduced the rate of HAE attacks. This novel treatment option has the potential to significantly improve the lives of patients with HAE.",

Inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥16 years with at least one health insurance claim from April 2018 to March 2019 in all departments of our hospital. Physician-diagnosed asthma documented in the charts was used as the reference standard. Positive and negative predictive values of the discrimination criteria for physician-diagnosed asthma were estimated and compared with those estimated from discrimination criteria based solely on ICD-10 codes.The new discrimination criteria had a high positive predictive value (PPV) of 86.0%, which was significantly higher than the PPV for the criteria defined solely by the ICD-10 codes (61.5%) (P < 0.01). The negative predictive values for both criteria were 100%. Allergic rhinitis and chronic cough were frequently misclassified as asthma using the discrimination criteria based solely on ICD-10 codes but were more likely to be appropriately classified using our proposed criteria.Our proposed criteria adequately identified asthma subjects using health insurance claims data in Japan with a high PPV.

However, whether airway inflammation and smoking affect the association between mucus plugs and clinical-physiological outcomes in asthma remains to be elucidated. The objective of this study is to examine how airway inflammation and/or smoking affect the correlation of CT-based mucus plug scores with exacerbation frequency and airflow limitation indices in asthma.A total of 168 patients with asthma who underwent chest CT and sputum evaluation were enrolled and classified in eosinophilic asthma (EA; n = 103) and non-eosinophilic asthma (NEA; n = 65) groups based on sputum eosinophil percentage (cut-off: 3%). The mucus plug score was defined as the number of lung segments with mucus plugs seen on CT.More mucus plugs were detected on CT scans in the EA group than in the NEA group, regardless of smoking status. Mucus plug score and exacerbation frequency during one year after enrollment were significantly associated in the EA group but not in the NEA group after adjusting for demographics, blood eosinophil count, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide. Mucus plug score was associated with percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s in non-smoking individuals in the EA and NEA group and in smoking individuals in the EA group but not in the NEA group after adjusting for demographics.The association of mucus plug score with exacerbation frequency and reduced lung function may vary due to airway inflammatory profile and smoking status in asthma.",

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the efficacy and safety of systemic targeted therapies for atopic dermatitis in children. A systematic review of literature available in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and ICHUSHI databases until January 7, 2023, was performed. Randomized controlled trials of systemic targeted therapies (biologics and small molecules) on children aged 18 years or younger with atopic dermatitis were included. The primary outcomes were the eczema area and severity index (EASI) and adverse events. Other efficacy and safety outcomes were also used for meta-analysis and risk of bias analysis. We included 10 studies reported in 11 articles involving three agents (dupilumab, abrocitinib, and upadacitinib) and 1760 children. Systemic targeted therapies significantly improved eczema severity with an EASI-75 response (risk ratio, 2.99; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2.66-3.37). However, systemic targeted therapies were associated with treatment-emergent adverse events (risk difference, 0.05; 95 % CI, 0.01-0.09), particularly among small molecules in subgroup analysis, while no such trend was observed with biologics. Systemic targeted therapy also significantly improved other efficacy outcomes, and no significant association was found in the other safety outcomes. There was no risk of bias in any of the outcomes. Our findings indicate that systemic targeted therapies are effective and relatively safe for treating atopic dermatitis in children, although small molecules may pose a slightly higher risk of adverse events.",

This study evaluated the impact of two SLIT extracts on AR and asthma progression or onset in these patients. This was a sub-analysis of a retrospective, longitudinal comparative cohort study that used a German prescription database. Patients treated with 3-tree (birch/alder/hazel) or birch-only SLIT-liquid and followed up for up to 6 years after treatment were compared with controls dispensed symptomatic medications. Multiple regression analysis compared dispensation data as a proxy for disease status and progression. A total of 493 patients treated with 3-tree SLIT-liquid and 311 treated with birch SLIT-liquid were analysed vs. 44,835 patients included as controls. Overall, 70.5 % of patients presented solely AR, 24.2 % solely asthma, and 5.3 % both diseases. Compared with controls, patients treated with 3-tree SLIT-liquid had reduced risk of AR [odds ratio (OR) = 3.21, 95 % CI 2.54-4.06, p < 0.001], asthma progression (OR = 2.03, 95 % CI 1.43-2.89, p < 0.0001), or asthma onset (OR = 0.592, 95 % CI, 0.408-0.860, p = 0.006). Birch-only SLIT-liquid showed similar effectiveness in reducing AR and asthma medication dispensation but no significant effect in reducing new-onset asthma. This real-world study demonstrated the effectiveness of treatment with 3-tree SLIT-liquid or birch SLIT-liquid in slowing the progression of birch-family pollen allergy. 3-tree SLIT-liquid covering a broader repertoire of epitopes mimicking natural exposure throughout the year may be valuable for patients sensitised to birch and/or alder and/or hazel pollen suffering from overlapping tree-pollen seasons.",

SchS shares clinical features with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, which is driven by gain-of-function mutations in NLRP3, and while IL-1β-targeted therapies have shown efficacy, the underlying pathogenesis of SchS remains unclear. During a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, investigator-initiated trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in five Japanese patients with SchS (named the SCan Study after SchS and Canakinumab), based on a similar study conducted in Germany, we measured 32 cytokines/chemokines and 11 complement-related factors in plasma and analyzed their correlations with changes in clinical symptoms during treatment. Furthermore, in two cases, single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood and spatial transcriptomic analysis of lesional skin were performed to identify IL1B-expressing cells. The improvement in clinical symptoms and quality of life was maintained for 48 weeks following canakinumab treatment. Notably, these changes in clinical symptoms strongly correlated with WBC count, neutrophil count, CRP, and serum amyloid A levels, which were used as evaluation parameters in this study. In contrast, IL-1β and most other cytokines/chemokines exhibited distinct patterns and were not useful as markers of disease activity. IgM levels remained stable without an upward trend. Additionally, IL1B-expressing cells were predominantly neutrophils in both peripheral blood and lesional skin. Furthermore, neutrophil counts in peripheral blood decreased following canakinumab administration. This study demonstrated that the primary source of IL1B-expressing cells in SchS is neutrophils. Moreover, canakinumab improves clinical symptoms by regulating neutrophil dynamics in peripheral blood.",

    "abstract": "The underlying pathophysiology of varying physical activity levels in patients with asthma remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the association between physical activity and air trapping, identified via chest computed tomography, in patients with asthma. The following computed tomography analyses were used to evaluate air trapping in two cohorts (Cohort 1: 27 patients with asthma, 12 healthy individuals; Cohort 2: 90 patients with asthma, 43 healthy individuals): density analysis, focusing on air trapping characteristics during expiration, and parametric response mapping (PRM), which integrates inspiratory and expiratory computed tomography scans to categorize air trapping into small airway disease (PRMSAD) and low-attenuation areas. Mucus plug scores were also measured. Patients with asthma exhibited significantly reduced activity levels compared with healthy participants at intensities of ≥2, ≥3, and ≥4 metabolic equivalents (METs) in both cohorts. Among patients with asthma, air trapping was significantly associated with decreased physical activity of ≥4 METs, corresponding to moderate-to-vigorous exercise intensity. Among the air-trapping components, increased PRMSAD significantly contributed to reduced physical activity at ≥4 METs. Regarding the relationship between PRMSAD and physical activity for each lung lobe, elevated PRMSAD in the left upper lobe played a significant role in decreasing physical activity. The presence of mucus plugs was associated with elevated PRMSAD. The uneven distribution of air trapping in the lungs of patients with asthma, particularly in the upper lobe, was linked to reduced moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity and was partially attributable to small airway obstruction caused by mucus plugs.",

However, their subsequent maintenance remains unclear, including the involvement of the gut microbiota. We aimed to investigate where and how SLIT-induced Treg cells are maintained to ensure tolerance to allergens. We used a mouse model of prophylactic SLIT with ovalbumin as the allergen. SLIT-induced tolerance was assessed by suppressing delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. The distribution of SLIT-induced Treg cells was determined based on their ability to suppress the DTH response upon adoptive transfer. The involvement of LNs and gut microbiota was assessed by the surgical removal of LNs and antibiotic depletion of the gut microbiota, respectively. Suppression of DTH by SLIT was impaired by surgical removal of submandibular LNs prior to SLIT. Functional SLIT-induced Treg cells were detected in submandibular LNs and gut-draining mesenteric LNs, however, not in skin-draining LNs or the spleen. Intriguingly, the surgical removal of mesenteric LNs alone after SLIT was sufficient to abolish the suppressive effect of SLIT. Gut microbiota depletion by antibiotic treatment after SLIT also abolished the suppressive effect of SLIT and impaired the maintenance of functional SLIT-induced Treg cells in mesenteric LNs. Functional SLIT-induced Treg cells were maintained in mesenteric LNs in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Thus, this study revealed a previously unrecognized role of the gut microbiota in SLIT and provided a rationale for targeting the gut environment to improve the efficacy and prolong the maintenance of SLIT.",

Microbes in the skin samples from the three groups were analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We estimated the anti-virulence of Kocuria rhizophila in the skin microbiome of children. The effects of K. rhizophila were evaluated in human skin cell models with AD-like damage caused by Staphylococcus aureus secretory toxins, including protein A (PA), lipoteichoic acid, and protease V8. Taxonomic classification revealed significant phylum-level differences among the three groups. Alpha-diversity indices tended to decrease in the AD-F group compared with the non-AD group but were higher in the AD-NF group. The AD group had a high relative abundance of S. aureus, but S. aureus was almost absent in the non-AD group and exhibited a marked decrease in the AD-NF group; K. rhizophila was negatively correlated with AD severity. Heat-killed K. rhizophila (HKKR) treatment upregulated gene expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 and critical components of the cornified cell envelope, involucrin and filaggrin, while downregulating the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that HKKR treatment was associated with skin barrier functions, cell-cell junctions, and immune responses. K. rhizophila may be associated with the mitigation of skin barrier dysfunction and inflammation in S. aureus infection, highlighting its potential for AD treatment.",

Here we report the final analysis of a long-term open-label extension (OLE) of a phase 3 study that assessed dupilumab in Japanese patients aged ≥6 months to <18 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis inadequately controlled with existing therapies. Study participants were randomly assigned to dupilumab or placebo with concomitant topical corticosteroids for 16 weeks, then to open-label dupilumab until approval or for 3 years, whichever came first. Of the 62 participants randomized, 60 entered the OLE and continued to receive dupilumab (n = 28) or initiated dupilumab (n = 32). Improvements in clinical severity scores seen with dupilumab at Week 16 persisted up to Week 116, as confirmed by several efficacy endpoints (proportion of patients who achieved ≥75 % or ≥90 % improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI] score, and Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0/1, and percent change in EASI scores from baseline). During the dupilumab exposure period, 93.5 % of patients experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). No adverse events leading to death, or TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation were observed during the OLE period. One (3.1 %) treatment-emergent positive anti-drug antibody response was observed during the OLE period in the placebo/dupilumab group. This analysis supports the long-term efficacy and safety of dupilumab in Japanese patients aged ≥6 months to <18 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.",

The QOL was evaluated using the Japanese Allergic Rhinitis Standard QOL Questionnaire (JRQLQ no. 1). The JRQLQ is structured to evaluate six domains of usual daily activities, outdoor activities, social functioning, sleep problems, general physical problems and emotional function, as well as the overall QOL. On the 14th day after the start of fexofenadine or placebo administration, the QOL was improved in all domains of the JRQLQ in the fexofenadine group, whereas it had worsened in all domains, except outdoor activities, in the placebo group. The overall evaluation of QOL was significantly more favorable in the fexofenadine group on the 14th day after the start of administration.

To overcome these difficulties, we created a regimen of intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) and cyclophosphamide (CPM) for the treatment of this patient.For the simultaneous treatment, IVIG-CPM was added to Pred/CsA by means of infusion of IVIG on five consecutive days per month, followed by CPM infusion on the ninth day after the last IVIG administration.

    "abstract": "Allergic bronchial asthma is a complex inflammatory diseases originated from dysregulated immune responses in the respiratory mucosa. The inflammatory state in asthmatic lung is characterized by massive infiltration with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in the airway mucosa leading to airway hyperseisitivity, goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus overproduction. The inflammatory process is thought to be the result of intensive T helper (Th) 2-biased immune response. Over the past several years, there has been enormous progress in understanding the mechanisms for development of Th2-biased responses after inhaled exposure to allergens and the characteristics of CD4 + T cells prominently involved in this process. Recently, a new population of T cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. iNKT cells are one of the most potent immune modulators through a massive production of a various cytokines including IL-4 and IFN-γ upon activation, and are involved in a variety of immunoregulations including infection, autoimmunity, and tumor surveillance. The potent pathogenic role of iNKT cells in the development of bronchial asthma is due to their ability to produce predominant Th2 cytokines in a given condition. The involvement of iNKT cells in the pathogenesis of asthma might have been underestimated in the past studies demonstrating the involvement of CD4 + T cells in asthma because of the difficulty in the detection of iNKT cells. Meanwhile, growing evidences have demonstrated that iNKT cells could be a promising target for immune-based therapies for autoimmune diseases, tumor, and infection due to the invariance of their TCR usage, the restriction to the evolutionally-conserved non-polymorphic antigen-presenting molecule CD1d, and their outstanding ability to produce both Th1- and Th2-cytokines. In this review, we will overview current understanding of the pathophysiological roles of iNKT cells in asthma. We would also discuss on possible therapeutic approaches to bronchial asthma employing glycolipid ligands for iNKT cells.",

Airway remodeling model mice were made by ovalbumin (OA) sensitization and inhalation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial biopsy were performed. Cell migration was assessed by the Boyden's chamber technique. The collagen content of lung tissue was measured using ELISA. The chemotactic activity in lung fibroblasts toward the mouse BAL fluid (BALF) was significantly increased in OA-inhaled mice. Total soluble collagen content was significantly increased in OA-inhaled mice. We observed markedly increased collagen deposition around the airway wall in OA-inhaled mice, which was not shown in saline-inhaled mice. Furthermore, fibronectin in the BALF of OA-inhaled mice was significantly higher than that in the control mice. The total soluble collagen content increased during the fibrotic change of airway remodeling in asthma. Furthermore, migration of fibroblasts may play a key role in this remodeling process, and fibronectin and type I and IV collagen seem to be chemotactic factors for the fibroblasts.",

After inhalation, the mice were tracheostomized and placed in a body box under controlled ventilation to measure airway resistance before and after acetylcholine inhalation. Administration of procaterol at a clinical dose equivalent did not augment airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation of the airway wall, or subsequent airway wall thickening induced by OVA inhalation. BALF cell analysis revealed that the eosinophil number in the BALF was significantly reduced in procaterol-treated mice compared to untreated mice.

There have been few studies that evaluate the cross reactivity with penicillin or other beta-lactams in subjects with primary hypersensitivity to cephalosporins. This clinical scenario emphasizes the need of more studies on cephalosporin allergy in particular as shown by this case of sequential non-IgE mediated cephalosporin induced TEN reaction pursuant by an IgE mediated penicillin allergy.",

    "abstract": "CC chemokines have been shown to play an important role in inducing selective recruitment of inflammatory cells into local allergic inflammatory sites. CC chemokines are also known as histamine releasing factors. We previously showed that histamine enhances transcription of CC chemokines from nasal mucosa which leads to further induction of histamine release. This cyclic cascade may cause prolonged allergic inflammation. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between histamine and CC chemokine production by using human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) and to examine the potential of H1 receptor (H1R) antagonists in new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of nasal allergy.HNECs were isolated from the nasal turbinates of patients diagnosed with nasal allergy. HNEC monolayers were cultured for 48 hours with or without histamine (10(-3) to 10(-5) mol/L). Furthermore, an H1R antagonist, either carebastine or olopatadine, was added to the supernatant (10(-3) to 10(-7) mol/L) 30 minutes before incubation with histamine. The expression of Regulated on Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in the culture media were measured by ELISA.The release of RANTES and MCP-1 was significantly upregulated by histamine compared with the control group. Both carebastine and olopatadine inhibited the release of CC chemokine production to the control level in both groups.This study suggests that the interaction between histamine and CC chemokines may prolong allergic inflammation in human nasal mucosa. We also demonstrate the potential use of H1R antagonists in new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of nasal allergy through inhibiting this histamine-CC chemokine interaction.",

Generally, a food-specific IgE is not detected, and FPIES may be caused by inadvertent exposure to allergenic foods. The patient in our case was a male infant in whom vomiting had been induced by ingestion of a cow's milk-based formula and bloody diarrhea had been caused by ingestion of breast milk during the neonatal period. Accidental ingestion of a new and extensively hydrolyzed casein/whey formula, MA-mi, caused watery diarrhea at 8 months of age, and FPIES was diagnosed based on these symptoms. In antigen-specific lymphocyte stimulation tests, New MA-1 was negative, but MA-mi and cow's milk antigens were positive. The only causative antigens were derived from cow's milk, and the symptoms were not induced by another extensively hydrolyzed casein formula, New MA-1. The patient grew and developed normally thereafter, and no symptoms were induced by solid food during the course of the condition. MA-mi is likely to be used increasingly for allergic infants, but it is not necessarily a substitute for other hydrolyzed milk formulae in all cases, and care should be taken regarding its use and possible misuse.",

In addition, the numbers of alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes in BALF increased significantly in the sensitized Hdc-/- mice with OVA inhalation compared to the wild-type mice under the same conditions. The concentrations of Interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13, Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-2 in the BALF all increased significantly in both groups compared to those exposed to saline. In particular, the concentration of TNF-α in the Hdc-/- mice exposed to OVA was significantly higher than that in the wild-type mice under the same conditions. The mRNA levels of Gob-5 and MUC5AC, and the ratio of the goblet cells in the airway epithelium significantly increased in Hdc-/- mice exposed to OVA compared to wild-type mice. These results suggested that histamine may play a regulatory role in goblet cell hyperplasia in allergic airway inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Lactobacillus gasseri OLL2809 strongly stimulates the production of interleukin (IL)-12 (p70) by innate immune cells. Thus, it is expected to ameliorate allergic diseases. We investigated whether the oral administration of heat-killed L. gasseri OLL2809 suppressed eosinophilia in cedar pollen antigen-challenged mice.BALB/c mice sensitized with Japanese cedar pollen extract were intraperitoneally challenged with the same extract. The mice were orally given heat-killed L. gasseri OLL2809 at doses of 0.5, 1, or 2mg/day throughout the experimental period (21 d). After 24 hours of the challenge, the eosinophil number and cytokine levels in the peritoneal lavage fluid and the serum antigen-specific IgG levels were determined.On administering varying amounts of heat-killed L. gasseri OLL2809, the number of eosinophils among the total number of cells was significantly reduced in all groups. In addition, the eosinophil number significantly decreased, and the eosinophil-suppression rate significantly increased by 44% in the 2-mg group. Although the serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a and IgG1 levels were not affected, the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio increased significantly in the 2-mg group compared with that of the control group. Furthermore, the administration of heat-killed L. gasseri OLL2809 resulted in the induction of IL-2 and reduction in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels in peritoneal lavage fluid.We demonstrated that the oral administration of heat-killed L. gasseri OLL2809 suppresses eosinophilia via the modulation of Th1/Th2 balance. These observations suggested that heat-killed L. gasseri OLL2809 might potentially ameliorate the increased number of eosinophils in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis.",

    "abstract": "Goblet cell hyperplasia with mucus hypersecretion contribute to increased morbidity and mortality in bronchial asthma. We have reported that thioredoxin 1 (TRX1), a redox (reduction/oxidation)-active protein acting as a strong antioxidant, inhibits pulmonary eosinophilic inflammation and production of chemokines and Th2 cytokines in the lungs, thus decreasing airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and airway remodeling in mouse asthma models. In the present study, we investigated whether endogenous or exogenous TRX1 inhibits goblet cell hyperplasia in a mouse asthma model involving chronic exposure to antigen.We used wild-type Balb/c mice and Balb/c background human TRX1-transgenic mice constitutively overproducing human TRX1 protein in the lungs. Mice were sensitized 7 times (days 0 to 12) and then challenged 9 times with ovalbumin (OVA) (days 19 to 45). Every second day from days 18 to 44 (14 times) or days 35 to 45 (6 times), Balb/c mice were treated with 40 microg recombinant human TRX1 (rhTRX1) protein. Goblet cells in the lungs were examined quantitatively on day 34 or 45.Goblet cell hyperplasia was significantly prevented in TRX1-transgenic mice in comparison with TRX1 transgene-negative mice. rhTRX1 administration during OVA challenge (days 18 to 44) significantly inhibited goblet cell hyperplasia in OVA-sensitized and -challenged wild-type mice. Moreover, rhTRX1 administration after the establishment of goblet cell hyperplasia (days 35 to 45) also significantly ameliorated goblet cell hyperplasia in OVA-sensitized and -challenged wild-type mice.Our results suggest that TRX1 prevents the development of goblet cell hyperplasia, and also ameliorates established goblet cell hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "30–80% of outgrown asthma subjects develop symptoms again later in life. We investigated inflammation and function of lower airway in adolescents with former asthma. 326 never-smoking young adults (mean age 24.0 years) were interviewed with special emphasis on history of asthma. Diagnosis of asthma was based on GINA guidelines. Former asthma subjects consisted of ones with a history of physician-diagnosed childhood asthma, who had been free of asthma symptoms without the use of medication for at least 10 years prior to the study. Provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (PC20) and eosinophil percentage in induced sputum were measured. 31 subjects were former asthma subjects (FBA), 11 subjects were current asthma subjects (CBA) and 284 subjects had no history of asthma (non-BA). PC20 and FEV1/FVC ratio were significantly lower in the FBA group than in the non-BA group (P < 0.01). Maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMF) was significantly lower in the FBA group than in the non-BA group (P < 0.05). Sputum eosinophil percentage was significantly increased in the FBA group compared with the non-BA group (P < 0.01). PC20 was significantly lower in the CBA group than in the FBA and non-BA groups (P < 0.01). FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and MMF were significantly lower in the CBA group than in the FBA group (P < 0.05, P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively) and the non-BA group (P < 0.01, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Sputum eosinophils were significantly higher in the CBA group than in the FBA and non-BA groups (P < 0.01). This study shows that subjects with long-term outgrown asthma continue to have airway eosinophilic inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and airway narrowing.",

This study set out to analyze whether unknown proteins that bind to IgE antibodies in serum from patients with egg allergy exist in egg white.Diluted egg white proteins were separated by 2-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis. Immunolabeling was performed on individual patient sera from 19 child patients with egg white allergy and 11 negative control subjects. Spots of egg white proteins that bound to the patients' IgE were identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics.Egg white proteins were separated into 63 spots. Twenty-five of the 63 reacted with egg allergy patients' sera, and 10 of the 25 reactive spots showed IgE-reactivity to controls as well. Specific bindings to the IgE from egg allergy patients were found in 15 spots; one of which was confirmed as ovotransferrin. Among the other 14 protein spots, egg white cystatin and lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) were newly identified proteins that reacted with IgE in patients with egg allergy.We demonstrated that L-PGDS and cystatin reacted with serum IgE in patients with egg allergy. Our proteomics-based analysis in egg white gives a comprehensive map of proteins bound with IgE and should assist in enabling more accurate diagnoses and recommendations of desensitizing treatments for individual patients.",

The goal of this investigation is to make an indirect comparison between loratadine, an oral antihistamine available over-the-counter (OTC) in the USA, and the more modern antihistamine levocetirizine. Only double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) studies involving monotherapy with the active substances levocetirizine and loratadine were included in the meta-analysis. The medical databases EMBASE and Medline were searched systematically for all relevant studies completed by the end of 2009. Only DBPC studies conducted in normal environmental settings were included. Furthermore, the Jadad scale was used to guarantee the quality of the studies involved. The “standardized mean difference” (SMD) method was applied for calculating the study-specific effects to neutralize the variability between studies. The results of a total of seven published DBPC studies met all criteria for inclusion in meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that levocetirizine was significantly more effective than loratadine in improving the total symptom score (TSS) (p < 0.01). The effect sizes were calculated as − 0.59 (95% confidence interval − 0.89, − 0.29) for levocetirizine and − 0.21 (95% confidence interval − 0.31, − 0.1) for loratadine when compared to placebo. The results of this meta-analysis illustrate greater effectiveness for treatment with the active substance levocetirizine as monotherapy in reducing allergic symptoms when compared to treatment with loratadine.",

    "abstract": "Direct contact of food proteins with eczematous lesions is thought to be the main cause of epicutaneous sensitization. To further investigate the development and pathogenesis of food allergy in vivo, a good mouse model of epicutaneous sensitization is needed. However, a fundamental problem in that regard is that the optimal age for epicutaneous sensitization of mice is unknown. In this study, we attempted to elucidate that optimal age.Dorsal skin of wild-type BALB/c female mice (1, 3, 8 and 24 weeks old) was shaved, depilated and tape-stripped. A Finn chamber containing a 20-μl-aliquot of 20-mg/ml (OVA) was applied to the tape-stripped skin on 3 consecutive days/week, for 3 weeks. The body temperature was measured after intraperitoneal OVA challenge. Serum OVA-specific IgE titers and OVA-induced cytokine production by spleen cells were measured by ELISA. Dendritic cells (DCs) that migrated to the draining lymph nodes were quantified by FITC-labeled OVA and flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels in the dorsal skin were measured by qPCR.A significant age-dependent body temperature decline was observed after OVA challenge. The serum OVA-specific IgE titer, OVA-induced cytokine production (i.e., IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) by spleen cells, and number of FITC-OVA-engulfing DCs increased with age. In addition, mRNA for IL-33, but not TSLP or IL-25, was significantly induced in the skin by tape-stripping and increased with age.Twenty-four-week-old mice showed the greatest DC migration, Th2 polarization, IgE production and body temperature decline. Skin-derived IL-33 is likely to play key roles in those changes.",

The predictive power of a model of parenting stress was examined using multiple regression analysis (stepwise), with parenting stress (PSI-SF) as the dependent variable, and children's demographics, including characteristics of AD; parents' demographics; QoL of families of children with AD (JCMV-CADIS); and family functioning (FAI) as independent variables. We handled missing values using a multiple imputation method.The pooled coefficients obtained from the multiple regression analysis after multiple imputation indicated that \"family cohesion,\" \"family system flexibility,\" \"emotions related to social factors\" and \"occupation of mother\" determined parenting stress. Lower family cohesion and family system flexibility predicted higher parenting stress. The high impact of \"emotions related to social factors\" on families' QoL predicted higher parenting stress. Full-time work by mothers predicted lower parenting stress.The current results reveal that \"family cohesion,\" \"family system flexibility,\" \"emotions related to social factors\" and \"full-time work by mothers\" predicted parenting stress of mothers who had children with AD.",

Sixteen cases of active non-IgE-mediated infantile gastrointestinal milk allergy, diagnosed by food elimination tests and oral food challenge tests (OFCTs) (group A), 15 cases of acute viral gastroenteritis (AGE) (group B), and 15 controls (group C) were enrolled. 1) B-mode abdominal ultrasound findings, 2) laboratory allergic data including eosinophil counts (Eos), serum IgE, and the antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation test (ALPT) against milk protein, and 3) vessel density (VD) indirectly quantified by gastrointestinal Doppler flow at jejunum, ileum, and sigmoid colonic mucosae were evaluated and compared among the groups. In the small intestine, wall thickening, dilation, mesenteric thickening, and poor peristalsis were found in 100%, 62.5%, 93.7%, and 100%, respectively, in group A.

The present study was aimed at identifying and characterizing additional allergens from sapodilla.Allergic subjects were identified by case history, skin prick test (SPT) and allergen-specific IgE. Sapodilla extract was fractionated using SP-Sepharose into 3 components (SP1, SP2 and SP3) which were analyzed by native/SDS-PAGE, IgE-immunoblot, isoelectric focusing (IEF) and N-terminal sequencing. The conserved regions of plant TLPs and the N-terminal sequence were used to design primers for PCR.SPT and ELISA confirmed a subject with oral allergy syndrome (OAS) to sapodilla and custard apple. Two proteins (26.9 and 24.5kDa; reducing conditions) were detected as allergens, of which the latter in SP2 has already been identified as basic TLP (TLP 2). The 26.9kDa protein present in SP1 was identified as an acidic TLP based on native PAGE, IEF and N-terminal sequencing. Presence of a basic β-1,3-glucanase in SP3 was inferred by zymography. Sequence analysis of the genomic clone of the acidic TLP gene revealed that it is intronless and non-glycosylated. Evolutionary relatedness to olive, grape and kiwi fruit allergenic TLPs were inferred by phylogenetic analysis.An acidic TLP (TLP 1) was identified as a new allergen in sapodilla. TLP 1 is a single polypeptide (207 residues) belonging to the thaumatin family of the GH64-TLP-SF superfamily. Clinically, sapodilla should be considered in the list of fruits causing OAS.",

To elucidate the effects of heparin on allergic inflammation, we examined the in vivo effects of heparin on antigen-induced mucus hypersecretion and infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils in the nasal epithelium of sensitized rats. We induced hypertrophic and metaplastic changes of goblet cells in the nasal epithelium of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized rats by intranasal challenge with OVA. The effects of intranasal instillation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; 1–1000 IU/0.1 ml) on mucus production and eosinophil/neutrophil infiltration were examined. Intranasal instillation with low-dose LMWH (1–10 IU/0.1 ml) at 30 minutes before OVA instillation stimulated OVA-induced mucus production in the nasal epithelium of sensitized rats, whereas treatment with 100 IU/0.1 ml LMWH showed no effect. Intranasal instillation with high-dose LMWH (1000 IU/0.1 ml) significantly inhibited OVA-induced mucus production. Intranasal instillation with LMWH (1–1000 IU/0.1 ml) dose-dependently inhibited eosinophil and neutrophil infiltration into the rat nasal mucosa. These results indicate that heparin inhibits mucus hypersecretion and infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils in allergic inflammation, though the inhibitory effect against mucus production is obtained in high-dose heparin. Intranasal instillation with high-dose heparin may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of nasal allergic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) and Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP) are common chronically allergic diseases associated with the activation of T-helper 2 cells. Recent studies have shown that polymorphisms in the genes for IL-4 receptor α chain (IL4RA) may contribute to susceptibility of AD and JCP, although the differences in the involvements of loci of IL4RA gene between AD and JCP are unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of polymorphisms in IL-4RA gene in conferring susceptibility to the development of AD and/or JCP using a family analysis and an association analysis in a Japanese population. Five polymorphisms in the IL-4RA gene, C-3223 T, T-1914C, T-890C, Ile50Val and Glu375Ala, have been genotyped using PCR-based methods in 75 trios families, including 15 AD families, 30 JCP families, and 30 families with combination of AD and JCP in the family analysis. Forty-five AD, 60 JCP and 125 control children constituted the association study. The transmission disequilibrium test showed that the allele of Ile50 was significantly transmitted to children with JCP alone (p < 0.05). Haplotype analysis showed that the -3223 T/Ile50 haplotype was preferentially transmitted to both AD (p < 0.01) and JCP children (p < 0.01), while that the C-3223/Ile50 haplotype was preferentially transmitted to only JCP children (p < 0.01). The association study showed that -3223 T and haplotype of -3223 T/Ile50 were associated with aD children, but not with JCP. Ile50 was associated with both AD and JCP. Our data suggest that -3223 T and the -3223 T/Ile50 haplotype were risk factors for AD. Ile50 allele seems to be involved in both JCP and AD. Interactions of the IL-4RA loci may play a role both conferring susceptibility and modulating severity of AD.",

    "abstract": "The 2006 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA 2006) guidelines emphasize the importance of evaluating the control rather than the severity of asthma. The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is well known to be an excellent tool for evaluating asthma control in the clinical setting. This study aimed to evaluate the ACT, Japanese version (ACT-J) as a predictor of asthma control as defined by the GINA 2006 guidelines in actual clinical practice.A cross-sectional analysis comparing the ACT-J score and GINA classification of asthma control among 419 patients of primary care physicians and specialists was performed using the data from a 2010 questionnaire-based survey conducted by the Niigata Asthma Treatment Study Group.The optimal cut-off point of the ACT-J score for predicting GINA-defined asthma control was 23, with ACT-J scores of ≥23 and ≤22 predicting controlled and uncontrolled asthma with area under the receiver operating characteristics curve values of 0.76 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72-0.81] and 0.93 [95% CI: 0.900.97], respectively.ACT scores of ≥23 and ≤22 are useful for identifying patients with controlled and uncontrolled asthma, respectively, as defined by GINA 2006, and the latter is more strongly predictive than the former. The reason for the higher cut-off point of the ACT-J relative to other versions of the ACT is unclear and warrants further investigation.",

Two goals of prophylactic treatment of pollinosis are use of fewer types of drugs and delay of onset of symptoms and impairement of QOL. Therefore, this study was performed to determine if pranlukast, a LTRA, met these goals in treatment of pollinosis. Pranlukast or placebo was administered to patients who visited our hospital immediately before the start of Japanese cedar pollen dispersal. The study was performed for 4 weeks as a double blind randomized trial. Subsequently, all patients were given pranlukast for a further 4 weeks from the peak until the end of pollen dispersal. The incidence of symptoms and use of concomitant drugs were investigated from daily nasal allergy records kept by patients. QOL was evaluated using the JRQLQ questionnaire. In the double blind period of the study, the percentage of patients who used concomitant drugs for nasal symptoms was significantly lower in the pranlukast group compared to the placebo group. Development of nasal symptoms (sneezing, runny nose and nasal congestion) and disturbance of daily activities were significantly delayed in the pranlukast group. No serious adverse reactions occurred in the pranlukast group and no patient withdrew from treatment with pranlukast. Pranlukast is effective for prophylactic treatment of pollinosis.",

This study was designed to determine whether S1P causes adherence of eosinophils to pulmonary endothelial cells via enhancement of adhesion molecule expression. Expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in human pulmonary microvasucular endothelial cells (HPMVECs). The number of adherent eosinophils to HPMVECs was calculated according to adhesion assay. Pre-treatment of HPMVECs with S1P increased mRNA and protein expression of VCAM-1, in contrast, did not dramatically increase those expression of ICAM-1. The maximal expression of these adhesion molecules in mRNA and protein was observed 4 and 8 h after exposure to S1P, respectively. Pre-treatment with S1P also activated RhoA, a monomeric G protein; the ability of S1P to enhance the expression of VCAM-1 was attenuated by RhoA related inhibitors such as Y-27632, C3 exoenzyme, and GGTI-286. The effects of S1P on VCAM-1 were attenuated by pre-incubation with pertussis toxin, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gi, a heterotrimeric G protein. After HPMVECs were treated with S1P, adhesion of human eosinophilic leukemic cell line (EoL-1) cells to HPMVECs was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. Augmented adherence of EoL-1 cells by S1P was also attenuated by Y-27632 and pertussis toxin. S1P causes adherence of eosinophils to pulmonary endothelium via RhoA activation. S1P may act as a lipid mediator in asthma. The RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway may be a therapeutic target for preventing eosinophil infiltration to the airway.",

In ECRS, nasal polyps recur immediately after endoscopic sinus surgery. The molecular biological mechanism underlying the refractoriness of ECRS is unclear.Whole-transcriptome analysis with next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted to investigate the molecular biological mechanism of ECRS. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to validate the results of RNA-seq.RNA-seq analysis revealed that in the nasal polyps of ECRS, the levels of 3 transcripts were elevated significantly and those of 7 transcripts were diminished significantly. Among the genes encoding these transcripts, TRPV3 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 3) was identified as the only gene that is highly expressed in ECRS nasal polyps but this gene's expression was not previously detected using DNA microarray analysis in peripheral blood eosinophils. TRPV3 is newly identified here as a gene transcribed in ECRS. Our analysis also revealed that TRPV3 was highly expressed in the infiltrating eosinophils and mucosal epithelium of the nasal polyps of ECRS, and further that the more severe the refractoriness was after surgery, the higher the TRPV3 expression was in nasal polyps.TRPV3 might play a role in the refractoriness of ECRS. Additional studies are required to evaluate the function of TRPV3 in ECRS.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a heterogeneous disorder that significantly affects daily activity, work productivity, sleep, learning, and quality of life in all generations. Japanese cedar (JC) pollen is the most common allergen responsible for the development of AR in Japan. AR caused by JC pollen is considered to be a multifactorial inheritance disease that is caused by both environmental and genetic factors. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Human Leukocyte Antigen-DPB1 (HLA-DPB1) is associated with JC sensitization/pollinosis. Subjects in the present study were 544 students at the University of Tsukuba from 2013 to 2015. PCR-SSOP was performed to determine each individual's HLA-DPB1 alleles. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine relationships between JC-related phenotypes and alleles/amino acid polymorphisms of HLA-DPB1. HLA-DPB1*02 allele were significantly associated with both JC sensitization/pollinosis (q < 0.05). Furthermore, HLA-DPB1*02:01 and HLA-DPB1*02:02 had a protective tendency for JC sensitization/pollinosis, and HLA-DPB1*05:01 had a susceptible tendency for sensitization (P < 0.05). In amino acid polymorphism analyses, Glutamic acid in position 69, Glycine-Glycine-Proline-Methionine in positions 84–87, Threonine in position 170 and Methionine in position 205 were also observed to have a protective tendency for JC sensitization (P < 0.05). Amino acid positions 69 and 84–87 were located in binding pocket 5 and 1 of HLA-DPβ1, respectively. Amino acid changes in the allergen-binding pocket of HLA-DPβ1 are likely to influence pollinosis/sensitization to the allergenic peptide of JC pollen and determine the pollinosis risk for each individual exposed to JC pollen.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has suggested that the innate immune response may play a role in the development of eosinophilic airway inflammation. We previously reported that uric acid (UA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), two important damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), activate eosinophil functions, suggesting that these molecules may be involved in the development of eosinophilic airway inflammation. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of DAMPs including UA and ATP in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with eosinophilic pneumonia (EP). BAL was performed in patients with EP including acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonia, and sarcoidosis. UA, ATP, and cytokine concentrations in the BALF were then measured. The UA concentration was increased in the BALF of EP patients. UA concentrations correlated with eosinophil numbers, and with eosinophil-derived neurotoxin and interleukin (IL)-5 concentrations. Furthermore, the ATP concentration was increased in the BALF of EP patients and ATP concentrations correlated with UA concentrations. Moreover, IL-33 was increased in EP patients and IL-33 concentrations correlated with UA and ATP concentrations. The UA and ATP concentration was increased in the BALF of EP patients. UA concentrations correlated with eosinophil numbers, and with ATP and IL-33 concentrations. Our findings suggest that DAMPs such as UA and ATP play a role in the pathogenesis of EP.",

Therefore, we administered an OFC using cooked PR to evaluate PR- and SR-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and allergic reactions in patients with PR sensitivity. This retrospective study evaluating patient characteristics and responses to OFCs was conducted with 10–20 g of cooked PR, between April 2006 and November 2016. We assessed 51 patients (median age: 6.8 years). All had PR sensitization, 6 (12%) with a history of immediate reactions to PR, and 18 (35%) of immediate reactions to SR. Median PR-specific and SR-specific IgE values were 3.4 kUA/L and 9.9 kUA/L, respectively. Seven patients (14%) had a positive OFC. There was no anaphylaxis. Induced symptoms were mild and included localized urticaria, throat pruritus, intermittent cough, and mild abdominal pain. We treated one patient with mild abdominal pain with oral antihistamines. There were no significant differences in history of immediate reaction to PR and PR-specific IgE titers between OFC-positive and OFC-negative patients, although significant differences were found for PR-specific IgE titers adjusted for SR-specific IgE (p = 0.025) and PR-specific IgE/SR-specific IgE ratio (p = 0.009). Increased PR-specific IgE/SR-specific IgE ratio or PR-specific IgE levels adjusted for SR-specific IgE levels were risk factors for OFC positivity.",

Antigen-induced NHR and changes in antigen-specific T cells in the NALT were investigated in OVA-specific Th2 cell-transferred mice.Dex significantly suppressed antigen-induced NHR, inflammatory cell infiltration, and IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13 expression in immunized mice. Chl was completely ineffective, and only IL-13 expression was suppressed by Mk. None of these drugs affected IgE and IgG production. Antigen-induced NHR and the increase in antigen-specific T cells in the NALT of Th2 cell-transferred mice were inhibited by Dex, but not by Mk or Chl.Steroids are effective for the reduction of NHR in AR by suppressing the accumulation of inflammatory cells, especially antigen-specific T cells.",

We analyzed BALF samples from 39 patients (19 BRHP and 20 other ILDs) and serum samples from 25 consecutive patients (20 BRHP and 5 other ILDs) who underwent the IPT.A significant increase of neutrophils was observed in the BALF from the BRHP patients following the IPT. Neutrophil chemoattractants, namely, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, and CXCL2 significantly increased in both the serum and BALF of the BRHP patients after the IPT. Serum IFN-γ and CXCL10, cytokines/chemokines that contributed to Th1 inflammation, were also significantly increased in BRHP following the IPT.This study demonstrated the exposure to the causative antigen provoked acute neutrophilic and Th1 immunologic responses similar to acute HP even in the chronic phase of HP.",

Regarding the histamine release activity of purified IgG from patients with CSU, the number of examined patients has been small. Thus, we sought to determine the prevalence and FcεRI crosslinking ability of these AAbs in a large number of patients with CSU and non-atopic control (NC) subjects.We compared the concentrations of anti-IgE and anti-FcεRIα AAbs and the abilities of these AAbs to cause FcεRI aggregation in patients with CSU (n = 134) and NC subjects (n = 55) using ELISA and an in vitro elicitation test, respectively.The concentration of anti-IgE AAbs was significantly different between the NC subjects and the CSU patients (P < 0.0001, cutoff value: 0.558 μg/mL), whereas the concentration of anti-FcεRIα AAbs was not. A significant difference in the duration of illness was noted between patients with lower and those with higher concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs relative to the cutoff value. The abilities of anti-IgE AAbs, but not anti-FcεRIα AAbs, to induce FcεRI crosslinking were significantly higher in CSU patients than in NC subjects (P = 0.0106).In the Japanese population of CSU patients studied, the ability of the anti-IgE AAbs to induce FcεRI crosslinking differed significantly between NC subjects and CSU patients, suggesting the involvement of anti-IgE AAbs in the pathogenesis of CSU in the Japanese population.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized by unpredictable, recurring and painful swelling episodes that can be disabling or even life-threatening. Awareness of HAE has progressively grown worldwide, and options for treatment of acute attacks and prevention of future attacks continue to expand; however, unmet needs in diagnosis and treatment remain. In Japan, recognition of HAE within the medical community remains low, and numerous obstacles complicate diagnosis and access to treatment. Importance of timely treatment of HAE attacks with on-demand therapies is continually demonstrated; recommended agents per the WAO/EAACI treatment guidelines published in 2018 include C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate, ecallantide, and icatibant. In Japan, multiple factors contribute to delayed HAE treatment (potentially leading to life-threatening consequences), including difficulties in finding facilities at which C1-INH agents are readily available. Recognition of challenges faced in Japan can help promote efforts to address current needs and expand access to effective therapies. Icatibant, a potent, selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, has demonstrated inhibition of various bradykinin-induced biological effects in preclinical studies and has shown efficacy in treating attacks in various clinical settings (e.g. clinical trials, real-world studies), and HAE patient populations (e.g. with C1-INH deficiency, normal C1-INH). Icatibant was approved in Japan for the treatment of HAE attacks in September 2018; its addition to the HAE treatment armamentarium contributes to improved patient care. In Japan, disease awareness and education campaigns are warranted to further advance the management of HAE patients in light of the unmet needs and the emerging availability of modern diagnostic approaches and therapies.",

    "abstract": "Global studies on asthma point to socioeconomic status as one of the main variables in terms of prevalence and disease severity in various parts of the world. Social factors related to community violence have been linked to higher incidence of asthma in the current studies. This study investigates the relationship between indicators of both community violence and development and hospital admissions due to asthma.This was an analytical ecological study of multiple groups, using public databases with information up until 2006. All Brazilian municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants were considered as units of analysis. The main index used as socioeconomic indicator was the FIRJAN Index of Municipal Development (FIMD). The Index of Youth Vulnerability to Violence (IYVV) was used as indicators of community violence. The rate of admissions due to asthma was used as the outcome. Pearson's correlation was used for multivariate analyses. The coefficient of determination (R(2)) was calculated and the simple linear regression model adjusted for significant correlations.There was an inverse correlation between asthma admissions and FIMD (r = -0.354, p < 0.001), with statistical significance for all dimensions of the index. Admissions due to asthma were associated with the IYVV (r = 0.240, p < 0.001) and its component related to school attendance and employment (r = 0.315, p < 0.001), homicides (r = 0.112, p = 0.034), and poverty (r = 0.303, p < 0.001).There was a direct correlation between indicators of violence and rates of admission due asthma, and an inverse correlation with indicators of development. These results suggest that social detriment can act as a risk factor for hospital admissions due to asthma.",

In the present study, we aim to dissect the spatiotemporal differences in the roles of IL-23 in an epicutaneously-sensitized asthma model of mice. C57BL/6 mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) by patch application on the skin, followed by airway exposure to aerosolized OVA. During sensitization and/or challenge phase, either a specific neutralizing antibody (Ab) against IL-23 or control IgG was injected intraperitoneally. On days 1 and 8 after the final OVA exposure, airway inflammation and responsiveness to methacholine, immunoglobulin levels in serum, and cytokine release from splenocytes were evaluated. Skin Il23a mRNA levels were evaluated with quantitative RT-PCR. Patch application time-dependently increased the expression of Il23a mRNA expression in the skin. Treatment with the anti-IL-23 Ab during sensitization phase alone significantly reduced the number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and peribronchial spaces after allergen challenge compared with treatment with control IgG. Anti-IL-23 Ab also reduced serum levels of OVA-specific IgG1. In contrast, treatment with the anti-IL-23 Ab during the challenge phase alone rather exacerbated airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine with little effects on airway eosinophilia or serum IgG1 levels. IL-23 expressed in the skin during the sensitization phase plays an essential role in the development of allergic phenotypes, whereas IL-23 in the airways during the challenge phase suppresses airway hy- perresponsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Inhalation studies suggested \"protective\" roles of exogenous prostaglandin E2, but the clinical relevance of endogenous prostanoids in asthma is poorly known. The objective of this study is to measure sputum levels of prostanoids in asthmatic patients to correlate with clinical indices. Mild (n = 41) or moderate-to-severe (19) asthmatics and 27 normal controls were examined for pulmonary function (FEV1 and mid-forced expiratory flow), sputum cell differentials, and sputum levels of prostaglandins D2, E2, F2α, and thromboxane B2 measured by sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Each prostanoid level did not differ among the three groups. Sputum number of bronchial epithelial cells was greater in moderate-to-severe asthmatics than in the other two groups, suggesting epithelial desquamation. Levels of prostaglandin F2α, D2, and thromboxane B2 positively correlated with the severity of airflow obstruction in the 60 asthmatic patients, whereas prostaglandin E2 levels were unrelated to pulmonary function. The ratio of combined \"contractile\" prostanoids (prostaglandin D2/prostaglandin F2α/thromboxane B2) to prostaglandin E2 was 2.5-fold greater in moderate-to-severe asthmatics than in controls (p = 0.001) or in mild asthmatics (p = 0.0002) but did not differ between the latter two groups. In the two asthmatic groups combined, this ratio positively correlated with the sputum number of epithelial cells. The combined \"contractile\" prostanoids levels positively correlated with prostaglandin E2 levels in controls and in mild asthmatics but not in moderate-to-severe asthmatics. An imbalance in production, breakdown, or both between prostaglandin E2 and other prostanoids possibly due to epithelial damage may be involved in the pathogenesis of moderate-to-severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is reported to promote airway remodeling in asthmatics, which is the main histological change that causes complex and severe symptoms in asthmatics. However, little is known about whether EMT also plays a role in acute exacerbations of asthma evoked by respiratory tract infections.A human lung adenocarcinoma line, A549, was incubated with TGF-β1 at 10 ng/ml to induce EMT. Then the cells were stimulated with CpG ODN. Expression of surface and intracellular molecules was analyzed by flow cytometry. IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 in the culture supernatant were measured by Cytometric Bead Assay, and the expression of mRNA was quantitated by real-time PCR. CpG ODN uptake was analyzed by flow cytometry.The culture supernatant levels of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 and the expression of mRNA for these cytokines in CpG ODN-stimulated A549 cells that had undergone EMT was significantly higher compared to those that had not. Addition of ODN H154, a TLR9-inhibiting DNA, significantly suppressed the CpG ODN-induced production of those cytokines. However, flow cytometry found the level of TLR9 expression to be slightly lower in A549 cells that had undergone EMT compared to those that had not. On the other hand, CpG ODN uptake was increased in cells that had undergone EMT.EMT induction of A549 cells enhanced CpG ODN uptake and CpG ODN-induced production of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1. These results suggest that EMT plays an important role in exacerbation in asthmatics with airway remodeling by enhancing sensitivity to extrinsic pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Background: We previously showed that the proportion of patients with both high serum periostin and YKL-40 levels was significantly higher in asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) than in asthma or COPD (Odds ratio, 2.59: JACI Pract 2019). In this study, we hypothesised that using serum eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) instead of periostin would be useful to identify ACO. Aims: To assess the usefulness of combined assessment of serum EDN and YKL-40 in identifying ACO. Methods: Subjects included Japanese patients with asthma (n = 177), ACO (n = 115), or COPD (n = 61). Serum EDN, YKL-40, and total IgE, blood eosinophils, and FeNO were measured and compared among the patients. Results: Serum EDN was higher in ACO than in asthma or COPD, whereas serum YKL-40 was higher in both COPD and ACO than in asthma (Figure 1A). Serum EDN levels weakly correlated with serum YKL-40 levels in COPD, but not in asthma and ACO. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that higher eosinophil counts and higher YKL-40 levels were significantly associated with higher EDN levels. Based on cutoff values derived by ROC analysis (EDN: 23.0 ng/mL; YKL-40: 61.3 ng/mL), patients were classified into high or low groups. The proportion of patients with both high serum EDN and YKL-40 levels was significantly higher in ACO than in asthma or COPD (odds ratio, 3.85 (95% CI, 2.35-6.36); p Conclusions: Combined assessment of serum EDN, rather than periostin, and YKL-40 may identify ACO.",

    "abstract": "The pollen grains of several plant species contain 1,3-β-D-glucan (BG). BG activates dendritic cells (DCs) and subsequently regulates the innate immune responses. Within Japan, the most common disease associated with type-I hypersensitivity is Japanese cedar pollinosis. However, the role of BG in Japanese cedar pollen (JCP) remains unclear. This study examined the localization and immunological effects of BG in JCP. The localization of BG in JCP grain was determined by immunohistochemical staining using a soluble dectin-1 protein probe and a BG recognition protein (BGRP). The content of BG extracted from JCP was measured by a BGRP-based ELISA-like assay. The cytokine production by bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) obtained from wild-type and BG receptor (dectin-1) knock-out mice was examined in vitro. The mice were intranasally administered JCP grains and the specific serum Ig levels were then quantified. BG was detected in the exine and cell wall of the generative cell and tube cell of the JCP grain. Moreover, BG in the exine stimulated production of TNF-α and IL-6 in the BMDCs via a dectin-1-dependent mechanism. Meanwhile, JCP-specific IgE and IgG were detected in the serum of wild-type mice that had been intranasally administered with JCP grains. These mice also exhibited significantly enhanced sneezing behavior. However, dectin-1 knock-out mice exhibited significantly lower JCP-specific IgE and IgG levels compared to wild-type mice. Latent BG in JCP can act as an adjuvant to induce JCP-specific antibody production via dectin-1.",

However, there have been no disease-specific patient-reported outcomes (PROs) available in Japan to measure disease activity and health-related QoL impairment in such patients.Japanese versions of the Angioedema Activity Score (AAS) and the Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL) were examined for their validity and reliability. By using these questionnaires, the relationship between disease activity and QoL impairment among the Japanese population of RecAE were analyzed in real-world setting.The Japanese AAS and AE-QoL domains showed good internal consistency of 0.967 and > 0.835. For known group validity, AAS28 and AE-QoL total scores were higher in more severe patients than those with milder disease and QoL impairment, respectively. AAS28 showed strong correlation with indexes of disease activity, while the AE-QoL total score correlated with Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Sufficient reproductivity of the AAS and AE-QoL was shown by their intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.890 and 0.700. The Japanese population is characterized by the total score of AAS28, 34.3 ± 38.8 (mean ± SD); and AE-QoL, 38.7 ± 25.2. Each domain score of AE-QoL was 32.4 ± 29.7 in \"Functioning\", 35.0 ± 27.8 in \"Fatigue/mood\", 50.7 ± 30.6 in \"Fears/shame\", or 24.7 ± 29.8 in \"Food\". Changes in AAS28 and AE-QoL positively correlated to Patient global assessment of disease activity and DLQI, respectively.The Japanese AAS and AE-QoL are valid and reliable instruments for Japanese patients with RecAE, and active disease affecting QoL. They help assess disease activity and QoL of RecAE in routine patient care and clinical trials.",

Our review revealed that cow's milk OFC was able to avoid the complete elimination of cow's milk in 66% of the patients with cow's milk allergy. We also found that adverse events occurred frequently (50.5%).This analysis supports the recommendation of conducting cow's milk OFC to avoid complete elimination of cow's milk, however the test should be conducted with careful consideration of the patient's safety. As the methods of OFC and subjects varied among the articles selected in this study, further studies are needed to obtain higher quality evidence.",

    "abstract": "IgE-mediated egg allergy is a common food allergy worldwide. Patients with egg allergy are known to easily achieve tolerance compared to other allergens such as nuts. Oral food challenge (OFC) is often performed on patients diagnosed with or suspected of having IgE-mediated food allergy, but whether hen's egg OFC is useful in IgE-dependent egg allergy patients to avoid complete elimination remains unknown. We identified articles in which OFCs were performed in Japanese patients diagnosed with or suspected of having IgE-mediated egg allergy. We evaluated whether the OFCs were useful to avoid the complete elimination of eggs by assessing the following: (1) the number of patients who could avoid complete elimination; (2) the number of patients who experienced serious adverse events (SAEs); or (3) adverse events (AEs); (4) improvement in quality of life (QOL); and (5) immunological changes. Fifty-nine articles were selected in the study; all the references were case series or case studies in which OFC was compared to pre-challenge conditions. The overall negative ratio against egg OFC was 62.7%, but an additional 71.9% of OFC-positive patients could take eggs when expanded to partial elimination. Of the 4182 cases, 1146 showed AEs in the OFC, and two cases reached an SAE. Two reports showed an improvement in QOL and immunological changes, although the evidence was weak. OFCs against eggs may be useful to avoid complete elimination, but medical professionals should proceed with the test safely and carefully.",

    "abstract": "Non-esophageal eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (non-EoE EGIDs) are chronic inflammatory disorders with massive infiltration of eosinophils into the gastrointestinal tract. Food elimination diets are potentially effective treatments. But the existing dietary therapies have various weak points. We developed a new regimen to compensate for the shortcomings of the elemental diet and 6-food elimination diet. The new regimen consists of an amino-acid-based formula, potatoes, vegetables, fruits and restricted seasonings. We named it the \"Rainbow Elimination Diet (ED).\" The aims of this study were to evaluate the tolerability and safety of this diet.A retrospective medical record examination was conducted at the National Center for Child Health and Development covering the period from January 2010 through December 2018. The medical records of patients (age 2-17 y) with histologically diagnosed non-EoE EGIDs were reviewed. The tolerability, nutritional intake, symptoms, and blood test findings were evaluated.Nineteen patients were offered several kinds of food-elimination diets. Seven patients (eosinophilic gastritis: 5; gastroenteritis: 1; duodenitis: 1) were treated with Rainbow ED. Six patients were compliant with this diet. The median duration of the diet induction phase was 15 days (range 14-30). All 5 patients who had had symptoms just before the induction phase became symptom-free. The body weight decreased in 5 patients (median -0.6 kg), probably because the serum protein increased, resulting in reduced edema. All 5 patients with hypoproteinemia had elevated serum albumin (median 2.9-3.5 g/dL). The ingested nutritional elements were calculated, and most of them were sufficient, except for fat and selenium.The Rainbow ED was well-tolerated and safe for pediatric non-EoE EGIDs.",

    "abstract": "Although paranasal sinuses are one of the most representative organs affected by eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), they have not been studied sufficiently. The aim of this study was to compare computed tomography (CT) findings in paranasal sinuses of EGPA with those of other eosinophilic sinus diseases and elucidate the clinical relevance of their severity.CT findings of paranasal sinuses in EGPA patients prior to therapeutic intervention (n = 30) were evaluated using the Lund-Mackay staging (LMS) system and compared with those of three control diseases [(NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD), aspirin-tolerant asthma, and eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis without asthma (ECRS)]. We divided EGPA patients into three groups based on their LMS scores and examined their association with disease manifestation.Total scores of the LMS system in EGPA were significantly lower than those of N-ERD and ECRS without asthma. There was a large variation in total LMS scores in EGPA, suggesting considerable heterogeneity of their sinus lesions. Although EGPA with low LMS system scores showed only minor findings in maxillary and anterior ethmoid regions, those with high LMS system scores were characterized by high scores in the ostiomeatal complex. However, the frequencies of patients with a Five-Factor Score ≥2 and with cardiac involvement were significantly higher for EGPA with low LMS system scores.Although paranasal sinus lesions in EGPA were less severe than those of other eosinophilic sinus diseases, their milder CT findings may be associated with a higher frequency of extra-respiratory organ involvement.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are pathogenic fungi that infect the human respiratory system and cause life-threatening pulmonary cryptococcosis. The immunopathology of cryptococcosis is completely different from that of other fungal allergies. In murine cryptococcal infection models, cryptococcal cells are usually injected via nasal or intratracheal routes. After the infection, the alveolar epithelial cells are impaired and release IL-33, an IL-1 family cytokine that functions as an alarmin. This cytokine detrimentally amplifies allergic responses, and also induces a protective immune response against parasitic infection. In the pulmonary cryptococcosis model, type-II alveolar epithelial cells are the major source of IL-33, and the alveolar epithelial cells, ILC2, and Th2 cells express the IL-33 receptor (ST2). In IL-33- or ST2-deficient mice, allergy-like immune responses are attenuated after the C. neoformans infection. The numbers of ILC2 and Th2 cells and the levels of type 2 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, are decreased in the mouse lungs in both models. In association with these changes, total blood IgE, bronchus mucus production, and the number of eosinophils are decreased. Conversely, lung neutrophils and M1-type macrophages are increased. These are protective immune subsets suppressing cryptococcal growth. As a result, the lung fungal burden of IL-33- and ST2-deficient mice is decreased post-infection, and both deficient mice show significantly improved mortality. This pathogenesis varies depending on the cryptococcal and murine strains used in the animal experiments. Here, we overview and discuss the itmmunopathology of the IL-33/ST2 axis in a murine lethal cryptococcal infection model.",

    "abstract": "Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergies (non-IgE-GIFAs) seem to be increasing rapidly worldwide. However, nationwide studies have been limited to food-protein-induced enterocolitis (FPIES) and food-protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), with little attention to other non-IgE-GIFA subgroups. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical features of all patients with non-IgE-GIFAs, not just certain subgroups. We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey of non-IgE-GIFAs in Japan from April 2015 through March 2016. A questionnaire was sent to hospitals and clinics throughout Japan. The questionnaire asked about the number of physician-diagnosed non-IgE-GIFA patients, the status of fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria, tentative classification into 4 clusters based on the initial symptoms, the day of onset after birth, complications, and the suspected offending food(s). The response rate to that questionnaire was 67.6% from hospitals and 47.4% from clinics. Analyses were conducted about \"diagnosis-probable\" patient cohort (n = 402) and the \"diagnosis-confirmed\" patients (n = 80). In half of the reported non-IgE-GIFA patients, onset occurred in the neonatal period. The patients were evenly distributed among 4 non-IgE-GIFA clusters. In Cluster 1, with symptoms of vomiting and bloody stool, the onset showed a median of 7 days after birth, which was the earliest among the clusters. Cow's milk was the most common causative food. In half of the patients, the onset of non-IgE-GIFAs was in the neonatal period. This highlights the importance of studying the pathogenesis in the fetal and neonatal periods.",

Owing to the high prevalence and early onset of hay fever and pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS), a safer and simpler treatment method than conventional AIT is needed. To develop a local nasal immunotherapy using an ointment containing hypoallergenic pollen and assess its efficacy in mice and healthy humans. Hypoallergenicity was achieved by combining pollen and galactomannan through the Maillard reaction to create birch pollen-galactomannan conjugate (BP-GMC). The binding of galactomannan to Bet v 1 was confirmed using electrophoresis and Western blotting (WB). Binding of specific IgE antibodies to BP-GMC was verified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and basophil activation test (BAT). The localization of BP-GMC absorption was confirmed using a BALB/c mouse model. BP-GMC mixed with white petrolatum was intranasally administered to 10 healthy individuals (active drugs, 8; placebo, 2) for 14 days. In electrophoresis and WB, no 17-kDa band was observed. In ELISA and BAT, BP-GMC did not react to specific IgE but was bound to IgA and IgG. In the mouse model, BP-GMC was detected in nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissues. In the active drug group, the salivary-specific IgA level significantly increased on day 15 (p = 0.0299), while the serum-specific IgG level significantly increased on day 85 (p = 0.0006). The BP-GMC ointment rapidly produced antagonistic antibodies against IgE; it is safe and easy to use and might serve as a therapeutic antigen for hay fever and PFAS.",

    "abstract": "Adults with food-protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) often develop severe abdominal symptoms after eating seafood. However, no investigation of a food elimination strategy for adult FPIES patients has been performed to date. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of seafood–avoidant adults by telephone interview, based on the diagnostic criteria for adult FPIES reported by González et al. We compared the clinical profiles, abdominal symptoms, and causative seafoods between FPIES and immediate-type food allergy (IgE-mediated FA) patients. We also profiled the detailed intake-status of seafoods in adult FPIES patients. Twenty-two (18.8 %) of 117 adults with seafood-allergy were diagnosed with FPIES. Compared with the IgE-mediated FA patients, FPIES patients had an older age of onset, more pre-existing gastrointestinal and atopic diseases, more episodes, longer latency and duration of symptoms, more nausea, abdominal distention, and severe abdominal pain, and more frequent vomiting and diarrhea. In particular, abdominal distention—reflecting intestinal edema and luminal fluid retention—may be the most distinctive characteristic symptom in adult FPIES (p < 0.001). Bivalves, especially oysters, were the most common cause of FPIES. Strikingly, intake-status profiling revealed that many FPIES patients can safely ingest an average of 92.6 % of seafood species other than the causative species. There are many differentiators between FPIES and IgE-mediated FA, which may reflect differences in the underlying immunological mechanisms. Although seafood FPIES is unlikely to induce tolerance, many patients can ingest a wide variety of seafood species after a long period from onset.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a persistent inflammatory disease of various endotypes, including eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), which is characterized by marked eosinophilic infiltration and high refractory rates despite treatment. Recent findings suggest the interaction between local IgE and mast cells in nasal polyps (NPs) is key to eCRS pathogenesis; however, the details remain unclear. This study investigated the involvement of MS4A2, a component of the IgE receptor, in the pathogenesis of refractory eCRS. NP tissue samples were collected from 47 patients with eCRS who underwent sinus surgery and classified into refractory and nonrefractory groups based on postoperative outcomes. Quantitative PCR was used to analyze the mRNA expression of IgE receptor components (MS4A2, FCER1A, and FCER1G) and cell-specific markers (CLC, TPSAB1, and GPR56) in NP tissues. Immunofluorescence staining was used to confirm MS4A2 expression and colocalization with tryptase, ProMBP1, and IgE. ROC analysis was conducted to assess MS4A2 mRNA levels as a predictor of refractory eCRS. MS4A2 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the refractory group, whereas FCER1A and FCER1G mRNA expression levels showed no significant differences. Immunofluorescence revealed an increased number of MS4A2-positive cells, particularly those colocalized with tryptase-positive mast cells, in the refractory group. Cells coexpressing MS4A2 and IgE were more prevalent in this group. ROC analysis indicated that MS4A2 mRNA expression can predict prognosis with high specificity. Our findings suggest the significance of the interaction between MS4A2-expressing mast cells and local IgE in the pathogenesis of refractory eCRS, highlighting MS4A2 as a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Food allergy (FA) is a growing global concern, which contributes significantly to anaphylaxis and severe allergic reactions. Despite advancements in treatments like allergen immunotherapy and biologics, current approaches have notable limitations and there is a pressing need for new therapeutic strategies. Recent research into taste receptors has unveiled their potential role in FA, offering fresh perspectives for understanding and managing this condition. Taste receptors, particularly type 1 taste receptors (TAS1Rs/T1Rs, sweet taste receptors) and type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs/T2Rs, bitter taste receptors), are distributed not only in the oral cavity but also in various extra-oral tissues, and their interactions with immune responses are increasingly recognized. This review highlights the connections between taste receptors and FA, exploring how taste receptor mechanisms might contribute to FA pathogenesis and treatment. Taste receptors, especially TAS2Rs, which include multiple subtypes with varying ligand specificities, have been implicated in modulating allergic responses and could serve as targets for novel FA therapies. Additionally, compounds such as bitter agents and sweeteners that interact with taste receptors show promise in influencing FA outcomes. This review emphasizes the need for further research into the mechanisms of taste receptor involvement in FA and suggests that targeting these receptors could provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention in the future.",

Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of YTHDF1 in the AD mouse model was evaluated for its therapeutic potential. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the YTHDF1 mRNA level in the skin lesions of AD was significantly higher than that in healthy people. YTHDF1 expression was significantly elevated in AD skin lesions, the DNCB-induced AD mouse model, and primary human keratinocytes and HaCaT cells stimulated with interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13, compared to controls. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that upregulation of YTHDF1 in AD exacerbated cell proliferation and inhibited keratinization by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, which was modulated via the IL-4/IL-13/STAT3 axis. Moreover, topical application of AAV-YTHDF1 significantly improved AD-like lesions in the mouse model. This study identifies YTHDF1 as a contributor to AD pathogenesis by influencing keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. It also suggests that YTHDF1 could be a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Many children with egg allergies experience aversion, which hinders reintroduction after a negative oral food challenge (OFC). We aimed to assess factors associated with egg aversion in children after negative egg OFCs. We conducted a multicenter questionnaire survey between January and December 2018 and retrospectively collected background data from the medical records. Children aged 3-18 years with a history of an immediate reaction to eggs more than 6 months after a negative OFC to half of a heated whole egg were included. We defined \"aversion\" as a dislike of eating eggs or processed egg products. We included 140 children (median age: 6.7 years) who passed OFCs at the median age of 3.3 years and had a median specific-IgE (sIgE) to egg white of 10.0 kUA/L. Overall, 57 (41 %) children had an egg aversion. \"Disliking the food texture or taste\" (61 %) was the most frequent reason for an aversion. The associated factor in the multivariate analysis was older age during a negative OFC (adjusted odds ratio: 1.24, 95 % confidence interval: 1.04-1.49). The aversion frequency depended on the type of cooking methods, where 68 % had an aversion to boiled egg whites, and less than 5 % had an aversion to egg-containing deep-fried chicken. About half of the children after negative OFC had an egg aversion, and it was associated with older age during negative OFC. Careful follow-up and guidance with consideration of less aversive cooking methods are important in older age groups.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the structural and functional basis of this cross-reactivity and its contribution to the co-sensitization to tree nuts often observed in peanut-allergic subjects. Six convergent antibodies, targeting the immunodominant Ara h 2-DPYSPS motif-associated sequence, and their reverted germline version, were produced as human IgG1 and IgE. Antibody specificity to natural and recombinant peanut and tree nut allergens and allergen-derived peptides was evaluated using ELISA, immunoblotting, inhibition tests, and basophil activation assays. The six antibodies showed reactivity to Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and weak reactivity to tree nut legumins, especially from almond, walnut and Brazil nut. The germline antibody exclusively recognized Ara h 2. Basophils sensitized with the individual antibodies were activated by Ara h 2 at a concentration of 10 ng/ml and at 100-fold higher concentrations by Ara h 1 and Ara h 3, but not by tree nut legumins. The three Ara h 1- and two Ara h 3-derived antibody-binding peptides, with one from each group previously identified as immunodominant, are in close proximity and may contribute to conformational epitopes. The biological activity of affinity-matured cross-reactive antibodies with Ara h 2-associated sequence convergence may explain the high allergenic potency of peanut and clinically irrelevant co-sensitizations to tree nuts commonly observed in peanut-allergic patients.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity of asthma requires a personalized therapeutic approach. However, objective measurements, such as spirometry and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) for implementing treatable traits approach, are limited in low- and middle-income countries and non-specialist settings. To implement precision medicine even with minimal resources, we developed an algorithm using unsupervised machine learning techniques that estimates key treatable traits (airflow limitation, type 2 [T2] inflammation, and frequent exacerbations) based on an asthma patient-reported outcome (PRO). We applied hierarchical clustering and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-5 including five residual symptoms from two asthma cohorts (the discovery cohort with 1697 patients and validation cohort with 157 patients). We identified five symptom clusters, characterized by key treatable traits: Cluster 1, minimal asthma symptoms; Cluster 2, a little symptom, mild airflow limitation; Cluster 3, predominant shortness of breath and wheezes, airflow limitation; Cluster 4, predominant morning symptoms and nocturnal awakening, T2 inflammation; and Cluster 5, all symptoms severe, airflow limitation, T2 inflammation and frequent exacerbations. The UMAP projections of ACQ-5 (five-dimensional) to two-dimensions allowed to visualize datapoints and clusters, which visually revealed that patients with poorly-controlled asthma were divided into Clusters 3, 4 and 5. These results were externally validated in an independent cohort. Based on asthma PRO data, the developed algorithm categorized asthma patients into five symptom-based subtypes that provide insights into key treatable traits. Our data-driven digital health approach will extend precision medicine of asthma to medical facilities even in resource-constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "There have been few epidemiological surveys regarding adult anaphylaxis in Japan. The aim of the study is to investigate the current condition in the diagnosis and management of adult anaphylaxis in Japan. An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted among physicians who belong to the Japanese Society for Cutaneous Immunology and Allergy and the Japanese Allergology Society, via cloud-based software. A 24-item questionnaire focused on the implementation of diagnostics and management of anaphylaxis, especially in adults. There were 537 departments that treated anaphylaxis, including 243 pediatrics, 156 dermatology, 124 internal medicine, and 14 allergy departments. Of the group, 362 departments treated adult patients with anaphylaxis, with 149 dermatology being the most common, followed by114 internal medicine, 85 pediatrics and 14 allergy departments. Big prefectures such as Tokyo have the most facilities. However, in terms of population ratio, it became clear that there was not necessarily more coverage in large cities. For anaphylaxis due to foods, specific IgE measurements were the most frequently performed at more than 90 % of all four departments, whereas skin tests and challenge tests were performed less than the IgE measurements at 56.9 % and 35.1 %, respectively. As for the reasons for not performing them, a lack of manpower was mostly cited, followed by lack of preparation for anaphylaxis before testing, unfamiliarity with testing methods, and low or no medical fees. The survey revealed the uneven geographical distribution of medical departments and the chief barriers for implementation of the examination in adult anaphylaxis.",

Although biologics have been used to treat EOM, their efficacy based on clinical characteristics remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of biologics and analyzed the clinical factors that influenced outcomes. We retrospectively studied 29 patients with EOM treated with either mepolizumab or dupilumab as an adjunct to standard therapy, which included intratympanic instillation of triamcinolone. Clinical efficacy was assessed by severity scores, temporal bone computed tomography scores, and pure-tone audiometry. The control group comprised 15 patients with EOM who did not receive biologics. We also analyzed the correlations between changes in severity score from baseline and clinical factors for each patient. Both biologics groups had significantly lower severity scores at 6 months, with sustained effects until 12 months. The patients with severe middle ear mucosal changes and high baseline severity scores experienced significant improvement with the use of dupilumab; mepolizumab was more effective in elderly patients. Temporal bone computed tomography scores improved in both biologics groups, indicating inflammation resolution in the whole temporal bone. No deterioration of bone-conduction hearing levels was observed in any group. Mepolizumab and dupilumab showed efficacy for EOM, with therapeutic effects evident within 6 months. Dupilumab is preferable for patients with severe mucosal changes, whereas mepolizumab may benefit elderly patients. Further studies are needed to refine treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "For over 100 years, the association of eosinophils with bronchial asthma has been known. Over the past 20 years, the proteins comprising the eosinophil granule have been isolated and characterized. Four proteins are recognized and termed the major basic protein (MBP), the eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), and the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). The activities of these proteins are reviewed with emphasis on their abilities to interact with structures in the bronchus and to reproduce features of the pathology of bronchial asthma. In addition, the relationship of these proteins to bronchial hyperreactivity, a major stigma of bronchial asthma, is discussed, and information highlighting the role of MBP is reviewed. Evidence also exists that eosinophil granule proteins may interact with the nervous system, and results showing increased vagal reactivity in an experimental animal model and the role of MBP as an allosteric muscarinic M2 receptor are presented. Finally, the effects of eosinophil granule proteins as cytostimulants on other cells including basophils, mast cells, neutrophils, platelets and alveolar macrophages are reviewed. Overall, these results indicate that eosinophil granule proteins have many abilities to alter lung function in asthma and to reproduce many of the cardinal manifestations of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation and the recruitment of inflammatory cells, typically eosinophils and lymphocytes, into the airway. Although several chemical mediators are released during the inflammatory process of asthma, evidence strongly suggests that the cysteinyl leukotrienes (LT), LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, play key roles in asthma. The short-term clinical efficacy of an LT receptor antagonist, pranlukast hydrate, in symptomatic patients with asthma who had already been treated with moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids was therefore investigated. Treatment with pranlukast hydrate for 4 weeks significantly improved respiratory function and decreased asthma symptoms, the rescue use of inhaled β2-agonists, the number of peripheral blood eosinophils and serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein. Furthermore, airway inflammation, as evaluated by the percentage of eosinophils in induced sputum and airway responsiveness to histamine, decreased significantly after treatment. There were no significant changes in these parameters in control patients with asthma whose treatment was not changed over 4 weeks. These preliminary results suggest that pranlukast hydrate, an LT receptor antagonist, is an effective agent in the management of asthma in combination with moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a second prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) receptor, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2), was identified. Because PGD2 was reported to have chemotactic activity on eosinophils, CRTH2 expressed on eosinophils attracted interest as a receptor associated with eosinophil migration to, and accumulation at, inflammatory sites. To elucidate the mechanism regulating the expression of CRTH2 on eosinophils, the effects of PGD2, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and interferon (IFN)-γ on CRTH2 expression were investigated. Blood eosinophils were purified using Percoll and anti-CD16 antibody coated magnetic beads. Eosinophils were incubated with PGD2 and/or IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-γ. The expression of CRTH2 on eosinophils was measured using a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). Prostaglandin D2 and IL-5, but not IL-4 and IFN-γ, downregulated the expression of CRTH2 on eosinophils. Furthermore, PGD2- and IL-5-induced downregulation of CRTH2 on human eosinophils was inhibited by phenylarsine oxide, a receptor internalization inhibitor. These results suggest that PGD2 and IL-5 regulate CRTH2 expression on eosinophils through CRTH2 internalization. The decreased expression of CRTH2 on tissue eosinophils may make these cells remain at the site of allergic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "In this review we discuss the potential of a new procedure, termed Bronchial Thermoplasty to prevent serious consequences resulting from excessive airway narrowing. The most important factor in minimizing an asthmatic attack is limiting the degree of smooth muscle shortening. The premise that airway smooth muscle can be either inactivated or obliterated without any long-term alteration of other lung tissues, and that airway function will remain normal, albeit with reduced bronchoconstriction, has now been demonstrated in dogs, a subset of normal subjects, and mild asthmatics. Bronchial Thermoplasty may thus develop into a useful clinical procedure to effectively impair the ability for airway smooth muscle to reach the levels of pathologic narrowing that characterizes an asthma attack. It may also enable more successful treatment of asthma patients who are unresponsive to more conventional therapies. Whether this will remain stable for the lifetime of the patient still remains to be determined, but at the present time, there are no indications that the smooth muscle contractility will return. This successful preliminary experience showing that Bronchial Thermoplasty could be safely performed in patients with asthma has led to an ongoing clinical trial at a number of sites in Europe and North America designed to examine the effectiveness of this procedure in subjects with moderately severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "In this review we discuss the role of dendritic cells (DC) in the pathogenesis of allergic contact hypersensitivity (ACH) and atopic disorders, such as asthma and atopic eczema. In ACH patients, DC recognize the invasion of simple chemicals such as haptens, and trigger antigen-specific T cell responses leading to the characteristic histological and clinical changes such as spongiosis and papulovesicular eruptions. During atopic disorders, it is well known that the Th2-deviated immune response plays a crucial role in their pathogenesis. DC provide T cells with antigen and costimulatory signals (signals 1 and 2, respectively), as well as with a polarizing signal (signal 3). When studying ACH, it is important to understand how simple chemicals induce the activation of DC and their migration to the draining lymph nodes where they supply signals 1 and 2 to naïve T cells. The mechanisms by which DC induce the Th2-deviated immune response, namely via the Th2-deviated signal 3, are central topics in the pathogenesis of atopic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Guidelines and literature debate the importance of testing for bronchial reversibility and its total significance is unclear. Clinically, patients with greater reversibility have higher fluctuations in respiratory symptoms, and hence may have a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). On the other hand, they may have a better HRQoL as medications may be more effective in this population. Presently, there are no reports concerning the relationship between HRQoL as an indicator of therapy and reversibility. We hypothesized that the reversibility of airflow limitation might be correlated with the HRQoL in COPD. We examined 63 subjects with COPD (mean age: 71.7 years). Reversibility was measured by the change in FEV1 and FVC after the inhalation of salbutamol (300 μg), and we investigated the relationship between the reversibility and the parameters of HRQoL, which included St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Visual analogue scale-8 (VAS-8), Short-Form 36-Item Health Study, Basic activities of daily living, Instrumental activities of daily living, and the Oxygen cost diagram. Post-bronchodilator FEV1, % predicted was positively correlated with both the total scores of SGRQ and VAS-8 (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.006, respectively). Furthermore, the reversibility of FVC was positively correlated with all items of the SGRQ, except for impact (total score: p < 0.02; symptoms: p < 0.02; activity, p < 0.05; total score of VAS-8: p < 0.02). However, the reversibility of FEV1 was neither correlated with the total score nor any items in the scales. Those who have FVC that respond to bronchodilator at rest might result in an improvement of HRQoL after treatment.",

Cry-consensus peptide is a recombinant polypeptide containing six major human T-cell epitopes derived from both Cry j 1 and Cry j 2, two major allergens of Japanese cedar pollen. We examined the effect of Cry-consensus peptide on an allergic rhinitis model in B10.S mice, which have one common T-cell epitope in the Cry-consensus peptide. B10.S mice were sensitized with Cry j 1/alum, then the Cry-consensus peptide was administered subcutaneously once a week for 5 weeks from the last sensitization. Histamine was dropped in both nostrils (10 μL per nostril) of each mouse on the day before continuous intranasal instillation of Cry j 1. Soon after the final challenge with Cry j 1, the mice were observed for 5 minutes for the resulting number of sneezes. In addition, serum levels of Cry j 1-specific IgE and IgG2a antibody, eosinophil infiltration in nasal tissue, and Cry j 1- specific cytokine production from splenocytes were evaluated. Cry-consensus peptide markedly inhibited Cry j 1-induced sneezes, eosinophil infiltration, and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activity in nasal tissue. Cry-consensus peptide inhibited the production of anti-Cry j 1 IgE (Th2-mediated) and significantly enhanced anti-Cry j 1 IgG2a (Th1-mediated). In cytokine production from splenocytes, Cry-consensus peptide significantly decreased in IL-4/IFN-γ and IL-5/IFN-γ ratios. It was concluded that Cry-consensus peptide effectively controlled allergic responses, which results from shifting from a Th2-dominated to a Th1-dominated immune response.",

Recent studies have shown that allergen exposure during very early pregnancy increases bronchial hypersensitivity in offspring in a murine model of bronchial asthma. However, no such phenomena were reported in humans. In the present study, the role of epigenetic control in the onset of allergic diseases was investigated. A total of 400 pairs of mothers with physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis (AR) and their offspring (age 7-18 months) who participated in a large-scale medical check-up were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Family history of allergic diseases and the presence or absence of AR symptoms during pregnancy were inquired about using a self-answered questionnaire. A logistic regression model adjusted for age, gender, birth month and father's history of allergic diseases was statistically analyzed. Offspring whose mothers had any AR symptoms during early pregnancy showed a significantly higher adjusted odds ratio for the onset of AR in offspring than those whose mothers had no symptoms during pregnancy (adjusted Odds Ratio: 6.26, p = 0.036). However, the symptoms of AR during late pregnancy showed no effects on the odds ratio. In contrast, the presence or absence of AR symptoms during early or late pregnancy showed no association with the prevalence of food allergy, atopic dermatitis or asthma in offspring. Conclusions: Our results suggest the presence of possible epigenetic mechanisms regulating the onset of AR in humans presumably through increased organ-specific hypersensitivity.",

While forest walking is a common form of recreation for Japanese people, it has been unclear whether forest walkers with JCP still choose to visit forested areas during the pollen season or whether they avoid those areas, and as such, the aim of this study was to investigate this question.The study participants were all healthy men and women volunteers aged 20 years or over who visited the Tokyo University Forest in Chiba during 4 different days. The survey was conducted using self-administered questionnaires.The number of available responses was 498. Of these, 112 participants who experienced JCP were included in the analysis. Seventy-three participants (65.2%) responded that they visit forests even during the pollen season. The association between forest walking choices during the pollen season and self-rated levels of pollinosis symptoms was not statistically significant (Cramer's V = 0.13, p = 0.47). As many as 60% of the participants who reported serious symptom levels responded that they visit forested areas even during the pollen season.These results revealed that two thirds of forest walkers who had experienced JCP visited forests even during the pollen season. This indicates the further need for public service announcements informing people with JCP that the risk of pollen exposure and subsequent JCP reaction is increased by visiting forested areas during the pollen season.",

    "abstract": "Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f) is one of the most frequently implicated allergens in several allergic diseases. Several genome-wide screens have identified a linkage between chromosome 6p21 and mite-specific IgE responsiveness. Butyrophilin-like 2 (BTNL2) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and, on the basis of its homology to B7-1, has been implicated as a costimulatory molecule involved in T-cell activation. BTNL2 resides in the HLA region on chromosome 6p21, and significant associations between BTNL2 gene polymorphisms and several inflammatory diseases have been reported.The aim of this study was to examine whether BTNL2 gene polymorphisms are associated with specific IgE responses to Der f.Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 2 coding SNPs and 1 intron SNP, were studied. One of the coding SNPs was the rs2076530 A > G, which has a functional consequence. A total of 863 unrelated Japanese subjects (447 positive and 416 negative for IgE to Der f) were recruited for a case-control study.Controlling for gender, age, smoking, and the presence of asthma, multiple logistic regression analyses showed that homozygosity of the rs2076530 A allele, which has been reported to be a risk allele for sarcoidosis, was associated with a risk of sensitization towards Der f (Odds ratio; 1.55, p = 0.0060).Although an association which may be due to the linkage disequilibrium with other genes in 6p21 needs to be ruled out, the present findings suggest that the BTNL2 gene might be one of the candidate genes that is responsible for the pathogenesis of Der f-specific IgE responsiveness.",

In this study we investigated the role of ST in leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) non-responders with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma before initiating corticosteroids inhalation therapy.This was a prospective open-level clinical trial. LTRAs was given to 41 patients with asthma for 4 weeks and clinical efficacy was assessed using daily symptom scores. The 10 patients, aged 2.5-8.5 years, who failed to show clinical improvement, were defined as LTRA non-responders. After a 1-week washout period, the efficacy of ST was investigated and compared with LTRA non-responders for the following 4 weeks.LTRA non-responders showed a significant improvement in the average symptom score, peak expiratory flow, use of rescue medication and the proportion of symptom-free days with ST therapy.ST is a good choice for patients who have failed to respond to LTRAs. ST should therefore be added to the list of treatment options for such patients.",

This study evaluated the 24-h bronchodilatory efficacy and safety of indacaterol in Japanese patients with COPD. This Phase-II, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study comprised four double-blind, single-dose treatment periods (washout between periods: 14-28 days). Japanese patients aged 40-75 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomised to receive single doses of indacaterol (150, 300, or 600 μg) or placebo via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler. Efficacy (primary endpoint: standardised FEV1AUC22 -24h) and safety were assessed for 24 h post-dose in each treatment period. Of the 50 patients randomised (92% male; mean age, 67.2 years), 45 completed the study. Standardised FEV1AUC22 -24h was significantly higher for all indacaterol doses as compared with placebo, with clinically relevant differences of 130, 160, and 170 mL for 150, 300, and 600 μg, respectively (P < 0.001). The improvement in FEV1 was seen as early as 5 min post-dose with indacaterol and sustained for 24 h (P < 0.001 vs placebo at all time points). All indacaterol doses were well tolerated and showed no clinically meaningful effect on pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, and laboratory parameters when compared with placebo. In the Japanese COPD population studied, single doses of indacaterol (150, 300, and 600 μg) provided sustained 24-h bronchodilation, with onset of action within 5 min post-dose. All doses were well tolerated. These results are consistent with data from Caucasian populations.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major respiratory pathogen which causes bronchiolitis with dyspnea and wheezing in children less than 2 years old. RSV bronchiolitis in infancy severe enough to cause hospitalization might be a risk factor for allergic sensitization and bronchial asthma in future. However, the pathophysiology behind this development has not been clearly characterized. To evaluate the existence of airway inflammation and characteristic of RSV bronchiolitis, we analyzed and compared the concentrations of eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) in nasal fluid and plasma.From 69 infants (aged <2 years) hospitalized for possible lower respiratory tract infections including RSV infection, we collected nasal fluid and plasma and determined the ECP concentrations.ECP concentrations in nasal fluid were significantly higher in patients with wheezing and/or bronchial rales than in patients without them (1733 ± 660 ng/mL vs 680 ± 450 ng/mL, p = 0.018), and those of the respiratory syncitial virus-infected group were significantly higher than those of the uninfected group (p = 0.04). Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in plasma ECP levels between patients with wheezing and patients without wheezing, and no significant difference between RSV-infected and other pathogen-infected patients. There were significant correlations between nasal fluid ECP concentrations and both neutrophil and eosinophil counts in the peripheral blood.Nasal fluid ECP concentrations are increased in infants with lower respiratory infections including RSV infection accompanied with wheezing. ECP probably originates from neutrophils as well as eosinophils migrated into airways. The monitoring of ECP concentration in nasal fluid may be useful for evaluating leukocyte (including eosinophils and neutrophils)-mediated airway inflammation during infancy and its severity.",

Twenty days after sensitization, animals were subjected to mild restraint stress for 3 hours, and plasma levels of IFN-gamma, IL-10, and IgE were measured. We analyzed the incidence of sneezing and nasal rubbing in the sensitized animals.Plasma levels of IL-10 and IgE increased in the sensitized animals with a concomitant increase in the incidence of sneezing and nasal rubbing. The increases in plasma IgE, IL-10 and the incidence of sneezing and nasal rubbing were suppressed by restraint stress. Adrenalectomy increased IFN-gamma, inhibited the increase in plasma IL-10 and IgE, and suppressed the incidence of sneezing. In contrast, hypophysectomy increased plasma levels of IL-10, IFN-gamma, and IgE and the incidence of sneezing. Intraperitoneal administration of ACTH decreased IL-10 in plasma but increased IFN-gamma and suppressed the incidence of nasal rubbing.The present findings show that the HPA-axis and ACTH play important roles in the regulation of plasma cytokines and IgE thereby modulating symptoms of pollinosis. The results also suggest that a mild restraint stress suppresses the increase in Th2-dependent cytokines and IgE to reduce the symptoms of pollinosis.",

    "abstract": "The concept of \"atopic march\" has been well appreciated both by physicians and by dermatologists; eczema (atopic dermatitis) often precedes the development of airway diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis in atopic subjects. However, the underlying mechanisms for atopic march are less elucidated. It has been conceived that genetic susceptibility to atopy determines the phenotype of allergic diseases progressive from the skin to the airways, but recent discovery of filaggrin gene mutations that disturb the barrier function of the skin in patients with asthma and eczema now suggests the crucial role of epicutaneous sensitization as a precursory event for the development of asthma. In the present review, we describe updated genetic and immunological evidences that suggest the relationship between skin barrier-related molecules and the pathology of asthma.",

In this study, we retrospectively studied the prognosis of acute spontaneous urticaria in relation to age and treatments in a local clinic of dermatology.Out of 5000 patients who visited an office dermatology clinic, clinical records of patients with spontaneous urticaria were extracted. Their prognosis and the relation to age and treatments were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and generalized Wilcoxon test.Among 386 patients diagnosed with spontaneous urticaria, 284 patients (73.6%) began treatments within a week after the onset. Their non-remission rates after one week, four weeks and one year from the onset were 26.8%, 15.0% and 6.7%, respectively. The non-remission rates of patients who were 20-years-old or younger by one year after the onset of urticaria, were significantly lower than those of patients older than 20-years-old. No apparent relationship between remission rates and sex or the use of steroids was detected. However, the non-remission rates of urticaria treated with a standard dose of antihistamine were lower than that treated with additional medications.Most patients who began treatments within one week from the onset remitted quickly. However approximately 7% of them continued to suffer from symptoms for more than a year. Such prolongation tended to be seen among patients who required other medications in addition to a standard dose of antihistamine.",

    "abstract": "Asthma in athlete populations such as Olympic athletes has various pathogeneses. However, few reports are available on the features of asthma in the athlete population in clinical practice. In this study, we focused on classifying asthma in Japanese athlete population.We performed a cluster analysis of data from pulmonary function tests and clinical biomarkers before administering inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) therapy in athlete population of individuals diagnosed with asthma (n = 104; male, 76.9%; median age, 16.0 years), based on respiratory symptoms and positive data on methacholine provocation tests. We also compared backgrounds, sports types, and treatments between clusters.Three clusters were identified. Cluster 1 (32%) comprised athletes with a less atopic phenotype and normal pulmonary function. Cluster 2 (44%) comprised athletes with a less atopic phenotype and lower percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (%FEV1) values, despite less symptomatic state. Cluster 3 (24%) comprised athletes with a strong atopic phenotype such as high eosinophil count in the blood and total serum immunoglobulin E level. After treatment with ICS or ICS plus long-acting β-adrenergic receptor agonist for 6-12 months, %FEV1 values were significantly improved in Cluster 2 athletes, whereas Cluster 3 athletes had a significant decrease in the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide compared to pretreatment values.These data suggest three clusters exist in Japanese athlete population with asthma. Between the clusters, the characteristics differed with regard to symptoms, atopic features, and lower %FEV1 values. The pathogeneses between clusters may vary depending on the inflammation type and airway hyperresponsiveness.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the long-term safety of subcutaneous immunotherapy with TO-204, a standardized house dust mite (HDM) allergen extracts, we conducted a multicenter, open label clinical trial. Japanese patients aged 5–65 years were eligible for the study, if they had HDM-induced allergic rhinitis (AR), allergic bronchial asthma (BA), or both. TO-204 was administered in a dose titration scheme, and the maintenance dose was determined according to the predefined criteria. The treatment period was 52 weeks, and patients who were willing to continue the treatment received TO-204 beyond 52 weeks. This clinical trial is registered at the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center (Japic CTI-121900). Between July 2012 and May 2015, 44 patients (28 with AR and 16 with allergic BA) were enrolled into the study. All patients were included in the analysis. The duration of treatment ranged from 23 to 142 weeks and the median maintenance dose was 200 Japanese allergy units (JAU). Adverse events occurred in 22 patients (50%). The most common adverse event was local reactions related to the injection sites. Four patients experienced anaphylactic reactions when they were treated with the dose of 500 JAU. Two patients experienced anaphylactic shock with the doses of 1000 JAU at onset. These 6 patients could continue the study with dose reduction. Safety profile of TO-204 was acceptable in Japanese patients with HDM-induced AR or allergic BA. Higher doses should be administered carefully, because the risk of anaphylaxis increased at doses of 500 or 1000 JAU.",

Recently, a novel major Japanese cypress pollen allergen, Cha o 3, was discovered. However, whether a Cha o 3 homolog is present in Japanese cedar pollen remains to be determined.Western blot analysis was performed using Cha o 3-specific antiserum. In addition, cloning of the gene encoding Cry j 4 was conducted using total cDNA from the male flower of Japanese cedar trees. Allergen potency and cross-reactivity were investigated using a T-cell proliferation assay, basophil activation test, and ImmunoCAP inhibition assay.A low amount of Cha o 3 homolog protein was detected in Japanese cedar pollen extract. The deduced amino acid sequence of Cry j 4 showed 84% identity to that of Cha o 3. Cross-reactivity between Cry j 4 and Cha o 3 was observed at the T cell and IgE levels.Cry j 4 was discovered as a counterpart allergen of Cha o 3 in Japanese cedar pollen, with a relationship similar to that between Cry j 1-Cha o 1 and Cry j 2-Cha o 2. Our findings also suggest that allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) using Japanese cedar pollen extract does not induce adequate immune tolerance to Cha o 3 due to the low amount of Cry j 4 in Japanese cedar pollen. Therefore, ASIT using Cha o 3 or cypress pollen extract coupled with Japanese cedar pollen extract is required in order to optimally control allergy symptoms during Japanese cypress pollen season.",

    "abstract": "Periostin is a matricellular protein belonging to the fasciclin family, playing a role for the pathogenesis of allergic diseases by binding to integrins on cell surfaces. Serum periostin is elevated in various allergic diseases reflecting type 2 inflammation and tissue remodeling so that for allergic diseases, periostin is expected to be a novel biomarker for diagnosis, assessing severity or prognosis, and predicting responsiveness to treatments. We have previously shown that most serum periostin exists in the oligomeric form by intermolecular disulfide bonds.In this study, we examined how periostin forms a complex in serum, whether the periostin complex in serum is functional, and whether the complex formation interferes with reactivity to anti-periostin Abs.We found that periostin formed a complex with IgA1 at a 1:1 ratio. The periostin in the serum complex contained at least five different isoforms. However, IgA was not essential for the oligomeric formation of periostin in mouse serum or in IgA-lacking serum. The periostin-IgA complex in human serum was functional, sustaining the ability to bind to αVβ3 integrin on cell surfaces. Moreover, periostin formed the complex with IgA broadly, which interferes the binding of the Abs recognizing all of the domains except the R4 domain to periostin.Periostin is a novel member of the IgA-associated molecules. These results are of great potential use to understand the pathological roles of periostin in allergic diseases and, from a practical standpoint, to develop diagnostics or therapeutic agents against periostin.",

Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of asthmatic attacks after enrollment and were matched using propensity scores to evaluate the factors associated with asthma exacerbations and the effect of the exacerbation on QOL.Potential factors associated with asthma exacerbations included high body mass index value, low forced expiratory flow 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF75%), severe rhinitis as determined based on ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma). Although patients with asthma exacerbations had significantly impaired quality of life at baseline as evidenced by the economic aspects, in addition to physical, mental, and social activities, no further reduction with the attacks was observed.This study suggested that higher body mass index (BMI) and severe asthma as well as severe rhinitis were factors associated with asthma exacerbations.

    "abstract": "The correlation between inflammatory cells and airway smooth muscle plays fundamental roles in the pathophysiology of asthma. This study was designed to determine whether pre-exposure of airway smooth muscle to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which is released from mast cells by allergic reactions, causes a deterioration of β-adrenoceptor function. Isometric tension and the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 340 and 380 nm (F340/F380), an indicator of intracellular Ca2 + levels, were simultaneously measured using fura-2 loaded guinea-pig tracheal tissues. Intracellular cAMP levels were also measured. Pre-exposure to S1P caused a reduction in the inhibitory effects of 0.3 μM isoprenaline, a β-adrenoceptor agonist, and 10 μM forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, against 1 μM methacholine-induced contraction in concentration- and time- dependent manners. In contrast, the values of F340/F380 were not augmented under this experimental condition. After incubation with S1P in the presence of 0.001-1 μM Y-27632, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, the reduced responsiveness to forskolin induced by S1P was reversed in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, pre-treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), an inhibitor of Gi, suppressed the loss of forskolin-induced relaxation induced by S1P. Pre-exposure to S1P markedly inhibited the augmentation of cAMP accumulation induced by forskolin. However, addition of Y-27632 and pre-exposure to PTX returned forsokin-induced cAMP accumulation to the control level. Pre-exposure to S1P causes heterologus desensitization of β-adrenoceptors by increasing the sensitivity of airway smooth muscle to intracellular Ca2 +. Ca2 + sensitization regulated by Gi and Rho-kinase is involved in this phenomenon.",

In individual comparisons of BALF samples, the levels of the protein gelsolin and Ig kappa chain C region were significantly higher in the UIP pattern than in the OP pattern. In contrast, the levels of α-1 antitrypsin, CRP, haptoglobin β, and surfactant protein A (isoform number 5) were all significantly higher in the OP pattern than in the UIP pattern. Gelsolin was cleaved into two fragments, a C-terminal half and N-terminal half, and the levels of both were significantly higher in the UIP pattern than in the OP pattern.

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor. Symptoms of HAE include edema, which can potentially cause suffocation. Some patients with HAE exhibit immunological abnormalities, which could prevent an accurate diagnosis. Low levels of complement components are characteristic of HAE and in other settings are thought to reduce elimination of apoptotic cells and immune complex (IC). Thus, we aimed to experimentally clarify the mechanism of immunological abnormalities using sera from HAE patients. Serum samples from 18 patients with HAE were collected when free from angioedema attack and compared with normal human pooled sera (NHPS) from 20 healthy volunteers. Opsonization was measured as the rate of phagocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat cells by macrophages differentiated from THP-1 cells incubated with serum. IC solubilization in serum was analyzed by quantifying peroxidase released from a synthetic IC composed of peroxidase and anti-peroxidase antibodies. Anti-C1q antibody levels were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serological immunological abnormalities were detected in 12 patients. Opsonization in serum samples from each patient with HAE was lower than that in NHPS (∼20% versus 70%, respectively). The rate of IC solubilization was lower in serum from HAE patients than NHPS. Some patients had high serum anti-C1q antibody levels with increased serum IC levels. Sera from patients with HAE exhibit anti-C1q antibodies, with a lower capacity for opsonization and IC solubilization. This may be associated with immunological abnormalities and should be investigated further to facilitate accurate diagnosis of HAE.",

    "abstract": "Viral infections are the most common triggers of asthma exacerbation, but the key molecules involved in this process have not been fully identified. Although cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) have been postulated as the key mediators, their precise roles remain largely unclear. To investigate the roles of cysLTs in virus-induced asthma exacerbation, we developed a murine model using a viral double-stranded RNA analog, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), and analyzed the effect of leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) administration.A/J mice were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) + alum (days 0, 28, 42, and 49), followed by intranasal challenge with OVA (phase 1: days 50-52) and poly I:C (phase 2: days 53-55). Montelukast was administered during poly I:C challenge (phase 2) in the reliever model or throughout the OVA and poly I:C challenges (phases 1 and 2) in the controller model. Airway responsiveness to acetylcholine chloride was assessed, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on day 56.Administration of poly I:C to OVA-sensitized and -challenged mice increased the number of eosinophils and levels of IL-13, IL-9, CCL3, and CXCL1 in BAL fluid (BALF) and tended to increase airway responsiveness. Montelukast significantly attenuated the poly I:C-induced increase in the number of eosinophils and levels of IL-13, IL-9, and CCL3 in BALF and airway hyperresponsiveness in both the reliever and controller models.This is the first report showing that LTRA functionally suppressed the pathophysiology of a virus-induced asthma exacerbation model, suggesting the importance of cysLTs as a potential treatment target.",

However, the relationship between the severity of CRS and four different sputum inflammatory phenotypes as defined by the proportion of eosinophils and neutrophils is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the severity of CRS on lower airway and systemic inflammation in asthmatic patients.We enrolled 57 adult asthmatic patients who underwent sinus computed tomography (CT). The severity of CRS was evaluated by the Lund-Mackay score (LMS). The induced sputum inflammatory phenotype was defined by eosinophils (≥/<2%) and neutrophils (≥/<60%). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected to examine cytokine productions.The median LMS of subjects was 6 (interquartile range, 0-11.5). The sputum inflammatory cell phenotype was categorized as paucicellular (n = 14), neutrophilic (n = 11), eosinophilic (n = 20), or mixed (n = 12). LMS was positively correlated with the percentage of blood eosinophils, sputum eosinophils, and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IL-5 on CD4+ T cells. In the severe CRS group (LMS, 12-24), the number of mixed cellular phenotypes was higher than that in the group without CRS (LMS, 0-4) and mild-to-moderate CRS group (LMS, 5-11).In asthmatic patients with severe CRS, the proportion of the mixed cellular inflammatory phenotype was increased as well as eosinophilic inflammation.",

However, the etiology of anaphylaxis and prescription patterns of EAI have not been widely examined in Japan. This was a retrospective cohort study using a large Japanese claims database (JMDC, Tokyo, Japan). We included patients with severe anaphylaxis who received epinephrine in a hospital or outpatient clinic from 2011 to 2016. We extracted patients who were prescribed EAIs and examined the annual trend of EAI prescription rates and refill patterns. We identified 1255 eligible patients. Among them, 361 patients (28.8%) were prescribed EAIs within 30 days after their initial severe anaphylactic episode. In patients who were prescribed EAIs, 65.9% were prescribed EAIs from the same facility in which initial treatment was given for severe anaphylaxis. The prescription rates of EAI significantly increased from 11.1% in 2011 to 30.9% in 2016. Among patients with initial EAI prescriptions, 97.3% refilled their EAI prescriptions at least once and 40.5% refilled their prescriptions annually during the 3 year follow up period. EAI prescription rates were relatively low in patients who experienced severe anaphylaxis in Japan. Physicians should prescribe EAIs to all patients who were treated for anaphylaxis under their care and avoid delegating the responsibility of prescribing EAIs to other facilities. Initial prescription of EAIs can result in improved regular refill and dissemination practices.",

Efficacy and effect persistence were evaluated using nasal and ocular symptom scores, daily use of rescue medication, and Japanese Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire scores recorded during the JC pollen dispersal season of each year. Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse events and adverse drug reactions.The mean combined total nasal symptom and medication score (range 0-18) during the peak symptom periods of 2015 through 2019 were 5.47 ± 3.38, 4.52 ± 3.13, 3.58 ± 2.63, 5.28 ± 4.01, and 6.83 ± 4.65, respectively.

Among them, patients with severe asthma (those undergoing Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] 2018 step 4 or 5 treatment) were included in this analysis and investigated clinical characteristics based on asthma control status.

Overall, there were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between patients with well-controlled and not well-controlled asthma. However, cluster analysis revealed that distinct 5 clusters (cluster 1, well-controlled; cluster 2, eosinophilic; cluster 3, non–type 2 inflammation; cluster 4, high periostin; and cluster 5, late-onset type 2 inflammation), and clusters 2–5 were not well-controlled. Among them, cluster 3 was characterized by low eosinophil counts, low periostin levels, and less frequent olfactory disturbance, and this cluster had the worst asthma control. Japanese patients with severe asthma were divided into well-controlled and not-well controlled asthma, and we confirmed heterogeneity of not well-controlled severe asthma.

We aimed to investigate the correlation between obesity and asthma-associated long-term mortality in Japanese adults.From the data on 3146 individuals with air pollution-related respiratory diseases in the Omuta City Air Pollution-Related Health Damage Cohort Program, 697 adult patients with asthma were analyzed. Hazard ratios for long-term all-cause and respiratory disease -related mortality were compared in patients with different physiques using the Cox proportional hazard models. The classification of physiques was based on the WHO obesity criteria.Of the 697 patients, 439 died during the median observation period of 26.3 years. The number (% of total) of underweight, normal-weight, pre-obese, and obese class I-III individuals were 75 (10.8%), 459 (65.9%), 140 (20.1%), and 23 (3.3%), respectively. The Cox proportional hazard model (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], P value) showed that pre-obese group had a significantly reduced risk for all-cause (0.65 [0.51 to 0.83], P < 0.05) and respiratory disease (0.55 [0.37 to 0.81], P < 0.05)-related mortality related to normal-weight group.Our cohort program demonstrated that being slightly overweight may reduce the risk of long-term mortality in patients with asthma. However, the influence of obesity on long-term outcomes remains unclear in asthma, because of the small number of obese patients included in our study. Our findings suggest that interventions, including nutrition and exercises, should be provided to Japanese patients with asthma.",

In addition, the correlations among AD severity, laboratory factors, and features of basophils were examined. Blood samples from 38 AD patients and 21 HCs were analyzed. Basophil response markers CD203c and CD63, and expression of surface-bound IgE and FcεRI on basophils were measured. CD203c and CD63 expressions induced by stimulation with anti-IgE and anti-FcεRI antibodies were measured. Clinical/laboratory factors including total serum IgE were examined for correlations with these basophil parameters.Baseline CD203c and CD63 expression on basophils were significantly higher in AD patients compared with HCs. The CD203c/CD63 response ratio to anti-FcεRI stimulation was higher than that to anti-IgE stimulation in AD patients, but not HCs. FcεRI expression on basophils was higher in AD patients than in HCs, although surface-bound IgE on basophils was equivalent. Total serum IgE had negative correlations with surface-bound IgE and CD63 responsiveness to anti-IgE stimulation.Basophils were spontaneously activated under steady-state conditions in AD patients and responsiveness to anti-IgE stimulation was lower than in HCs. Despite high serum IgE and high basophil FcεRI expression, surface-bound IgE on basophils remained relatively low.

Clinical presentation of HMB resembles other mosquito allergic responses, and it can also be difficult to clinically distinguish HMB from other severe allergic reactions. However, a distinctive pathophysiology underlies HMB. HMB belongs to a category of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated natural killer (NK) cell lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD). Hence, HMB may progress to systemic diseases, such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, chronic active EBV disease, and EBV-associated malignancies. A triad of elevated serum IgE, NK lymphocytosis, and detection of EBV DNA in peripheral blood is commonly observed, and identification of EBV-infected NK cells usually facilitates the diagnosis. However, the effective treatment is limited, and its precise etiology remains unknown. Local CD4+ T cell proliferation triggered by mosquito bites appears to help induce EBV reactivation and EBV-infected NK-cell proliferation. These immunological interactions may explain the transient HMB signs and symptoms and the disease progression toward malignant LPD. Further research to elucidate the mechanism of HMB is warranted for better diagnosis and treatment of HMB and other forms of EBV-associated LPD.",

Intramuscular epinephrine was administered to all 7 patients who experienced an anaphylactic reaction. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic efficiency of soybean-specific IgE titers were low for predicting the responses to the challenge test.Soybean allergies were diagnosed in only 18% of the subjects with positive sensitization to soybeans.

    "abstract": "The eosinophil is deeply associated with the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and other allergic diseases. We recently identified a novel eosinophil-specific cell surface molecule, major facilitator super family domain containing 10 (Mfsd10). A monoclonal antibody (mAb) against Mfsd10 (M2) showed selective binding and neutralizing activities for eosinophils. However, the relative potency of the blockage of Mfsd10 and other eosinophil-specific molecules for the treatment of allergic diseases has not been evaluated. Therefore, in this study, the effects of M2 and an anti-Siglec-F mAb on antigen-immunized and antigen-specific Th2 cell-transferred murine eosinophilic inflammation models were comparatively investigated. Ovalbumin (OVA)-specific Th2 cells were differentiated from naïve CD4+ T cells of DO11.10/RAG-2−/− mice in vitro and cytokine producing activity of the Th2 cells was examined. OVA-immunized and Th2 cell- transferred BALB/c mice were treated with M2 or anti-Siglec-F and challenged with OVA. Then the number of inflammatory cells and the concentration of IL-5 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. Antigen-specific Th2 cells produced large amounts of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 but not IL-17A or IFN-γ. Administration of M2 significantly suppressed antigen-induced lung eosinophil infiltration both in OVA-immunized and Th2 cell-transferred mice. The potency as well as selectivity of M2 for down-regulating eosinophils was quite similar to that of anti-Siglec-F. Both mAbs did not affect antigen-induced IL-5 production in the lungs. Mfsd10 as well as Siglec-F could be an effective target to treat eosinophil-related disorders including bronchial asthma.",

In the present study, we examined the effects of rapamycin on vascular remodeling including intraluminal myofibroblast proliferation in a murine model of allergic vasculitis with eosinophil infiltration. : C57BL/6 mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and alum. The positive controls were exposed to aerosolized OVA daily for 7 days. The other group of mice was administered with rapamycin (1 mg/ kg) intraperitoneally, in parallel with daily exposure to aerosolized OVA for 7 days. On the 3rd and 7th day, bron- choalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and the lungs were excised for pathological analysis. Cell differentials were determined and concentrations of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and TGF-β in the BAL fluid (BALF) were measured. Semi-quantitative analysis of pathological changes in the pulmonary arteries was evaluated according to the severity of vasculitis. : The number of eosinophils in BALF was reduced significantly in the mice treated with rapamycin compared to the positive control. There was a significant decrease in the TGF-β concentration of the BALF in the rapamycin-treated group compared to that of the positive control. The pathological scores were reduced significantly in the rapamycin-treated group compared to the positive control group. Intraluminal myofibroblasts in pulmonary arteries were reduced dramatically in the rapamycin-treated group compared to the positive control group. : Rapamycin suppressed pulmonary vascular remodeling in a murine model of allergic vasculitis with eosinophil infiltration through reducing eosinophil infiltration and TGF-β production in the lung and inhibition against biological action of TGF-β.",

The present study investigated the efficacy of this solution against birch pollen conjunctivitis in a CAC test.Ten adult subjects (eight males and two females) with asymptomatic birch pollen conjunctivitis were enrolled in this study. The average age of the subjects was 41.1 years. This study was conducted during a period without birch pollen dispersion. In each subject, the epinastine 0.05% ophthalmic solution was instilled in one eye, and an artificial tear fluid was instilled in the fellow eye in a double-blind manner. Five minutes or 4 h after the drug instillation, both eyes were challenged with an optimal concentration of birch pollen, and ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia were then graded. Tears were collected before the drug instillation and 20 min after the pollen challenge, and the histamine level was measured.The ocular itching scores and palpebral conjunctival hyperemia scores of the epinastine-treated eyes were significantly lower than those of the contralateral control eyes when the eyes were pretreated with the drug 4 h before the CAC. There was a significant correlation between the tear histamine level and mean ocular itching score of three time points (3, 5 and 10 min) following the CAC in the control eyes but not the epinastine-treated eyes.Epinastine is effective in suppressing ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia in birch pollen conjunctivitis.",

    "abstract": "Nasal congestion in allergic rhinitis (AR) is caused by vascular hyperpermeability and vascular relaxation of the nasal mucosa. We previously detected high levels of a lipoxygenation metabolite of dihomogammalinolenic acid, 15-hydroxy-8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatrienoic acid (15-HETrE) in the nasal lavage fluid of AR model mice. Here, we investigated the effects of 15-HETrE on vascular functions associated with nasal congestion. We measured 15-HETrE levels in the nasal lavage fluid of ovalbumin-induced AR model mice and nasal discharge of patients with AR. We also assessed nasal congestion and vascular relaxation in mice. Vascular contractility was investigated using isolated mouse aortas. Five ovalbumin challenges increased 15-HETrE levels in AR model mice. 15-HETrE was also detected in patients who exhibiting AR-related symptoms. Intranasal administration of 15-HETrE elicited dyspnea-related behavior and decreased the nasal cavity volume in mice. Miles assay and whole-mount immunostaining revealed that 15-HETrE administration caused vascular hyperpermeability and relaxation of the nasal mucosa. Intravital imaging demonstrated that 15-HETrE relaxed the ear vessels that were precontracted via thromboxane receptor stimulation. Moreover, 15-HETrE dilated the isolated mouse aortas, and this effect was attenuated by K+ channel inhibitors and prostaglandin D2 (DP) and prostacyclin (IP) receptor antagonists. Additionally, vasodilatory effects of 15-HETrE were accompanied by an increase in intracellular cAMP levels. Our results indicate that 15-HETrE, whose levels are elevated in the nasal cavity upon AR, can be a novel lipid mediator that exacerbates nasal congestion. Moreover, it can stimulate DP and IP receptors and downstream K+ channels to dilate the nasal mucosal vasculature.",

    "abstract": "Oxaliplatin is commonly used to treat gastrointestinal malignancies. However, its applications are limited due to potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs), particularly severe anaphylactic shock. There is no method to predict or prevent ADRs caused by oxaliplatin. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the genetic HLA predisposition and immune mechanism of oxaliplatin-induced ADRs. A retrospective review was performed for 154 patients with ADRs induced by oxaliplatin during 2016–2021 recorded in our ADR notification system. HLA genotyping was conducted for 47 patients with oxaliplatin-induced ADRs, 1100 general population controls, and 34 oxaliplatin-tolerant controls in 2019–2023. The in vitro basophil activation test (BAT) was performed and oxaliplatin-specific IgE levels were determined. The incidence of oxaliplatin-induced ADRs and anaphylactic shock in our cohort was 7.1% and 0.15%, respectively. Of the 154 patients, 67.5% suffered rash/eruption; 26.0% of the patients who could not undergo oxaliplatin rechallenge were considered to show oxaliplatin-induced immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions (HRs). The genetic study found that the HLA-DRB∗12:01 allele was associated with oxaliplatin-induced HRs compared to the general population controls (sensitivity = 42.9%; odds ratio [OR] = 3.4; 95% CI = 1.4–8.2; P = 0.008) and tolerant controls (OR = 12; 95% CI = 2.3–63.7; P = 0.001). The in vitro BAT showed higher activation of CD63+ basophils in patients with oxaliplatin-induced HRs compared to the tolerant controls (P < 0.05). Only four patients (8.5%) with oxaliplatin-induced ADRs were positive for oxaliplatin-specific IgE. This study found that 26.0% of patients with oxaliplatin-induced ADRs could not undergo oxaliplatin rechallenge. HLA-DRB∗12:01 is regarded as a genetic marker for oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity.",

Based on its success in demonstrating the substantial efficacy of SLIT, we next conducted a larger-scale study by administering JC pollen to all JCP patients recruited. It was because of aiming to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of SLIT and its underlying mechanisms by comparing high- and non-responder patients. Despite limitations posed by liquid medication, significant effectiveness and safety demonstrated by the 2-year treatment served as the foundation for launching the first SLIT medicine for JCP, in 2014. Furthermore, in addition to the clearer Th1/Th2-imbalanced property in the high-responders, the possible involvement of bitter taste receptors in CD4+ T cells, apoptosis pathways in CD4+ T cells and basophils, and inducing a mast cell degranulation inhibitory molecule in the effect of SLIT was demonstrated. To solve the limitations posed by liquid medication, clinical trials evaluating JC pollen sublingual tablets started in 2014. Due to the minimal side effects, ease of administration, and convenient storage, the sublingual tablet medicine was launched in 2018. Giving the ongoing rise in demand for SLIT and considering that more than 1% of JCP patients are currently undergoing SLIT, the practical use of this treatment for multiple allergens is becoming increasingly important.",

    "abstract": "Allergen-specific IgE is a major mediator of allergic responses and contributes greatly to allergic disease in the human population. Therapies that inhibit the production of IgE would be useful for lessening the burden of allergic disease. A great deal of research has focused on how IgE responses are regulated, and several factors that promote the production of allergic IgE have been characterized. T follicular helper (TFH) cells expressing IL-4 are required for the development of IgE expressing B cells in the germinal center (GC). Ig somatic hypermutation and B cell selection in the GC leads to the development of high affinity allergen-specific IgE that promotes anaphylaxis, a severe form of allergic response. T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells are also found in the GC response and act with TFH cells in the selection of high affinity IgE + B cells. This review examines the current literature on IgE responses and TFR cells. In mouse studies, TFR cells have a suppressive role on IgE responses in allergic airway disease, however TFR cells also play a helper role in the IgE response in food allergy. In human studies, TFR cells correlate with a decreased allergic response but evidence for a direct suppressive role of TFR cells on IgE in vivo is lacking. TFR cells may represent a new target for allergy therapies, but caution must be exercised to promote the suppressor activity of TFR cells and not the helper activity of TFR cells on IgE responses.",

    "abstract": "In some clinical studies performed in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, ramatroban, a new thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, significantly improved nasal symptoms. As yet the mechanism of action of this drug has not been fully elucidated. In the present study we investigated the effects of ramatroban on changes in nasal reactivity and levels of inflammatory cells and mediators in nasal lavage fluid after allergen challenge. Ramatroban was administered orally at a daily dose of 150 mg (b.i.d.) for 4 weeks to 11 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis exhibiting positive responses to nasal allergen challenge with house dust mite. Analysis of variance revealed that there was a significant decrease in eosinophil counts and eosinophil cationic protein levels in nasal lavage fluid when compared with values immediately before allergen challenge before and after ramatroban treatment. Histamine, tryptase and albumin levels were significantly decreased in analysis of variance before and after ramatroban treatment. The degree of nasal reactivity to histamine was also significantly decreased after the ramatroban treatment. These findings indicate that ramatroban decreases important pathogenic factors in allergic rhinitis, resulting in an improvement in nasal symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-18 acts as both a Th1 and Th2 cytokine, but its association with allergic diseases remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to measured plasma IL-18 and serum IgE levels in atopic children to evaluate how IL-18 is associated with allergic diseases. The plasma IL-18 and serum IgE levels in 51 atopic children, 28 healthy control children and 14 healthy control adults were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The 5' end of the IL-18 gene of 48 atopic children and 20 healthy control children was sequenced. The plasma IL-18 level was significantly elevated in children with bronchial asthma and/or atopic dermatitis. Plasma IL-18 levels in the moderate or severe atopic dermatitis group were significantly higher than those in either the control group or the mild atopic dermatitis group. There was a positive correlation between plasma IL-18 and serum IgE levels. Three allelic combinations of polymorphisms in the IL-18 gene promoter region were observed. There was no significant difference in the plasma IL-18 levels between groups carrying these genotypes. However, bronchial asthma patients had significantly higher frequencies of the − 137 G/G genotype than did control children. The plasma IL-18 level was elevated, particularly in patients with atopic dermatitis. As the clinical severity of atopic dermatitis increased, the plasma IL-18 level also tended to increase. These findings suggest that IL-18 may be associated with the severity of atopic dermatitis.",

    "abstract": "It is very important to use antiinflammatory agents, including inhaled corticosteroids, in the management of asthma because bronchial inflammation is a fundamental component of bronchial asthma. Although management according to this strategy is recommended in several countries, the actual situation of asthmatic patients in Japan is poorly understood. To clarify the actual management of asthma in Japan, the present study was undertaken. In 1998, for 8 weeks from September through to October, questionnaires on asthma control and satisfaction in daily life were given to asthmatic patients. In addition, questionnaires regarding patient profiles and medication were given to the patients' physicians. The same questionnaires were repeated in 1999 and 2000. The information obtained from the same patients and their physicians who responded in each of the three years was used for analysis. We analyzed 840 cases. During this period, over 80% of patients used oral theophylline, although the percentage of patients using inhaled steroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists increased from 67.0 and 29.8% in 1998 to 75.1 and 34.2%, respectively, in 2000. Asthma control (including the presence of attacks and self-evaluation by each patient), asthma- related symptoms and sleep disturbance improved significantly. However, there was no improvement in satisfaction in daily life of asthmatic patients surveyed. Multiple-regression analysis revealed that self-evaluation of asthma control by each patient was significantly related to improvement in satisfaction in daily life. These results indicate that antiinflammatory agents, including inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists, contributed to improved asthma control, whereas oral theophylline is characteristically used in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. However, not all asthma-related problems, such as satisfaction in daily life, improved and self-evaluation of asthma control by patients may play a key role in improving their satisfaction in daily life.",

    "abstract": "Because fungi in the indoor environment strongly affect not only damage to and the deterioration of building materials, but also affect human health, it is important to know the distribution of fungi within an indoor environment. Therefore, in the present study, we examined fungi in houses over a period of 1 year and attempted to produce an indoor fungal contamination map for Japanese houses. Fungi were collected at approximately 100 fixed points in 81 ordinary houses around the Kanto District using either the stamp or dressing tape methods between 1999 and 2000. A commercially available potato dextrose agar culture medium was used to incubate the fungi collected. After incubation, fungi were quantified and identified by routine methods and the fungal conditions in the indoor environment was evaluated. The relationships between the fungal conditions in the indoor environment found around the Kanto District and parameters such as the season, area in the house and indoor environment were analyzed. According to the fungal flora found in the present study, the indoor environment in Japanese homes was classified into three areas: (i) relatively wet areas, such as the bathroom, lavatory and kitchen, where hygrophilic fungi and yeasts are often detected; (ii) relatively dry areas, such as the living room and Japanese-style rooms, where xerophilic fungi are often detected; and (iii) areas where wet and dry parts coexist, such as bedrooms and closets containing futons and clothes with moisture, where both hydro- philic and xerophilic fungi, as well as yeasts, are detected. In the presnt survey, seasonal changes in the fungi detected in the indoor environment were small. We confirmed the actual fungal conditions in the indoor environment and produced a fungal map.",

Upon the great success of anti-TNF biologicals as the therapeutic modalities of choice in the treatment of inflammatory disorders of unknown etiology, the details of TNF, and anti-TNF biological agents are extensively reviewed, particularly, focusing on those used against RA. So far, nearly one million patients are expected to expose to these agents worldwide. In Japan, chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNFα, infliximab has been approved for Crohn's disease in 2002, RA in 2003, and TNF receptor 2-IgG Fc fusion protein, etanercept had just approved for RA in 2005. Full human anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody, adalimumab is now under clinical trials. Safety profiles of these agents, based on the exposure to one hundred million patients for up to ten years, are summarized. While the experiences using biological agents in Japan are rather limited, the unique circumstances in Asian countries should been taken into account. In this respect, the issues around the anti-TNF biologicals in Japan are finally discussed.",

    "abstract": "Itching, a typical symptom in dermatitis, including atopic dermatitis (AD), leads to scratching. In the present study, we investigated whether histamine-induced itching is involved in scratching behavior seen in NC/Nga (NC) mice, in which AD-like dermatitis is induced spontaneously. The severity score of dermatitis, the number of scratches, histamine content, activity of the histamine-forming enzyme histidine decarboxylase (HDC), the number of mast cells and the effect of histamine receptor antagonists were examined. We found two types of scratching behavior in NC mice, one of a short duration (0.3-1.0 s) and the other of a longer duration (over 1.0 s). The number of short scratchings and HDC activity increased with age (4–13 weeks) in parallel with the severity of dermatitis in NC mice raised in conventional surroundings. The number of longer-duration scratchings had increased before any apparent development of dermatitis and this type of scratching behavior increased at 13 weeks, as did histamine content and mast cell number in the skin. There were no changes in these parameters in NC mice raised in specific pathogen-free surroundings during the experimental period. Chlorpheniramine (a histamine H receptor antagonist), but not histamine H2 and H3/4 receptor antagonists, decreased the number of short scratchings. None of the histamine receptor antagonists decreased the number of long scratchings, whereas tacrolimus reduced both short and long scratching behavior. The findings of the present suggest that histamine produced by enhanced HDC activity is involved in the induction of short scratchings in NC mice.",

Clinical characteristics of 14 patients (aged 1–8 years) with peanut allergy were evaluated. IgE antibodies to peanut from patients with and without clinical peanut allergy were compared with those to soybean and other nuts. To examine the role of cross-reactive carbohydrate determinant (CCD) on the clinically false positive detection of peanut IgE, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bromelain specific IgE were measured by Uni CAP IgE kit. Inhibition of peanut IgE by HRP was also examined. The patients repeatedly experienced potentially life-threatening symptoms, including anaphylaxis. Sera from patients with peanut allergy had negative or relatively low IgE antibodies to other nuts. However, clinically false positive peanut IgE showed significant correlation-coefficients with soybean, almond, chestnut, pistachio, macadamia and cashew (r = 0.61–1.00). Anti-HRP and anti-bromelain IgE antibodies were detected in the clinically false positive sera, but not in the sera from patients with peanut allergy. Two out of four clinically false positive peanut IgE antibodies were significantly inhibited by HRP. Social education about the features of peanut allergy is needed in Japan. Anti-CCD IgE antibody was suggested to be one of the mechanisms contributing to the false positive detection of peanut IgE. Detection of anti-HRP or anti-bromelain IgE can be a useful tool to recognize the presence of anti-CCD antibodies.",

A self-administered 37-item version (AHQ-37) consisting of 36 disease-specific items and a Face Scale was designed for socially active patients. Exploratory factor analysis, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, concurrent validity and longitudinal validity were evaluated. A total of 326 asthma patients (202 men; range of age from 18 to 65 years) answered the AHQ-37 twice. Each item of the AHQ-37 was well accepted by the patients with answering rates of 95 to 100%. Six subscales (Asthmatic Symptoms, Emotion, Daily Activity, Factors which Worsened Symptoms, Social Activity and Economics) were extracted by factor analysis. Psychometric testing showed high feasibility, good repeatability and good internal consistency. The Face Scale moderately correlated with all subscales except for Economics, indicating that the Face Scale alone could measure global quality of life (QOL) functioning of asthmatic patients. Concurrent validity with peak-flow values was insufficient (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.05−0.27), showing that the peak flow alone could not estimate QOL. In longitudinal validity, however, changes in peak-flow values had an impact on the Asthmatic Symptoms, Daily Activity and Factors which Worsened Symptoms (P = 0.000−0.419), indicating that changes in peak-flow were important to asthmatic patients' QOL. The QOL of asthmatic patients must be evaluated by asthma-specific questionnaires, such as the AHQ-37.",

    "abstract": "Because bronchial inflammation was recognized as a basic component of bronchial asthma, the strategy for asthma management has changed in the last two decades. In Japan there are few clinico-epidemiological reports of changes in the management of bronchial asthma in actual practice. In this study, we analyzed practical asthma management in Japan, and examined changes in the prevalence of asthma medication and relation between these changes and the level of asthma control and management. From 1998 to 2002, questionnaires on asthma control, asthma related emergent episodes and satisfaction in daily life. Questionnaires were distributed to adult asthmatic patients. Questionnaires about the patients’ profiles and medication were also given to the patients’ doctors. The total number of patient responders was approximately 2500—3300 per year. The rate of peak flow meter (PEFM) use was under approximately only 40% and plateaued from 2000 to 2002. The percentage of inhaled corticosteroid use and leukotriene receptor antagonist use increased, from 62.0%, 27.2% to 77.4%, 40.6% respectively. Indicators for asthma control, including presence of attacks and sleep disturbance, were significantly improved. Limited to PEFM users, there was an improvement hospitalization, ambulance use or ED visits and in satisfaction in daily life based on a Quality of Life (QOL) indicator. These results indicate that the prevalence of anti-inflammatory agents, including inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonist, was associated with an adequate improvement in asthma control in clinical practice. In asthma management in clinical practice, prevalence of PEFM may play an important role in the improvement of asthma related emergent episodes or QOL.",

    "abstract": "Known susceptibility genes to atopy and asthma have been identified by linkage or associations with clinical phenotypes, including total serum IgE levels. IgE-mediated sensitivity reactions require a high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI), which immobilizes the immunoglobulin on the surface of the effector cells, mostly mast cells and basophils. In this mini-review, recent findings are presented on genetic variation of this receptor, as related to atopy. Transcription of FCER1A gene encoding the receptor α subunit can be initiated from two separate promoters, the proximal one and the distal one, which results in a transcript containing two novel untranslated exons (1A, 2A). Our knowledge on the role of this mechanism in allergic diseases is still at an infancy stage. Within regulatory elements of FCER1A some common single nucleotide polymorphisms have functional associations, which were recently reported and replicated in different ethnical groups. Interestingly, these associations do not confer susceptibility to allergic diseases, but rather modulate serum concentrations of IgE. Similarly to the previously investigated β subunit of the receptor, FCER1A is a good candidate for a quantitative trait locus (QTL) in allergic diseases, and appears to participate in the systemic regulation of IgE levels.",

The aim of the present study was to ascertain the sensitisation to TGP in 411 patients known for their reactivity to BGP extracts by analysing their reactivity to crude timothy pollen extract and timothy pollen purified allergens, establishing their specific IgE-profiles. Using the immunoenzymatic CAP method we evaluated IgE-specific antibodies for BGP- and TGP-extracts and the timothy recombinant (r) and natural (n) allergens rPhl p 1, rPhl p 2, nPhl p 4, rPhl p 5, rPhl p 6, rPhl p 7, rPhl p 11, and rPhl p 12. BGP-IgE positive patients (median = 8.0 kUA/l, 2.8-22.2 kUA/l 25th-75th percentile) simultaneously had IgE positive results for TGP (100% of subjects) (median = 48.9 kUA/l, 19.8- > 100 kUA/l 25th-75th percentile) and high prevalence of sensitization to 6/8 Phleum pratense allergens (Phl p 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, markers of genuine sensitisation to TGP) other than profilin and calcium binding protein. More than 72% of BGP allergic patients were co-sensitised to rPhl p 1, rPhl p 2, nPhl p 4, rPhl p 5, rPhl p 6. A decrease of total and specific IgE with patients' age was observed. Our data show that all BGP-allergic patients simultaneously exhibit higher IgE antibody levels to recombinant and natural P. pratense allergens as well as to crude TGP extract. This suggests that when choosing an immunotherapeutic regimen for BGP-sensitised patients (after establishing their IgE profile via purified TGP-allergens), subcutaneous or sublingual TGP-extract vaccines in appropriate doses, in order to influence T epitope specificity, might be beneficial. Though extremely uncommon, in cases where a patient is exclusively BGP allergen-sensitised, BGP-extract therapy is the appropriate therapeutic response.",

We measured eNO levels, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) before and after treatment, reversible airway obstruction (ΔFEV1) after inhalation of bronchodilator, and other parameters. eNO was significantly correlated with peripheral blood eosinophil counts in asthma patients (in steroid-naïve asthma patients, r = 0.544, p < 0.0001; in asthma patients treated with inhaled corticosteroid, r = 0.463, p = 0.026), and subjects with severe eosinophilia in sputum showed high levels of eNO (mild eosino- philia versus severe, p = 0.0152). Among patients with obstructive impairment, eNO levels were correlated with ΔFEV1 regardless of whether patients received (r = 0.527, p = 0.0435) or did not receive (r = 0.64, p = 0.0056) inhaled corticosteroid. In subjects with normal pulmonary function, there was no significant relationship between eNO and AFEV1 with or without inhaled corticosteroid. In patients with obstructive impairment, eNO reflects the degree of reversible airflow limitation. In subjects with normal pulmonary function, eNO may facilitate the diagnosis and management of asthma, rather than indicate reversible bronchial obstruction. eNO measurement by off-line methods is applicable as a potential tool for the diagnosis of asthma and management of asthma patients.",

    "abstract": "The Asthma Health Questionnaire (AHQ)-Japan is useful for assessing quality of life (QOL) in Japanese patients with asthma. However, no studies have compared the AHQ-Japan to other QOL instruments. The AHQ-33-Japan and the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) were completed simultaneously by 126 Japanese patients with asthma (48 men, 78 women; 58.1 ± 17.3 years of age), and the data were compared. Poor negative correlations (correlation coefficient (r) = -0.20 to -0.44, P < 0.05) were observed for 38 combinations of the subscales of these QOL instruments. As the severity of the patients' asthma increased, the scores of most subscales of both QOL instruments became worse. However, the AHQ-33 was more sensitive for severity than the SF-36. On logistic regression analysis, high Asthmatic Symptoms, Factors which Worsened Symptoms, Emotion, Daily Activity, and Social Activity subscale scores, as well as a high total 32- item score, of the AHQ-33 were associated with an increased risk of moderate to severe asthma. On the other hand, only the Physical functioning subscale score of the SF-36 was associated with an increased risk of moderate to severe asthma. Our results show that the AHQ-33 is useful as a disease-specific QOL instrument in Japanese patients with asthma and that it is better than the SF-36, which is a generic QOL instrument. In the future, the AHQ-33 should be compared to other asthma-specific questionnaires.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) is characterized by a severe multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction that usually appears after prolonged exposure to certain drugs and may be related to reactivation of herpes viruses. There have been few reports regarding the clinical association of DIHS with pathogens other than herpes viruses. We report a case of scleroderma with DIHS associated with paramyxovirus infection. A 61-year-old man with early diffuse cutaneous scleroderma with myositis and progressive interstitial pneumonia developed generalized erythema with high fever 3 weeks after taking sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The diagnosis of DIHS was made based on the patient's history of using an offending drug, clinical manifestations and laboratory data showing peripheral eosinophilia with the presence of atypical lymphocytes. Virological tests showed significant increases of antibody titers against mumps virus and parainfluenza virus type 2, which strongly suggested that paramyxovirus infection occurred during the clinical course of DIHS. These findings suggest that paramyxovirus infection had contributed to the development of DIHS in this patient and that there is a need to seek evidence of other viral infections in some cases of DIHS, especially those without herpes virus reactivation/infection.",

To date, there have only been a few reports on models of murine allergic rhinitis which clearly show nasal blockage. Therefore, in order to try and develop such a model, we administered multiple dosages of intranasal pollen or purified antigen protein Cry j 1. B10.S mice were sensitized by intranasal instillations of either pollen extract or Cry j 1 twice a day for 7 days, which was adsorbed on Al(OH)3. Subsequently, once a week, the mice were given multiple intranasal instillation challenges of either the pollen suspension or Cry j 1 and the frequency of sneezing was observed after respective challenges were made. Specific airway resistance (sRaw) was measured as an indicator for nasal blockage. Cry j 1-specific IgE levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum Cry j 1-specific IgE level showed clear elevation only in the group sensitized by Cry j 1 + Al(OH)3 and then challenged by Cry j 1. No elevations were seen in the groups sensitized by pollen extract + Al (OH)3 followed by a pollen suspension challenge. There was an immediate increase in sneezing after challenges in all of the sensitized-challenged groups. Nevertheless, no increases in sRaw in any of the groups were detected at any of the time points during the 8 hours following the challenges. Cry j 1 may be more effective than crude antigens for efficient sensitization/challenge in mice. No increase in sRaw occurred, even in mice that possessed high amounts of Cry j 1-specific IgE and that exhibited sneezing.",

The aim of this study was to examine the expression and function of B7-H2 in human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells and compare them with those of CD40 or OX40 ligand (OX40L). Methods: Expression of B7-H2, CD40 and OX40L in ASM cells and their respective counterparts in T cells was analyzed by RT-PCR or flow cytometry. The modulating effect of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) on expression of B7-H2, CD40 and OX40L was also examined. The function of these three molecules was evaluated by virtue of adhesion of anti-CD3-activated T cells, IL-6 and IL-8 production and DNA synthesis. Results: ASM cells constitutively expressed B7-H2, CD40 and OX40L that mediated adhesion of activated T cells expressing ICOS, CD40L and OX40. ASM cells responded to poly I:C with upregulated expression of B7-H2, CD40 and OX40L and displayed enhanced adhesion of activated T cells. Functional analysis performed on untreated ASM cells showed that engagement of B7-H2 with ICOS-Ig clearly induced DNA synthesis, whereas that of CD40 or OX40L with trimeric CD40L or OX40-Ig greatly increased IL-6 and IL-8 production. These responses were enhanced in poly I:C-treated ASM cells. Conclusions: The data demonstrate that ASM cells express functionally active B7-H2, CD40 and OX40L and suggest that B7-H2-dependent signaling may play an active role in a proliferative response rather than in cytokine and chemokine production. In addition, the modulation of B7-H2, CD40 and OX40L expression and function by poly I:C may have important implications for the function of virus-infected ASM cells.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that allergic rhinitis is closely related to bronchial asthma, reflecting the \"one airway-one disease\" hypothesis. It is unclear if the effects of pranlukast, a leukotriene-receptor antagonist, are consistent with this hypothesis. The goal of the study was to determine if pranlukast has effects on the upper and lower airways through a comparison of the effects of fexofenadine and pranlukast on airway hyperresponsiveness in non-asthmatic patients with cedar pollinosis before the Japanese cedar pollen season and during the peak pollen season. Patients received fexofenadine hydrochloride plus oral mequitazine (fexofenadine group) or pranlukast hydrate plus oral mequitazine (pranlukast group) as an initial treatment. Subsequent changes in airway responsiveness to acetylcholine were measured. Among patients in whom coughing developed during the peak pollen season, airway responsiveness significantly increased in the fexofenadine group. In the pranlukast group, airway responsiveness did not increase significantly, regardless of the presence or absence of coughing. The results indicate that pranlukast hydrate inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness in non-asthmatic patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis. In turn, this suggests that cysteinyl leukotrienes have a role in increased airway responsiveness.",

The medical charts of fifty outpatients treated continuously for asthma, aged 16-50 years, from October 2002 to October 2004 at Showa University Hospital were analyzed for physicians’ compliance with asthma guidelines, symptom severity, episodes in various occasions, prescriptions and drug costs. Physicians’ compliance with the guidelines, which were defined as the number of patient visits treated in conformity with the JGL over the total number of patient visits, was found to be high before (89.4%) and after (90.3%) the introduction of JGL2003, without a statistical difference. On the other hand, the distribution of asthma symptom severity varied significantly (P < 0.0001). Fewer patients were recognized as having more severe asthma symptoms after the introduction of JGL2003. Significantly more patients with severe asthma symptoms were detected in the physicians’ noncompliant group than in the compliant group (P < 0.0001). The number of patients prescribed with oral corticosteroids, long-acting β2-agonists containing patches, long-acting oral β2-agonists, short-acting inhaled β2-agonists, sustained-released theophylline and leukotriene receptor antagonists decreased after the introduction of JGL2003. Furthermore, the total annual drug cost per patient decreased significantly by an average of 16,259 yen (P = 0.006). The JGL2003 was judged to have improved criteria, which thus resulted in the high compliance of physicians with the guidelines, in the remission of asthma symptoms and in the reduction in the total annual drug cost per patient.",

    "abstract": "Airway remodeling is a repair process occurring after airway injury; its primary histopathological features are subepithelial fibrosis and smooth muscle thickening of the bronchi. These histopathological changes are considered to occur due to bronchial smooth muscle cells (bSMC) that secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which work as chemoattractants and influence cell migration. Therefore, we examined the interaction between bSMCs and ECM proteins in vitro for understanding the remodeling process in the bronchi. bSMCs were cultured to collect a bSMC-conditioned medium. Using the bSMC-conditioned medium thus obtained, we performed a cell migration assay, characterized p integrin expression, and identified ECM proteins and matrix metalloproteinases by western blotting and gelatin zymography, respectively. The response of bSMC migration to bSMC-conditioned medium increased with time in culture, and fibronectin (FIB) was detected as a chemoattractant for bSMCs in bSMC-conditioned medium by western blot analysis and a cell migration assay using anti-FIB antibodies. The involvement of p1 integrin in the migration of bSMCs toward FIB contained in bSMC-conditioned medium was demonstrated by inhibition of cell migration using anti-p1 integrin antibodies. Expression of p1 integrin on bSMCs was confirmed by using a p-integrinmediated cell adhesion array. In addition, metalloproteinases detected in bSMC-conditioned medium by gelatin zymography were suggested to be matrix metalloproteinase-1 and 2 by western blotting and amino acid sequencing. Our results suggest that FIB and matrix metalloproteinases secreted from bSMCs might play major roles in bSMC migration in the process of airway remodeling.",

Peptide-based immunotherapy has been proposed as one of new strategies for reduction of allergic adverse reactions. We examined the possibility of candidate peptides for the development of peptide-based immunotherapy for Japanese cedar pollinosis. Twelve Cry j 1-specific T-cell lines were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 12 patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis. Using these T-cell lines, 37 Cry j 1-derived overlapping peptides were assessed for their proliferative responses and cytokine production. Four peptides corresponding to the Cry j 1 sequence were able to induce proliferative responses to more than one T-cell line: p61-80 (3/12; 25.0%); p115–132 (2/12; 16.6%); p206–225 (4/12; 33.3%); and p337–353 (5/12; 41.7%). Furthermore, T-cell lines generated from 11 of 12 donors (91.7%) responded to at least one of these four peptides. On the other hand, the pattern of cytokine production from Cry j 1-specific T-cell lines varied. Moreover, cytokine production patterns by stimulation with Cry j 1 peptide did not reflect those by stimulation with Cry j 1 protein. Our results suggest four Cry j 1-derived peptides (p61–80, p115–132, p206–225 and p337–353) may be considered to be the immunodominant T-cell epitopes of the Cry j 1 molecule, and can be useful for the design of peptide-based immunotherapy for the management of Japanese cedar pollinosis.",

We observed that SFC significantly improved forced expiratory volume in one second (p < 0.05), IOS measurements of total resistance R5 (p < 0.01), central resistance R20 (p < 0.05), and distal reactance X5 (p < 0.01) compared with FP. The percentage of eosinophils in sputum, but not in serum, decreased significantly more in the SFC group than in the FP group (p < 0.05). There was also a significant improvement in symptom control in the SFC group (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that SFC is more useful than FP in mild asthma cases.

This method is based on electrophoretic separation using the difference of 39 bases between α1 and α2 mRNAs. Three selective, 5 partial and 2 secondary IgAD patients were examined. In the 3 selective IgAD patients, no α1 or α2 mRNA expression was detected. In the 5 partial IgAD patients, various α1 and α2 mRNA expression patterns were found. One of the partial IgAD patients showed only α2 gene expression, but not α1 gene expression, and was found to show an α1 gene deletion together with γ2 and ε gene deletions. His plasma IgA2 level was within the normal range. Patients with an α1 gene deletion can be considered as having partial IgAD.

    "abstract": "Allergenic cross reactivity between the members of the Pooids (Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense, and Poa pratensis) and Chloridoids (Cynodon dactylon and Paspalum notatum) is well established. Studies using crude extracts in the past have demonstrated limited cross reactivity between the Pooids and the Chloridoids suggesting separate diagnosis and therapy. However, little is known regarding the molecular basis for the limited cross reactivity observed between the 2 groups of grasses. The present study was undertaken to gain insights into the molecular basis of cross allergenicity between the major allergens from rye and Bermuda grass pollens. Immunoblot inhibition tests were carried out to determine the specificity of the proteins involved in cross reactivity. Crude pollen extract and bacterially expressed and purified recombinant Lol p 1and Lol p 5 from rye grass were subjected to cross inhibition experiments with crude and purified recombinant Cyn d 1 from Bermuda grass using sera from patients allergic to rye grass pollen. The immunoblot inhibition studies revealed a high degree of cross inhibition between the group 1 allergens. In contrast, a complete lack of inhibition was observed between Bermuda grass group 1 allergen rCyn d 1, and rye grass group 5 allergen rLol p 5. Crude rye grass extract strongly inhibited IgE reactivity to Bermuda grass, whereas crude Bermuda grass pollen extract showed a weaker inhibition. Our data suggests that a possible explanation for the limited cross reactivity between the Pooids and Chloridoids may, in part, be due to the absence of group 5 allergen from Chloridoid grasses. This approach of using purified proteins may be applied to better characterize the cross allergenicity patterns between different grass pollen allergens.",

    "abstract": "We obtain summary estimates of the accuracy of additional objective tests for the diagnosis of adult asthma using systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies. Medline, Embase, and other relevant electronic databases were searched for papers published between January 1989 and December 2016. Studies were included if they evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of objective tests, including airway reversibility (AR), airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and fractionated exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) for the diagnosis of adult asthma in patients with symptoms suggestive of asthma. If papers were assessed appropriate using the adapted QUADAS-2 tool, meta-analysis was conducted using the hierarchical bivariate model. This hierarchical model accounts for both within and between study variability. Sixteen studies reported the performance of the evaluated objective tests at presentation. For diagnosis of adult asthma, overall sensitivity and specificity for AR were 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18 to 0.66) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.00); for AHR, 0.86 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.00) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.00); for FeNO, 0.65 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.77) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.90). Comprehensive comparison of three diagnostic tools for adult asthma using the back-calculated likelihood rate (LR) showed that AR and AHR corresponded to a higher LR+, and AHR gave a lower LR-. In the current situation of no gold standard for diagnosis of adult asthma, AR and AHR are appropriate for ruling-in the true diagnosis, and AHR is superior for ruling-out a diagnosis. Since each objective test had a specific characteristic, it should be chosen depending on the situation, such as the capacity of the institution and the conditions of patients.",

    "abstract": "Aspirin enhances food allergy symptoms by increasing absorption of ingested allergens. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of aspirin in facilitating intestinal absorption of the wheat allergen, gliadin, in rats. Plasma concentrations of gliadin were determined after oral administration by gavage or administration into a closed intestinal loop in rats. We used an in situ intestinal re-circulating perfusion experiment to examine the effect of pepsin on aspirin-facilitated gliadin absorption. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran-40 (FD-40) was used as a marker of non-specific absorption. The molecular size of gliadin and its allergenicity in plasma were examined using immunoblot analysis and intradermal reaction tests with Evans blue dye (EBD) extravasation, respectively. Aspirin increased plasma concentrations of gliadin after oral administration but had no effect in the closed intestinal loop study. An in situ intestinal re-circulating perfusion study showed that FITC-labeled gliadin was absorbed similarly to FD-40. Aspirin increased absorption of both intact and pepsin-digested gliadin, with a more significant effect on absorption of pepsin-treated gliadin. Immunoblotting showed that most gliadin was absorbed in intact form. When the gliadin fraction was extracted from rat plasma after gavage and injected intradermally into gliadin-sensitized rats, EBD extravasation was observed at injection sites in a gliadin dose-dependent manner. Aspirin increased the absorption of intact and pepsin-digested gliadin via the paracellular pathway, maintaining their allergenicity. Moreover, the effect of aspirin on gliadin absorption was enhanced by modification and digestion of gliadin in the stomach.",

    "abstract": "Background: In cases using a budesonide/formoterol combination inhaler, many patients are started on fixed-dose treatment at 640/18 μg (4 puffs) daily, but there are no guidelines yet regarding the step-down method when control has been maintained. Methods: Patients with moderate asthma treated with either budesonide 400 μg and salmeterol 100 μg (GINA step3 group) or salmeterol/fluticasone 250 at 2 puffs (GINA step4 group) were enrolled and started on therapy of budesonide/formoterol 4 puffs. Thereafter, step-down to 2 puffs was performed if either of the following criteria was met at 8-week intervals: fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) ≤ 28 ppb plus asthma control test (ACT) score ≥ 22, or ACT score ≥ 24 at 3 consecutive visits regardless of FeNO level. Thereafter, changes in ACT score, the number of acute exacerbations and reliever use, and FeNO level were monitored through 48th week. Results: Fifty-one patients, 27 in step3 group and 24 in step4 group, underwent step-down. ACT scores and the number of reliever use remained stable in both groups even after step-down. In contrast, FeNO levels increased gradually in step4 group, whereas in the step3 group they increased immediately after step-down. Step-down was considered to be safely performed because the numbers of reliever use and those of moderate or more severe exacerbations during the 48-week period has not changed significantly compared to before step-down. Conclusions: If complete control of asthma, not only of clinical symptoms but also airway inflammation, is achieved by 3-6 months of fixed-dose budesonide/formoterol 4 puffs/day, it should be possible to safely perform step-down to 2 puffs/day.",

In this study, the potential therapeutic effect of β-1, 4 mannobiose (MNB) in a murine model of cedar pollinosis was investigated.Groups of Balb/c mice were intranasally sensitized to Japanese cedar pollen extract, and subsequently administered with low or high dose MNB. Both intraperitoneal and intranasal challenges were performed to monitor for clinical signs. Frequency of sneezing was recorded. Serum, spleen and Peyer's patches were collected for various biomarker analyses. Anti-allergic activity of MNB using RBL-2H3 cells was also evaluated.Significant decrease in sneezing frequency, histamine, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17A and increase in TGF-β and IL-10 concentration were exhibited by the MNB-treated mice. However, Cry j1 and Cry j 2-specific IgE activity remained unaltered. The high dose MNB treatment increased total IgA activity and IL-10, TGF-β and FoxP3 and decreased IL-4, IL-17A, and RORγT mRNA expression. Inhibition of activation of RBL-2H3 cells was observed via decrease in histamine, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and FcεRI mRNA expression.We demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of MNB and conclude that MNB is a potential therapeutic molecular nutritional supplement candidate for treatment of pollen allergy.",

Since it was suggested early that asthma is a risk factor for an increased severity of the infection, the Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology (JSPACI) organized a working group for countermeasures, and investigated asthmatic children admitted to the hospitals for pdm (H1N1) 2009 infection. An appeal was made on the home page of the JSPACI to medical practitioners to input clinical information about asthmatic and non-asthmatic children (0–19 years) admitted to the hospital with pdm (H1N1) 2009 infection. A total of 862 children (390 with asthma, and 472 without asthma) from 61 medical centers were registered, and the data of 333 asthmatic children and 388 non-asthmatic children in all were entered in the analyses. The mean age was 7.4 ± 2.9 years in the asthma group and 6.9 ± 3.8 years in the non-asthma group. The percentage of children admitted for respiratory symptoms was significantly higher in the asthma group than in the non-asthma group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the frequency of admission to the ICU or need for mechanical ventilation support between the two groups. No definite trend was detected in the relationship between the severity of asthma and the intensity of asthma attack. Antiviral drugs were administered within 24 hours in about 85% of the patients in both groups. Asthma may not be a risk factor for severe pdm (H1N1) 2009 infection in children.",

    "abstract": "The effect of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) on the bone status of asthmatic patients is still uncartain, becuase it can differ by race and because there have been few cases in Japan. In this study, the bone status of ICS users with asthma was evaluated in an actual clinical setting in Japan. In 7 participating hospitals, ICS users with asthma and control subjects were age- and gender-matched and recruited into this study. To assess bone status, ultrasound measurements of each individual's calcaneus were made using an AOS-100. The ratio of the osteo sono-assessment index (OSI) to the average OSI corrected for age and gender was denoted as %OSI and used for quantitative assessment. The second %OSI measurement was performed 6 months after the first %OSI one. During the study period, individual treatment remained unchanged. There were no significant differences in the 1st and 2nd %OSI between the ICS users and control subjects. However, the 2nd %OSI significantly decreased compared with 1st %OSI in female ICS users, although there were no significant changes in the male and female control subjects and male ICS users. The 6 month manegement of asthma in the actual clinical setting, including regular ICS use, might have a harmful influence on the bone status of female asthmatic patients. It may be necessary to manage and treat female patients for potent corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis, although further analyses of bone status in asthma patient ICS users will be required.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies show that depression plays an important role in asthma. However, the association between asthma control and severity, and depression is inconclusive. To investigate the association between asthma control and severity, and depression, we assessed differences in asthma control and asthma severity between groups with various grades of depressive state as defined by the PHQ-9 score using data from the Japanese version of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (J-PHQ-9) and a questionnaire survey including the Asthma Control Test (ACT). The ACT scores in the symptom-screen positive (SP) and major/other depressive disorder (MDD/ ODD) group were significantly lower than those in the symptom-screen negative (SN) and non-MDD/ODD groups, respectively. The rate of step1 and of step 3 and 4 in the SP group were significantly lower and higher than those in the SN group, respectively. When the SP group was divided into three, that is minimal, mild, and more than mild (MTM) depressive state subgroups, the ACT scores in the mild and MTM depressive state subgroups were significantly lower than those in the minimal depressive state subgroup. When the MTM subgroup was divided into moderate, moderate-severe and severe depressive state groups, however, there was no significant variation in ACT score and asthma severity among these three depressive state groups. This study is the first, large-scale investigation of the use of the J-PHQ-9 in asthma patients. Using the J-PHQ-9 and the questionnaire, there was a clear association between asthma control and severity, and depression. As the depression became more severe, the existence of other depression-associated factors unrelated to asthma control and severity might be assumed, although further investigation will be required.",

We considered that it is necessary to understand the characteristics of each age group so that we can establish strategies in preventing severe asthma exacerbation. All asthma inpatients who were hospitalized between 2004 and 2011 with SpO2 < 90% (in room air), were breathless at rest, and showed increased respiratory rate and pulse rate were examined. We compared the characteristics among the young age group, middle age group, and advanced age group. The total number of patients was 204. In the young age group, the percentages of patients with irregular visits and non visits to a medical institution were high. This group showed high percentages of smokers and pet owners. The percentage of continuous ICS users in this group was 25.9%. The middle age group had high rates of aspirin-intolerant asthma. The percentage of continuous ICS users in this group was 60.2%. In the advanced age group, the percentages of patients with hypertension/heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and COPD were high. This group showed good treatment adherence. The percentage of continuous ICS users in this group was 77.4%. The characteristics of inpatients with severe asthma vary depending on age.

    "abstract": "The asthma control questionnaires used in Japan are Japanese translations of those developed outside Japan, and have some limitations; a questionnaire designed to optimally evaluate asthma control levels for Japanese may be necessary. The present study was conducted to validate the Japan Asthma Control Survey (JACS) questionnaire in Japanese asthma patients. A total of 226 adult patients with mild to severe persistent asthma were enrolled and responded to the JACS questionnaire, asthma control questionnaire (ACQ), and Mini asthma quality of life questionnaire (Mini AQLQ) at Weeks 0 and 4. The reliability, validity, and sensitivity/responsiveness of the JACS questionnaire were evaluated. The intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were within the range of 0.55–0.75 for all JACS scores, indicating moderate/substantial reproducibility. For internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.76 to 0.92 in total and subscale scores, which were greater than the lower limit of internal consistency. As for factor validity, the cumulative contribution ratio of four main factors was 0.66. For criterion-related validity, the correlation coefficients between the JACS total score and ACQ5, ACQ6, and Mini AQLQ scores were −0.78, −0.78, and 0.77, respectively, showing a significant correlation (p < 0.0001). The JACS questionnaire was validated in terms of reliability and validity. It will be necessary to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy measured by the JACS questionnaire and calculate cutoff values for the asthma control status in a higher number of patients. UMIN000016589",

Although the histamine release test (HRT) using semi-purified sweat antigen (QR) was available for the detection of immediate sweat allergy, the existence of HRT low responders could not be disregarded. Furthermore, it has not been established whether the results of the HRT are consistent with the autologous sweat skin test (ASwST). We aimed to compare the HRT and basophil activation test (BAT) for the diagnosis of immediate sweat allergy. The HRT and BAT were performed on 47 subjects (35 ASwST positive, 12 negative) whose symptoms had worsened on sweating. For the BAT, blood was incubated with QR or crude sweat and CD203c upregulation was assessed. A commercial HRT was performed and histamine release induced by QR was quantified. When excluding non-responders for anti-IgE antibody, the BAT using QR and the HRT had a sensitivity of 100% and 44% and specificity of 75% and 100%, respectively. The BAT and HRT had a positive predictive value of 91.3% and 100% and negative predictive value of 100% and 30%, respectively. The BAT detected 0% non-responders, whereas the HRT identified 22.5%. When using crude sweat for the BAT, the false-positives observed when using QR were not detected. The BAT using QR displayed a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value and a lower number of non-responders compared with the HRT. Furthermore, the BAT using crude sweat can also be an alternative tool for the ASwST.",

To evaluate the effect of topical immunotherapy with squaric acid dibutylester (SADBE) in alopecia areata patients, we performed a retrospective cohort study on 49 alopecia patients who had received topical immunotherapy with SADBE. Patients were evaluated by the change in alopecia severity at 6 and 12 months after the initiation of topical immunotherapy. The improvement rate was calculated by determination of the complete and partial responses rate to treatment with topical immunotherapy by application of SADBE. The improvement rate in all alopecia patients treated with SADBE topical immunotherapy was 57.8% (complete response; 11.1% and partial response; 46.7%). Topical immunotherapy with SADBE is an effective treatment for alopecia areata. Therefore, the current treatment recommendations for alopecia areata with topical immunotherapies are appropriate.",

In addition to including new knowledge of allergens and evidence, the 2016 revision contains a \"Flowchart to Diagnosis\" for the convenience of general doctors. We report the essence of the revised guidelines in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Many patients report questionable drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) to betalactam antibiotics. A workup is required for objectivation. Direct drug provocation tests (DPTs) omitting a prior allergy workup are increasingly recommended as the primary diagnostic approach. However, apart from the risk of severe side effects, DPTs often are a scarce resource in overloaded healthcare-systems. We investigated how many cases can be solved by drug-specific history, drug-specific IgE, and skin tests obviating the need for DPT.We conducted a chart review in a retrospective cohort of 932 patients in an allergy outpatient centre from 2016 to 2017. Patients had been submitted to drug-specific history and specific IgE-, skin prick-, intradermal- and patch-tests with early and late readings with a series of penicillins and cephalosporins but DPTs were no option.Overall, positive in vitro and/or skin tests were found in 96/932 (10.3%) patients. Drug-specific IgE was detected in 40/932 (4.3%) patients, 61/787 (7.8%) patients had positive skin tests. In vitro tests to Pencillin V showed the highest rate of positivity 24/479 (5.0%) and early readings of ampicillin the highest amongst the skin tests (3/49, 6.1%). Immediate skin tests were more often positive than delayed ones (75:45). The combination of all parameters including drug-specific history solved 346/932 (37.1%) cases while 586/932 (62.9%) remained unresolved. Self-reported DHR could be less often confirmed in females and young children (p < 0.05).Testing with betalactams applying simple, cheap, and safe skin and blood tests can solve a third of DHR-cases on a high throughput scale.",

    "abstract": "In Japan, regional differences in asthma mortality have been reported; however, regional differences in asthma exacerbations have not been studied extensively. Therefore, using a health insurance claims database, we investigated the regional differences in the incidence of asthma exacerbations in Japan.This study used data from Medi-Scope (Japan Medical Information Research Institute Inc., Japan)-a nationwide health insurance claims database. Patients with asthma at the index date (the latest date of an asthma-related prescription with an asthma diagnosis before October 1, 2018) were included in the analysis. The pre-index period was defined as 1 year before the index date, and the follow-up period as 1 year after the index date. The incidence of asthma exacerbation events was analyzed for each region.The primary analysis population comprised 24,883 patients who were continuously prescribed ICS or ICS/LABA at least four times during the pre-index period. The incidence rate of asthma exacerbations with hospitalization was the highest in Chugoku (2.95/100 person-years [95% CI, 1.97-4.43]) and the lowest in Kanto (1.52/100 person-years [95% CI, 1.26-1.83]). The incidence rate of asthma exacerbations for the composite outcome of hospitalization, injectable corticosteroid prescription, and oral corticosteroid burst was the highest in Fukui (105.00/100 person-years [95% CI, 64.53-170.85]) and the lowest in Nagasaki (15.69/100 person-years [95% CI, 10.84-22.72]).Regional differences in the incidence of asthma exacerbations as well as their treatments were observed in Japan.",

The study aims to identify wheezing trajectories and investigate their relation with pulmonary function and asthma-related outcomes at 22 years of age.Individuals from a population-based cohort in Brazil (1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort) with post-bronchodilator pulmonary function data at 22 years (3350) were included in the study. From parentally reported (4 and 11 years) and self-reported (15, 18 and 22 years) history of wheezing in the last 12 months, we used a group-based trajectory modelling approach to derive wheezing trajectories.Four trajectories were identified: never/infrequent, transient-early, late-onset and persistent wheeze. After adjustments, wheezing trajectories remained associated with lower post-bronchodilator values of pulmonary function. Individuals in the persistent wheeze trajectory had a markedly poorer pulmonary function and also showed greater odds of asthma-related outcomes compared to other trajectories groups. Those following this trajectory had on average -109 ml (95% CI: -188; -35), -1.80 percentage points (95% CI: -2.73; -0.87) and -316 ml/s (95% CI: -482; -150) lower FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and FEF25-75% respectively; higher odds of self-reported medical diagnosis of allergy (OR 6.18; 95% CI: 3.59; 10.61) and asthma (OR 12.88; 95% CI: 8.91; 18.61) and asthma medication use (OR 9.42; 95% CI: 5.27; 16.87) compared to the never/infrequent group.Wheezing trajectories, especially the persistent wheeze trajectory, were related to lower pulmonary function values and increased risk of asthma and allergy diagnosis in early adulthood.",

    "abstract": "There are problems in diagnosis of allergy to amide-type local anesthetic agents (ALAs), because definitive diagnosis is not obtained by in vivo tests, which are used for the diagnosis. Consequently, patients may be exposed to risk. There are few diagnoses based on in vitro tests, and there are almost no relevant studies. Authors examined involvement of allergic reaction using the leukocyte migration test (LMT) through multiple standpoints in 43 patients who underwent suspected diagnosis of allergy to ALAs. Rate of LMT-positives was 54%, and especially the positive rate of lidocaine hydrochloride preparations was significantly high. In 15 positives to lidocaine hydrochloride preparations, all cases were indicated as positive in a test with drugs containing antiseptic agent, but only 3 cases were indicated as positive in a test with lidocaine hydrochloride alone. In addition, test with paraben was conducted in 4 cases; 2 cases were confirmed as positive. In relevance of histories of drug or food allergies, development rates of ALAs-allergies were the highest in both allergies, and were 35% and 13%, respectively. There is a high possibility that these adverse reactions were caused by pseudoallergy to drug. Even by allergic reactions, it was assumed that 80% of them might be caused by antiseptic agents such as paraben. In addition, it was suggested that ALAs, especially lidocaine hydrochloride preparations have high antigenicity (sensitizing property). Furthermore, it was considered that patients with past history of drug or food allergies have a high potential for manifestation of the reactions.",

To explore latent trends, we conducted a retrospective examination of the age at onset of asthma and specific IgE antibodies against inhalant allergens in Japanese asthmatic children.We conducted a case series study of 103 consecutive children with atopic type of asthma (aged 2 years to 16 years, mean age 9.4 ± 3.4 years). Diagnoses of asthma and allergic rhinitis were defined according to Japanese guidelines. The onset of asthma and allergic rhinitis was also defined as any report of asthma and allergic rhinitis confirmed by a physician. Allergen sensitization was evaluated as specific serum IgE levels for 9 common inhalant allergens in peripheral blood. Atopic type of asthma was defined as a being positive for at least one aeroallergen.Mean age at asthma onset was 2.3 ± 1.9 years, which is slightly lower than that of previous reports, including those published in Japan. A high prevalence rate of up to 80% was found for perennial antigens including Dermatophagoides spp. and house dust, as reported previously. Notably, some of the children aged at 1 year tested positive for these allergens.The age at onset of asthma seems to be decreasing in comparison with previous reports. Furthermore, the age at onset of allergen sensitization against inhalant allergens appears to follow this trend.",

In May or June each year from 1994 to 2007, schoolchildren were assessed for serum Japanese cedar pollen (JCP)-IgE and house dust mite (HDM)-IgE levels, and surveyed regarding nasal symptoms. Among the 220 children initially assessed in the first grade, 69 (31.4%) were already sensitized to JCP at first grade and 119 (54.1%) did not develop JCP sensitivity during the 6-year study at all. In the first grade children who were HDM-sensitized but JCP non-sensitized, JCP-IgE level was significantly elevated compared to the JCP and HDM non-sensitized group. This seems to indicate that HDM sensitization was very strongly associated with JCP sensitization. Elevated serum IgE is a consequence of specific sensitization to HDM and HDM sensitization appeared to develop prior to the start of primary school which distinguishes HDM sensitization from JCP sensitization.",

We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of immunomodulator FTY720 ointment (fingolimod) for mite-induced intractable AD using an NC/Nga mouse model.Female NC/Nga mice that developed severe AD were divided into four groups: (1) FTY720 (0.001% FTY720 ointment), (2) tacrolimus (tacrolimus hydrate ointment) (3) betamethasone (betamethasone ointment), and (4) ointment base (hydrophilic petrolatum), all of which received treatment six times per week. Therapeutic efficacy after two weeks was evaluated in terms of AD severity, histochemical observations (epidermal hypertrophy, mast cell accumulation, and CD3(+) T cell infiltration), transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and epidermal barrier function (filaggrin expression).Betamethasone treatment showed little effect, confirming that the AD was intractable. In the FTY720 group, AD improved significantly compared with the ointment base group, as did epidermal hypertrophy, mast cell accumulation, and CD3(+) T cell infiltration. In contrast, AD in the tacrolimus and betamethasone groups did not improve significantly, nor did epidermal hypertrophy or mast cell accumulation. Furthermore, in the FTY720 group, TEWL decreased significantly compared with the ointment base group, and filaggrin expression significantly increased compared with the betamethasone and ointment base groups.FTY720 ointment is a promising candidate for treatment of intractable AD. These findings also provide the first evidence that FTY720 ointment ameliorates epidermal barrier function.",

The expiration-to-inspiration lung sound power ratio at low frequencies between 100 and 200 Hz (E/I LF) obtained by LSA was compared between healthy volunteers and bronchial asthma patients. Next, post-ICS treatment changes were compared in bronchial asthma patients between the good adherence patients and the poor adherence patients. E/I LF was significantly higher in bronchial asthma patients (0.62 ± 0.21) than in healthy volunteers (0.44 ± 0.12, p < 0.001). The good adherence patients demonstrated a significant reduction in E/I LF from pre-treatment to post-treatment (0.55 ± 0.21 to 0.46 ± 0.16, p = 0.002), whereas the poor adherence patients did not show a significant change. The decrease of E/I LF correlated with the improvement of FEV1/FVC ratio during the ICS treatment (r = −0.26, p = 0.04). The subjects with higher pre-treatment E/I LF values had significantly lower FEV1/FVC and V50,%pred (p < 0.001), and significantly higher FeNO and sputum eosinophil percentages (p = 0.008 and p < 0.001, respectively).

Six autoantibody types were evaluated: antinuclear antibody, anti-cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (MPO-ANCA) and proteinase 3-ANCA. Other clinical data were also recorded concurrently.An antinuclear antibody titre of ≥1:160 presented only in asthma but not in COPD (10% vs. 0%, p = 0.0002). Eosinophil counts in blood were negative predictors of antinuclear antibody in asthma. Conversely, eosinophil counts in blood and immunoglobulin-E levels of ≥100 IU/mL were positively associated with rheumatoid factor in asthma but not in COPD. There was no relationship between antinuclear antibody or rheumatoid factor and disease severity.It is possible that asthma tends to involve autoimmunity associated with antinuclear antibody more frequently than COPD because asthma is the more robust factor for antinuclear antibody positivity. Antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor are associated with eosinophilic responses, but they do not work as biomarkers for disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Refractory asthma, which is caused by several factors including neutrophil infiltration is a serious complication of bronchial asthma. We previously reported that nerve growth factor (NGF) is involved in AHR. NGF-derived induction of hyperalgesia is dependent on neutrophils; however, this relationship remains unclear in respiratory disease. In this study, we examined the roles of neutrophils and NGF in refractory asthma.Using intranasal house dust mite sensitization, we established a mouse model of asthma with mixed inflammation (Mix-in). AHR, NGF production and hyperinnervation of the lungs were examined with or without different inhibitory treatments. The levels of the singlet oxygen markers, 10- and 12-(Z,E)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODE) in the lungs, were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. An in vitro experiment was also performed to evaluate the direct effect of singlet oxygen on NGF production.NGF production and hyperinnervation were higher in Mix-in mice than in conventional eosinophilic-asthmatic mice and were positively correlated with AHR. Asthmatic parameters were inhibited by NGF neutralizing Abs and myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibition. The 10- and 12-(Z,E)-HODEs levels were increased in the lungs and were positively correlated with MPO activity and NGF production. NGF was produced by bronchial epithelial cells in vitro upon stimulation with singlet oxygen.Our findings suggest that neutrophil MPO-derived singlet oxygen induces increased NGF production, leading to AHR and 10- and 12-(Z,E)-HODEs production. These findings may help to develop new therapies targeting this mechanism and to establish a new biomarker for non-type 2 and refractory asthma.",

    "abstract": "Quality of life (QoL) assessment is important in the management of severe asthma, and comorbidities and/or exacerbations may affect longitudinal QoL. However, there are few reports on the longitudinal assessment of QoL in patients with asthma over multiple years and its related factors. This study aimed to clarify the relationship of longitudinal changes in QoL with comorbidities and/or exacerbations during a prolonged observation period in patients with severe asthma. A total of 105 subjects who participated in the Hokkaido-based Investigative Cohort Analysis for Refractory Asthma (Hi-CARAT) with a six-year follow-up were analyzed. QoL was assessed annually, using the Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the subjects were divided into three groups: (1) persistently good QoL, (2) persistently poor QoL, and (3) fluctuating QoL. Assessed comorbidities comprised depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), a key symptom of obstructive sleep apnea. Of 105 subjects with severe asthma, 53 (50%) were classified in the persistently good QoL group, 10 (10%) in the persistently poor QoL group, and 42 (40%) in the fluctuating QoL group. The persistently poor QoL group was associated with shorter time to hospitalization due to exacerbation and the presence of multiple comorbidities. In addition, the presence of EDS was an independent contributor to the fluctuating QoL group compared to the persistently good QoL group. The presence of multiple comorbidities and hospitalization due to exacerbation contribute to longitudinal changes in QoL in patients with severe asthma.",

However, the role of other subsets of ILCs and the differentiation of ILCs in CRSwNPs is not well understood. This study aimed to characterize the ILC subsets and evaluate the differentiation of ILCs from ILC precursors (ILCPs) in NP tissue.ILC subsets and ILCPs were evaluated by flow cytometry in fresh sinonasal mucosa from patients with CRSwNPs and control subjects. Subsets were compared based on clinical variables and immunological features of the patients. Sorted ILCPs (Lin-CD127+CD117+CD45RA+IL1R1+) were cultured with cytokines.The frequency of ILC1s and IFN-γ-producing ILC1s increased in non-eosinophilic NPs, whereas that of ILC2s and IL-5-producing ILC2s increased in eosinophilic NPs, particularly in patients with comorbid asthma. The frequency of ILC1s and IFN-γ-producing ILC1s, and frequency of ILC2s and IL-5-producing ILC2s positively correlated with that of neutrophils and eosinophils, respectively. The proportion of IFN-γ-producing ILC1s positively correlated with clinical severity and levels of IFN-γ and IL-8. The proportion of IL-5-producing ILC2s positively correlated with levels of IL-5, CCL24, and total IgE. ILCPs were identified in NP tissue and differentiated into IFN-γ-producing or IL-5-producing ILCs in response to increased IL-12 and IL-18 or IL-25 and IL-33 in non-eosinophilic NPs and eosinophilic NPs, respectively.ILC1s and ILC2s may be associated with neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation in CRSwNPs, respectively. In addition, ILCPs located in the sinus mucosa could differentiate into IFN-γ- or IL-5-producing cells in response to local cytokine stimuli.",

    "abstract": "This article covers the salient and updated themes of the Japanese Pediatric Guidelines for the Treatment and Management of Asthma (JPGL) 2020 published by the Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology. In the 2020 guidelines, five new clinical questions (CQs) have been added to address the 12 CQs regarding the treatment of childhood asthma. \"Infant and preschool asthma\" is diagnosed when young children (<6 years of age) have three or more episodes of clear expiratory wheezing, which continue for more than 24 h, and symptom improvement can be observed after beta-2 agonist inhalation. In children without clear improvement, diagnostic therapeutic trial for the duration of 1 month with controller treatment can be used. Since long-term management is initiated, the treatment level is adjusted based on the current control status and the management of risk factors, with the provision for holistic care. This underscores the smooth transition of pediatric patients into adult services. There are several differences between the JPGL and the guidelines of other countries. Further evidence is obtained as the utility of the newly proposed management plans should be evaluated in the Japanese population.",

The TRAVERSE open-label extension (OLE) study (NCT02134028) assessed the safety and efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks up to 96 weeks in 2282 patients who completed a previous dupilumab asthma study. The primary endpoint was incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary endpoints included annualized severe exacerbation rate and change from parent study baseline in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), asthma control, quality of life, and blood eosinophil levels. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were evaluated. We report results in 160 (7.8% of exposed population) patients recruited from Japanese centers with non-oral corticosteroid (OCS)-dependent asthma rolled over from two parent studies, and in subgroups with a type 2 inflammatory phenotype. TEAEs were consistent with the parent studies and the known safety profile of dupilumab. One patient permanently discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. Exacerbation rates remained low and were sustained to Week 96, as were improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV1. Rapid, sustained improvements were observed in dupilumab-treated patients who previously received placebo in a parent study, while further improvements in exacerbation rates, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life were observed in those continuing dupilumab. Blood eosinophil levels decreased progressively while on treatment. Treatment-emergent ADA responses were highest in patients who had previously received placebo. Efficacy results were consistent in patients with a type 2 phenotype. Long-term dupilumab treatment was well tolerated and efficacious in patients with non–OCS-dependent, moderate-to-severe asthma recruited from Japan.

    "abstract": "Although sensory nerve dysfunction is related to the pathology of severe uncontrolled asthma and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), the impact of comorbid FGIDs on the pathophysiology of severe uncontrolled asthma remains poorly understood. The aim was to clarify the physiological relationships between severe uncontrolled asthma and FGIDs.Fifty-two patients with severe uncontrolled asthma who visited our hospital between September 2016 and August 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics, other comorbidities including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and biomarkers such as fractional nitric oxide (FeNO) and capsaicin cough sensitivity (C-CS) before the beginning of biologics or bronchial thermoplasty, were compared between patients with and without comorbid FGIDs. C-CS was evaluated by C5 (concentration of inhaled capsaicin that induced five or more coughs), and C5 ≤2.44 μM was defined as heightened C-CS.Seventeen patients had comorbid FGIDs. These patients had a lower FeNO level (21.9 ± 1.7 ppb vs. 33.9 ± 2.8 ppb, P = 0.04), a lower C5 threshold (2.24 ± 2.88 μM vs. 8.91 ± 5.5 μM, P < 0.001), a higher prevalence of comorbid GERD (64.7% vs. 31.7%, P = 0.03), and a higher prevalence of heightened C-CS (70.6% vs. 28.6%, P = 0.007) than those without FGIDs. Analysis of covariance showed a significant effect of FGIDs on C-CS in severe uncontrolled asthma without being affected by GERD.Comorbid FGIDs are associated with heightened C-CS in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, and they may be an important extra-respiratory manifestation of the airway neuronal dysfunction phenotype of severe uncontrolled asthma.",

Using an objective lung sound analysis, we examined the effect of wheeze and the lung function on lung sound parameters in children with asthma.A total of 114 children with asthma (males to females = 80: 34, median age 10 years old) were analyzed for their lung sound parameters using conventional methods, and wheeze and the lung function were checked. The effects of wheeze and the lung function on lung sound parameters were examined.The patients with wheeze or decreased forced expiratory flow and volume in 1 s (FEV1) (% pred) showed a significantly higher sound power of respiration and expiration-to-inspiration sound power ratio (E/I) than those without wheeze and a normal FEV1 (% pred). There was no marked difference in the sound power of respiration or E/I between the patients without wheeze and a decreased FEV1 (% pred) and the patients with wheeze and a normal FEV1 (% pred).Our data suggest that bronchial constriction in the asthmatic children with wheeze similarly exists in the asthmatic children with a decreased lung function. A lung sound analysis is likely to enable an accurate understanding of airway conditions.",

However, it is evident that the impreciseness of using laboratory mice maintained in super-hygienic barrier facilities to mirror relevant aspects of human physiology and pathology exists, which is a major limitation in translating mouse findings to inferring human medicine. Interestingly, free-living wild mice are found to be substantially different from laboratory-bred, specific pathogen-free mice with respect to various immune system compartments. Wild mice have an immune system that better reflects human immunity. In this review article, we discuss recent experimental findings that address the so-called \"wild immunology\", which reveals the contrasting immune features between laboratory-raised mice and their wild companions as well as laboratory mice that have been exposed to a natural rodent habitat. A particular focus will be given to the development of pulmonary mast cells and its possible impact on the use of \"naturalized\" or \"rewilded\" laboratory mice as experimental asthma models.",

In Singapore, two prominent cohort studies, Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) and the Singapore PREconception Study of long-Term maternal and child Outcomes (S-PRESTO), have made notable advancements to our knowledge and understanding of allergic diseases. These cohorts, which comprised of healthy mother-infant dyads recruited from the healthy Singapore population, have shed light on the complex connections between factors influencing health in early life, preconception and pregnancy, on the pathogenesis of allergic disorders in offspring. GUSTO highlighted significant risk factors in antenatal and early life, such as maternal diet, health and lifestyle choices, as well as infant environmental influences, that contributed to the risk of allergic diseases in the Asian Singaporean population. It also identified differential patterns of allergic disease in comparison to other populations, particularly the role of the microbiome in predicting atopic outcomes. Meanwhile, S-PRESTO further explores the long-term maternal and child outcomes associated with preconception health. Findings seem to suggest that prevention of offspring allergic conditions can be achieved through optimizing maternal health and lifestyle choices before conception. Both studies underscore the significance of early life interventions, preconception health, and personalized approaches to effectively manage and prevent allergies. By leveraging the insights and promising findings from GUSTO and S-PRESTO, future work can drive development of preventative strategies and personalized interventions to reduce burden of allergic diseases in the Singapore population.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have reported that the mice passively sensitized with anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) IgE antibody exhibited IgE-mediated cutaneous reaction with an immediate phase response (IPR) at 1 h and a late phase response (LPR) at 24 h after the challenge of dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). We found that the third-phase inflammatory reaction with intense and persisting infiltration of eosinophils, named ‘very late phase reaction (vLPR)’, was induced following IPR and LPR in response to DNFB in actively and passively sensitized mice, and that the peak response of vLPR was at 8 days after the challenge. This reaction was slightly observed in non-sensitized mice. Since the accumulation of eosinophils in vLPR was markedly observed when compared with that of LPR at 24 h, the vLPR may be an important reaction in allergic diseases. The development of vLPR was partly decreased in mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice and was absent in T cell-deficient BALB/c-nu/nu mice in passive sensitization. These results indicate that the vLPR in the triphasic cutaneous reaction may be mainly mediated by T cells and partially by mast cells and/or IgE antibody, and consequently lead to an intense ear swelling accompanying massive infiltration of eosinophils.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of activation of mast cells have been studied in most detail in rat RBL-2H3 cells. These cells respond to antigen via the IgE receptor (FceRI) through sequential activation of the tyrosine kinases, Lyn and Syk, and to adenosine analogs via the adenosine A3 receptor (A3R) and a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, most likely Gi-3. Other receptors, introduced through gene transfection, include the muscarinic ml receptor (mlR) which acts via Gq/11. Stimulation of cells via FceRI, A3R or ml R leads to the activation of phospholipase (PL) C, PLD and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase resulting in the generation of inositol phosphates and diglycerides, an increase of cytosolic Ca2 +, the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the phosphorylation of various proteins by PKC and MAP kinase. The extent and time course of these events varies for each receptor. These variations, as well as the effects of pharmacologic probes, gene transfection and reconstitution of responses in washed permeabilized cells, indicate how these events relate to functional responses. A modest but sustained elevation of cytosolic Ca2 + through an influx of extracellular Ca2 + and activation of PKCβ and PKCδ are sufficient for optimal release of preformed secretory granules. Phosphorylation of a cytosolic PLAj by AMP kinase (p42mapk) and a modest increase in cytosolic Ca2 + are necessary for the activation of Pl^ and the binding of PLA2 to membranes, respectively. Finally, both de novo generation and secretion via Golgi-derived vesicles of certain cytokines are dependent on Ca2 + and PKC as well as additional signals most probably phosphorylation of proteins by Syk and p42mapk.",

There are many reports suggesting that stressful life events, family problems and a behavior pattern that increases psychological conflict may influence the development or relapse of asthma and influence its clinical course. Depression is known as one of the risk factors of fatal asthmatic attack. In laboratory studies, about 20% of asthmatics were considered reactors who showed an airway change after exposure to emotional stress. Studies regarding the pathway of stress effect on allergy and asthma are reviewed and discussed from the standpoint of psychoneuroimmunology; for example, the enhancement of IgE production and increased susceptibility to respiratory infection by stress, conditioned anaphylaxis and nerve/mast cell interaction, the effect of stress on various bronchial responses and the inhibition of the immediate and late asthmatic response by anterior hypothalamic lesioning.",

    "abstract": "Buckwheat extract was analyzed by immunoblotting experiments using sera from nine allergic and three non-allergic individuals. Major IgE-reactive bands were 73, 70, 62, 58 and 54 kDa under non-reducing conditions and were detected in allergic subjects, but not in non-allergic ones. Under reducing conditions, the 73, 70, 62 and 58 kDa bands split to 56 and 24, 52 and 24, 45 and 24, and 43 and 24 kDa, respectively. The 24 kDa molecule was the most prominent band recognized with IgE as well as IgG or IgA. The FA02 cDNA clone, encoding the α and β subunits of the legumin-like storage protein, was isolated from a cDNA library made of immature buckwheat seeds. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA clone is substantially identical to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 24 kDa molecule, which may be identical to that of BW24KD reported by Urisu et al. Consistent with these results, the translation product of the cDNA encoding the putative β subunit was strongly recognized with serum IgE, IgG and IgA from buckwheat-allergic patients. These results suggested that the 24 kDa molecule may be the β subunit of the legumin-like storage molecule of buckwheat.",

    "abstract": "Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to mannitol present naturally in pomegranate (Punica granatum) and cultivated mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) have appeared in the medical literature recently. Mannitol, being inert, cannot react with proteins to form a hapten–carrier conjugate and elicit an immune response. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism of immediate hypersensitivity to this sugar alcohol. A likely mechanism was conceptualized to explain how an individual can become sensitized to mannitol and how free mannitol can elicit an anaphylactic reaction in the sensitized individual. The proposed mechanism for sensitization involves the reaction of D-mannose with exposed amino groups of proteins in vivo to form Schiff base intermediates bearing a D-mannitoyl moiety, which closely resembles D-mannitol. This intermediate appears to be responsible for eliciting the formation of mannitol- specific IgE in susceptible individuals. Once an individual is sensitized with the formation of mannitol-specific IgE, mannitol can cause anaphylactic reactions by acting either as a univalent anaphylactogen or a bivalent hapten. The Schiff base intermediate bearing the mannitoyl moiety appears to act as a true sensitizer, whereas D-mannose appears to act as prosensitizer and D-mannitol acts as a non-sensitizing elicitor. This hypothesis can also explain the mechanism of sensitization and IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to any sugar alcohol.",

We investigated the additive effect of tulobuterol tape in adult asthma patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids. A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter trial was conducted. Male and female patients with a diagnosis of asthma requiring inhaled short-acting β2-agonists despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids took tulobuterol tape (1 mg or 2 mg) and corresponding placebo tapes for 4 weeks. Results: Mean morning peak expiratory flows (PEF) in the 1 and 2 mg/day groups were significantly increased from the baseline value by 23.8 and 35.9 L/min at week 4, respectively. The increase in mean morning PEF in the 2 mg/day group was significantly higher than that in the 1 mg/day group. The mean evening PEF was significantly increased in both treatment groups compared with baseline values. Although the increase in mean evening PEF in the 2 mg/day group was greater than that in the 1 mg/day group, the difference between groups was statistically significant only at week 1. The safety profiles of the two treatments were similar. Conclusions: In patients with persistent asthma who require inhaled short-acting β2-agonists while receiving inhaled corticosteroids, transdermal tulobuterol significantly improved PEF in a dose-dependent manner, i.e., greater effect with 2 mg than with 1 mg per day.",

    "abstract": "The role of Th2 type cytokines in the persistence of chronic rhinosinusitis, especially that induced by non-infectious inflammatory causes, has been noted. However, the original cause of sinus eosinophilia remains unclear and whether the presence of allergic rhinitis (AR) may be a risk factor has been an issue of debate. In the present study, we examined cytokine expression and the distribution of CD4-positive cell subsets in the paranasal sinus mucosa of patients with chronic sinusitis. A total of 133 sinusitis patients was examined. Patients were subdivided into four groups based on the presence of AR and the degree of local eosinophil infiltration. The expression of granulocyte- macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-5, IL-8, IL-16, eotaxin and interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA was detected by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical localization of CD4-, CXCR3- and CCR4-positive cells in the same specimens was quantitatively analyzed using a laser scanning confocal microscope. The group of non-AR patients with low eosinophilia (the AR(−)Eo(−) group) only showed an increase in IFN-γ mRNA expression. In contrast, the other three groups showed similar cytokine profiles, with high expression levels for GM-CSF, IL-5 and eotaxin mRNA. The total number of CD4+ cells was also increased in these three groups. The density of CCR4-positive CD4+ cells was significantly higher in groups with high eosinophilia, irrespective of the presence of AR. As a result, the CXCR3+/CCR4+ cell ratio in the AR(−)Eo(−) group was significantly increased compared with the other three groups. These results indicate that high expression of Th2-type cytokines concomitant with the infiltration of a predominant number of CD4+ cells and their Th2 subsets play a role in the pathogenesis of eosinophil inflammation in sinus mucosa. In addition, the finding that some of the non-atopic patients also shared Th-2 type immune responses provides support for the concept of chronic sinusitis as a Th2-mediated disease process.",

Measurement of hIFN-γ is widely used for various immunological responses for allergic or autoimmune diseases. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is an established immunoassay used to quantify cellular metabolites or cytokines. ELISA requires many incubation and wash steps and is not practically suitable for screening large numbers of samples. We have developed a fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA) method for the detection of hIFN-γ. We measured the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of the hIFN-γ production by interleukin (IL)-18 binding protein and anti-IL-18 monoclonal antibody. The IC50 described by FLISA was compared with that by ELISA. We developed a new system for measuring hIFN-γ using Allophycocyanine (APC) fluorescent protein and compared it with the previous method using Cy5.5. The proposed FLISA had a smaller coefficient of variation than ELISA, and the means of coefficient of variation using the same samples measured by ELISA and FLISA were, respectively, 11.1% and 3.8%, suggesting that the edge effect often giving non-specific results may be smaller in FLISA than in ELISA. The improved FLISA system proposed is ideally suited for efficient measurements of hIFN-γ. This homogeneous and multiplex method will be a powerful tool for high throughput screening for drug discovery research.",

    "abstract": "Asthma pathobiology is remarkable for chronic airway inflammation that fails to spontaneously resolve. No curative therapy is currently available. A growing body of evidence indicates that, in health, inflammation resolution is an active process orchestrated by specific chemical mediators that are elaborated to restore tissue homeostasis. Activated cell membranes release polyunsaturated fatty acids from phospholipids for enzymatic conversion to biologically active mediators with profound regulatory effects on innate and adaptive immunity. Some of these mediators carry anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions that are transduced in a cell-type specific manner via specific recognition sites that initiate regulatory intracellular signals, such as presqualene diphosphate remodeling, to limit pro-phlogistic cell activation. Some of these counter-regulatory lipid mediators have been identified in the airway during asthma and defects in their production are associated with disease severity. In this review, we describe the biosynthesis and bioactions of pro-resolving chemical mediators and provide examples of select mediators and their structural analogs with particular relevance to asthma.",

The administration of montelukast 5 mg or 10 mg once daily was well tolerated and the safety profiles were similar to those of the placebo. There were no significant differences in the incidences of adverse experience or drug-related adverse experience among the montelukast 5 mg, 10 mg groups and the placebo group. Both montelukast 5 mg and 10 mg doses show clinically meaningful efficacy for the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and the safety profiles of those are comparable to that of the placebo.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary dendritic cells (DCs) play critical roles in both allergy and in viral infection. Levels of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) increase after allergen sensitization and viral infection and can modulate the migration and functions of DCs. The present study examines the effects of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection on numbers of DCs and cysLT concentrations in lung tissues of mice sensitized with mite allergen. We examined Control, Dermatophagoides farinae allergen sensitized (Df), RSV infected (RSV) and Df allergen sensitized and RSV infected (Df-RSV) Balb/c mice. We then determined the number of CD11c-positive DCs and the LT concentration in lung tissues of the mice and examined lung pathology and cytokine profiles in thoracic lymph nodes. Infection with RSV significantly enhanced allergic airway inflammation in Df mice with concomitant increases in Th1 and Th2 immunity. The number of DCs and the cysLT concentrations were significantly increased in the lungs of Df and RSV mice and more so in Df-RSV, than in Df mice. The present findings suggest that RSV infection increases the number of DCs and the cysLT concentrations in lung tissues of asthma patients, both of which could result in enhanced allergic airway inflammation.",

This study aimed to develop forecasting models for the total annual count of airborne pollen grains based on data monitored over the last 20 years at the Mie Chuo Medical Center, Tsu, Mie, Japan.Airborne pollen grains were collected using a Durham sampler. Total annual pollen count and pollen count from October to December (OD pollen count) of the previous year were transformed to logarithms. Regression analysis of the total pollen count was performed using variables such as the OD pollen count and the maximum temperature for mid-July of the previous year.Time series analysis revealed an alternate rhythm of the series of total pollen count. The alternate rhythm consisted of a cyclic alternation of an \"on\" year (high pollen count) and an \"off\" year (low pollen count). This rhythm was used as a dummy variable in regression equations. Of the three models involving the OD pollen count, a multiple regression equation that included the alternate rhythm variable and the interaction of this rhythm with OD pollen count showed a high coefficient of determination (0.844). Of the three models involving the maximum temperature for mid-July, those including the alternate rhythm variable and the interaction of this rhythm with maximum temperature had the highest coefficient of determination (0.925).An alternate pollen dispersal rhythm represented by a dummy variable in the multiple regression analysis plays a key role in improving forecasting models for the total annual sugi pollen count.",

Although several kinds of ICSs are currently available, there is no established strategy for ICS selection. Using the data from the 2004 questionnaire surveys by the Niigata Asthma Treatment Study Group, we analyzed relationships between each patient and the ICS employed on the basis of patient background, asthma control and treatment, and indicated characteristics of ICS selection by the physician. Of 2852 cases, 2279 (79.9%) were ICS users, and 1513 (66.4% of ICS users) were classified as being in the fluticasone propionate (FP) group, 438 (19.2%) in the budesonide (BUD) group, and 240 (10.5%) in the hydrofluoroalkane-beclometasone (HFA-BDP) group, indicating that FP was a standard ICS in this study. The mean age was significantly lower in the BUD group (52.3 +/− 18.2 years) and was significantly higher in the HFA-BDP group (59.9 +/− 17.0 years) than that in the FP group (55.8 +/− 16.6 yaers). The proportion of female patients was significantly higher not in the HFA-BDP (46.5%) but in the BUD group (59.0%) than in the FP group (51.1%). These results indicated that BUD was frequently prescribed to young female and HFA-BDP was employed in the elderly patients irrespective of gender compared with FP. Our study indicates that ICS selection is reasonably adapted to each patient's background at least in the surveyed area. We need to elucidate the characteristics of ICS selection further in the future as new ICS and devices are developed.",

    "abstract": "Salmon is one of the most widely consumed seafoods in Japan and many other countries around the world. Due to the confirmed cases of salmon-induced allergy, the food sanitation law in Japan stipulates salmon as one of the specific food items for which labeling is recommended when used as an ingredient of processed foods. However, trout, the landlocked form of anadromous salmon, is not subject to the allergenlabeling requirements, even though both populations belong to a single species. Since no supporting data have been demonstrated to make a clear distinction between these two populations in terms of allergenicity, we comparatively examined their allergenic properties using sera from patients allergic to fish. Extracts of Oncorhynchus nerka from different habitats were obtained: kokanee (landlocked) and red salmon (anadromous). Control extracts were derived from four other species. This study focused on the (1) IgE-binding capacity of the fish extracts in patients' sera (n = 50), (2) ELISA inhibition test (n = 6), and (3) inhibition immunoblot test (n = 8) between the kokanee and red salmon. The extracts from kokanee and red salmon showed the highest correlation with each other in terms of the IgE-binding capacity, and showed complete (100%) reciprocal cross-inhibition in the ELISA inhibition test. On immunoblotting, there was no marked difference in the staining pattern between the two extracts, and each IgE-binding band gradually disappeared when the patients' sera were preincubated with the counterpart antigen in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that kokanee has similar allergenic properties to red salmon.",

Case Summary: A 27-year-old man with atopic dermatitis developed atopic keratoconjunctivitis including corneal ulcer with plaque deposition in his right eye. Conjunctival inflammation in the right eye was resistant to topical steroid therapy. Surgical removal of corneal plaque and administration of autologous fibronectin eye-drops resulted not only in resurfacing of the corneal epithelium but also in amelioration of conjunctival inflammation. This case suggests that loss of corneal epithelial integrity likely exacerbates conjunctival allergic inflammation and that restoration or maintenance of the barrier function of the corneal epithelium may be one of the important targets for the treatment of severe ocular allergic diseases.",

Thirty-three and 31 patients were treated with tulobuterol patches and theophylline, respectively. % PEF measured in the morning and before bedtime was significantly higher at all times in the treatment period compared with baseline in the tulobuterol patch group (p < 0.001), and was significantly higher in the tulobuterol patch group compared with the theophylline group. FeNO was similar and unchanged from baseline in both groups. There were no drug-related adverse events in either group.

These barriers also encounter innocuous antigens, such as foods, airborne antigens, and microbiota. The mucosa has developed a sophisticated immune system that can mount robust immune responses against pathogenic antigens, while maintaining mucosal tolerance against non-pathogenic antigens. Accumulating evidence indicates that the mucosal epithelium, dendritic cells, and a subtype of T cells with regulatory properties play important roles in the development and maintenance of mucosal tolerance. Moreover, the micribiota also contribute to regulating the mucosal immune system. A failure to develop or the breakdown of mucosal tolerance can result in allergic diseases, such as food allergy and asthma. By taking advantage of the unique characteristics of the mucosal immune system, strategies that induce regulatory cells in vivo and, thereby, reconstitute mucosal tolerance may be used to develop novel therapies that are suitable for treating or preventing of allergic diseases.",

We therefore evaluated aerosol characteristics and physicochemical stability of the admixture of an inhaled corticosteroid suspension with a beta2-agonist solution.An 8-stage cascade impactor was used to measure the particle size distribution of admixture of Pulmicort® Respules® (budesonide, 0.5mg/2mL) with Meptin® Inhalation Solution Unit (procaterol hydrochloride, 30μg/0.3mL) from a jet nebulizer, PARI LC Plus®. Concentration of each drug was assayed with high-pressure liquid chromatography. Physicochemical compatibility was also assessed up to 24 hours after mixing.With regard to budesonide, impactor parameters such as mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and respirable mass (RM) were comparable between admixtures and single-drug preparations (2.92 ± 0.03 vs 2.99 ± 0.14μm, 146.8 ± 2.9 vs 147.6 ± 8.2μg, respectively). On the other hand, delivery rates of procaterol increased when admixed with budesonide suspension, resulting in significantly higher RM (15.1 ± 0.8 vs 10.2 ± 0.5μg, p < 0.01). Variations from initial concentration in the percentages of drug remaining at any time point were less than 10%, and there were no appreciable changes in pH of the admixtures for up to 24 hours.There is a possibility that admixture might influence of aerodynamic characteristics of procaterol, but not budesonide. In vivo data will be needed for the clinical implications of our findings.",

However, it is a challenge for practitioners to master the various devices available and train patients on the accurate use of inhalers. Thus, establishing a system to instruct patients on how to accurately use inhalers is essential. We prepared a DVD and accompanying user manual explaining the operation of each inhaler device used in Japan. This pilot study aimed to examine the efficacy of these materials.The subjects were 33 outpatients with bronchial asthma who received treatment in our facility for asthma and had already received conventional inhalant training. The oral medication and inhalants used by the patients were not changed. The patients were randomly assigned to a DVD viewing group or non-viewing group; various parameters were comparatively examined after 4 weeks.Significant improvements in Asthma Control Test scores, inhalation technique, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, impulse oscillometry resonant frequency, and induced sputum eosinophil count were observed in the DVD viewing group at 4 weeks post training.Pulmonary function and inflammatory parameters improved significantly in the DVD viewing group. These findings suggest that unnecessary step-up of asthma treatment can be avoided, leading to treatment cost reduction. Training patients with asthma in accurate inhaler use improves quality of life and therefore has great clinical significance. Hence, this method should be used more extensively in Japan and worldwide.",

To prevent such incidents, we assessed the causative factors of these incidents.The Anaphylaxis Working Group of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology requested that society members register cases in which adrenaline auto-injectors were unintentionally used. One hundred cases were reported from June 2015 to March 2016. We identified the root causes of 70 child and 25 adult cases, separately.The incidents occurred with repeated prescriptions as well as the first prescription. Three cases resulted in a failure to administer an adrenaline auto-injector to children with anaphylaxis. Four caregivers used it with improper application (epilepsy or enteritis). Among the child cases, the median age at the time of the incident was 5.5 years (range, 2-14 years). Five children injected the adrenaline auto-injector on their own body trunk. Twenty children were not the allergic patients themselves. Improper management protocol of the device and the child's development were concomitantly involved in most of the cases. A variety of human behaviors were identified as the root causes in the adult cases. At least 34 cases were associated with mix-ups between the actual and training device.Health workers should provide sufficient education regarding safety use of adrenaline auto-injector for caregivers tailored to their experience levels at both first and repeated prescriptions. Such education must cover anticipatory behavior based on normal child development. Devices should also be further improved to prevent such incidents.",

    "abstract": "Most of the patients develop food allergy early in life. The factors related to parental immune condition might be one of the conceivable causes.We reported murine models of food allergy and oral OVA tolerance. To investigate the influence of parental immune condition on infant food allergy, female and male mice with food allergy or oral tolerance were mated with each other.Food allergy was suppressed by decreased IgE production in the offspring of mice with food allergy. On the contrary, anaphylaxis for OVA was induced in the offspring of mice with oral tolerance. The suppression of food allergy being dependent on a maternal factor was revealed in the offspring after cross-mating mice with food allergy and oral tolerance. Because OVA-specific IgG, presumed to be from the allergic mother, was detected in the serum of naïve infants from mothers allergic to food, we assumed that the suppression was dependent on a specific IgG. The serum IgG purified by a G-protein column was administered before OVA sensitization in the food allergy model, and OVA-specific IgE production was found to be diminished in the administered mice. However, OVA-specific monoclonal IgG1 and IgG2a administration could not suppress food allergy. Because we detected OVA-IgG immune complex in the serum of mothers allergic to food, it might be a cause of maternal immune suppression.We demonstrated that maternal specific IgG conjugated food antigen is an important factor related to the development of food allergy and acquiring tolerance.",

    "abstract": "TYRO3 is a member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) receptor tyrosine kinase family and functions to limit type 2 immune responses implicated in allergic sensitization. Recent studies have shown that multiple intronic variants of TYRO3 were associated with asthma, implying that genetic variation could contribute to errant immune activation. We therefore hypothesized that expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of the TYRO3 gene influence the development of allergic diseases (including asthma and allergic rhinitis) in Japanese populations.We performed a candidate gene case-control association study of 8 eQTLs of TYRO3 on atopy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis using 1168 unrelated Japanese adults who had GWAS genotyping. We then examined the genetic impact of rs2297377 (TYRO3) on atopy and allergic rhinitis in 2 other independent Japanese populations.A meta-analysis of 3 Japanese populations (a total of 2403 Japanese adults) revealed that rs2297377 was associated with atopy and allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.29 and 1.31; P = 0.00041 and 0.0010, respectively). The risk allele at rs2297377 correlated with decreased expression of TYRO3 mRNA. The gene-gene interaction between HLA-DPB1 and TYRO3 was not significant with regard to sensitization. The estimated proportion of atopy and allergic rhinitis cases attributable to the risk genotype was 14% and 16%, respectively.Our study identified TYRO3 as an important susceptibility gene to atopy and allergic rhinitis in Japanese.",

    "abstract": "Given increased risk of cardiovascular events in asthma we hypothesized that lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), an enzyme involved in atherosclerosis, is associated with proinflammatory and prothrombotic blood alterations in this disease.In 164 adult asthmatics (63 with severe asthma) we measured plasma Lp-PLA2 activity using the PLAC test. We determined its relations to inflammation and prothrombotic blood alterations.In asthma, Lp-PLA2 was inversely related to the age (β = -0.1 [-0.18 to -0.02]) and was lower in women (n = 122 [74%], 205 [182-242] vs. 243 [203-262] nmol/min/ml, p = 0.001). Interestingly, Lp-PLA2 correlated negatively with the asthma severity score (β = -0.15 [-0.23 to -0.07]), being 10.3% higher in those with non-severe (mild or moderate) asthma (n = 101, 62%) as compared to the severe disease subtype (224 [191-261] vs. 203 [181-229], p = 0.006 after adjustment for potential confounders). Lp-PLA2 activity was positively related to the levels of low-density lipoprotein (β = 0.1 [0.02-0.18]), triglycerides (β = 0.11 [0.03-0.19]) and glucose (β = 0.1 [0.02-0.18]) and inversely to the tumor necrosis factor α (β = -0.27 [-0.35 to -0.2]), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (β = -0.1 [-0.19 to -0.02]) and fibrinogen (β = -0.12 [-0.21 to -0.03]), as well as prothrombin (β = -0.16 [-0.24 to -0.08]), and parameters describing thrombin generation potential, such as endogenous thrombin potential (β = -0.14 [-0.21 to -0.06]) and peak thrombin generated (β = -0.2 [-0.28 to -0.12]).Elevated Lp-PLA2 activity in non-severe asthmatics suggests increased atherosclerotic risk in this group. Lower Lp-PLA2 activity accompanied by its inverse relationship to inflammatory or prothrombotic blood biomarkers observed in turn in severe asthmatics might be related to the pathogenesis of more severe asthma phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The long-term prognosis of asthma with airflow obstruction is poorly understood in Japan. The aim of this retrospective 26-year study was to investigate the long-term mortality risk of airflow obstruction in asthmatics.Using data from the Omuta City Air Pollution-related Health Damage Cohort Program, mortality risk ratios of airflow obstruction in Japanese Individuals were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards models. Airflow obstruction was considered to be present when the forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1)/forced vital capacity ratio was <0.7 and FEV1 predicted was <80% based on spirometry.Among the 3146 victims with chronic respiratory diseases, 697 with adult asthma were selected. Median follow-up period was 26.3 (range 0.9-40.9) years. The airflow obstruction group (n = 193) showed significantly higher rates of mortality related to respiratory problems (risk ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.51 [1.86-1.93], P = 0.0017) and asthma attacks (1.86 [1.30-2.66], P = 0.0011) than the without airflow obstruction group (n = 504). Airflow obstruction was an independent risk factor for both respiratory-related (1.84 [1.36-2.49], P = 0.0001) and all-cause (1.44 [1.17-1.76], P = 0.0008) mortality after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status. More severe airflow obstruction was significantly associated with poorer prognosis.This long-term cohort program revealed the impacts of asthma with airflow obstruction as an independent mortality risk. Findings suggest that intervention and prevention of airflow obstruction can reduce long-term mortality in patients with asthma.",

A phase 3, single-arm, open-label study was performed to evaluate a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant, for the treatment of acute attacks in Japanese patients with HAE Type I or II. After the onset of an acute attack, icatibant 30 mg was administered by the patient or a healthcare professional via subcutaneous injection in the abdomen. Eight patients who had an attack affecting the skin (n = 4), abdomen (n = 3), or larynx (n = 1) were treated with icatibant (3 of the injections were self-administered). The median time to onset of symptom relief was 1.75 h (95% confidence interval, 1.00–2.50), and all patients had symptom relief within 5 h after administration. The time to maximum plasma concentration of icatibant was 1.79 h, and the maximum plasma concentration was 405 ng/ml. Seven patients experienced an injection site reaction, and 3 patients had adverse events (2 patients had a worsening or repeat HAE attack 29.0 and 18.3 h after icatibant administration, respectively, and 1 had headache). Although the number of patients is small, the efficacy and tolerability of icatibant for acute attacks were demonstrated in Japanese patients with HAE, regardless of self-administration or administration by healthcare professional.",

    "abstract": "Fish roe allergy is a common health problem in countries where sea food is a major part of the diet, such as Japan. β′-component (β′-c) in fish roe has been identified as a major antigen for patients who show hypersensitivity to various fish roes. However, little is known about causative antigens for patients reactive to fish roe of specific species. Serum and basophils were obtained from patients who had reactivity to roes of Gadus chalcogrammus (GC) and/or other fish species. GC roe specific antigens were analyzed by immunoblotting, histamine release assay (HRA) and mass spectrometry. Recombinant-fragments of vitellogenin (Vg) were obtained by the Escherichia coli expression system. Serum IgE of a patient with specific reactions to GC roe bound to 15, 28, 40 and 70 kDa-proteins in GC roe extract. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that proteins in these bands contained fragments corresponding to Vg. Immunoblotting of Vg immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti-Vg antiserum from the extract revealed 15, 28 and 54 kDa fragments bound by the patient's IgE. These bindings were inhibited by the pretreatment of recombinant phosvitin (rPv) and β′-c (rβ′-c). Fractions obtained by native gel electrophoresis containing 15, 28 and 54 kDa proteins, but not the other fractions, induced significant histamine release from the patient's basophils. Sera of the other patients with GC roe specific-IgE showed IgE binding to rPv and/or rβ′-c. The 15, 28 and 54 kDa-fragments of Vg which include structures of Pv and β′-c, could be antigens for GC roe specific type-I-hypersensitivity.",

In a case-control study, 28 children with AD and 12 normal children without AD were exposed to one of two air conditioner modes (conventional or wind-free) for 2 h. Skin temperature, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and skin pH were measured on right cheek and forearm at pre- and post-exposure time points. We also measured filaggrin and FDPs from the volar surface of the forearm. In AD patients, skin temperature on the forearm decreased after exposure to the conventional and wind-free modes (P < 0.001 and P = 0.026), and TEWL on the cheek and the forearm decreased in the wind-free mode (P = 0.037 and 0.002). Skin pH on the cheek increased only after exposure to the conventional mode in AD group (P = 0.002). However, no changes in TEWL and skin pH were found after exposure to either the conventional or the wind-free mode in the control group. In AD children, the levels of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA) and cis-urocanic acid (UCA) were reduced only after exposure to the conventional mode (all P = 0.033). The percent changes of PCA and cis-UCA were higher in the AD group than those in the control group after exposure to conventional mode (P = 0.029 and 0.046). Skin barrier function in children with AD may be altered by the exposure to cold airflow from a conventional air conditioner.",

We analyzed the prevalence, demographic and clinical characteristics of children with oral symptoms to Rosaceae fruits/soybean; defined as oral symptoms occurring shortly after ingesting apple, peach, cherry or soybean. Additionally, we assessed the correlation between the prevalence and external data on alder sensitization rates by prefecture.Responses from 41,264 primary and 35,302 secondary school students were analyzed. The prevalence of oral symptoms to Rosaceae fruits/soybean was 0.99%, 95%CI: 0.89-1.09% and 2.75%, 95%CI: 2.59-2.93% among each age group, respectively. Children with oral symptoms were more likely to have parental and personal history of allergic disease compared to those without symptoms. Oral symptoms were experienced more often in children with severe spring allergic rhinitis or have both allergic rhinitis and wheeze. There was a strong correlation between the prevalence of oral symptoms and alder sensitization rates by prefecture among both age groups (r = 0.63, p < 0.001 and r = 0.76, p < 0.001, respectively).Oral symptoms to Rosaceae fruits/soybean, which is suggestive of PFS was reported by 1-3% Japanese school children.

Pathogenic immune cells are presumed to be closely related to the pathogenesis of intractable diseases, but the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases remain unclear. The balance between the T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cell fractions has been believed to be responsible for the differences among inflammatory diseases. However, an analysis of the cells infiltrating inflammatory lesions in mice and humans revealed the generation of pathogenic Th cells with different characteristics at the memory T-cell stage in the peripheral tissues in various inflammatory diseases. In this review, we will summarize and discuss recent progress regarding the characteristics of pathogenic Th cells, their mode of action, and the molecular mechanisms that regulate the pathology of intractable chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with tissue fibrosis.

Serum levels of substance P (SP) were reportedly significantly elevated, in correlation with the severity of CSU. Hemokinin-1 (HK-1) reportedly induced histamine release from LAD2 cells via MRGPRX2. We aimed to investigate HK-1's role in CSU.The concentrations of HK-1 and SP were measured using ELISAs. Skin- and synovium-derived cultured MCs were generated by culturing dispersed skin and synovial cells, respectively, with stem cell factor. MRGPRX2 expression in the MCs was reduced using a lentiviral shRNA silencing technique.Anti-SP Ab used in the SP ELISA showed 100% cross-reactivity to HK-1, but anti-HK-1 Ab showed 0% cross-reactivity to SP. The serum level of HK-1 was significantly lower in patients with CSU (n = 151) than in non-atopic healthy control (NC) subjects (n = 114). The EC50 of histamine release from MCs induced by HK-1 (5056 nM) was 12-fold higher than by SP (426 nM). Brief pretreatment of MCs with HK-1 at concentrations of 3.0-10 μM significantly reduced histamine release by 0.1 μM SP. However, brief incubation of MCs with HK-1 did not elicit rapid MRGPRX2 internalization.In NC subjects, high HK-1 concentrations may desensitize MGRPRX2-mediated MC activation, thereby preventing MC degranulation by SP.",

    "abstract": "Thrombomodulin treatment modulates the properties of dendritic cells (DCs) converting them from immunogenic to tolerogenic and inducing its own expression on DCs. Thrombomodulin binds to the inflammatory mediator, high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), antagonizing signalling through its receptor, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). To test if soluble thrombomodulin could antagonize HMGB1 signaling via RAGE on DCs. DCs were prepared from mouse bone marrow cells or human monocytes. In some experiments dendritic cells were sorted into thrombomodulin + and thrombomodulin− populations. Expression of surface maturation markers was determined by flow cytometry following treatment with thrombomodulin in the presence or absence of HMGB1. Thrombomodulin + dendritic cells secrete less HMGB1 into the medium. HMGB1 reduces the effects of thrombomodulin on expression of DC maturation markers. Treatment with thrombomodulin reduces the expression of maturation markers such as CD80 and CD86 and increases the expression of thrombomodulin on the DC surface. Treatment of DCs with neutralizing anti-HMGB1 antibody acted synergistically with thrombomodulin in increasing thrombomodulin expression on DCs. Treatment with thrombomodulin can still reduce the expression of surface markers on DCs derived from mice that are deficient in RAGE showing that thrombomodulin can affect DCs by an alternative mechanism. The results of this study show that thrombomodulin modulates DCs both by antagonizing the interaction of HMGB1 with RAGE and by an independent mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Background: Exercise-induced wheezing (EIW) may be a symptom of asthma and is a predictor of exercise- induced bronchoconstriction, transient narrowing of the lower airway following exercise in the presence or absence of diagnosed asthma. Population-based studies with a large sample of EIW in relation to age, sex, current asthma severity and medication usage have been sparse. Methods: International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaires were distributed at 885 nurseries, 535 primary schools, 321 junior high schools and 190 high schools, respectively, across Japan, and the corresponding data on 46,597, 41,216, 45,960 and 51,104 children were analyzed. Results: Prevalence of EIW was 4.8, 4.7, 17.9 and 15.4% for each of the four educational facility types, respectively. Among 24,103 current asthmatics, 20.9, 28.7, 76.1 and 73.6% of subjects for the 4 educational facility groups reported to have experienced EIW, respectively. Severity of current asthma was associated with the risk of EIW; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of children with asthma attack every day for having EIW once a week or more, using intermittent asthmatics as reference group, were 24.48 (19.33 to 31.01) adjusted for other covariates. Among current asthmatic kindergartners, increase in risk for EIW due to ascending severity of current asthma was mitigated by daily use of leukotriene receptor antagonist (p for interaction = 0.071). Conclusions: EIW was not rare among current asthmatic children. An increased risk for EIW was in accordance with increasing severity of current asthma and this relation was mitigated with leukotriene receptor antagonist daily use among kindergartners.",

    "abstract": "Minimal persistent inflammation (MPI) contributes to hyperreactivity in allergic rhinitis. However, little is known regarding whether pre-onset activation of eosinophils and mast cells is present or not in Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP). Furthermore, a prophylactic effect of intranasal corticosteroids on such MPI in JCP has not been investigated. We designed a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Twenty patients with JCP were examined outside the pollen season (UMIN000008410). Nasal provocation with paper discs containing extracts of Japanese cedar pollen was performed once a day for 3 consecutive days. Onset of nasal symptoms was monitored over 15 min after each provocation. The levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and tryptase in nasal secretions were examined. Fluticasone furoate nasal spray or placebo treatment was started one day before the first provocation. In the placebo group, 25% of the patients showed onset of nasal symptoms following provocation on the first day. In addition, 75% and 68% of the patients showed symptom onset on the second and third day of provocation, respectively. After the first provocation, the levels of ECP and tryptase in nasal secretions were significantly increased. These increases were seen not only in symptomatic but also in asymptomatic subjects in response to provocation, and the levels were similar between these subjects. Prophylactic treatment with fluticasone significantly suppressed the increase in nasal ECP and tryptase associated with repeated provocations. These results suggest that pre-onset activation of eosinophils and mast cells is present in experimental JCP, and that prophylactic treatment with intranasal corticosteroids has the potential to control such activation.",

    "abstract": "Intravital imaging is becoming more popular and is being used to visualize cellular motility and functions. In contrast to in vitro analysis, which resembles in vivo analysis, intravital imaging can be used to observe and analyze cells directly in vivo. In this review, I will summarize recent imaging studies of autoreactive T cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) and provide technical background. During their in vivo journey, autoreactive T cells interact with many different cells. At first, autoreactive T cells interact with endothelial cells in the airways of the lung or with splenocytes, where they acquire a migratory phenotype to infiltrate into the CNS. After arriving at the CNS, they interact with endothelial cells of the leptomeningeal vessels or the choroid plexus before passing through the blood-brain barrier. CNS-infiltrating T cells become activated by recognizing endogenous autoantigens presented by local antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This activation was visualized in vivo by using protein-based sensors. One such sensor detects changes in intracellular calcium concentration as an early marker of T cell activation. Another sensor detects translocation of Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) from cytosol to nucleus as a definitive sign of T cell activation. Importantly, intravital imaging is not just used to visualize cellular behavior. Together with precise analysis, intravital imaging deepens our knowledge of cellular functions in living organs and also provides a platform for developing therapeutic treatments.",

The aim of this study was to examine the eosinophil infiltration in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract in patients with BA using esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Patients with BA who had upper GI tract symptoms were enrolled. Patients who received systemically administered steroids were excluded. Eosinophil infiltrations in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were examined with regard to the endoscopic findings and pathological findings of biopsy specimens (UMIN000010132). Ninety patients were enrolled from October in 2012 to September in 2014. Thirty-six were male, 54 were female, and the mean age was 57.5 years. Eighty-one (90%) used inhaled corticosteroids. Fourteen patients (15.6%) had reflux esophagitis, 8 of whom had grade A and 6 had grade B. No patient with EoE was observed. One female patient who had marked eosinophil infiltration in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum was diagnosed as having eosinophilic gastroenteritis, but endoscopy showed only mucosal edema in the antrum. Another female patient who had marked eosinophil infiltration in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum was diagnosed as having eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and endoscopy showed erosions in the antrum and the duodenum. Three patients had eosinophil infiltration in the stomach, but none of them had severe symptoms. Patients with asthma who had upper gastrointestinal symptoms rarely had eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders. Biopsy specimens are of high importance in the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders even if there is no remarkable endoscopic finding.",

    "abstract": "Allergen-specific immunoglobulins have a crucial role in allergic diseases. Most wheeze episodes develop before school age, and allergic rhinitis later develops during early elementary school years. However, the clinical background and cytokine/chemokine profiles associated with changes in immunoglobulins during early school-age are poorly understood.This study used blood samples from children participating in the JECS Pilot Study. We examined nineteen kinds of aeroallergen-specific immunoglobulins (IgE, IgG1, IgG4, and IgA) levels in patients at age 6 and age 8. Fluctuations of Der f 1- and Cry j 1-specific immunoglobulins levels during the two periods were compared to assess the frequency of allergic statuses and clusters of cytokine/chemokine profiles.The medians of aeroallergen-specific IgE levels did not fluctuate, and almost all IgG1 and IgG4 decreased. In IgA, four (e.g., Der f 1) increased, whereas the other four (e.g., Cry j 1) decreased. The ratio of the Der f 1-specific IgG1 level at age 8 to that at age 6 was higher in children with poor asthma control than in children with better asthma control. Moreover, the cytokine/chemokine cluster with relatively lower IL-33 and higher CXCL7/NAP2 was associated with lower Der f 1- and Cry j 1-specific IgG4 levels, but not IgE levels.The cluster of cytokine/chemokine profiles characterized by lower IL-33 and higher CXCL7/NAP2 was associated with the maintenance of aeroallergen-specific IgG4 levels. This result provides a basis for considering the control of aeroallergen-specific immunoglobulins.",

First, three-week-old BALB/c female mice were intragastrically administered EW or each protease-digested EW product, followed by intraperitoneal ovalbumin (OVA) or ovomucoid (OVM) injection with alum. Serum OVA- and OVM-specific IgE titers were measured. Second, six-week-old mice were sensitized with OVA/OVM, and the rectal temperature was measured after intraperitoneal administration of EW or each protease-digested EW. Third, EW or each protease-digested EW product was applied to the tape-stripped skin for 3 days/week for 3 weeks. Serum OVA- and OVM-specific IgE titers were measured.Orally administered pepsin-digested EW product (PDEW) and Thermoase PC10F-digested EW product (TDEW) significantly suppressed OVA-/OVM-specific IgE production. Neither product elicited a body temperature decline (anaphylaxis) in OVA-/OVM-sensitized mice. Serum OVA-/OVM-specific IgE levels were significantly lower in mice epicutaneously exposed to PDEW or TDEW than in EW-exposed mice.Two protease-digested EWs showed potential as optimal EW products for early introduction for primary prevention of egg allergy.",

In the phase 3 NAVIGATOR study (NCT03347279), tezepelumab reduced exacerbations by 56% compared with placebo in adults and adolescents with severe, uncontrolled asthma. This analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in NAVIGATOR patients recruited in Japan. NAVIGATOR was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients (12–80 years old) were randomized 1:1 to receive tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. Endpoints assessed included: the annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks (primary endpoint) and the change from baseline to week 52 in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-6 score. The safety of tezepelumab was also assessed. Overall, 97 patients recruited in Japan were randomized (tezepelumab, n = 58; placebo, n = 39). The AAER over 52 weeks was 1.54 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 2.64) with tezepelumab compared with 3.12 (95% CI: 1.82, 5.35) with placebo (rate ratio: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.99]; 51% reduction).

The frequency of adverse events was similar between treatment groups (tezepelumab, 86.2%; placebo, 87.2%).

The present review provides an update on information on JCPsis based on clinical data from our research group, through the support of the Department of Health and Welfare (Japanese Government), during the period from 1988 to 1997, because this disease is infrequently documented internationally despite a large number of publications from Japan. The information on JCPsis presented here may be of use in the management of various kinds of pollinosis prevalent in other countries. The prevalence rates of JCPsis vary from district to district and also depend on the age of the subjects, the method of analysis and the year of examination in population. Yet, on an average, the incidence of JCPsis is presumed to be 10-20% in adults and 5-10% in children. The risk factors for sensitization and the onset of symptoms seem to be dependent on the amount of air-borne pollen, the age of school children, hereditary disposition, including human leukocyte antigen type and the high levels of specific IgE in childhood. Because pollen counts also vary depending on many factors, such as the type of pollen samplers used, yearly variations, the number of pollen count stations, the atmospheric temperature and solar radiation in the previous year of the season, accurate predictions of daily and seasonal pollen counts are rather difficult. Commercial crude extracts and purified allergenic substances Cry j I and II correlate well with the skin test and the radioallergosorbent test. Japanese cedar pollen has an allergenic component that is cross-reactive with Japanese cypress. In many patients, the onset of symptoms occurs on the day when the air-borne pollen count is 10/cm2 (the Durham method) and, if severe symptoms occur due to intense exposure to pollen, the symptoms will last for a long time despite variations in the pollen count (priming effect). Eye glasses, face masks and keeping windows and doors of the house closed are useful measures for pollen avoidance. Symptom control during the season is not difficult by the continuous use of new anti-allergic drugs during the season. If medication is started 1–2 weeks prior to the onset of the season, more satisfactory results can be obtained. Specific immunotherapy can not only control symptoms, but can reduce the amount of medication and, after completion of the regimen, long- term remission without medication can be expected.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms regulating the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into Th1/Th2 subsets have been intensively investigated in the mouse. This report summarizes the current knowledge regarding naive human CD4 T cell maturation in vitro. The Thl/Th2 dichotomy is less absolute in human than in mouse T cells; indeed, unlike their murine counterparts, human Th2 cells retain the capacity for responding to and of inducing the production of interleukin (IL)-l2. When adequately stimulated, naive CD4 T cells release not only IL-2, but also high levels of type 1 cytokines (interferon (IFN)-γ, lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) as well as low levels of type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13 and IL-10). lnterleukin-4 may be produced by every single naive T cell at very low levels that are sufficient to promote the acquisition of a Th2 phenotype upon repetitive stimulation in the absence of exogenous cytokine. Interleukin-l2 primes naive T cells for increased production of IFN-γ, decreased production of IL-4 and IL-5 and increased responsiveness to IL-12. The effects of IL-12 on IFN-γ and IL-5 as well as on IL-12 responsiveness are prolonged, whereas those on IL-4 are transient. However, repetitive stimulation in the presence of IL-12 leads to Thl effectors. Thus, IL-12 is required not only for the induction but also for the development and maintenance of a Thl response. Upon interaction with dendritic cells (DC), naive T cells produce several cytokines (IL-4, IFN-γ) and express CD40L, which triggers IL-1 2 production by DC. The balance between these endogenously produced cytokines determines the lymphokine-producing phenotype of primed cells, this balance depending upon the genetic background, the nature and the strength of the T-cell-receptor-mediated signal and the activation state of DC.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to describe patterns in weekly asthma visits to Accident and Emergency (A&E) facilities in Trinidad during 1997 and to examine associations with climatic conditions. A census of patients with asthma, defined as those who required bronchodilator nebulization, was taken at five A&E facilities in the Caribbean island of Trinidad from 1 January to 31 December 1997. Data on patients' ages, gender and dates of visits were obtained from the A&E records. Climate variables, including rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, were obtained from the island's meteorological office. There was a total of 27 848 asthma visits to the five facilities during 1997, of which the pediatric population (< 16 years) accounted for 43.7%. There were steady increases in adult and elderly visits from January to December. In the pediatric population, there was a decrease in visits from weeks 5–36 in the year, followed by a sharp increase during the next 3 weeks. This sharp increase coincided with the start of the academic school year in September after a 2 month break. The results of multiple regression analysis indicated that pediatric visits to the A&E were positively associated with temperature and wind speed, while visits by adults were positively associated with temperature and relative humidity. There were no independent predictors of asthma visits in the elderly. The results show that there is an association between the climate and asthma visits in Trinidad. However, there is a need for further research to explain the increase in pediatric visits at the start of the school year as well as to elucidate the mechanisms for the observed associations between asthma visits and climate variables.",

    "abstract": "We have shown that some patients presenting with chronic bronchodilator-resistant non-productive cough have global atopic tendency, airway cough hyper-sensitivity without non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic inflammation of the trachea and bronchi, abbreviated as atopic cough (AC). Histamine H1 receptor antagonists are effective in relieving the cough in some patients with AC but not in others in whom corticosteroids are needed to improve the cough. The aim of the present study was to compare the intensity of eosinophil infiltration in biopsied bronchial submucosa and sequential bronchoalveolar lavage (SBAL) fluids between two subgroups of patients with AC: (i) group A, successfully treated with histamine H1 receptor antagonists; and (ii) group B, requiring corticosteroids. Sequential BAL was performed using three 50 mL aliquots of physiologic saline solution and then bronchoscopic bronchial biopsy was performed in group A (n = 9) and B (n = 9) patients. Sequential BAL was also performed in normal controls (NC; n = 13). The first SBAL fraction was analyzed as bronchial lavage fluid (BLF) and the mixed fluid of the second and third SBAL fractions as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The number of eosinophils in the bronchial subepithelium was significantly (P = 0.0134) greater in group B patients (median 8.3 cells/mm2; range 3.6–21.9 cells/mm2) compared with group A (median 3.6 cells/mm2; range 0–10.0 cells/mm2). However, There were no significant differences in the number or percentage of eosinophils in BLF or BALF between group A, group B and NC subjects. These findings confirm that eosinophils do not infiltrate the peripheral airways of AC and suggest that corticosteroids are required to relieve the cough in more severe illness of AC, in which submucosal eosinophilic inflammation of the central bronchi is more intensive compared with the milder illness successfully treated with histamine H receptor antagonists.",

We performed skin prick tests (SPT) to 13 molds in 341 children from six schools and studied the microbial status of all school buildings. Subsequently, mold specific IgE was measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to 10 molds in 31 of those children with a positive (≥ 3 mm) or weak SPT reaction (1–2 mm) and in 62 age- and sex-matched controls with no such reactions. Mold-specific IgE was elevated by EIA (> 0.35 lU/mL) to at least one of the 10 studied species in 12 children (39%) with and in two children (3%) without skin test reactions. The calculated prevalence of elevated mold-specific IgE was 5% in the non-selected and 10% in children selected by respiratory morbidity. Six children had IgE to the dampness-indicative mold Aspergillus fumigatus, five children had IgE to the common outdoor mold Cladosporium herbarum and four children had IgE to the uncommon, but highly allergenic, indoor mold Rhizopus nigricans. All 14 children who had elevated IgE to molds were boys, 13 had atopy by skin tests and 12 had either asthma or had wheezed. However, no species-specific association was found between IgE or SPT responses and exposure to molds. Mold allergy, as assessed by IgE measurements or skin tests, is rare in children. School- aged asthmatic boys having exposed to indoor air dampness seem to form a susceptible group for mold allergy, being at risk for worsening of their asthma.",

    "abstract": "It is known that the symptoms of allergic rhinitis can significantly reduce the quality of life of the patient. One of such typical symptoms of allergic rhinitis is nasal obstruction. Nasal obstruction is currently thought to be closely related to the presence and abundance of lipid mediators, such as leukotriene and thromboxane (TX) A2. The novel drug ramatroban, a TXA2 receptor antagonist, which has been developed by Bayer Yakuhin Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), has been demonstrated, in clinical trials, to improve nasal obstruction in the treatment of patients with allergic rhinitis and it has recently become commercially available. In the present study, ramatroban was administered for 28 days to 10 patients who were diagnosed with perennial allergic rhinitis but were untreated. Changes in self-reported symptom scores and in vivo allergic reaction parameters were assessed during three observational periods. From baseline scores, all three symptom scores after 28 days treatment with ramatroban declined clearly in all patients, except for one patient who suffered a cold during the study period and had aggravated rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction as a result. The concentrations of histamine and TXB2 (a metabolite of TXA2) in the nasal fluid induced by antigen challenge after the 28 day treatment period also decreased in most subjects compared with concentrations during the pretreatment period. The symptom scores for nasal obstruction during the pretreatment period were correlated with the concentration of TXB2 in antigen-induced nasal fluid. The present study reconfirmed the clinical efficacy of a post-marketed drug, namely ramatroban, in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. In addition, the results suggest that ramatroban suppressed the secretion of chemical mediators in nasal that are thought to be involved in the allergic reaction in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "More than one mechanism contributes to persistent increases in eosinophils in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus. The levels of eotaxin in lavage samples obtained after antigen challenge showed strong correlation with lavage levels of eosinophil counts and eosinophil protein-X. In the eosinophil endothelial transmigration (TEM) assay using nasal microvascular endothelial cells, eotaxin showed the most potent effect among various eosinophil chemoattractants. In addition, treatment of eosinophils with anti-CCR3 monoclonal antibody significantly blocked eosinophil TEM induced by homogenate of nasal mucosa. These results indicate that eotaxin has an important role in eosinophil-dependent inflammation in nasal mucosa and suggest that blocking eotaxin or CCR-3 may be useful for new therapeutic tools of allergic rhinitis. Several mechanisms for eosinophilic inflammation in paranasal sinus may be proposed: a series of reaction systems may be involved, such as swollen mucosa caused by type I allergic reactions in the nasal cavity, closure of natural orifices, a hypoxic state in the maxillary sinus, accelerated production of eotaxin and RANTES from fibroblasts and eosinophilic infiltration. These reaction systems would include tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-β, as well as Th2 cytokines, including interleukin-4 and −13, so that this phenomenon hardly occurs in infective rhinitis.",

The mechanisms by which neutrophils are recruited to the airways and contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma remain to be elucidated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), which can induce both tissue accumulation and activation of neutrophils and eosinophils, has been shown to be increased in the airways of severe asthma. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether TNF-α is associated with neutrophilic inflammation in asthma. Following an inhalation of hypertonic saline, induced sputum was obtained from 9 healthy controls, 9 mild persistent asthma patients who were treated with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; and 7 severe persistent asthma patients who were treated with combinations of drugs including high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, oral prednisolone, bronchodilators, and leukotriene receptor antagonist. After 0.1% dithiothreitol (DTT) homog- enization, they were examined for total cell count, cellular differentiation, and the concentrations of TNF-α and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The concentration of TNF-α was not correlated with neutrophils in healthy controls or mild asthma patients. In sputum from severe asthma patients, however, the concentration of TNF-α is significantly correlated with both the percentage of neutrophils and the concentration of MPO. The concentration of TNF-α is not correlated with the percentage of eosinophils in healthy controls, mild asthma patients, or severe asthma patients. TNF-α may be a contributing molecule for both accumulation and activation of neutrophils in the airways of severe asthma.",

In toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), the relevance of HHV infection to the symptoms is unclear. Patients with a diagnosis of DIHS (n = 7), TEN (n = 5) and SJS (n = 4) were included in the present study. These patients were evaluated for the presence of active HHV-6, HHV-7 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections by serological tests and polymerase chain reaction with blood. More than 3 weeks after the onset of DIHS, HHV-6 serological tests revealed a remarkable rise in IgG antibodies in six patients, including one treated without steroids. Human herpesvirus-6 DNA was detected in blood from three patients. In one patient with DIHS, reactivation of CMV was shown without reactivation of HHV-6, whereas in three patients anti-CMV IgG antibodies increased after the rise of anti-HHV-6 IgG antibodies. Anti-HHV-7 IgG antibodies did not show remarkable rises in any of these patients. As for patients with TEN and SJS, anti-HHV-6, anti-HHV-7 and anti-CMV IgG antibodies showed no significant increase, except for one patient in whom anti-HHV-6 and anti-HHV-7 IgG antibodies increased, but not more than 1: 160, after steroid therapy. Human herpesvirus-6 DNA was not detected in the blood of those patients. Human herpesvirus-6 reactivation in patients with DIHS is not due to non-specific reactivation induced by steroid therapy, but to events specific to DIHS. We hypothesize that DIHS may occur as a result of reactivation of HHV, especially HHV-6, accompanied with an allergic reaction to drugs, followed by a substantial immune response to the virus that is probably responsible for visceral involvement.",

One of the important differences is the classification of asthma severity ; the frequencies of asthma symptoms in Steps 2, 3 and 4 of the JPGL2002 are similar to those of Steps 1, 2 and 3, respectively, of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). In the JPGL2002, infantile asthma is classified separately, considering the necessity of special concern due to the characteristic features, and three different protocols for long-term management are provided according to the patients' ages : younger than 2 years, 2 to 5 years, and older than 5 years. For patients older than 5 years, inhaled glucocorti- costeroid (ICS) is recommended for asthma with symptoms more than once a month but less than once a week (Step 2). The GlNA classifies this as Step 1 and does not recommend the use of ICS. The recommended dosages of ICS for Steps 3 and 4 of the JPGL2002 are, however, smaller than those for Steps 2 and 3, respectively, of the GINA. It should be clarified in future studies whether or not such a use of ICS can lead to earlier and more frequent remission of asthma, hopefully resulting in the asthma being outgrown.",

    "abstract": "The importance of smoking in bronchial asthma has been thoroughly investigated. Although a high smoking rate has been recognized in Japan, there have been few studies of the relationship between active smoking and bronchial asthma, and little analysis of the gender difference in this relationship. The aims of this study were to examine the contribution of active smoking to asthma and to clarify any gender difference. For 8 weeks from September through October 2000, a smoking questionnaire survey was performed on adult patients with bronchial asthma, and their attending physicians, in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The questionnaire surveyed asthma control, asthma-related emergencies and satisfaction in daily life. The attending physicians were questioned about patient profiles and medications. Patients were classified into three groups: non-smokers (NS), ex-smokers (ES) and current smokers (CS). For examination of gender differences, the CS group was compared with the NS group, due to variable duration of smoking and of cessation of smoking in the ES group. Complete data were received from 2947 cases. Of the male patients, 340 (23.0%) were in the CS group, 325 (22.0%) were in the NS group and 812 were in the ES group. Of the female patients, 109 (7.4%) were in the CS group, 1132 (77.4%) were in the NS group, and 229 (7.4%) were in the ES group. The male CS group had more severe asthma-related symptoms in the morning and at night, more sputum and cough in the morning, and more severe sleep disturbance than the male NS group. In the female patients, these differences were not detected. A logistic and multiple regression analysis confirmed these significant differences between male and female asthma patients. The gender differences in the susceptibility of asthma to smoking suggests the need for gender-specific strategies for smoking cessation, although further investigation is required.",

Twenty-four asymptomatic subjects were randomized to instill 0.025% levocabastine ophthalmic suspension in one eye and vehicle in the other eye 10 minutes before the CAC test. Signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis were scored 10, 15, and 25 minutes after the CAC test. The duration of drug effects was also evaluated by allergen rechallenge 4 hours after levocabastine administration. The itching score for each eye as the primary efficacy endpoint was assessed 15 minutes after the CAC test using a 5-point scale. The mean itching score in the levocabastine-treated group was 0.08 ± 0.06, which was significantly lower than the mean score of 1.98 ± 0.16 in the vehicle group (P< 0.0001). The redness and chemosis of the conjunctiva were also improved significantly compared with the vehicle group. Levocabastine showed prolonged efficacy in inhibiting itching (0.42 ± 0.12 vs 0.94 ± 0.17, P<0.0002) and redness (1.04 ± 0.18 vs 1.42 ± 0.22, P < 0.01) of the conjunctiva upon the rechallenge test.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro pharmacological profile of KP-496. The antagonistic activities of KP-496 for leukotriene (Lt) D4 and thromboxane (TX) A2 receptors were examined using the LTD4 - and U46619-induced contractions of the isolated guinea pig trachea. The selectivity of KP-496 was examined using various agonist-induced contractions in the isolated guinea pig trachea. KP-496 produced parallel rightward shifts of the LTD4 and U46619 concentration-response curves in a concentration-dependent manner. Schild plot analyses of the antagonistic activities of KP-496 demonstrated that it is a competitive antagonist for LTD4 and TXA2 receptors with pA2 values of 8.64 and 8.23, respectively. The LTD4 antagonistic activity of KP-496 was comparable to that of pranlukast and zafirlukast but was more potent than that of montelukast. The TXA2 antagonistic activity of KP-496 was comparable to that of seratrodast. KP-496 and seratrodast also inhibited the prostaglandin (PG) D2 - and PGF2α-induced contractions of the isolated guinea pig trachea. KP-496 had no effect on the histamine-, acetylcholine-, serotonin- and substance P-induced contractions of the isolated guinea pig trachea. These results indicate that KP-496 is a selective dual antagonist for LTD4 and TXA2 receptors. LTD4 and TXA2 play important roles in asthma, and antagonists for these mediators are being used for the treatment of asthma. Thus, KP-496 is expected to become a novel potent therapeutic agent for asthma.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophils are considered to be the major inflammatory cells in asthma. Since regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) is a potent chemoattractant for various important inflammatory cells such as eosinophils as well as memory T cells potentially recruiting these cells to an inflamed focus, RANTES has been considered to play a key role in various allergic disorders such as asthma. To extend our understanding of the participation of eosinophils and T cells in relation to the production of RANTES in response to the specific allergen in asthma, we examined the production of RANTES from peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured with specific allergen in atopic asthma patients by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. It was revealed that mononuclear cells produced RANTES but not eotaxin in response to the specific allergen in asthma. RANTES production from mononuclear cells of asthma patients with eosinophilia was greater than that of asthma patients without eosinophilia. Moreover, in this study, no differences in RANTES production between CD4 negative cells and CD8 negative cells were observed. Taken together, these findings may suggest that mononuclear cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis, particular in eosinophil and T lymphocyte recruitment into the inflamed focus of asthma through RANTES production in response to the specific allergen.",

Eosinophils are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma, pollinosis, and atopic dermatitis as well as in the inflammatory response to parasitic infections. Recent studies using selective activators and inhibitors of individual PKC isoforms have revealed that this enzyme is involved in eosinophil dynamics such as cell motility and other functions. However, the role of PKCs in eosinophil functions has been not wholly understood. in this review, we have focused upon and summarized the current knowledge regarding the role of PKC isoforms in eosinophil functions.",

A 24-year-old man with an episode of local urticaria on his first contact with a sea anemone (Stichodactyla haddoni), developed dyspnea, severe urticaria and hypotension on exposure to water containing the dead bodies of the organism. To study whether this reaction was mediated by antigen-specific IgE, we performed a histamine release test with blood, Western blotting with serum and lymphocyte proliferating test with peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the patient, for the homogenate of sea anemones. The homogenate of sea anemones induced histamine release from the blood of the patient, but it also induced histamine release from the blood of control subjects. Moreover, it also caused hemolysis of blood of all donors. However, Western-blotting demonstrated the presence of an 86 kd protein-specific IgE in the serum of the patient. Protein antigen (s) in sea anemones may cause anaphylactic shock under the influence of the cytolytic effects and/or lymphocyte-stimulating activity elicited by the toxin of sea anemones.",

Matsutake mushroom (Tricholoma matsutake) is a typical edible mushroom available in autumn in Japan. We encountered an 8-year-old Japanese girl who developed anaphylaxis after ingesting matsutake mushrooms. We studied the case in detail, by measuring specific IgE antibodies and conducting skin tests, to confirm the diagnosis. We also detected seven cytokines and chemical mediators in the blood in order to study the pathophysiology of the anaphylaxis. We diagnosed anaphylaxis caused by ingestion of matsutake mushrooms based on the following. A skin prick test showed a positive reaction to matsutake mushroom, and specific IgE antibody for matsutake mushroom extract was detected in the patient’s serum by fluorometric ELISA. Blood levels of chemical mediators including histamine, ECP, tryptase and cytokines such as IL-6, IL-5 and IL-10 but not IFN-γ also increased significantly during the allergic episode. We demonstrated that chemical mediators including histamine, tryptase and ECP as well as several cytokines were involved significantly during the episode of anaphylaxis. In addition, eosinophils as well as mast cells played significant roles in the anaphylaxis. Furthermore, CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells that released IL-10 were likely activated during the anaphylaxis. Matsutake mushroom should be considered as a causative allergen in food anaphylaxis.",

A total of 279 adult patients with bronchial asthma referred to our hospital between June and December 2004 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into LTRA treated and untreated groups. Frequency of acute exacerbations and number of visits to emergency rooms and of hospital admissions were analyzed as indicators of frequency of infections and asthma exacerbation over the previous 12 months. Irrespective of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, frequency of infections was significantly lower in the LTRA treated group (0.3 ± 0.7 times/year) than in the LTRA untreated group (1.6 ± 4.2 times/year) (P < 0.05), suggesting that LTRA therapy prevents common cold-like symptoms. Frequency of acute exacerbations and number of hospital admissions were significantly lower in the LTRA treated versus LTRA untreated group (0.4 ± 0.8 versus 2.7 ± 4.3 times/year and 0.0 ± 0.2 versus 0.4 ± 0.7 times/year, respectively; both P < 0.01). When the patients were divided into ICS treated and untreated groups, none of the parameters analyzed differed significantly between the two groups, although all parameters tended to be lower in the ICS treated group. Adult asthma patients undergoing treatment with LTRAs exhibit lower incidence rates of common cold-like symptoms than those not receiving LTRAs. LTRAs play an important role in reducing the incidence of common cold-like symptoms among asthma patients and in suppressing exacerbation of asthma symptoms possibly associated with these symptoms.",

In the study of susceptibility loci to vasculitis in MRL mouse models, we learned that systemic vasculitis developed in a cumulative effect of multiple gene loci, each of which by itself did not have a significant effect to induce the related phenotype, thus indicating a polygenic system. The mice developed vasculitis in an additive manner of multiple genes with a hierarchical effect. Some of the susceptibility loci seemed to be common to those in other collagen diseases as well. Moreover, the loci controlling tissue specificity of vasculitis were present. One of the positional candidate genes for vasculitis showed an allelic polymorphism in the coding region, thus possibly causing a qualitative difference in its function. As a result, a particular combination of polygenes with such an allelic polymorphism may thus play a critical role in leading the cascade reaction to develop vasculitis, and also a regular variation of systemic vasculitis. This is designated as the polygene network in systemic vasculitis.",

There have been no studies to show the relationship between eNO measured by offline methods and the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids. The study population comprised asthmatics at our outpatient clinic. We measured eNO levels by two methods (\"eNOs\" was measured with a Sievers kit; and \"eNOc\" was measured with a kit from the Center for Environmental Information Science, Japan). We also used spirometry to test bronchial hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine (PC20Ach). We recruited 192 stable asthmatics. There was a significant relationship between eNOs and eNOc (r = 0.919, p < 0.001). LogPC20Ach levels were negatively correlated with eNOs or eNOc levels (eNOs, r = − 0.31, p < 0.001; eNOc, r = − 0.23, p = 0.0013). We classified the subjects into two groups based on eNOs levels ((A) the subjects with high eNOs levels (n = 92) and (B) the subjects with normal eNOs levels (n = 100) ); logPC20Ach was significantly correlated with eNOs (r = − 0.34, p = 0.001) or eNOc (r = − 0.28, p = 0.0075) but not correlated with %FEV1 in (A), whereas logPC20Ach was not significantly correlated with eNO but significantly correlated with %FEV1 (r = 0.33, p = 0.002) in (B). Levels of eNOs and eNOc were correlated with the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine in adult asthmatics treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Our findings suggest that offline monitoring of eNO will facilitate the management of bronchial asthma in patients treated with these drugs.",

The imbalance between Th1 and Th2 is considered to be the pathogenesis of allergic and autoimmune disorders.

We investigated the expression of IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-12 from LPS- or PHA-stimulated PBMCs at 30°C or 37°C using ELISA and Real-time PCR. We measured the change of NF-kappaB activity at 30°C or 37°C with LPS stimulation using the reporter gene assay. IFN-gamma production from LPS-stimulated PBMCs at 30°C was up-regulated compared with 37°C. IL-5 and IL-10 production from PHA-stimulated PBMCs at 30°C were down-regulated compared with 37°C. This augmented IFN-gamma production was caused by the up-regulation of IL-12 production from CD14+ blood monocytes. Both IL-12 mRNA and IL12 protein at 30°C were up-regulated compared with 37°C. NF-kappaB, the key molecule for the expression of IL-12, was also augmented at 30°C compared with 37°C. Hypothermia up-regulated the expression of IL-12 and IFN-gamma due to the augmented NF-kappaB activity. It is suggested that hypothermia modifies the pattern of cytokine gene expression.",

However, whether eosinophil activation results from virus-induced inflammation or local eosinophilia per se precedes the onset of wheezing remains unknown. In the present study, we examined the association between the presence of nasal eosinophils during respiratory tract infection (RTI) and subsequent wheezing in young children. A total of 35 young children less than 3 years of age who visited our outpatient clinic with rhinorrhea between April and July 2004 were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Subjects who were given diagnoses of allergic rhinitis were excluded. In all the subjects, the presence of eosinophils in nasal secretions was determined. The subjects were followed, and the cumulative incidences of wheezing during the subsequent 2- and 12-month periods were examined. According to a logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, family history, allergies, and wheezing at entry, young children with nasal eosinophil infiltration during acute RTI had a significantly higher risk of wheezing during the subsequent 2 months, compared with those without nasal eosinophil infiltration (adjusted odds ratio, 27.618, p = 0.016). Our findings not only suggest that nasal eosinophil testing may serve as a convenient clinical marker for identifying young children at risk for subsequent wheezing, but also shed new light on the role of eosinophils in the onset of wheezing in young children.",

It has recently been demonstrated that allergen-linked immunostimulatory DNA (ISS) is effective in stimulating an allergen-specific Th1 response with decreased allergenicity. The objective of this study is to investigate whether ISS linked to purified ragweed allergen Amb-a-1 (AIC) can inhibit local allergen-specific Th2 and induce allergen-specific Th1 responses in explanted nasal mucosa of ragweed-sensitive subjects. In addition, we set out to determine whether AIC is more effective compared to stimulation with unlinked Amb a 1 and ISS. Tissue from ragweed-sensitive patients (n = 12) was cultured with whole ragweed allergen (RW), Amb-a-1, AIC, Amb-a-1 and ISS (unlinked), or tetanus toxoid (TT) for 24 hours. IL-4, − 5, − 13, TNF-α and IFN-γ mRNA-positive cells were visualized by in situ hybridization and T cells, B cells and neutrophils were enumerated using immunocytochemistry. RW or Amb-a-1 increased the number of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 mRNA + cells in the tissue compared to medium alone. AIC had similar cytokine mRNA reactivity as control tissue. AIC and TT increased IFNγ-mRNA expression. Unlinked Amb-a-1 and ISS showed similar effects to AIC, however this response was weaker. The number of TNF mRNA + cells, T cells, B cells and neutrophils remained unchanged. AIC is effective in stimulating a local allergen-specific Th1- and abolishing Th2-cytokine mRNA reactivity in the nose and may be considered as a strong candidate for an improved approach to immunotherapy in ragweed-sensitive individuals.",

In the DFb group, the conjunctiva showed similar findings to those of atopic keratoconjunctivitis, i.e. intraepithelial pseudotubular formation, Torus-form infiltration due to massive lymphocytes in the palpebral conjunctiva and gelatinous hyperplasia in the limbus with subepithelial granuloma composed of lymphocytes and eosinophils. Subepithelial infiltration of eosinophil density in the DFb group [878.4 ± 399.7 cells/mm2 (mean ± SD)] was significantly higher than in the other 2 groups (DFco 85.6 ± 40.1 Ba 49.2 ± 32.3) (P < 0.001). Total serum IgE concentration and HDM-specific serum IgE antibody concentration in the DFb group and the DFco group were significantly higher compared with those in the NT group. Topical application of an ointment containing DFb to both the skin and eyes of NC/Nga mice can induce an atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) model in these mice.",

    "abstract": "Although a challenge test using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is crucial for diagnosis of aspirin-induced asthma (AIA), it also has drawbacks in terms of possible side effects. Therefore, alternative in-vitro diagnostic methods for AIA are awaited. Nineteen stable non-AIA patients (9 males and 10 females; mean age, 49.4 ± 4.8 years), and 20 AIA patients (9 males and 11 females; mean age, 51.1 ± 4.8 years) were enrolled in this study. CD11b and CD16 expressions on the peripheral-blood granulocytes after administration of aspirin and different concentrations of PGE2 in vitro were examined using flowcytometry. Aspirin induced a significant increase in CD11b expression on eosinophils (CD16 negative granulocytes) in 19 AIA patients and one non-AIA patient. Increase in CD11b expression on eosinophils by aspirin administration was suppressed by PGE2 in a dose-dependent manner. The measurement of CD11b expression on peripheral-blood eosinophils showed very high sensitivity and specificity of (− 95%) in diagnosing AIA. Although this method requires laboratory facilities for flowcytometry, it may be very useful in diagnosis of AIA without side effects. In addition, PGE2 may be involved in regulation of CD11b expression on eosinophils by aspirin administration.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis in the alveolar septa is thought be a critical factor in pulmonary emphysema. Angiomotin-like protein 1 (AmotL1) is involved in angiogenesis via regulating endothelial cell function. However, the role of AmotL1 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema has not been elucidated. The objective of this study is to evaluate the expression of AmotL1 in lung tissues from a murine model with emphysema, as well as from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, we analyzed the regulation of AmotL1 expression by TNF-α and IFN-γ in endothelial cells in vitro. Nrf2 knockout mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) for 4 weeks, and the down-regulated genes affecting vascularity in the whole lung were identified by microarray analysis. This analysis revealed that the mRNA expression of AmotL1 decreased in response to CS when compared with air exposure. To confirm the protein levels that were indicated in the microarray data, we determined the expression of AmotL1 in lung tissues obtained from patients with COPD and also determined the expression of AmotL1, NFκB and IκBα in cultured normal human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) that were stimulated by TNF-α and IFN-γ. We found that the number of AmotL1-positive vessels decreased in the emphysema lungs compared with the normal and bronchial asthmatic lungs. IFN-γ pretreatment diminished the TNF-α-induced AmotL1 in the cultured HLMVECs by blocking the degradation of IκBα. These results suggested that IFN-γ exhibits anti-angiogenesis effects by regulating the expression of TNF-α-induced AmotL1 via NFκB in emphysema lungs.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-19 (IL-19), a member of the IL-10 family, is characterized as the cytokine suppressing the release and function of several proinflammatory cytokines. For regulation of local reaction in allergic rhinitis (AR), IL-19 might play an especially important role. We examined effects of IL-19 on IL-4-induced eotaxin production by human nasal fibroblasts. Early receptor-mediated events (expression of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 [STAT6]) by IL-19 was examined. Knockdown methods by RNAi were administered to investigate the involvement of those signal transductions. Pretreatment with IL-19 downregulates IL-4-induced eotaxin production, but not interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced RANTES. Pretreatment with IL-19 suppressed the IL-4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation. The IL-19 induced SOCS-1, but not SOCS-3 or SOCS-5. The SOCS-1 knockdown by RNAi diminished pretreatment with IL-19-induced down-regulation of eotaxin production. These results suggest that IL-19 down-regulates IL-4-induced eotaxin production via SOCS-1 in human nasal fibroblasts. In non-hematopoietic cells in AR, IL-19 might be an immunosuppressive factor.",

The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of switching from SFC to FBC in patients with asthma not adequately controlled under the former treatment regimen. This was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled longitudinal study in 87 adult patients with an Asthma Control Questionnaire, 5-item version (ACQ5) score of greater than 0.75 under treatment with SFC 50/250 μg one inhalation twice daily (bid). SFC was switched to FBC 4.5/160 μg two inhalations bid. Study outcomes included ACQ5 score, peak expiratory flow (PEF), FEV1, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) at the end of treatment period. Eighty-three patients completed the study. ACQ5 scores improved and exceeded the clinically meaningful difference after 12 weeks of treatment and well-controlled asthma (ACQ5 score ≤ 0.75) was attained in 37 (44.6%) patients. Minimum and maximum PEF and FEV1 values improved significantly, but not FeNO values, after switching from SFC to FBC. Switching ICS/LABA combination therapy is a useful option in the management of asthma that is not optimally controlled.",

Both leukocyte migration activating activity (LMAA) and leukocyte migration inhibitory activity (LMIA) are involved in the development of drug allergies. However, no cytokines associated with LMIA have been identified to date. Because CXCL8 played an important role in neutrophil infiltration and activation, we performed the LMT and measured CXCL8 levels in patients with hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics (beta-lactams) and antipyretic analgesics (APAs) and investigated the pathogenic mechanism of hypersensitivity to these drugs. The LMT was performed according to an improved version of the agarose plate method and CXCL8 levels in the reacted solution that had been stored as described were measured using a solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Migration index (MI) values for the LMT were 77.7 ± 11.7 for patients with hypersensitivity to beta- lactams and 83.6 ± 1.9 for those with hypersensitivity to APAs. The CXCL8 concentrations were significantly higher in patients after beta-lactams administration (175.9 ± 71.2 ng/mL) than those without beta-lactams administration (48.3 ± 34.9 ng/mL). The CXCL8 concentrations were significantly lower in patients after APAs administration (41.7 ± 24.3 ng/mL) than those without APAs administration (63.1 ± 30.2 ng/mL). Increased CXCL8 levels produced by beta-lactams administration were accompanied by LMIA. CXCL8 may be involved in LMIA and play a role in beta-lactam allergies. In contrast, the LMIA detected in patients with allergies to APAs may be a cytokine or chemokine other than CXCL8.",

Acute bronchitis due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during infancy exhibits an asthma-like pathogenesis, suggesting that it may be associated with the subsequent development of asthma. However, the mechanism by which RSV infection leads to development of asthma has not yet been fully elucidated. Infants younger than 36 months were enrolled and classified into three groups. Group I included patients hospitalized with RSV-induced bronchitis. These patients were further stratified into two sub-groups according to whether the criteria for the modified Asthma Predictive Index (mAPI) had been met: Group I consisted of mAPI (+) and mAPI (−) patients; Group II included patients with food allergy as a positive control group; and Group III included children with no allergy as a negative control group. Serum periostin and SCCA levels were measured in the groups. This study was registered as a clinical trial (UMIN000012339). We enrolled 14 subjects in Group I mAPI (+), 22 in Group I mAPI (−), 18 in Group II, and 18 in Group III. In Group I, the serum periostin and SCCA levels were significantly higher during the acute phase compared with the recovery phase. However, no significant differences were found between Group I mAPI (+) and mAPI (−). The serum periostin and SCCA levels increased during acute RSV bronchitis. Both periostin and SCCA may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute bronchitis due to RSV.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial cell-derived IL-33 has an important role in the initiation and activation of innate allergic inflammation. IL-33 acts as a cytokine through the ST2 receptor (ST2L) and it stimulates the production of Th2 cytokines. Soluble ST2 (sST2) may regulate Th2 responses by neutralizing the activity of IL-33. Basophils express ST2L and produce IL-5 in response to IL-33. However, the role of the epithelial cell-basophil interaction and sST2 in IL-5 production remains unclear.Cultured human bronchial epithelial (hBE33) cells, that contained the human IL-33 gene (i.e., hBE33 cells) and a human basophilic cell line, KU812 cells, were used to study the epithelial cell-basophil interaction in the production of IL-5 induced by HDM.At 15 min after incubation, HDM stimulated the rapid release of IL-33 from cultured hBE33 cells. IL-33 and the supernatant of HDM-treated hBE33 cells stimulated IL-5 production from KU812 cells. Anti-IL-33 antibody and anti-ST2 antibody treatment of KU812 cells suppressed IL-5 production, which had been induced by the supernatant of HDM-treated hBE33 cells. The hBE33 cells secreted sST2 in a time-dependent manner. The production of sST2 by KU812 cells co-cultured with hBE33 cells was significantly increased, compared with KU812 cells cultured with the supernatant of hBE33 cells. Soluble ST2 suppressed IL-5 production by KU812 cells, which was induced by the supernatant of HDM-treated hBE33 cells.Epithelial cell-derived IL-33 promoted IL-5 production by KU812 cells. The subsequently produced sST2 has important roles in regulating Th2 responses.",

We compared the efficacy, safety, and parental anxiety of two different dietary instruction methods to introduce egg. Eligible participants were children aged 1–4 years who were positive for egg white IgE, and ovomucoid IgE <3.5 kUA/L. Participants were either naïve in egg consumption or had a history of an immediate, but non-anaphylactic, allergic reaction to egg. After a negative result of baseline 2 g boiled egg white oral food challenge (OFC), participants were randomly assigned to the step-up OFC testing (SOFT) or home incrementing group. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who were able to ingest 20 g of boiled egg white 6 months after initiation. This study is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network clinical trial registry (UMIN000024192). Between September 2016 and August 2018, we randomly allocated 55 participants to the SOFT (n = 33 [60%]) and home incrementing (n = 22 [40%]) groups and analyzed 51 patients. Four patients were excluded because they were lost to follow-up. Thirty-one (96.9%) of 32 participants in the SOFT and 12 (63.2%) of 19 in the home incrementing group achieved the primary outcome (p = 0.003). No serious adverse reactions were observed in either group. Parental anxiety significantly improved during treatment in both groups. The SOFT method was more effective than home incrementing as dietary instruction to introduce egg in children with suspected egg allergy.",

However, we did not determine exact cutoff values related to exacerbation. The aim of this study was to determine the cutoff values of Eo and FeNO that could be related to the exacerbation of severe asthma. We also aimed to confirm the clinical utility of Th2 markers related to exacerbation. This study included 105 severe asthma patients who completed a three-year follow-up of a severe asthma cohort study, including smokers. Three Th2 markers were selected, viz., Eo, FeNO, and positive atopic status. Regarding Eo and FeNO, we determined the cutoff values for the definition of \"positive\" Th2 features using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, based on the comparisons between frequent exacerbators and other patients. The cutoff values for positive Th2 features were Eo ≥ 250 cells/μL and FeNO ≥31 ppb. Sixteen patients (15.2%) had no Th2 features, 40 (38.1%) had one, 25 (23.8%) had two, and 24 (22.9%) had three. A high number of positive Th2 features was significantly associated with exacerbation frequencies over three years (p < 0.05). Similarly, compared to patients with one or no Th2 features, those with three Th2 features had a significantly higher probability of having more than one exacerbation (p < 0.05). The cutoff values determined in the current analysis were good predictors of future exacerbations in severe asthma patients.",

    "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is expressed in upper airways, however, little is known regarding whether Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signals exert a regulatory effect on the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), especially on eosinophilic inflammation. We sought to investigate the effect of Poly(IC), the ligand for TLR3, on cytokine production by dispersed nasal polyp cells (DNPCs). DNPCs were pretreated with or without Poly(IC), and were then cultured in the presence or absence of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), following which the levels of IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A and interferon (IFN)-γ in the supernatant were measured. To determine the involvement of IL-10 and cyclooxygenase in Poly(IC)-mediated signaling, DNPCs were treated with anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody and diclofenac, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, respectively. Poly(IC)-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production was also determined. Exposure to Poly(IC) induced a significant production of IL-10, but not of IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A or IFN-γ by DNPCs. Pretreatment with Poly(IC) dose-dependently inhibited SEB-induced IL-5, IL-13 and IL-17A, but not IFN-γ production. Neutralization of IL-10 significantly abrogated the inhibitory effect of Poly(IC). Treatment with diclofenac also abrogated the inhibitory effect of Poly(IC) on SEB-induced IL-5 and IL-13 production. However, unlike exposure of diclofenac-treated DNPCs to lipopolysaccharide, the ligand for TLR4, exposure of these cells to Poly(IC) did not enhance IL-5 or IL-13 production. Poly(IC) did not significantly increase PGE2 production by DNPCs. These results suggest that TLR3 signaling regulates eosinophilia-associated cytokine production in CRSwNP, at least in part, via IL-10 production.",

    "abstract": "We previously identified MGL_1304 secreted by Malassezia globosa as a sweat antigen for patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and cholinergic urticaria (ChU). However, purifying native MGL_1304 from human sweat or culture supernatant of M. globosa (sup-MGL_1304) is costly and time-consuming. Moreover, recombinant MGL_1304 expressed by using Escherichia coli (TF-rMGL_1304) needs a large chaperon protein and lacks the original glycosylation of yeasts. Thus, we generated a recombinant MGL_1304 by Pichia pastoris (P-rMGL_1304) and investigated its characteristic features. Recombinant MGL_1304 proteins expressed by E. coli and P. pastoris were generated. Properties of these recombinants and native antigens were compared by western blot analysis, histamine release tests (HRT) of patients with AD and ChU, and β-hexosaminidase release tests with RBL-48 cells. P-rMGL_1304-specific IgE in sera of patients with AD were measured by sandwich ELISA. Western blot analysis revealed that IgE of patients with AD bound to all MGL_1304 recombinants and native antigens. The histamine releasing ability of P-rMGL_1304 was 100 times higher than that of TF-rMGL_1304, and was comparable to that of sup-MGL_1304. Degranulation rates of RBL-48 cells, sensitized with sera of patients with AD in response to the stimulation of P-rMGL_1304, were comparable to those of sup-MGL_1304, whereas those of TF-rMGL_1304 were relatively weak. The levels of P-rMGL_1304-specific IgE in sera of patients with AD were correlated with their disease severities. P-rMGL_1304 has an antigenicity comparable to the native antigen, and is more useful than TF-rMGL_1304, especially in HRT and degranulation assay of RBL-48 cells.",

This study aimed to evaluate whether the results of SPT agreed well with those of specific serum immunoglobulin E (sIgE) antibody test in young infants with AD.This study included 2,077 eligible infants (age, <12 months) with AD who were tested by either SPT or sIgE between 2007 and 2011. Among them, 199 infants tested for egg white (EW) and 192 infants tested for cow's milk (CM), by both SPT and sIgE on the same day were identified and reviewed retrospectively. Kappa statistics and tests for equal kappa statistics were used to evaluate the agreement between the SPT and sIgE.The mean wheal diameter and the allergen-to-histamine ratio of SPT showed substantial agreement with those of sIgE for EW (κ = 0.62, 0.69) and CM (κ = 0.34, 0.47). The agreement for EW was significantly higher <6-month-old than in ≥6-month-old infants (κ = 0.79 vs. 0.54, P = 0.02), and that for CM was similar (P = 0.60). The mean wheal diameters for EW and CM were evenly distributed, and did not show increasing trends regardless of age in months (Ptrend = 0.13 and 0.06, respectively).The results of SPT agreed well with those of sIgE. This finding provides a rationale for using SPT, and suggests that SPT can be used along with sIgE to detect food sensitization in young infants with AD.",

Nasal and ocular symptoms were scored by parents/guardians/patients and recorded in a patient's daily diary. In addition, rhinoscopy findings, including mucosal swelling, were scored by the investigators as an efficacy measure. As a safety measure, adverse events and clinical laboratory data were evaluated.An adverse event was reported by 67% of patients during the treatment and follow-up period, all of which were mild in intensity. The most commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis and acute sinusitis (acute rhinosinusitis). There were no serious adverse events. FFNS 55 μg improved nasal symptom scores and rhinoscopy findings compared with the baseline. Ocular symptom scores were also improved compared with the baseline in FFNS 55 μg in a sub-group of patients with any ocular symptoms at baseline. FFNS 55 μg was shown to be well tolerated over the 12-week treatment period. Majority of patients receiving FFNS 55 μg had unquantifiable plasma levels of fluticasone furoate (FF).Twelve-week treatment with FFNS 55 μg, once daily, is well tolerated and effective with low systemic exposure in Japanese children aged 2 to <15 years with PAR.",

    "abstract": "Allergic sensitization is a key step in the pathogenesis of asthma. However, little is known about the molecules that are critical regulators for establishing allergic sensitization of the airway. Thus, we conducted global gene expression profiling to identify candidate genes and signaling pathways involved in house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic sensitization in the murine airway. We sensitized and challenged mice with HDM or saline as a control through the airway on days 1 and 8. We evaluated eosinophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), airway inflammation, and mucus production on days 7 and 14. We extracted total RNA from lung tissues of HDM- and saline-sensitized mice on days 7 and 14. Microarray analyses were performed to identify up-regulated genes in the lungs of HDM-sensitized mice compared to the control mice. Data analyses were performed using GeneSpring software and gene networks were generated using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). We identified 50 HDM-mediated, stepwise up-regulated genes in response to allergic sensitization and amplification of allergic airway inflammation. The highest expressed gene was myeloid differentiation-2 (MD-2), a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding component of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling complex. MD-2 protein was expressed in lung vascular endothelial cells and was increased in the serum of HDM-sensitized mice, but not in the control mice. Our data suggest MD-2 is a critical regulator of the establishment of allergic airway sensitization to HDM in mice. Serum MD-2 may represent a potential biomarker for the amplification of allergic sensitization and allergic inflammation.",

Epidemiological studies focus either on specific populations or document adverse drug reactions in general. Our objective was to document self-reported drug allergy in Greece, through a simple, informative internet-based questionnaire.A questionnaire on drug allergy was accessible online for a 3-month period. Participants voluntarily answered 28 questions referring to: suspected drug, clinical manifestations, concomitant factors, received treatment, reaction's re-occurrence.A total of 2528 questionnaires were included in study analysis. Beta-lactams and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most prevalent culprit agents (53% and 27.5% respectively) while half of the participants acknowledged skin manifestations as the most common symptoms. One out of three reported subsequent exposure to the drug presumed to be responsible for the reaction and 74.5% of those stated a new reaction upon re-exposure. Only 26.7% underwent allergological evaluation. Reactions manifested with respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms, parenteral administration of the culprit drug and personal history of allergy to agents of >1 different pharmacological categories were associated with increased risk of hospitalization.Allergic reactions to drugs are adverse events difficult to define and diagnose. A remarkable proportion of presumed as hypersensitivity reactions are not referred to allergists; therefore these patients may be either re-exposed to potentially noxious drugs, or needlessly avoid whole classes of drugs as b-lactams for more costly or less appropriate treatments. Internet-based questionnaires may contribute to awareness programs concerning drug allergy and help improve proper referral.",

Psychologic and socioeconomic factors may further aggravate the asthma status. Ethnic minorities are at increased risk of asthma. The perception of dyspnea may be blunted in asthma sufferers. Slow-onset fatal asthma may be associated with submucosal eosinophilic, whereas sudden-onset may be associated with submucosal neutrophilia. Fatal asthma occurs in patients abusing regular |32-agonist therapy. Peak flow assessment often provides insight into asthma deterioration prior to signs of respiratory distress.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of olopatadine on the release of peptide leukotrienes (P-LT), potent inflammatory mediators, from human eosinophils. Human eosinophils were purified from venous blood of healthy donors by negative selection using the anti-CD16 antibody. When human eosinophils were stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μmol/L), the amount of P-LT release was approximately 1200 pg/ 105 cells, while thromboxane (TX) B2 release was under the detection limit (< 20 pg/105 cells). Olopatadine inhibited the A23187-induced P-LT release from human eosinophils with an IC50 of 4.5 μmol/L. Ketotifen also inhibited this reaction with an IC50 of 39.4 μmol/L. The inhibitory effect of olopatadine on the P-LT release may contribute to the antiallergic efficacy of this drug.",

    "abstract": "European studies have shown that approximately 20% of all pollen-allergic patients display IgE reactivity to various plant profilins. Profilins are ubiquitous intracellular proteins, with a role in cell signalling and morphology. Recently, functionally relevant human profilin tetramers were identified, but the characterization and allergenic roles of plant profilin multimers have not been reported. Because larger molecules are generally more antigenic, the present objectives were to: (i) determine if plant profilin forms multimers; (ii) use the allergenic property of profilin in the design of an immunoassay to detect type I allergies in the local population; and (iii) assess the allergenic potential of monomeric versus multimeric profilin. In agreement with other known profilin forms, silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analyses revealed that a significant 14.8 kDa protein was purified from Escherichia coli transformed with the cDNA of a plant (Zea mays) profilin isoform (ZmPROI). Higher molecular weight proteins (particularly 60 kDa and 30 kDa) were also observed, which became predominant and larger (> 90 kDa) in the absence of reducing agents. Human IgE reactivity to profilin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that was developed using patient serum samples classified as either negative (no type I allergies), positive (type I plant allergies) or miscellaneous (i.e. allergies other than classical type I plant allergies). The IgE-ZmPRO1 complexes were seen in three of nine patients with type I plant allergies, compared with one of eight negative controls and three of 14 from the miscellaneous category. Dot filtration immunoblots were subsequently developed to absorb profilin diluted in the presence or absence of reducing agent to yield mostly monomeric or multimeric profilin, respectively. Immunoglobulin E from positive patients displayed a greater intensity of binding to ZmPROI under conditions that favored profilin multimers. In summary, recombinant ZmPROI profilin forms multimers and is suitable for a developed ELISA. The data further suggest that profilin has pan-allergenic potential in the North American population and raise the possibility that profilin multimers have greater immunogenicity than monomers.",

    "abstract": "The induction of allergen-specific IgE synthesis requires the cognate interactions between B and T helper (Th) 2 cells. The B cell-activating signal for IgE synthesis is delivered through interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13 and CD40 ligand, which are provided by activated Th2 cells. Signaling through the IL-4 receptor α chain (IL-4Rα) triggers IL-4- or IL-1 3-dependent germline Ce transcription by activating signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-6 through members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family. In addition to the known JAK-STAT pathway, two adaptor molecules associated with the IL-4Rα, which include Src homologous and collagen (Shc) and a product of the fes proto-oncogene family, are involved in the induction of germline Ce transcription. These adaptor molecules transmit the downstream signaling, leading to activation of PU.1, a product of the ets proto-oncogene family, which cooperates functionally with STAT-6 for germline Cε transcription. Ligation of CD40 in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13 leads to expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). This novel RNA-editing enzyme plays a role upstream of the putative switch recombinase, activation of which results in IgE isotype switching, mature Cε transcription and IgE synthesis. Although CD40 signaling activates multiple pathways that are critical for the activation of the switch recombination machinery, none of the known second messengers and transcription factors generated by CD40 ligation is involved in AID expression and isotype switching. Elucidation of the merging point of IL-4Rα and CD40 signaling pathways required for IgE switching will provide potential new strategies for the isotype-specific regulation of IgE synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways superimposed upon structural changes that include an increase in smooth muscle and airway wall remodeling. In addition to a background of chronic mediator release, asthma is characterized by considerable variations in airway function brought about by important interactions with the environment, including allergen, pollutant and virus exposure. At least in mild-moderate disease, cytokines released from Th2 cells appear important in orchestrating the inflammation. The situation in more severe disease is complicated by the superimposition of a Th1 on top of a Th2 response. Until recently, the only controller treatment for chronic asthma has been corticosteroids. However, identification of specific effector molecules in asthma has led to targeting of specific pathways by using cytokines and cytokine inhibitors. Administration of a monoclonal blocking antibody against IgE has been shown to be highly efficacious in severe allergic asthma, but enhancement of Th1 responses or attempts to reduce eosinophils using anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibodies have no clinical benefit. In more severe asthma, blockade of tumor necrosis factor-a using the decoy etanercept has revealed efficacy in a small open study supporting the view that Th1, in addition to Th2, pathways are important as the disease adopts a more severe phenotype. Thus, like atopic dermatitis, it is likely that asthma is not a single disease, but a group of disorders that differ in",

    "abstract": "Approximately 16.2% of the Japanese population suffer from cedar pollinosis, with various manifestations such as ophthalmic, laryngo-pharyngeal and skin symptoms in addition to nasal symptoms. Thus, the annual pollen season is an agonizing period for patients. No study has reported symptoms and their clinical courses after conjunctival provocation with purified cedar pollen allergen Cry j1 as well as suppression of these allergen-induced ocular symptoms by antihistamine eye drops. Nine patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis who had no nasal or ocular symptoms were included in the present study, after obtaining informed consent in writing. 1) Purified cedar pollen allergen Cry j1 was instilled in the left eye and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the right eye as a control. 2) Levocabastine hydrochloride ophthalmic suspension and ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution were respectively instilled in the left and right eyes, which were then challenged with the allergen. Ocular symptoms after provocation with the allergen were recorded through the clinical course. Pollen allergen-induced ocular symptoms were itching and hyperemia of the palpebral conjunctiva, and itching lasted for more than 5 hours. Moreover, preadministration of antihistamine eye drops suppressed the increases in the ocular symptom scores, eliminating itching within 1 hour. Allergen provoked not only ocular symptoms but also nasal symptoms in 77.8% of patients. Preadministration of antihistamine eye drops suppressed the symptoms induced by the allergen, which suggests that this is an effective early therapy for Japanese cedar pollinosis, if it is started before the pollen season. However, self-protection by patients using a mask may not be effective enough to suppress nasal symptoms during the pollen season, requiring them to additionally wear glasses to avoid exposure to the allergen.",

On blood examination, peripheral blood eosinophilia was present, but all other examinations for immunologic diseases were negative, including specific IgE. We suspected cutaneous allergic vasculitis and performed skin biopsy. In December 2002, histological examination of biopsy specimens of the skin lesions showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The diagnosis of cutaneous allergic vasculitis was made based on the clinical symptoms and the pathological findings of biopsy specimens. Immunohistochemical staining for human mast cell tryptase using monoclonal antibody against human mast cell tryptase showed an accumulation of mast cells. Treatment with oral corticosteroid resulted in the disappearance of clinical symptoms, and the steroid tapered. A second skin biopsy was performed in June 2005 after informed consent was obtained. Histological examination showed no findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and the number of mast cells had decreased. She has been well without treatment. Mast cells may increase in the skin lesion of cutaneous allergic vasculitis.",

This research investigated the prescription patterns of drugs for cedar pollinosis by ear, nose, and throat specialists (ENTs), general physicians (GPs) and internal medicine doctors (IMs) in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. A cross-sectional study was conducted by mailing questionnaires to 532 physicians in autumn 2006. The main part of the questionnaire constituted clinical vignettes of pollinosis cases with nasal and ocular symptoms ranging from mild to severe. We requested that the physicians fill out prescription medications they considered appropriate for each vignette. Responses from 172 physicians (32%) for six clinical vignettes were analyzed. The number of drugs prescribed by ENTs was significantly higher than that by GPs and IMs for vignettes representing moderate to severe cases (p < 0.004). The percentage of physicians who said they would prescribe nasal corticosteroid and eye drops was higher in the ENT group compared to the other two groups in these vignettes. In terms of second-generation antihistamines, no differences were observed between the three groups for all vignettes. Our investigation suggested that, compared to ENTs, GPs and IMs have a lower tendency to concomitantly prescribe drugs for localized treatment such as nasal corticosteroids and eye drops with oral medication. There may be differences in prescription patterns of drugs for pollinosis between ENTs and non-specialist physicians.",

Here, we examine the effect of commercially available immunoreaction enhancer solutions and different blocking reagents in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for total or antigen-specific murine IgE in order to improve the assays. Sera from mice immunized with recombinant house dust mite major allergens, Der f 1 and Der p 1, were used for the assays. Total IgE was measured by sandwich ELISA using monoclonal antibodies against murine IgE. Antigen-specific IgE was assayed using allergen-coated plates. Sensitivity or signal intensity in ELISA was compared among conditions differing in the use of enhancer solutions, blocking reagents, or monoclonal antibodies, and incubation time. Use of enhancer solutions improved the sensitivity of ELISA for total IgE by approximately 30-fold of that using a conventional buffer. A blocking reagent caused more unwanted enhancement of the background signal in blank wells in ELISA for total IgE compared with another blocking reagent, however, improved signal intensity in ELISA for antigen-specific ELISA without significant enhancement of the background signal. Optimal assay conditions were determined. Enhancer solutions are effective in improving ELISAs for total and antigen-specific murine IgE. Selection of blocking reagents was important to decrease unwanted enhancement of background signals and was effective in enhancing signals for positive samples. The ELISAs improved in this study are useful for the study of allergies in mouse models.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports have shown that pathogen-associated patterns (PAMPs) induce the production of interleukin (IL)-1β in macrophages. Moreover, studies using mouse models also suggest that chitin, which acts as a PAMP, induces adjuvant effects and eosinophilic infiltration in the lung. Thus, we investigated the effects of inhaled chitin in mouse models.We developed mouse models of inhaled chitin particle-induced airway inflammation and steroid-resistant ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation. Some experimental groups of mice were treated additionally with dexamethasone (DEX). Murine alveolar macrophages (AMs), which were purified from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, were incubated with chitin, and treated with or without DEX.The numbers of total cells, AMs, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils among BAL-derived cells, as well as the IL-1β levels in BAL fluids and the numbers of IL-1β-positive cells in lung, were significantly increased by chitin stimulation. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was aggravated in mice of the chitin inflammation model compared to control animals. The production of IL-1β was significantly increased in murine AMs by chitin treatment, but DEX administration did not inhibit this chitin-induced IL-1β production. Furthermore, in mouse models, DEX treatment inhibited the OVA-induced airway inflammation and AHR but not the airway inflammation and AHR induced by chitin or the combination of OVA and chitin.These results suggest that inhaled chitin induces airway inflammation, AHR, and the production of IL-1β. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate for the first time that inhaled chitin induces steroid-resistant airway inflammation and AHR. Inhaled chitin may contribute to features of steroid-resistant asthma.",

The aim of this study is to analyze pulmonary function test (PFT) in athletes from the aspect of BA retrospectively.Medical history questionnaires of 2111 athletes (male: 1549, female: 562) were reviewed. All athletes participated in the institute's athletic test for the first time, from April 2003 through March 2006. Athletes were categorized into three groups; current-BA confirmed and treated by the physician, possible-BA according to the allergic history and/or BA symptoms, and non-BA that is neither of the above two groups. The PFT data were then analyzed.There were 24 current-BA (1.1%), 137 possible-BA (6.5%), and 183 cases with a past history of BA (PH; 8.7%). Percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV1) and of predicted peak expiratory flow rate (%PEF) in current-BA (86.2+/-17.7% and 81.6+/-19.1%, respectively) and possible-BA (84.7+/-14.6% and 81.2+/-17.3%, respectively) were significantly lower than those in non-BA (93.9+/-13.7% and 93.8+/-19.8%, respectively), without any significant difference between current-BA and possible-BA. Athletes with PH show impaired obstructive indices; even in non-BA with PH showed lower %FEV1 (91.3+/-13.9%, p<0.05) and %PEF (86.8+/-17.8%, p<0.001) than non-BA without PH (94.0+/-13.7% and 94.2+/-19.9%, respectively).The incidence of BA in Japanese athletes may be higher than currently recognized. More intervention is encouraged for the diagnosis of BA, to avoid any fatal asthma during sports by initiating preventive therapy.",

The elimination of HCV has been reported to be beneficial for asthmatic patients with HCV infection. Therefore, we hypothesized that chronic HCV infection might be associated with the severity of asthma. Asthmatic patients were prospectively enrolled from 13 outpatient settings. Hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen and HCV-RNA were measured at the time of enrollment and evaluated along with the clinical characteristics of the patients including the age, sex, duration of asthma, atopic status, smoking history, and treatment step according to the Global Initiative for Asthma guideline. Of 1327 asthmatic patients, 1258 patients (94.8%) were treated with inhaled corticosteroids, 18 patients were positive for HBs antigen (1.4%), and 32 patients (2.4%) were positive for HCV-RNA. When compared with HCV-RNA-negative patients, HCV-RNA-positive patients required significantly more drugs for the treatment of asthma. No such relationship was observed in patients with positive HBs antigen. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the male sex, a long duration of asthma, status as a current smoker, and HCV-RNA positivity were independently associated with more severe asthma. These results suggest that chronic HCV infection is an independent factor that predisposes asthmatic patients to more severe asthma. The evaluation of chronic HCV infection may be helpful for the management of severe asthmatic patients without obvious factors associated with severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of 7-year-old monozygotic twin patients with atopic dermatitis. The HLA haplotypes were HLA A2, A11, B27, B61, DR1, and DR4. Both serum IgE levels and cedar pollen radioallergosorbent test (RAST) scores were high in the twins (elder/younger sister: IgE: 5170/3980 IU/ml and Japansese cedar pollen: >100/64.0) in contrast to low mite and food RAST scores (Dermatophagoides Pterygonium; 0.59/0.4 and egg white 9.24/4.6). The patients showed positive immediate (20 min in both sisters) and delayed (24 hours in elder sister, 24, 48, 72 hours in younger sister) reactions to a scratch test with Japanese cedar pollen. Skin lesions on the face were aggravated and extended to the trunk and extremities during the Japanese cedar pollen season and gradually subsided in summer. Oral provocation with egg white or cow milk showed no exacerbations, and topical corticosteroid did not improve the eczema. In contrast, successful protection from severe scratching behaviors was achieved by use of topical anti-allergic eye drops and wearing nightgowns made by the mother.",

    "abstract": "Recently, correlations of peak expiratory flow (PEF) variation have been shown to facilitate the prediction of later asthma symptoms and exacerbations. However, it has not been fully examined whether or not any patient characteristics are associated with the residual airway lability in treated asthmatics. The objective of this study is to examine a predictive marker for increased variation of PEF in patients with clinically stable asthma. We studied 297 asthmatic patients who were monitored for PEF twice a day. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), spirometry, and exhaled nitric oxide fraction (FENO) were measured. After the assessment of baseline values, PEF measuring was continued and associations between these clinical markers and later variation of PEF over a week (Min%Max) were investigated. 17.5% of the subjects showed increased PEF variability (Min%Max < 80%). ACQ, forced expiratory volume in 1 s % of predicted (%FEV1), and FENO were identified as independent predictors of Min%Max < 80%. An ACQ ≥ 0.4 yielded 96% sensitivity and 59% specificity, a %FEV1 ≤ 85% yielded 62% sensitivity and 89% specificity, and a FENO ≥ 40 ppb yielded 75% sensitivity and 90% specificity for identifying the subjects with high variability in PEF. When we combine %FEV1 ≤ 85% and FENO ≥ 40 ppb, this index showed the highest specificity (98%) for increased PEF variability. These results indicate that ACQ, %FEV1 and FENO can stratify the risk for increased variation in airway caliber among patients with stable asthma. This may help identify subjects in whom further monitoring of lung function fluctuations is indicated.",

    "abstract": "I read with great interest the paper by Takahashi et al.1 reporting on a child affected by juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). The peculiarity of the case was the presence of erythema and violaceous papules following a Blaschko’s line over the posterior aspect of the right thigh. The authors speculate that such lesion is an expression of flagellate erythema. However, flagellate erythema of DM is transient, not infiltrated, typically occurs in multiple streaks on the trunk and does not follow Blaschko’s lines. I rather suggest herein that the reported case actually represents a remarkable example of superimposed segmental dermatomyositis. Two types of skin mosaicism are currently recognized with regard to monogenic skin disorders, i.e. type 1 (segments of heterozygous skin in the setting of nonmutant skin) and type 2 (segments of homozygous skin in the setting of heterozygous skin). Segmental manifestations can also be observed in many acquired polygenic skin disorders. In this case, the terms suggested as equivalents of type 1 and type 2 are “isolated” (segmental lesions as the sole manifestation of a dermatosis) and “superimposed” (segmental lesions coexisting with nonsegmental, otherwise typical manifestations of a dermatosis), respectively.2 Many polygenic skin disorders have been already shown to present, albeit very rarely, with a superimposed segmental manifestation. JDM has been recently included in the list3 after the publication of 3 cases featuring segmental calcinosis.4-6 The case by Takahashi et al. 1 is likely to represent the first reported one in which the segmental manifestation is represented by the pathognomonic findings of DM, i.e. Gottron’s sign and papules.",

    "abstract": "Screening patients for latex allergy prior to surgery is an important but intensive procedure. The appropriate testing strategy for diagnosing latex (Hevea brasiliensis) allergy involves in-vitro specific IgE or skin prick testing. The sensitivity and specificity of both tests are influenced by patient-specific factors or manufacturing processes that alter the clinically relevant allergens in skin testing solutions. Total IgE and latex-specific IgE testing was introduced as a screening test. Skin prick testing was done on patients with a high probability of latex allergy and negative specific IgE with total IgE < 100 kU/L. SDS-PAGE was done on the non-ammoniated latex (NAL) and newly introduced ammoniated latex (AL) reagents for the clinically relevant allergens. 51 patients had a total IgE < 100 (range, 2.8-99.0 kU/L), and 10% had a positive skin test. 60% of positive skin tests would have been missed with lower total IgE cut-offs of 50 kU/L (6% of referrals). SDS-PAGE of the NAL solution showed 3 prominent bands with molecular weights of approximately 20, 24 and 42 kDa that correlated with Hev b 6, Hev b 3 and Hev b 7/13, respectively. In contrast, the AL solution showed 3 very faint higher molecular weights bands that did not correlate with clinically relevant antigens. Increasing the cut-off value of total IgE for allergen-specific IgE testing increased the sensitivity of the specific IgE test. The NAL reagent had a greater number of clinically significant allergens at higher concentrations than AL, which may have implications for the clinical sensitivity of the newer AL reagent.",

In the present study, the prophylactic efficacy of a disaccharide p-1, 4 mannobiose (MNB) in a BALB/C mouse model of intranasally-induced pollen allergy was characterized. Methods: Balb/c mice were pretreated with MNB orally and sensitized with pollen extract intraperitoneally and intranasally and challenged with histamine and crude pollen extract. Outcomes were measured as clinical signs, antibody isotypes, cytokine gene and protein expression patterns. Results: The MNB-treated mice had lower sneezing frequency as compared to the positive control mice (P < 0.05). The low dose MNB-treated mice had less histamine (P < 0.05). However, the Cry j1 and Cry j 2-specific IgE, IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibody activity did not differ between groups (P > 0.05). The MNB-treated mice had increased IFN-y (P < 0.05), and decreased IL-4 (P < 0.05). Mice in the high dose group had increased IL-10 (P < 0.05). However, TGF-p and IL-17 concentration did not differ between groups (P > 0.05). Both total and Cry j1 and Cry j 2-specific IgA were increased in the high dose group. Real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that IL-4 and IL-17 mRNA expression were lower in MNB-treated mice (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This work provides insights into using MNB as a potential prebiotic immunomodulator via decreased clinical signs, improved type1/type 2 balance, and IgA production, thus validating the potential use of MNB as a prophylactic prebiotic candidate to attenuate allergic response.",

Patients with moderate persistent adult asthma who had received SFC 50/250 μg bid with well-control status were recruited. After switching to 8-week therapy with fixed-dose BUD/FM 4 puffs (640/18 μg) (phase-1), patients chose either SFC or BUD/FM. FeNO and ACT score were evaluated every 8 weeks until the end of the 52-week treatment period for both treatment groups (phase-2). In total, 103 patients were examined: BUD/FM was chosen by 34 patients (BUD/FM group), while SFC was chosen by 23 (SFC group). Thirty-six received SFC consistently from the beginning of the study (control). Patients in the BUD/FM and SFC groups showed significant improvements in ACT scores and FeNO levels in phase-1; these beneficial effects persisted for 52 weeks in the BUD/FM group. On the other hand, in the SFC group, although the FeNO level decreased from 54.3 ± 26.4 ppb to 41.9 ± 18.3 ppb in phase-1, it increased to 54.5 ± 26.2 ppb, a level similar to the baseline prior to the beginning of BUD/FM therapy, at 8 weeks in phase-2, and remained at 50-odd ppb thereafter. These results suggest that maintenance therapy with fixed-dose BUD/FM is a useful treatment option exerting an airway anti-inflammatory effect for a period as long as 1 year, even for asthmatics who could not accomplish total control with SFC.",

Meanwhile, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) concentration, used in assessing airway inflammation in bronchial asthma, is known to be affected by atopic disposition. The possible role of FeNO measurements was evaluated in patients with anaphylaxis.FeNO was measured in 52 adult patients (17-78 years old, median age 41.5 years) in whom anaphylaxis occurred. These measurements were made within 24 h after onset and after about one month when the patients were symptom-free. In some of these patients, FeNO was measured a third time, two months or more after onset.The FeNO level in the 52 patients was not significantly different in measurement made within 24 h of onset of anaphylaxis and after one month. However, excluding 9 patients who also had asthma history, the FeNO level in the remaining 43 patients decreased significantly from within 24 h of onset (36.7 ± 27.5 ppb) to one month later (28.8 ± 19.5 ppb). Of these 43 patients, this phenomenon was evident in a group that had respiratory symptoms (31 patients), but it was not seen in a group that did not have respiratory symptoms (12 patients).Elevation of FeNO was related to respiratory symptoms observed in anaphylactic patients without asthma. Although the mechanism of increased FeNO level is unclear, its usefulness for diagnosis of anaphylaxis must be examined in prospective studies.",

We examined its role in allergic airway inflammation in response to two distinct antigens using IL-23-deficient mice.Allergic airway inflammation was evaluated in wild-type and IL-23p19(-/-) mice. Mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) or house dust mite (HDM) by intraperitoneal injection of antigen and their airways were then exposed to the same antigen. Levels of antigen-specific immunoglobulins in serum as well as cytokines in bronchoalveolar or peritoneal lavage fluid and lung tissue were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Deficiency of IL-23p19 decreased eosinophils and Th2 cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of OVA-treated mice, while it increased BALF eosinophils of HDM-treated mice. Peritoneal injection of OVA with alum, but not of HDM, induced local synthesis of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-23. Systemic production of antigen-specific IgG1 was partially dependent on IL-23. In contrast, airway exposure to HDM, but not to OVA, induced IL-23p19 mRNA expression in the lungs. In IL-23p19-deficient mice, HDM-exposed lungs did not exhibit the induction of IL-17A, which negatively regulates eosinophilic inflammation.Different antigens induced IL-23 at different part of the body in our similar asthma models. Endogenous IL-23 production at the site of antigen sensitization facilitates type-2 immune responses, whereas IL-23 production and subsequent IL-17A synthesis in the airways suppresses allergic inflammation.",

There is limited information about the natural history of skin sensitization tests and factors that affect them. It was aimed to determine the changes in skin test results and the factors affecting the reactivity of skin tests after a period of approximately four years in children with allergic disease. Methods: SPT of 170 patients among 2485 children with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis and/or atopic dermatitis, who underwent SPT between 2005 and 2007, were repeated after an interval of at least 3 years. Results: The mean age was 10.7 ± 3.1 (5-18) years and 70% of the patients were male. In total 66 (39.0% of the study population) had a different skin tests result in follow-up. Alterations: loss of sensitivity in 18 (11%) patients, the formation of a new sensitivity in 37 (22%) patients, and 11 (6%) both gained and lost sensitization. The presence of atopy in the family, the presence of allergic rhinitis and IgE elevation significantly predicted the incidence of new sensitization. The presence of sensitization to multiple allergens significantly predicted the incidence of loss of sensitization. Conclusions: It is found that there was an alteration of sensitization in 4/10 children at the end of the average 4-year period. The presence of family atopy, the presence of allergic rhinitis and serum total IgE elevation were risk factors for the development of new sensitization. On the other hand sensitization to multiple allergens was risk factors for the loss of sensitization.",

Although it has a large impact on the patient's quality of life, little is known about the factors associated with its severity. The aim of this study was to assess the factors associated with the severity of rhinoconjunctivitis among children in the general population.A survey was conducted using an online research panel in 2012. Parents were asked to answer an International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood-based questionnaire to identify children with current rhinoconjunctivitis and evaluate factors associated with the severity of its symptoms. Severity was rated according to the degree of impairment caused by the symptoms in the patient's daily life.Among 26,725 children aged 6-12 years old, rhinoconjunctivitis was defined in 5175 (19.4%), and of these, 688 children (13.3% of children with current rhinoconjunctivitis) presented severe symptoms. Living in areas with a high cedar and cypress pollen count and having concurrent eczema were associated with severe rhinoconjunctivitis [adjusted OR (95% CI): 1.21 (1.00-1.46) and 1.45 (1.20-1.75), respectively]. Further, a maternal history of asthma and allergic rhinitis was a significant risk factor for severe rhinoconjunctivitis [1.34 (1.04-1.74) and 1.30 (1.10-1.53), respectively]. However, living with fur-bearing animals (pets) before 1 year of age proved to be a protective factor against severe rhinoconjunctivitis [0.70 (0.52-0.94)].Environmental factors such as pets and pollen, together with comorbidities and a maternal history of allergic diseases, play an important role in determining the severity of rhinoconjunctivitis.",

    "abstract": "Several guidelines, including the Japanese Pediatric Guideline for the Treatment and Management of Asthma (JPGL), recommend salmeterol/fluticasone combination therapy (SFC) as step 3 to 4 treatment for moderate to severe asthma. However, the optimal step-down approach to SFC remains unclear. In the current study, we examined step-down approaches in asthmatic children whose symptoms had been stabilized by SFC 100/200 μg/day.This randomized, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group study was conducted over 12 weeks. For step-down therapy, subjects aged 5-15 years were randomly assigned to an SFC group (25/50 μg b.i.d.) or an FP group (100 μg b.i.d.), and treated for 12 weeks. Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) scores, lung function, and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels were monitored.Of 131 enrolled subjects, 128 completed the study and were included in the analysis. Decreases in % peak expiratory flow rate and % forced expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity (V50) were observed in the FP group at each time point. There was a significant difference between the two groups for the change in %V50 from its previous value at each time point. There were no significant changes in FeNO levels (range 15-20 ppb) or C-ACT scores (∼26 points) within or between groups.A high level of asthma control was maintained with both approaches. The use of SFC step-down resulted in somewhat better respiratory function, with no worsening of airway inflammation. However, halving the dose of SFC and switching to FP alone are both optimal step-down approaches.",

It has been showed that P and TMP act by reducing glycerol-induced abdominal pain and by inhibiting colonic phasic contractions. 1 Exceptionally, P and TMP are associated with muco-cutaneous manifestations and allergic reactions. It has been reported, in the French National pharmacovigilance database, 21 cases of anaphy-laxis to phloroglucinol, including 16 cases of anaphylactic shock and 5 cases of allergic skin reaction (unpublished data). We report a case of anaphylaxis to phloroglucinol confirmed by skin testing. Case report We report the case of a 23 year old female patient, who has a medical history of mildly active ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine (Pentasa ®). She had no relevant past surgical history. The patient was evaluated in allergy consultation for a recent generalized facial maculo-papular exanthema associated with dysphonia, dysphagia and mild dyspnea that occurred 6 months ago. In fact, this systemic reaction appeared half an hour after taking Spasfon ® , paracetamol, loperamide and a cough syrup containing codeine (Polery ®), during an influenza-like illness with gastroenteritis. She then presented to the emergency department where she was given intravenous H1 antihistamine plus a single intravenous corticosteroid dose (methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg). Dysphonia, dysphagia and dyspnea improved successfully and she was discharged on oral antihistamine and corticosteroid for 5 days. The facial skin eruption disappeared slowly over 3e4 days. All drugs that have been taken are known to cause allergic reactions as side effects. Also, children and adult can commonly develop urticaria as a result of viral respiratory infections. 2 As this systemic reaction can evoke an immunological IgE mediated mechanism, we decided to test all drugs that were taken on that day. An allergic food reaction is unlikely, given the absence of food intake for at least 6 h before the reaction, and the absence of ingestion of unusual foods within the 24 h before the reaction.

    "abstract": "T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 (TIM-3), which is preferentially expressed on Th1 cells rather than Th2 cells, is considered to be a negative regulator of Th1 cell function. This suggests that TIM-3 indirectly enhances Th2-type immune responses by suppressing Th1 cell function.To investigate TIM-3's possible involvement in Th2-type acute and chronic airway inflammation, wild-type and TIM-3-deficient (TIM-3-/-) mice were sensitized and challenged with a house dust mite (HDM) extract. Airway inflammation and the number of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) in the mice were determined by histological analysis and with a hemocytometer, respectively. Expression of mRNA in the lungs was determined by quantitative PCR, while the levels of cytokines in the BALFs and IgE in sera were determined by ELISA.Despite constitutive expression of TIM-3 mRNA in the lungs, the number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and the score of pulmonary inflammation were comparable between wild-type and TIM-3-/- mice during both acute and chronic HDM-induced airway inflammation. On the other hand, the number of lymphocytes in the BALFs of TIM-3-/- mice was significantly increased compared with wild-type mice during HDM-induced chronic, but not acute, airway inflammation, while the levels of Th2 cytokines in the BALFs and HDM-specific IgG1 and IgG2a and total IgE in the sera were comparable in both groups.Our findings indicate that, in mice, TIM-3 is not essential for development of HDM-induced acute or chronic allergic airway inflammation, although it appears to be involved in reduced lymphocyte recruitment during HDM-induced chronic allergic airway inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Lung sound analysis is useful for objectively evaluating airways even in children with asymptomatic asthma. However, the relationship between lung sounds and morphological changes in the airways has not been elucidated. We examined the relationship between lung sounds and chronic morphological changes in the airways during the progression of asthma from onset in guinea pigs.Eleven male guinea pigs were examined; of these, seven were used as asthma models and four as controls. The asthma models were sensitized and repeatedly challenged by inhaling albumin chicken egg. We measured lung sounds and lung function twice a week for 21 weeks. After the final antigen challenge, the lungs were excised for histological examination. We measured the ratio of airway wall thickness to the total airway area and the ratio of the internal area to the total airway area in the trachea, third bronchi, and terminal bronchioles.Among the lungs sounds, the difference between the two groups was greatest with respect to inspiratory sound intensity. The ratio of airway wall thickness to the total airway area of the terminal bronchioles was greater in the asthma models than in the controls, and it correlated best with the changes in inspiratory sound intensity in the 501-1000-Hz range (r = 0.76, p < 0.003).Lung sound intensity in the middle frequency range from 501 to 1000 Hz correlated with peripheral airway wall thickness. Inspiratory sound intensity appeared to be an indicator of morphological changes in small airways in asthma.",

However, it is not clear whether the development of barley allergy in patients with wheat allergy is due to cross-antigenicity between wheat and barley. This study aimed to determine the clinical cross-reactivity and immunological cross-antigenicity of wheat and barley.The results of barley oral food challenges (OFCs) were compared before and after oral immunotherapy (OIT) for wheat in nine patients with wheat allergy to estimate the clinical cross-reactivity of wheat and barley. Moreover, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) inhibition and immunoblotting inhibition using serum from seven patients allergic to wheat and barley.Nine patients who had positive barley-OFC results performed before OIT for wheat were all negative on barley-OFC performed after OIT. In ELISA inhibition, preincubation of serum from patients allergic to wheat and barley with a high barley extract concentration inhibited binding of IgE to wheat extract by less than 10%. On the other hand, wheat and barley extracts equally inhibited binding to barley sIgE at high concentrations. In the immunoblotting inhibition test, the spots of wheat were inhibited but weakly by barley extracts, and most of the spots of barley were inhibited even by low concentrations of the wheat and barley extract.We showed that barley allergy associated with wheat allergy is caused by cross-reactivity from wheat. The OIT for wheat is one of the promising options for barley allergy.",

The secreted IgD antibody (Ab) is found in relatively modest concentrations in the blood and other body fluids as it has a relatively short serum half-life. IgD Abs produced in the upper-respiratory mucosa presumably participate in host defense against pathogens. The allergen-mediated cross-linkage of basophil-bound IgD Ab enhances type 2 cytokine secretion; IgD Ab may also interfere with IgE-mediated basophil degranulation, suggesting dual and opposing roles of IgD Ab in allergen sensitization and the development of allergen immune tolerance. We recently demonstrated that children with egg allergies who avoided all forms of egg have lower ovomucoid-specific IgD and IgG4 Ab levels than those who only partially avoided egg products and that different mechanisms may regulate allergen-specific IgD Ab production compared to allergen-specific IgG4 Ab production. The relationship between antigen-specific IgD Ab levels and the clinical improvement of asthma and food allergies suggests that antigen-specific IgD Ab affects the process of outgrowing allergies. We discuss the possibility that allergen-specific IgD Ab production reflects low-affinity, allergen-specific IgE production as children outgrow a food allergy.",

We previously reported that mice overexpressing IL-33 (IL-33Tg) in the cornea and conjunctiva spontaneously develop atopic keratoconjunctivitis-like inflammation. Despite previous studies, it is not fully understood what types of immune cells contribute to the disease process of IL-33-induced keratoconjunctivitis.To defect Th2 cells, IL-33Tg mice were crossed with Rag2KO mice. To defect ILC2s, IL-33Tg mice received bone marrow transplantations from B6.C3(Cg)-Rorasg/J mice that lacked ILC2. Immunostaining techniques were used to determine where ILC2 is distributed in the cornea and conjunctiva. We analyzed the transcriptomes of ILC2 from the conjunctiva by using single-cell RNA-seq analysis. To investigate whether tacrolimus reduces type 2 cytokine production by ILC2, ILC2 was cultured with tacrolimus, and the percentage of cytokine-producing ILC2 was examined. To investigate whether tacrolimus can inhibit IL-33-induced keratoconjunctivitis in vivo, IL-33Tg mice were treated with tacrolimus eye drops.ILC2 infiltrated the conjunctival epithelium and subepithelial tissue. Keratoconjunctivitis developed spontaneously in Rag2KO/IL-33Tg mice, but keratoconjunctivitis was abolished in IL-33Tg mice lacking ILC2. ILC2 was not a uniform cluster but a heterogeneous cluster. Tacrolimus inhibited cytokine production from ILC2s in vitro, and tacrolimus eye drops inhibited keratoconjunctivitis in IL-33Tg mice in vivo.ILC2 plays a pivotal role in IL-33-induced keratoconjunctivitis in mice.",

Since group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) play a pivotal role in asthma by triggering and exacerbating type 2 inflammation, controlling ILC2s function is key to combating severe asthma. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like T cells abundant in humans and are activated both in a T cell receptor-dependent and -independent manner. MAIT cells are composed of MAIT1 and MAIT17 based on the expression of transcription factors T-bet and RORγt, respectively. MAIT cells play pivotal roles in host defense against pathogens and in tissue repair and are essential for the maintenance of immunity and hemostasis. Our recent studies revealed that MAIT cells inhibit both ILC2 proliferation and functions in a mouse model of airway inflammation. MAIT cells may alleviate airway inflammation in two ways, by promoting airway epithelial cell barrier repair and by repressing ILC2s. Therefore, reagents that promote MAIT cell-mediated suppression of ILC2 proliferation and function, or designer MAIT cells (genetically engineered to suppress ILC2s or promote repair of airway damage), may be effective therapeutic agents for severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Skin prick tests (SPT) were performed on 2113 atopic patients (407 children and 1 706 adults) with asthma and/or rhinitis at 24 allergy clinics in Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Lithuania and Russia. Test extracts were Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D. pteronyssinus), Dermatophagoides farinae [D. farinae), cat, dog, horse, birch, timothy, mugwort, Cladosporium, Alternaria, cockroach, chironomids (red mosquito larvae, RML) and shrimp. Among the allergens, timothy followed by cat, birch and dog gave the highest number of positive SPT. Positive SPT with house dust mites (HDM), furred animals, RML and Cladosporium were more common in asthmatics than in patients with rhinitis; birch and timothy more common in patients with rhinitis. Sensitization against D. pteronyssinus, horse, timothy and Cladosporium was more common in men than in women. Although the general sensitization pattern of the atopic patients at the participating centers showed similarities, there were also significant differences between centers. Positive SPT with furred animals were most prevalent in Northern and Central Sweden and St Petersburg, and least common in Siberia and Denmark. Pollen allergy was most common in Novosibirsk and on the west coast of Sweden, and less common in Vladivostok. Sensitization against HDM was most common in Lithuania and least prevalent in Northern Sweden and Finland. Insect allergens gave the most positive reactions in St Petersburg and the least positive reaction in Novosibirsk. Sensitization against multiple allergens was found in 74% of the patients and a mono-allergy in 26%. The degree of atopy was higher in males than in females and higher in asthmatics than in patients with rhinitis. The month of birth of the patients did not influence significantly the test results. It is concluded that although the sensitization pattern shows similarities in different regions, it is also influenced to some extent by residence as well as by diagnosis, sex and age of the patients.",

Patients from each year during this period were divided into eight age groups. The birth month and the month of first visit for each age group was obtained in average of 7 years. Only for subjects aged < 1 year was there a definite tendency for higher birth numbers in autumn and lower birth numbers in spring. The percent birth rate for subjects < 1 year of age was significantly higher in October and November and significantly lower in March and May in comparison with the expected percent birth rates calculated on the basis of birth months of the Japanese population. Similarly, patients aged < 1 year, 1–2 and 3–5 years showed a tendency for higher numbers of first visits in spring and, in addition, patients aged < 1 year showed a tendency for smaller numbers of first visits in summer. At school and college ages, between 6 and 20 years of age, a steep increase of first visits was observed in March and a smaller increase of first visits was observed between July and August. We investigated whether the distribution of birth month for subjects aged < 1 year was statistically significant. The percent first visiting month was significantly higher in March and April and lower between July and October in comparison with the expected percentage first visiting month. We speculated that the uneven distribution of birth month was a reflection of a more marked distortion observed in the distribution of the month of first visit. The mean age at first visit (6.24 months) explains the difference between first visiting month and birth month. There were no definite social reasons for the increase in the number of first visits in spring for subjects aged < 1 year. Therefore, the uneven distribution of the month of first visit for subjects aged < 1 year could probably be the result of climatic effects.",

Furthermore, LPR and immediate-phase response often act in concert to produce confounding symptoms due to repeated attacks over a short period of time. We examined the nasal airway resistance (NAR), allergic symptoms, eosinophil cationic protein and histamine concentration in nasal surface tissue 30 min before, and 10 min, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 h after a house dust (HD) nasal challenge test was performed twice on 10 patients with HD perennial nasal allergy. Nasal airway resistance readings after the HD nasal challenge test were classified into three types based on changes in NAR: type I (short-lasting, five cases); type II (prolonged, eight cases); and type III (biphasic, six cases). Delayed increases in NAR were not observed in type I patients with weak responses to nasal challenge. In type II patients, baseline NAR was elevated and numerous basophilic metachromatic cells (BC) were present in the epithelial layer. In type III patients, baseline NAR was not as elevated as it was in type II patients, but marked responses to challenge were noted. In all three types of changes in NAR, eosinophil leukocyte increased at late phase. Moreover, there was no correlation of change in NAR with an increase in the number of eosinophil leukocyte and BC at the epithelial layer in all three types, which suggests that further study is required to confirm the exact role of eosinophils and basophilic cells in LPR.",

We investigated the relationship between atomspheric pollen counts and the formation of male flowers of Cryptomeria japonica D. Don (C. japonica). An atmospheric pollen survey of C. japonica was conducted from 1983 to 1996 using a Durham's sampler. A regression analysis was performed between the total pollen count and July temperature in previous years. The atmospheric pollen counts of C. japonica had a high positive correlation with the mean temperature in July of the previous year. However, the predicted using average mean July temperature records of the previous year were insufficient, especially in years following high pollen count. In experimental conditions, using 60 C. japonica trees in pots, the formation of male flowers was shown to increase with a rise in incubation temperature. In a forest of C. japonica, our results showed that the length and weight of new needle growth from old needles, which produced many flowers in the previous year, were shorter and lighter, respectively. These aerobiological and plant physiological studies provide evidence that a smaller number of pollen counts are a common result in a year following one in which many male flowers are produced, even if the mean July temperature of that year was high.",

    "abstract": "A study throughout 1999 of the airborne pollens of both Cryptomeria japonica and Cupressaceae (Chamaecyparis obtusa and Juniperus rigida in the present study) demonstrated unique patterns of pollen dispersal at three observation sites, namely Okayama and Nishinomiya cities in the Chugoku region and Sakura city in the Kanto region. In contrast with the Sakura site, where there was a low pollen count for Cupressaceae, high pollen counts were found at the two sites in Okayama and Hyogo Prefectures. There was a good correlation between results of pollen prick tests and the capsulated hydrophilic carrier polymer–radioallergosorbent test (CAP-RAST) for C. japonica, C. obtusa and J. rigida. The fact that a positivity rate of 32.6% to the J. rigida pollen skin test was obtained in Sakura city in Chiba Prefecture, where no J. rigida pollen dispersal was observed, seems to demonstrate the existence of a common antigen epidemiologically. Daily pollen counts, symptom scores, medication scores and symptom–medication scores of 25 patients with vernal pollinosis in Chiba Prefecture in whom the dose and use of internal and external medication was consistent with the severity of their symptoms, were all significantly related. The efficacy of pharmacotherapy seems to be inadequate when patients are exposed to pollen during a heavy pollen dispersal period without having taken any protection against it. Moreover, there seemed to be a certain critical point beyond which the symptoms rapidly worsened. These results suggest that it is important to avoid exposure to pollen, based on the regional pollen information, as well as to administer appropriate medication.",

Serum levels of cedar pollen-specific IgE antibody was examined in Brown Norway rats exposed to a higher dose of (20 μg) Cry j I, a lower dose (2 μg) of Cry j I or no dose for 6 months. Serum levels of cedar pollen-specific IgE antibody were measured by reverse IgE-capture ELISA. The extent of local eosinophilia in the nasal, laryngeal and tracheal mucosa of rats exposed higher and lower doses of cedar pollen antigen and controls were observed microscopically. The mean serum levels of specific IgE antibody in rats exposed to the higher dose were significantly higher than those in rats exposed to the lower dose, and the mean levels in rats in the lower-dose group were significantly higher than in controls. The extent of eosinophilia in the nasal mucosa in the higher-dose group was significantly greater than in controls, but no significant differences between the lower-dose group and controls were found. The extent of eosinophilia in the laryngeal mucosa in the higher-dose group was significantly greater than that in the lower-dose group and in controls. Only a small degree of eosinophilia was observed in the trachea of all three groups. Local exposure dose of the upper airway to cedar pollen may affect sensitization.",

    "abstract": "Since the observation that Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination in children correlates with a decreased prevalence of asthma, several investigators have been attempting to reproduce this effect experimentally in mouse models of asthma. While these reports have agreed in some areas, uncertainty has remained as to the effect of BCG on IgE and asthmatic response in general. Furthermore, the effect of mycobacterial antigens on the early allergic response and the release of bronchoconstrictory mediators have not been examined. In the present study, we have aimed to more completely describe the effect of BCG and Mycobacterium vaccae on early and late allergic responses (EAR and LAR, respectively), airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and broncho-constrictory mediators in the mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. Using BALB/c mice sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) and treated twice with either BCG or M. vaccae (1 × 105 CFU, intranasally), we investigated airway resistance of both the EAR and LAR, AHR to methacholine, serum total and antigen-specific IgE, cysteinyl leukotrienes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (10 min following challenge), a complete cell differential of the BAL (24 h post-challenge), BAL and serum cytokines and lung histology. Neither BCG nor M. vaccae were able to attenuate the EAR, yet both were able to abrogate the parameters used to evaluate the LAR. Interestingly, in neither case were serum or OVA-specific IgE levels reduced after treatment with mycobacterial antigens and type 1/type 2 T cell cytokine skewing, based on cytokine levels in BAL and serum, was incomplete. These results have led us to conclude that the mycobacterial antigens elicit potential anti-asthmatic effects independent of changes in IgE levels. We speculate that mycobacteria likely directly or indirectly suppress eosinophil effector function via attenuation of type 2 T cell-mediated immune responses.",

In the present study, based on questionnaires given to 3224 asthmatic patients in Niigata Prefecture, the characteristics, management and circumstances of elderly asthmatic patients were investigated. Questionnaires were completed by asthmatic patients and their physicians in participating institutions within Niigata Prefecture from September to October 1999. Patients more than 65 years of age were defined as elderly asthmatic patients and a comparison was made between these patients and younger asthmatic patients who were less than 64 years of age and were used as a control group. In the classification of bronchial asthma, a greater frequency of infectious and mixed-type bronchial asthma was found in the elderly, whereas the use of peak flow meters was lower in this group. Significant differences were found for both self- evaluation of the condition of the asthma and satisfaction with daily life between the two age groups. A lower incidence of ambulance use, emergency room visits and use of inhaled steroids was observed in elderly patients, although the incidence of hospitalization and use of oral steroids was higher. The discrepancy between objective and subjective evaluation of asthma control, the incidence of the use of both inhaled and oral steroids and the low use of peak flow meters were problematic in the elderly. Based on sufficient consideration of the problems specifically related to elderly asthmatic patients, adequate education and careful management of asthma in this group are required, and the accumulation of these steps will result in the achievement of the guidelines final goals.",

In the current study, the usefulness and safety of ICSs in the treatment of pregnant women with asthma were investigated. Of 11,358 women who delivered in our hospital between January 1987 and December 2003, 592 women had asthma. Their midwifery records, delivery records, and clinical charts retained in the outpatient clinic of the internal medicine department were reviewed to identify treatments provided, pregnancy/delivery course, and possible perinatal abnormalities. On the basis of these data, the usefulness and safety of ICSs were retrospectively investigated. The percentage of pregnant women with asthma receiving asthma treatment was 17.5% from 1987 to 1989, 32.7% from 1990 to 1994, 43.8% from 1995 to 1999, and 40.7% from 2000 to 2003. Among those treated, the proportion treated with ICSs showed an increase (0% from 1987 to 1989, 10.0% from 1990 to 1994, 55.3% from 1995 to 1999, and 83.3% from 2000 to 2003). Intrapartum asthma attacks occurred in 1.38% of the asthma patients from 1995 to 1999, while there was no such occurrence in 2000 or later. In the untreated patients, the incidence of perinatal abnormalities remained unchanged with the guideline publication (31.6% before and 31.3% after). In contrast, the incidence of perinatal abnormalities in the treated patients decreased from 59.6% to 26.2% with the guideline publication. The incidence of perinatal abnormality among the treated was compared between the ICS therapy and non-ICS therapy groups. No difference was observed between the two groups from 1987 to 1994, but from 1995 to 2003, the total incidence of perinatal abnormalities was significantly higher in the non-ICS group. ICSs can be considered to be safe and useful for the prevention of asthma attacks during pregnancy and for decreasing perinatal abnormalities.",

In addition, it has been indicated that allergic diseases are highly correlated with stress. 2,4,6-Trinitrochlorbenzene (TNCB) and crowding stress were applied to mouse atopic dermatitis (AD) models for the purpose of provoking chronic dermatitis. In addition, TNCB-sensitized mice were given olopatadine hydrochloride (10 or 3 mg/kg), an anti-allergic agent, orally. The neuropeptide content in the skin tissues and serum IgE levels were measured in these mice. Repeated local application of TNCB solution induced itching skin lesions, together with an increase in levels of substance P, a decrease in calcitonin generelated peptide levels and early augmentation of IgE production. Treatment with crowding stress brought about a transient increase in substance P. Furthermore, we observed significant decreases in substance P and serum IgE levels when the administration of olopatadine hydrochloride was started before the elicitation of chronic dermatitis caused by repeated application of TNCB solution. These changes were more definite in the group administered a higher dose of the drug (10 mg/kg). It is suggested that repeated contact allergic dermatitis or mental stress may promote the development and exacerbation of AD and that substance P has a role in this response. In addition, it seems that an anti-allergic drug, such as olopatadine hydrochloride, possibly downregulates substance P, thereby suppressing the development of AD. In the future, the development and clinical application of a drug that strongly influences the release of neuropeptides, such as substance P, and the expression of neuropeptide receptors would be expected for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells express high-affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI) on their surface and can be activated to secrete a variety of biologically active mediators by cross-linking of receptor-bound IgE. Recent studies in animal models indicate that mouse mast cells may play a protective role in host defense against bacteria through the production of tumor necrosis factor-α, mainly as a result of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4- or CD48-mediated activation. Moreover, several recent observations in animal models have indicated that mast cells may also play a pivotal role in coordinating the early phases of autoimmune diseases, particularly those involving auto-antibodies. We recently identified functional TLR4 and FcγRI on human mast cells, in which their expression had been upregulated by interferon-γ. We compared each of the receptor-mediated gene expression profiles with the FcεRI-mediated gene expression profile using high-density oligonucleotide probe arrays and discovered that human mast cells may modulate the immune system in a receptor-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "A new electronic mesh nebulizer, eMotion® is known to have higher performance compared to conventional nebulizers. However, there are some concerns about whether too much delivered dose might cause side effects with higher frequency. To evaluate the safety and usefulness of the nebulizer, we measured changes in heart rates and lung functions of 73 asthmatic children when they inhaled 1 μg/kg of procaterol with eMotion® or a conventional nebulizer, Junior BOY®. In 34 children with mild asthma exacerbation, physical findings, lung function and transcutaneous oxygen saturation levels were improved after inhalation using both nebulizers. No adverse effects including significant increase of heart rate were found. Improvements in the rates of the parameters were comparable. When response to beta2-agonist inhalation was checked in 39 children in stable condition, similar degrees of improvement in lung function were observed, and heart rates did not change after inhalation with either nebulizers. Safety and efficacy was comparable between eMotion® and a conventional nebulizer when it was used to administer beta2-agonists in asthmatic children. However, from the fact that eMotion® needs only 3–4 minutes to inhale 2 mL solution, eMotion® could be more useful for most children who usually do not prefer longer inhalation time with conventional compressor nebulizers.",

    "abstract": "Background: Influenza virus is a major trigger of asthma exacerbation. Annual vaccination against influenza should be considered for asthmatics. However, the inoculation rates remain low. One reason may be the lack of evidence supporting the benefit of the vaccination for patients with asthma. Methods: We studied 115 adults with asthma in 2002–2003 and 67 in 2001–2002 and evaluated the effect of influenza vaccination on the prevention of asthma exacerbation during the winter season (December-March). Results: The rate of asthma exacerbation per person was significantly lower in asthmatics who received influenza vaccination (0.14 ± 0.4) during the 2002–2003 season than in asthmatics who did not (0.35 ± 0.61) (p = 0.037). During 2001–2002 season, the rate of asthma exacerbation in the vaccinated group (0.08 ± 0.41) appeared to be lower than that in the non-vaccinated group (0.27 ± 0.59). However, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.143), presumably due to the low number of patients receiving vaccination. Severe adverse effects due to vaccination were not observed in the patients analyzed. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination during the winter season appears to be effective in the prevention of asthma exacerbation and should be recommended for patients with asthma.",

During the past few years, not only Th1, but also Th2 adjuvants have been reported. Allergy-inducing materials, such as parasites, first stimulate dendritic cells (DCs) to change their character as professional antigen-presenting cells. Such a DC population (DC2) can stimulate naive CD4T cells to induce differentiation into Th2. In some instances, DCs that can stimulate regulatory T cells are also induced. Interestingly, many of such substances are glycolipids or phospholipids that mammalian species do not usually carry. In this paper, we show a cellular and molecular basis for Th2 adjuvants.",

After obtaining approval from the Ethics Committee of Nippon Medical School and informed consent from five patients with cedar pollinosis(one man, four women; age range, 38–66 years), administration of a therapeutic extract was started in July 2001 or later(mean treatment period, 13.4 months). The clinical efficacy of SLIT and its influence on the quality of life, as measured by the Japanese Allergic Rhinitis QOL Standard Questionnaire, and the incidence of side effects were evaluated in 2003. Between February and April the mean severity score was 1.44 in the patients undergoing SLIT and 1.86 in the patients undergoing pharmacotherapy, and the respective mean QOL total scores during the season were 3.82 and 10.0. Neither systemic nor local side effects occurred during SLIT. SLIT is safe and effective for Japanese cedar pollinosis.",

    "abstract": "Dengue fever (DF) is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease. Practical vaccines or specific therapeutics are still expected. Environmental factors and genetic factors affect the susceptibility of Dengue virus (DV) infection. Asthma is a common allergic disease, with house dust mites (HDMs) being the most important allergens. Asthmatic patients are susceptible to several microorganism infections. A nationwide population-based cohort analysis was designed to assess whether to determine whether asthma can be a risk factor for DF. Unexpectedly, our data from a nationwide population-based cohort revealed asthmatic patients are at a decreased risk of DF. Compared to patients without asthma, the hazard ratio (HR) for DF in patients with asthma was 0.166 (95% CI: 0.118–0.233) after adjustment for possible confounding factors. In the age stratification, the adjusted HR for DF in young adult patients with asthma was 0.063. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) of dendritic cells (DCs) is an important entry for DV. Through another in vitro experiment, we found that HDM can diminish surface expression of DC-SIGN in monocyte-derived DCs and further decrease the cellular entry of DV. Decreased DC-SIGN expression in DCs of allergic asthmatic patient may be one of many factors for them to be protected against DF. This could implicate the potential for DC-SIGN modulation as a candidate target for designing therapeutic strategies for DF.",

    "abstract": "Wheezing is a common symptom in infants, which may occasionally develop into asthma. There are many factors related to infant wheezing, including anatomical features, viral infections, and passive smoking. There are only a few reports on the association between renovation and pregnancy worldwide, and reports on this association are inadequate in Japan. This study aimed to examine the association between house renovation and new construction during pregnancy and wheezing in infants during the first year of life using data from the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS).Data of pregnant women registered in JECS were collected using self-administered questionnaires during the second/third trimester and 1 month after delivery. Childbirth records were completed by the doctors. Similarly, wheezing in infants was evaluated using self-administered questionnaires 1 year after birth. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the primary outcome.In total, 75,731 infants, excluding those with unknown gender, who were not singleton infants, and who relocated during pregnancy and the first month of life, were examined in this study. Renovation during pregnancy increased the prevalence of wheezing (odds ratio [OR]: 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.48) and recurrent wheezing (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.00-1.48) in the first year of life. The relationship between new construction during pregnancy and wheezing in infants was insignificant (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.90-1.06).Renovation during pregnancy may be a risk factor for wheezing in infants, and should be avoided.",

However, the robust barrier structure and function of the skin are highly resistant against external insults so as to not easily allow foreign invasions. Upon sensing danger signals, the innate immunity system is promptly activated. This process is mediated by alarmins, which are released passively from damaged cells. Nuclear alarmins or stressorins are actively released from intact cells in response to various cellular stresses. Alarmins/stressorins are deeply involved in the disease processes of chronic skin disorders of an unknown cause, such as rosacea, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, alarmins/stressorins are also induced in the congenital skin disorders of ichthyosis and keratoderma due to defective keratinization. Studies on alarmin activation and its downstream pathways may help develop novel therapeutic agents for intractable skin disorders.",

    "abstract": "The total naso-ocular symptom score (TSS) is widely used as an endpoint to evaluate the severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, it is not a generic preference-based measure. We sought to develop an algorithm for mapping between the TSS and health utility in Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP). We also performed a cost-utility analysis of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for JCP by using this algorithm.Patients with JCP filled out the TSS questionnaire and EQ-5D-5L simultaneously during the pollen season in 2019 and in 2020. We estimated a direct utility mapping model by regressing responses to individual TSS questions directly onto utility. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of active SLIT to a placebo was determined by examining the drug expense and the estimated quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using a dataset from a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.A total of 238 records were included for analysis. The estimated utility decreased with increasing severity of rhinitis. Patients with comorbid asthma showed lower utility. A negative and significant correlation was seen between the TSS and utility in both 2019 and 2020. The estimated equations were: Y(utility) = -0.0161∗X(TSS) + 1.005 in non-asthmatic JCP patients. The ICER of active SLIT to the placebo was estimated to be 4,049,720 and 6,011,218 JPY/QALY in the first and second year, respectively.It is possible to reasonably predict utility from the total naso-ocular symptom score by using regression models. In the estimated algorithm, pre-seasonal SLIT for JCP is cost-effective.",

In the component-resolved diagnosis (CRD) using microarray technology, she also tested positive for profilin, a pan-allergen among plants. It is reported that profilin cross-reacts between pollen, fruits, vegetables and latex. From these results, we concluded that the allergic reactions to multiple kinds of foodstuff and pollens observed in this subject were due to cross-reactivity induced by profilin.

We evaluated the relationship between eNO and lung function by minimizing the effects of aging and height.In Study 1, the subjects comprised 738 elementary school children and junior high school children (aged 6 to 15 years, 366 males and 372 females). They were divided into two groups according to age (6-10 years and 11-15 years). A height range was determined by a histogram of height in each group. In Study 2, lung function, respiratory resistance and eNO level were measured in age- and height-limited groups.In Study 1, total of 148 younger children ranging in height from 120 to 130 cm and 180 older children ranging in height from 148 to 158 cm participated in Study 2. The level of eNO among asthmatic children was higher than that of normal children in both the younger and the older groups. The decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) and other parameters of central airway resistance did not correlate with the eNO level. However, the small airway parameters of MMEF and V(25)/HT in older asthmatic children, and V(25)/HT and R(5)-R(20) in younger asthmatic children inversely correlated with eNO.Our data suggest that eNO level inversely correlates with small airway narrowing, and airway inflammation has a significant effect on small airway lung function in asthmatic school children.",

    "abstract": "Oral allergy syndrome resulted from plant-derived foods is frequent among adults. Allergy to melon (cucumis melo) is one of the most frequent fruit allergies in Iran. Three different major allergens have been found in Cucumis melo that Cuc m 1 (cucumisin) has been identified as the major allergen of melon. Cucumisin is an alkaline serine protease that it is found as a 78 kDa protein in precursor form. The aim of this study was production of recombinant Cuc m 1 in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells and characterization of its allergenicity property. Production of recombinant Cuc m 1 was carried out by cDNA cloning technique into the pET32b(+) vector using specific primers designed based on cucumisin nucleotide sequence available in Genebank database, cucumisin encoding gene and directional cloning method. Cloned plasmid into E. coli TOP10 was transformed into E. coli BL21 and expression of the protein was induced by iptg. The recombinant protein was purified via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography using histidine tag in recombinant protein. IgE binding of this protein was assessed by IgE-immunoblotting, ELISA and inhibition ELISA. The directional cloning was resulted in expression of a fusion Cuc m 1. Immunoblotting with sera of patients allergic to melon showed strong reactivity with purified protein band. Inhibition assays demonstrated that purified rCuc m 1 could be the same with natural form of Cuc m 1 in total extract. In the present study, we have provided a functional recombinant cucumisin allergen, rCuc m 1 with 86 kDa, which may be used as a standard allergen for clinical diagnosis and study of allergy to melon.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that has a severe impact on health worldwide. A survey of 10,771 patients with bronchial asthma in the Tama region, Tokyo was conducted for 5 years to examine treatment and quality of life (QOL). Subjects were patients aged ≥ 16 years and their physicians who replied to a questionnaire sent in November from 2002 to 2006. Symptoms of bronchial asthma, visits to an emergency room, use of drugs, and severity of asthma were investigated. Asthmatic symptoms improved over the 5 years, with a reduction in the number of emergency room visits. Since inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were used by > 80% of patients in 2002, we suspected that increased use of concomitant leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) and long-acting β2 agonists (LABA) might have contributed to these findings. The effects of these drugs were compared between ICS + LTRA (n = 45) and ICS + LABA (n = 54) groups of patients. There was no significant difference in the ICS dose between these groups. In the ICS + LABA group, 18.5% and 22.2% of patients visited an emergency room before and after initiation of combination therapy, respectively, with no statistically significant difference. In contrast, the rate of emergency room visits in the ICS + LTRA group decreased from 24.4% to 6.6% after addition of LTRA. These results suggest that the frequency of visits to an emergency room was decreased by complementing the anti-inflammatory effect of ICS with further treatment of inflammation, particularly with LTRA.",

The Allergy Control Score was proved to be a valid and reliable instrument to assess allergy severity in clinical trials and may be used in observational studies of respiratory allergic diseases in many countries. We translated the Allergy Control Score and adapted it for use in Japan.We translated the original English version into Japanese according to the Mapi approach to linguistic validation: conceptual definition, forward translation by two native Japanese speakers, reconciliation, backtranslation by an independent translator, review in consultation with original developer, and pilot testing on 12 patients of an allergy clinic and 3 volunteers with seasonal/non-seasonal allergic rhinitis and/or asthma.Two of the ten back-translated items needed slight modifications and some words were revised. In the pilot test, the average time required to complete the questionnaire was 55 seconds for the section on symptoms and 25 seconds for the section on medication. All participants were able to self-complete the questionnaire.By applying the Mapi approach to linguistic validation, we ensured a close match between the Japanese and English versions of the Allergy Control Score. The Allergy Control Score Japanese version is accessible and acceptable to persons with respiratory allergic symptoms in Japan.",

At the same time, recognition of numerous sources of formaldehyde in indoor environments has increased concerns about health hazards from this pollutant. Formaldehyde has been shown to cause and exacerbate asthmatic symptoms. In addition, the effects of formaldehyde on the airway are proportional to the concentration and duration of exposure and are greater in inflamed than in healthy airways. Formaldehyde may induce features of airway inflammation associated with asthma, such as epithelial disruption, microvascular leakage and increased airway secretions. Exposure to this chemical may facilitate IgE sensitization to a variety of allergens, as well as producing IgE-mediated allergic responses to itself. Thus, avoidance of formaldehyde exposure may reduce the incidence and severity of asthma, although the ability of low concentrations of formaldehyde to trigger mechanisms contributing to asthmatic symptoms is still debated. Setting appropriate exposure limits for formaldehyde as an indoor environmental pollutant requires further quantitative and predictive evaluation of its health effects.",

This augmentation was due to the systemic effect of percutaneously absorbed GC, because topical GC also augmented the skin reaction in mice that had been sensitized on a separate site from that of the GC application. In contrast, topical application of GC inhibited the contact sensitivity skin reaction when applied on the challenged sites. Intraperitoneal injection of the same dose of GC also failed to augment the skin reactions. Glucocorticoid augmented the contact sensitivity skin reactions and these persisted for 96 h after the control skin reactions subsided. Early phase (1–6 h) skin reactions were also induced or augmented when dinitrofluorobenzene or trinitrochlorobenzene but not oxazolone were used as the sensitizer; GC also augmented the non-specific reactions to croton oil or to suboptimal concentration of hapten in normal mice. The numbers of Langerhans cells (LC) were reduced in both the GC-application and challenged sites. Haptenated LC from GC-treated skin showed a rather weak sensitizing ability, which was not statistically significant. Transfer of lymph node cells and/or spleen cells or serum from GC-pre-treated mice failed to induce a contact sensitivity reaction in normal recipient mice. These results suggest that topical GC might augment cutaneous inflammation through a possible modulation of local cytokine production, regardless of the number of LC or the presence of sensitized lymphocytes.",

Immunoglobulin (Ig) E was characterized pharmacologically and compared with that caused by compound 48/80. Although DNFB application itself caused scratching behavior in non-sensitized mice, the number of scratchings apparently increased in sensitized mice from 60 min after antigen application in comparison with non-sensitized control mice. Prednisolone, cyproheptadine, dibucaine and naloxone significantly inhibited the DNFB-induced scratching behavior, whereas the histamine H1-receptor antagonists HSR-609, cetirizine and terfenadine only showed a tendency to inhibit scratching. Injection of 48/80 into the rostral part of the back also caused scratching. The first scratching was observed within 10 min after injection and lasted intermittently for 30 min. The 48/80-induced scratching was markedly inhibited by cyproheptadine, dibucaine and naloxone, but not by prednisolone and the histamine H1-receptor antagonists. Ear edema caused by DNFB application in sensitized mice was markedly inhibited by prednisolone, HSR-609, cetirizine, terfenadine and cyproheptadine, whereas dibucaine and naloxone failed to affect ear edema. These results indicate that scratching behavior could be induced in mice in association with an IgE-mediated allergic cutaneous reaction and that the reaction is pharmacologically similar, but not identical, to that caused by 48/80. Although histamine is considered to participate in the formation of ear edema, it may not play an important role in the generation of scratching.",

While limited information is currently available, recent functional studies have suggested that ML-1 (IL-17 F) is a multifunctional protein with a wide tissue expression pattern.

In response to challenge with 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05% DNFB, triphasic skin reactions, including an immediate-phase response (IPR), a late-phase response (LPR) and a very late-phase response (vLPR) at 1 and 24 h and 8 days after antigen challenge, respectively, were increased in socially isolated mice compared with group-housed mice. Oral administration of Yokukan-san attenuated the isolation stress-exacerbated triphasic skin reactions in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it had no significant effect on cutaneous reactions in the unstressed group-housed mice. In contrast, intraperitoneal administration of diazepam, a classic benzodiazepine receptor agonist, suppressed the enhanced IPR and LPR in socially isolated mice but, surprisingly, stimulated vLPR in both stressed and unstressed mice, showing different efficacy to Yokukan-san. Moreover, the elevated locomotor activity in socially isolated mice was reduced by Yokukan-san and diazepam, while the isolation stress-induced aggressive behavior was normalized only by diazepam and not by Yokukan-san. The results of the present study indicate that IgE-mediated triphasic cutaneous reactions were exacerbated by social isolation stress and suggest that Yokukan-san and diazepam antagonize isolation stress-induced cutaneous reactions partly through their sedative action on social isolation stress.",

    "abstract": "It is believed that G-protein-coupled receptors are the most promising target proteins for drug research. The β2-adrenergic receptor has been analyzed extensively in terms of its structure, regulation and signaling as a prototype G-protein-coupled receptor. Recent development of a recombinant β2-adrenergic receptor reveals that the receptor exists in different conformations in addition to the resting and active forms. Furthermore, different conformations that are important for coupling with G-proteins are induced in a ligand-specific manner. After the receptor binds an agonist, the receptor is phosphorylated by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase or second messenger-dependent kinase. β-Arrestin is a cytosolic protein that binds to receptors phosphorylated by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase, but not those phosphorylated by second messenger-dependent kinase, and plays important roles in agonist-induced desensitization. However, β-arrestin has recently been recognized as a scaffold protein that helps to achieve efficient transmission of internalization and signaling. Receptor agonists can be divided into two groups: full and partial agonists. Partial agonists have an advantage over full agonists because desensitization is less likely to be induced following stimulation with a partial agonist. However, the effects of partial agonists on β-arrestin-mediated signaling and internalization have not been fully examined so far. Information regarding the binding sites of partial agonists is still not sufficient to explain why they cannot fully activate the receptor. In the present study, recent progress regarding the structure, regulation and signaling of β2 adrenergic receptors and about differences between full and partial agonists will be summarized.",

Atopic dermatitis was observed in 12 of 18 infants at 4 months and in five of 15 infants at 1 year. Egg white-specific IgE was positive (≥ 0.70 UA/mL) in six infants at 4 months and in seven infants at 1 year. No relationship was observed between the percentage of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli or clostridia in the intestinal tract at 4 months and the development of allergy. However, all five infants who exhibited a percentage of bacter- oides (compared with the total intestinal microflora level) of more than 10% at 4 months had positive egg white-specific IgE and higher levels of total IgE (> 25 IU/mL) at 1 year; these relationships were statistically significant (P = 0.01). Colonization with bacteroides at 4 months of age is suggested to be related to the allergic state at 1 year of age.",

    "abstract": "Theophylline is a bronchodilator that also has an anti-inflammatory effect. In Japan, methylxanthines, including theophylline and aminophylline (theophylline ethylenediamine), have been used widely in the treatment of asthma. In some asthma management guidelines, although methylxanthines are recommend for the treatment of asthma, they are not preferred primarily because of potential serious adverse effects in case of overdose. The present review examines the efficacy and adverse effects of sustained-release theophylline and injectable methylxanthines in the treatment of chronic asthma and acute exacerbation of asthma by evaluating reports of published clinical trials and a prospective survey on the occurrence of serious adverse drug reactions to these agents. A prospective survey on the safety of methylxanthines was administered to adult patients (15–64 years of age), mainly with asthma, in medical centers by physicians certified as specialists by the Japanese Society of Allergology. Review of published clinical trials has shown that methylxanthines are effective in controlling asthma. In the prospective study, in the case of sustained-release theophylline, 3921subjects reported by 66 medical centers and meeting the criteria for inclusion in the survey were selected for analysis. In the case of intravenous methylxanthines, 682 subjects reported by 55 medical centers conforming and meeting the criteria for inclusion in the survey were selected for analysis. None of these subjects exhibited serious adverse drug reaction with sustained-release theophylline or intravenous methylxanthines. In conclusion, methylxanthines are effective for the treatment of asthma and are safe as long as the dose administered accords with the protocols recommended by asthma management guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Transdermal patches containing tulobuterol, slow-releasing β2-agonist patches, are now widely used in the treatment of asthma in Japan. Unlike inhalational β2-agonists, tulobuterol patches act systemically and may modify the functional status of inflammatory cells in the peripheral circulation. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of tulobuterol on the adhesive interaction between blood eosinophils and endothelial cells. Peripheral blood eosinophils and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were pretreated with either tulobuterol or a control medium, and adhesion of eosinophils to HUVEC was examined using an eosinophil peroxidase assay. Spontaneous adhesion of eosinophils to resting HUVEC was not modified by tulobuterol. On the other hand, eosinophil adhesion to IL-4 + TNFα-stimulated-HUVEC was inhibited minimally but significantly by tulobuterol. Furthermore, both IL-5- and FMLP-activated adhesions of eosinophils to HUVEc were partially but significantly inhibited by tulobuterol. Tulobuterol can decrease adhesion of blood eosinophils to endothelial cells. This finding suggests that tulobuterol patches have anti-inflammatory properties, and may therefore contribute to the treatment of airway inflammation in asthma.",

Increased exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) levels have been shown to be associated with allergic airway inflammation. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of isocyanate on eNO levels and to elucidate whether the latter are associated with specific sensitization and/or unspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). Additionally, we wanted to compare eNO changes of smokers and non-smokers. Methods: We determined eNO during diagnostic isocyanate challenges in workers with suspected isocyanate asthma. : Fourteen of 22 symptomatic isocyanate workers showed BHR and five of these 14 developed an asthmatic response upon challenge with methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). In comparison with the group without BHR, subjects with BHR had higher basal eNO and a significant increase in eNO 22 hrs after MDI challenge. Four of the asthmatic responders and six of the nine MDI non-responders with BHR revealed an eNO increase of > 30%. There was also a positive association between the eNO change and the increase in airway resistance in isocyanate workers with BHR. The highest eNO change was found in subjects with IgE-mediated sensitization to MDI and low MDI thresholds. Only one of the eight MDI non-responders without BHR exhibited an eNO increase of > 30%. : Isocyanate workers with BHR show increased MDI responses both of airway resistance and of the inflammatory marker eNO. eNO measurement is obviously a new suitable tool for monitoring isocyanate workers under respiratory risk.",

    "abstract": "We have already reported that antigen-specific IgG1 antibody production in WBB6F1-W/Wv (W/Wv) mice after oral administration of ovalbumin (OVA) was extremely high. Active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) was induced in these mice after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of OVA, and Th2-dominant helper T-cell activation occurred. In this study, we examined the effect of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) conjugation of OVA on oral immunization of W/Wv mice. W/Wv mice were sensitized by administration of 0.1 mg OVA or CpG ODN-OVA by gavage every day for 4 weeks, and the serum titers of OVA-specific IgG1, IgE, and IgG2a antibody were determined. ASA was induced by i.p. injection of OVA, and the changes in body temperature were monitored. In vitro production of Th1- and Th2- type cytokines by splenocytes re-stimulated with antigen was also measured. The antigen-specific IgG1 antibody titer in the CpG ODN-OVA-sensitized W/Wv mice was lower than in the OVA-sensitized group, but the IgG2a titer was higher. ASA was not induced by i.p. OVA challenge. There were significant increases in the production of Th1-type cytokine (IFN-γ) by splenocytes in the CpG ODN-OVA-sensitized mice, but the Th2-type cytokine (IL-4) level in the splenocyte culture medium was lower. These results indicated that oral administration of CpG ODN-OVA conjugate significantly induced antigen-specific Th1 responses and reduced Th2 responses (allergic reactions) on re-stimulation. These findings suggest that CpG ODN-antigen conjugate may be useful as an oral vaccine.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the ability of chlorine bleach (NaOCl) to reduce the immunogenicity of the major allergenic protein of Japanese cedar (Cry j 1).Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, and skin testing were carried out in 7 individuals.The allergenic protein was undetectable using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining at a sodium hypochlorite/allergenic protein molar ratio of 457. Western blotting with human sera showed the same dose-dependent efficacy. The immunogenicity of the purified protein and cedar pollen was also demonstrated on enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay to be reduced by sodium hypochlorite treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, sodium hypochlorite-treatment inhibited the skin test response to the protein in all 7 individuals.Hypochlorous acid generated by electrolysis is an effective method for significantly reducing the immunogenicity of Cry j 1.",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict the development of allergic diseases in infants is important. Predictive biomarkers are wanted to improve the risk evaluation in addition to known heredity of allergy. Biomarkers taken during infancy need to be evaluated through longitudinal studies into adulthood. The objective of this study was to analyse the occurrence of metachromatic cells in the nasal mucosa during infancy (MCinfancy) and evaluate the cells as predictive biomarkers of allergy development. Previously, MCinfancy occurrences were analysed in 64 infants with and without allergy heredity, and related to allergy development at 18 months and 6 years of age. In this third follow-up at 18 years of age, current allergy symptoms were analysed. MCinfancy findings were related to the cumulative number of allergic subjects. The predictive values of MCinfancy and known heredity were compared. The cumulative number of subjects with allergy was 46, probable allergy 5, and no allergy 13. Detected MCinfancy predicted allergy with high accuracy (31/33), but negative MCinfancy findings did not exclude the risk (15/31). In the group of allergic subjects positive MCinfancy were found in 31/46 (67%), positive heredity in 37/46 (80%) and one/both factors positive in 43/46 (93%). Detection of MCinfancy could precede the debut of allergy symptoms by many years. Detected MCinfancy predicted allergy development, but absence of MCinfancy did not exclude the risk, and therefore this biomarker was not found to be adequate. There is a further need to find biomarkers with high ability to both predict and exclude the risk.",

    "abstract": "Adherence Starts with Knowledge-12 (ASK-12) is a useful indicator of drug adherence. In this study, we analyzed patient background including social and psychological factors in a low-adherence group of patients with asthma defined using ASK-12. From a questionnaire survey for patients with asthma from the Niigata Prefecture, Japan, conducted in the fall of 2016, we enrolled patients who answered all ASK-12 items and underwent a measured respiratory function test within 1 year. The low-adherence group (ASK-12 ≥ 28) was compared with the control group (ASK-12 < 28), and we conducted a cluster analysis of the low-adherence group. There were 170 patients in the low-adherence group and 402 patients in the control group. There was a significant difference between age, gender, working status, smoking history, the percentage of forced expiratory volume in one second (%FEV1), asthma control test (ACT), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score between the two groups. Logistic analysis revealed that working status (working), % FEV1 (<90%), and PHQ-9 score (>5) were independent factors for the low-adherence group. The cluster analysis identified three clusters in the low-adherence group. Among these, one cluster was characterized by elderly males with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and another by middle-aged nonsmoking females with a depression tendency, had problems with asthma control. Several factors were considered to be attributed to low drug-adherence. There were several phenotypes in the low-adherence population correlated with incomplete asthma control. Intervention with drug adherence should be a future goal for asthma treatment.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We analyzed seasonal variations in eicosanoid levels in the airways of patients with asthma and concomitant SAR sensitized to JCP (N = 29, BA-SAR-JCP group) and those not sensitized (N = 13, BA-AR-non-JCP group) during the JCP season. The association between changes in eicosanoid concentrations and pulmonary function was assessed. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) was collected, and pulmonary function tests were performed during the JCP and non-JCP seasons. The cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), prostaglandin D2-methoxime (PGD2-MOX), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels in the collected EBC were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent immunoassays. The log CysLT levels significantly increased in the BA-SAR-JCP group during the JCP season compared with the non-JCP season (1.78 ± 0.55, 1.39 ± 0.63 pg/mL, mean ± standard deviation, respectively, p = 0.01) and those in the BA-AR-non-JCP group during the JCP season (1.39 ± 0.38 pg/mL, p = 0.04). Moreover, the log TXB2 levels seemed to increase. However, the log LTB4 and log PGD2-MOX levels did not increase. The changes in the log CysLT levels during the two seasons were negatively correlated to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in the BA-SAR-JCP group (r = −0.52, p < 0.01). In the BA-SAR-JCP group, seasonal increases in eicosanoid levels in the airway likely promoted deterioration in pulmonary function despite optimal maintenance treatment.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that bronchioles are involved in asthma, there have been limited asthmatic cases showing marked centrilobular opacities on computed tomography (CT) chest scans. Systemic corticosteroids have been administered in such cases, but the efficacy of extra-fine particle inhaled corticosteroids has not been assessed. A previously healthy 64-year-old man presented with a four-month history of productive cough and progressive dyspnea despite a combination therapy with inhaled salmeterol (50 μg bid) and fluticasone (500 μg bid), sustained-release theophylline, and pranlukast because of suspicion of asthma. Physical examination revealed wheezing at the end of forced expiration. High resolution CT chest scan showed diffuse centrilobular opacities, bronchiectatic changes, and bronchial wall thickening. Transbronchial lung biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and transbronchial biopsy all showed predominant eosinophil infiltrates, suggesting that eosinophilic inflammation across the entire airway tree caused the abnormal CT findings. Alveolar fraction of exhaled nitric oxide level, a non-invasive marker of eosinophilic peripheral airway inflammation, was also elevated. Because he refused systemic corticosteroids, inhaled ciclesonide (400 μg bid) and inhaled tiotropium were added on to his current medication under careful observation. His symptoms, pulmonary function and CT findings promptly improved, and he had fully recovered at follow-up. Extra-fine particle inhaled corticosteroids could be an alternative approach in centrilobular opacities caused by eosinophilic peripheral airway inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Yellow sand dust (“Asian dust”) is a meteorological phenomenon involving the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants originating from the Taklamakan and Gobi deserts and the Loess plateau. Over one million tons of Asian dust particles are estimated to fall on Japan each year, 3000-5000 km away from their source regions. Yellow sand dust particles reach not only Asia but also the North American continent and Europe. Chemical analysis of these storms and microbiological studies of Asian dust have suggested that humans in the affected regions are exposed to communities of microorganisms that may cause various adverse health effects. 1 Recently, Kobayashi et al. 2 reported that Asian sand dust directly sampled with a bioaerosol sampler at a height of 400 m using a tethered balloon over Noto Peninsula, Suzu City, Ishikawa Prefecture, contained Nocardiopsis spp., Bacillus spp., Streptomyces spp., and Bjerkandera spp. Ichinose et al. 3 reported the aggravating effects of Asian sand dust on lung eosinophilia in mice, and found marked eosinophil accumulation in the bronchial lavage fluid in mice stimulated with Bjerkandera spp. among these isolated strains in samples provided by Kobayashi (personal communication).",

    "abstract": "Adrenaline is the first-line medication for managing anaphylaxis. A better understanding of prescription trends for adrenaline auto-injectors (AAIs) is important to improving patient care as well as information on health education interventions and medical guidelines. However, it has been difficult to gather comprehensive data in a sustainable manner. Thus, we aimed to investigate trends in AAI prescriptions in Japan.We searched the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB), a unique and comprehensive database of health insurance claims, and investigated prescriptions for AAIs for all ages (April 2017 to March 2018). We assessed the annual number of prescriptions per person as well as prescription rates per 100,000 population per year by age, sex, and geographic region.A total of 88,039 subjects (56,109 males, 31,930 female) and 116,758 devices (1.33 AAIs per patient per year) were prescribed AAIs at least once a year for all ages. The prescription rate for AAIs was 69.5 per 100,000 population-years. Patients aged 0-9 years were prescribed AAIs at the rate of 278.9 per 100,000 population-years. Patients aged 0-19 years were 6.4 times more likely to be prescribed AAIs than those over 20 years of age. Males were more frequently prescribed AAIs than females in all age groups, except for those aged 20-24 years. We also evaluated differences in prescription rates by geographic region.This comprehensive evaluation revealed trends in AAI prescriptions, thus helping develop preventive strategies with respect to anaphylaxis in Japan.",

    "abstract": "Airway epithelium-derived cytokines are critical to provoke and perpetuate type 2 inflammation in asthma. Yet it is poorly understood how this epithelial cell-driven inflammatory response is negatively regulated. We previously reported that Axl receptor tyrosine kinase was expressed by basal cells in the airway epithelium and had a role in defining their stem cell identity. However, whether and how Axl regulates airway type 2 inflammation remains unknown.We performed immunofluorescence staining to compare Axl expression in airway epithelium between non-asthmatic subjects, mild-moderate asthma and severe asthma. We confirmed this result by interrogating public databases of global gene expression in endobronchial biopsies. We then quantified eosinophil numbers infiltrating into the trachea of wild-type or Axl-knockout mice that were intranasally treated with house dust mite extracts (HDM). Cell-based assays using siRNA targeting Axl were further performed to identify molecules involved in Axl-mediated regulation of inflammation.Histological assessments and transcriptome analyses revealed decreases in protein and mRNA of Axl in airway basal cells of severe asthmatics. This reduction of Axl expression was correlated with infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells in severe asthmatics. Eosinophil infiltration was more evident in the trachea of Axl-knockout mice in response to repetitive HDM administration. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Axl increased mRNA and protein expression of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in human bronchial epithelial cells.Axl kinase expressed by basal cells may suppress excessive eosinophilic inflammation via inhibition of GM-CSF in the airway. Axl reduction has clinical implications for the pathogenesis of severe asthma.",

We investigated whether this finding varies during summer based on the type of cleanser (soaps and detergents). This evaluator-blinded, pragmatic, randomized, and non-inferiority study enrolled patients with AD whose eczema was controlled following regular steroid ointment application 2 days/week. For 8 ± 4 weeks, participants washed their upper and lower limbs with a cleanser on one side and with water alone on the other. Each participant chose either a weakly alkaline soap or an acidic detergent. The primary outcome was the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score at week 8 ± 4. The data of 43 of the 47 registered participants were analyzed. The median patient age was 44 (23–99) months; 28 and 15 participants chose weakly alkaline and acidic cleansers, respectively. At week 8 ± 4, EASI scores of the water and cleanser sides were 0.00 (0.00–0.40) and 0.15 (0.00–0.40), respectively (p = 0.74). The difference between both sides was 0.00 (−0.07 to 0.14); the limits of the 95 % confidence interval did not reach the pre-specified non-inferiority margin. No difference was observed in the median Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure score, number of additional steroid ointment applications, and occurrences of skin infections. There were no differences between the cleanser types in any of the results. We demonstrated that washing with water was not inferior to that with a cleanser in patients with AD in the maintenance phase during summer, regardless of the type of cleanser.",

Overall, 306 pregnant women were recruited. Their newborns were examined by otolaryngologists and pediatric allergists at 1, 2, and 5 years of age. Participants with clinical and laboratory data available at all consultation points were considered eligible. Among 187 eligible participants, the prevalence rates of PAR were 2.1%, 4.3%, and 24.1% at 1, 2, and 5 years of age, respectively. AR-specific nasal local findings and eosinophils in nasal smear were observed in a substantial number of patients with PAR at 1 and 2 years of age. Factors present up to 2 years of age that were associated with PAR onset at 5 years of age, in descending order, were as follows: sensitization to house dust mites (HDM), nasal eosinophilia, and sensitization to cat dander. In 44 cases with HDM sensitization, nasal eosinophilia up to 2 years of age achieved a sensitivity of 76.0% and a specificity of 73.7% for predicting PAR onset at 5 years. Rhinitis findings and nasal eosinophilia are useful auxiliary diagnostic items for pediatric PAR. Sensitization to HDM and nasal eosinophilia were the most influential factors associated with future PAR onset. A combination of these factors may facilitate the prediction of PAR onset.",

    "abstract": "Skin reaction patterns vary across patients with cholinergic urticaria (CholU), but their definition, prevalence, and clinical significance remain ill characterized. Patients with CholU underwent pulse-controlled ergometry provocation testing to analyze skin reaction patterns and their correlation with location, onset, severity, sweating behaviour, clinical features, disease control, and quality of life (QoL) impairment. Based on the size, color, spacing, and shape of wheals as well as their surrounding skin responses, we identified six distinct types of CholU skin reactions, which differed in prevalence, from 83% (Type I) to 11% (Type VI) of patients affected. Almost all patients (94%) had ≥1 type of skin reaction pattern. Sweating was reduced in the majority of CholU patients and most prominently reduced in patients with Type VI skin signs (very small, round, red, widely spaced wheals with surrounding anemic halo), which emerged exclusively on the extremities. Type V skin signs (large, irregular, anemic, widely spaced wheals with moderate size erythema) were associated with the most severe clinical presentation and poorest QoL. Our analysis showed that most patients have more than one type of skin reaction patterns and that different skin signs are linked to distinct features. Future studies should determine any links between treatment response and types of skin signs in CholU.",

    "abstract": "To identify risk factors for childhood wheezing and allergies, a questionnaire regarding family histories and environmental factors was added to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) Phase One questionnaire and the associations between current prevalence and risk factors were analyzed. Questionnaires were completed by 4466 schoolchildren, who were 13–14 years of age, in Tochigi Prefecture. Children were divided into groups on the basis of risk factors and the severity of each allergic disease according to answers to the ISAAC questionnaire. In analyses of family histories, the odds ratios (OR) of children who have a family history with no symptoms were significantly lower by risk factor-based analyses compared with those children with a family history of symptoms of wheezing (OR = 2.34-4.39), rhinitis (1.76-2.68) and eczema (2.54-7.81), and significant correlations were observed between severity and family history in all diseases by the Mantel test (P < 0.001). Although the OR of household smoking was not significant, heavier smoking in a household had an effect on severity and showed a significant correlation with severity in rhinitis (P < 0.05) and eczema (P < 0.01). Regarding road traffic, the percentage of children living in an area with heavy traffic showed a significant correlation with the severity of wheezing (P < 0.05) and no children with severe wheezing lived in areas with light traffic. In addition, the mean percentage of children with current wheezing between school locations was significantly higher in the city area (10.2 ± 0.7%) compared with that in the suburbs (6.6 ± 0.9%; P = 0.01) and industrial areas (6.6 ± 0.7%; P = 0.01). These results suggest that the family histories may have potential effects on the severity of allergic diseases and that household smoking for rhinitis and eczema and heavy road traffic for asthma may be more important modifiable risk factors for severity in Japan.",

In the present study we quantitatively analyzed VEGF in the nasal lavage fluid of patients with nasal allergy. We performed nasal antigen challenge with Japanese cedar pollen antigen in 10 healthy adult volunteers and in 10 cedar pollen IgE-positive patients with nasal allergy. In all patients with nasal allergy, VEGF and histamine levels in the nasal lavage fluid reached a peak 30 min after antigen challenge, then returned to prechallenge values 2 h after antigen challenge. In these patients, the histamine level increased three-fold, while the VEGF level increased 10-fold. However, in all healthy adult volunteers, VEGF and histamine levels did not increase. A stronger correlation was noted between the ratio of decreased nasal cavity volume and the ratio of increased VEGF levels (R = 0.823; P < 0.001) than between the ratio of nasal cavity volume and the ratio of increased histamine levels (R = 0.660; P < 0.01). These results suggest that VEGF may contribute to the pathogenesis of nasal obstruction in the early phase of nasal allergy as a new factor involved in increasing vascular permeability.",

However, in order to plant C. japonica forests with low allergen levels, there is still a shortage of fundamental data for forest breeding. To obtain the some fundamental data concerning Cry j 1, three items were investigated: (i) variations in weight and Cry j 1 content per single pollen grain among 117 clones; (ii) environmental factors affecting Cry j 1 content; and (iii) genotype variations of Cry j1. Although the variation in weight per single pollen grain among 117 clones was relatively small (mean (± SD) 10.2 ± 0.1 ng), the Cry j 1 content was found to vary widely from 0.26 to 7.54 pg. The expression level of Cry j 1 was higher in samples collected from lower altitudes. Using western blotting, it was shown that there were two Cry j 1 genotype variations. From these results, we have concluded that immunologic determination of Cry j 1 by individual pollen grain levels provides useful data, especially for forest breeding to prevent pollinosis.",

Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, derived from T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) subsets, are central in mediating IgE production and development of immediate hypersensitivity. Atopy is also characterized by Th1/Th2 skewing that derives from genetic and environmental factors. The prevalence of atopy has increased in recent decades, especially in developed countries among children and young adults. In the present review, we first discuss the relationship between the Th1/Th2 imbalance and the recent rise of allergy.

    "abstract": "Asthma treatments have changed radically due to elucidation of morbidity and development of medicine/treatment strategies. The Global Initiative for Asthma consists of a six-part asthma management program and seven defined states for controlled asthma worldwide. However, considering the present status of asthma in infants through to young adult patients, it is extremely difficult to implement these ideal programs and to attain their goals. At the Pediatric Unit in the National Minami Fukuoka Chest Hospital, the number of out-patients and patients hospitalized due to asthma attacks increased continuously from 1975 until 1987 at respective rates of 4.9-fold (from 466 to 2295 patients) and 10.6-fold (from 118 to 1245 cases). Thereafter, the number of out-patients has remained stable (1999 patients in 1997), while the number of hospitalizations has decreased (766 in 1997). However, the age-specific distribution of hospitalized patients has changed remarkably. There are two peaks: one in the infant population and another in older elementary school students. In the past, the incidence of hospitalization was higher among older elementary school students, although now the situation has been reversed, with as many as 53.6% (323 patients) of patients aged between 0 and 3 years of age being hospitalized in 1999 and more patients being identified with complications. This reversal could be largely attributable to the fact that whereas strong medications and therapies, such as round the clock therapy with theophylline, disodium cromoglycate inhalation and inhalation of steroids, have become standard treatments for older elementary school children with asthma, these therapies, especially steroid inhalation, may be difficult to use for the treatment of infants and, therefore, pediatricians are hesitant to use these treatment strategies. The elevated incidence rate of asthma and its higher incidence in younger children may also be an underlying cause. In contrast, asthma mortality at our pediatric unit has never increased, on average one patient yearly, and most of these cases were deaths at home or deaths on the way to hospital. With regard to asthma death statistics in Japan, a sudden increase in deaths due to asthma was noted among children aged 10–14 years in the 1960s, whereas no such increase in deaths due to asthma has been noted since the 1970s. This suggests a big step ahead in terms of the treatment and management of children with bronchial asthma. However, the long-term prognosis of severe childhood refractory asthma is not good. In our prognosis study on severe asthma patients who were hospitalized 20 years ago, 27.2% experienced remission and 12.7% died, and residual impaired pulmonary function was noted in many cases. Among the 24 cases of death, we have been notified that 20 cases of sudden death were patients aged between 10 and 29 years of age. The mortality rate in patients aged 15–29 years in Japan increased threefold during the subsequent 10 years from 1980. Although this rate has apparently started to decrease in the past 5 years, compared with the estimated bronchial asthma incidence rate from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) study, the bronchial asthma mortality rate in Japan is definitely higher than in Western countries. These data suggest difficulty in the management of adolescent and young adult patients with severe asthma, who often have a psychological/social/economic handicap. The relatively high asthma mortality rate in Japan may be attributable to: (i) a greater number of patients with severe asthma; (ii) the poor medical supply system; (iii) a lack of asthma education for both physicians and patients; and (iv) problematic treatment regimens. In present paper, the first point is discussed in relation to the ISAAC study, the second point is discussed with regard to the system for outpatients' overnight visits, the third point is discussed with regard to the educational/cooperative system involving school and society, and the fourth point is discussed in terms of treatments with steroids inhalation and β-adrenergic receptor agonsists. In conclusion, the overall control of bronchial asthma can certainly be achieved more easily now, as seen by the reduction in the number of hospitalizations from asthma attacks and the year-round number of patients with severe asthma. However, infant asthma patients do not show this tendency and this requires investigation into treatment regimens involving morbidity analysis and early interventions. In addition, severe childhood refractory asthma presents various current and future problems. In fact, these patients are facing many problems, such as long-term use of multiple medications, disturbances to everyday life, obstacles to higher education/work, an inadequate system of emergency night visits and a lack of understanding in society. Therefore, establishment of a system for true total care with early long-term vision and social consciousness is strongly desired. Asthma mortality is a serious problem that requires the establishment of a large, long-term project in order to investigate the cause of the relatively high mortality rate among asthma patients in Japan and to propose measures against this.",

Twenty-five active alcoholics and 18 healthy controls were included in the study. All subjects were non-atopic (asymptomatic from the allergologic point of view and Phadiatop® (Phamacia & Upjohn Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) negative). Serum IgE was measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay and serum sCD30 was assayed by ELISA. Total serum IgE was higher in alcoholics than in controls (median (range) for alcoholics and controls 59 (15.8-236) vs 24 (4-103) IU/mL, respectively; P = 0.003). Conversely, median serum sCD30 levels were lower in alcoholics than in controls (< 1 (< 1-144) vs 7.3 (< 1-83) U/mL, respectively; P = 0.02). Among the alcoholics, a negative correlation between serum IgE and sCD30 values was observed. Increased serum IgE in non-atopic alcoholics is associated with low serum sCD30 concentrations. In so far as sCD30 is a marker of Th2 activation, total serum IgE elevation in alcoholics does not seem to be related to Th2 dominance.",

Samples of blood and urine were obtained from the same patients when their symptoms were active and when patients were well. The number of eosinophils in peripheral blood was also counted. The median concentrations of EDN in blood and urine and the number of eosinophils in peripheral blood from patients with active symptoms were all significantly higher compared with values obtained when patients were well. Compared with healthy control subjects, EDN concentrations in the serum, plasma and urine from asymptomatic asthmatic patients, as well as EDN concentrations in the serum and plasma from patients with mild atopic dermatitis and asymptomatic patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, were significantly higher. Blood and urine concentrations of EDN in patients with active symptoms, but not urine concentrations of EDN from symptomatic patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, were significantly increased compared with values obtained for healthy control subjects. The concentrations of EDN in the serum and plasma from bronchial asthmatic patients, serum from patients with atopic dermatitis and plasma from patients with mild atopic dermatitis correlated with the number of eosinophils in peripheral blood; however, the concentration of EDN in the serum correlated with the number of eosinophils from asymptomatic patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Determination of blood and urinary concentrations of EDN is useful to monitor eosinophil activity in allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Atopic disorders, such as asthma, eczema and rhinitis, develop due to the interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Atopy is characterized by enhanced IgE responses to environmental antigens. The production of IgE is upregulated by Th2 cytokines, in particular interleukin (IL)-4, and downregulated by Th1 cytokines, in particular interferon (IFN)-γ. In the present review, we present the genetic factors responsible for IgE production and genetic defects in the downregulation (brake) of IgE production, especially in terms of IL-12 and IL-18 signaling, mutations of the IL-12 receptor β2 chain gene and mutations of the IL-18 receptor α chain gene in atopy. Moreover, we newly present a genetic classification of atopy. There are four categories of genes that control the expression of allergic disorders, which include: (i) antigen recognition; (ii) IgE production (downregulation = brake; and upregulation); (iii) the production and release of mediators; and (iv) events on target organs. In the near future, this genetic classification will facilitate the development of tailor-made treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cytokines are important regulatory mediators secreted by T cells and other immunoactive cells. Based on the cytokine synthesis patterns, CD4 T cells can often be classified into at least two populations with different immune regulatory functions. The Th1 cells, producing interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-γ, are often associated with cell-mediated immune responses such as delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), whereas Th2 cells, secreting IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, usually provide B cell help and enhance allergic reactions. Naïve CD8 T cells, similar to CD4 T cells, can differentiate into at least two subsets of cytolytic effector cells with distinct cytokine patterns. The Tc1 cells secrete a Th 1 - like cytokine pattern, including IL-2 and IFN-γ. The Tc2 cells produce Th2 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5 and 11—10. There is increasing evidence that Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 cytokine imbalance has been of patho- genetic importance in various diseases, such as allergic and autoimmune diseases. The present review article focuses on the evidence that the imbalance of Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 cytokines plays an important role in various otolaryngological diseases, such as Kimura's disease, Wegener's granulomatosism, acute perceptive hearing loss and Meniere's disease. It is concluded that the predominance of Th 1 or Th2 and Tc1 or Tc2 cells may contribute to the mechanism in the pathogenesis of these otolaryngological diseases.",

    "abstract": "It is now widely accepted that aspirin, along with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may precipitate asthma attacks in a minority of susceptible individuals. The syndrome is part of a mucosal inflammatory disease that typically affects the nasal, as well as the bronchial, mucosa and sometimes the gut and skin also. Although the mucosal cellular infiltrate in aspirin-sensitive asthma and rhinitis resembles that of asthma and rhinitis in general, there is evidence of increased expression of asthma-relevant cytokines, such as interleukin-5 and granulocyte–macrophage colony stimulating factor, and a more intense infiltrate of mast cells and eosinophils. One key feature of aspirin-sensitive asthma is thought to be the overproduction of cysteinyl leukotrienes, principally by these local mast cells and eosinophils, but whether this represents a fundamental abnormality or is simply a consequence of greater numbers and activation of inflammatory cells is unclear. Genetic polymorphisms of the leukotriene C4 synthase gene, which result in elevated expression of this enzyme, may also play a role. In addition, overexpression of cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, particularly CysLT1, may contribute to an enhanced response of local inflammatory and structural cells to cysteinyl leukotrienes. Aspirin challenge in these patients is accompanied by acute further elevation of the already elevated baseline cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis, a phenomenon that is most closely related to the ability of aspirin and related NSAIDs to inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme COX-1. The reason for this is unknown, although it has been suggested that the COX-1 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) serves as a 'brake' to leukotriene synthesis and that somehow this mechanism is deficient in aspirin-sensitive asthmatics. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of aspirin-sensitive asthma will undoubtedly lead to better approaches to treatment. Aside from the use of drugs that inhibit cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis or block the action of cysteinyl leukotrienes on their receptors, recent data suggest that PGE2, and possibly lipoxin analogs, may also prove effective in the treatment of aspirin-sensitive asthma.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic nucleotides are powerful signaling molecules and their sole means of removal is through the action of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Elevating levels of cAMP is beneficial in many diseases, including neurological conditions, cancers, viral infections and most inflammatory disorders. There are 11 known PDE families, with PDE4 being the most highly expressed. Evidence of the clinical usefulness of PDE4 inhibition has come from the use of specific chemical inhibitors and the generation of knock-out mice models. There exists an extensive range of PDE4 family members, because there are four subfamilies, each encoded by their own gene and each capable of generating multiple isoforms. Several members of the PDE4 family are found to be expressed in every cell and tissue studied and evidence is now being uncovered indicating unique functions for each. Their actions are controlled by their expression patterns, subcellular location and interaction with other signaling pathways. The first generation of PDE4 inhibitors, although potent anti-inflammatory agents, failed as pharmaceuticals owing to their emetic and gastric side-effects. A new generation of chemical inhibitors is now nearing the market, which display greatly reduced side-effects. In the future lies the generation of more specific inhibitors that will focus upon particular diseases. This will be achieved by targeting specific PDE4 family members. Because the current target of chemical inhibition (the catalytic site) is virtually identical between isoforms, this specificity is likely to be achieved by blocking the enzyme's interaction with other signaling cascades.",

Here, we investigated whether CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells mediate the suppressive effects of α-GalCer treatment on EC. To deplete CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells, neonatal mice were thymectomized and intraperitoneally injected with anti-CD25 Ab. At 6 weeks of age, these mice were immunized with ragweed (RW) in aluminum hydroxide. Ten days later, the mice were challenged with RW in eye drops and 24 hours later, the conjunctivas and spleens were harvested for histological and flow cytometric analyses, respectively. α-GalCer or vehicle was injected 2 hours prior to RW challenge. In addition, α-GalCer was injected into thymus-intact EC-developing mice that had not been treated with anti-CD25 Ab. α-GalCer treatment significantly suppressed EC in the thymus-intact mice that had not been treated with anti-CD25 Ab. In contrast, α-GalCer treatment of thymectomized and anti-CD25 Ab-treated mice did not affect the severity of EC or splenic CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T-cell numbers. However, α-GalCer treatment did significantly increase splenic CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T-cell numbers in thymectomized mice that had not received anti-CD25 Ab. α-GalCer treatment during the effector phase of EC increased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T-cell numbers, which in turn suppressed the development of EC.",

    "abstract": "As a non-injection route for immunotherapy, local nasal immunotherapy has been examined in allergic rhinitis patients. However, it is unclear how the immunotherapy affects sneezing, biphasic nasal blockage and nasal hyperresponsiveness. Thus, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of nasal immunotherapy on the symptoms of guinea pig allergic rhinitis. Additionally, we also evaluated whether the immunotherapy relieved pollen-induced allergic conjunctivitis. Sensitized animals were repeatedly challenged by pollen inhalation once every week. After the 7th challenge, the pollen extract was intranasally administered 6 times a week until the 30th challenge. Sneezing frequency was counted after each of the challenges. As an indicator of nasal blockage, changes in specific airway resistance were measured. Nasal hyperresponsiveness was assessed by measuring leukotriene D4-induced nasal blockage. Additionally, during the immunotherapy, we applied pollen onto the ocular surface to induce the allergic conjunctivitis symptoms. At the 11th—30th challenges, the nasal immunotherapy showed inhibition or a tendency to inhibit the biphasic nasal blockage although the inhibitions were variable at respective challenges. The development of nasal hyperresponsiveness was markedly suppressed by the immunotherapy. Nevertheless, neither sneezing nor antigen-specific IgE antibody production was substantially influenced by the immunotherapy. On the other hand, the nasal immunotherapy did not affect the induction of allergic conjunctivitis symptoms. Local nasal immunotherapy may be clinically useful for allergic nasal blockage associated with nasal hyperresponsiveness. The mechanisms responsible for this effectiveness might not be related to IgE production. Additionally, the effectiveness for nasal tissue was dissociated from that seen for the ocular tissue.",

    "abstract": "The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a useful marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthmatics. No studies have examined the relationship between the change in FeNO levels measured offline and changes in bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in asthmatic patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the change in FeNO levels measured offline and the change in BHR to acetylcholine in asthmatic patients taking ICS. The study population comprised 41 ICS-treated asthmatics from our outpatient clinic. We measured FeNO levels by two methods—with a Sievers kit (“FeNOs”) and with a kit from the Center for Environmental Information Science, Japan (“FeNOc”) at baseline and after 1 year of regular treatment. We also used spirometry to test BHR to acetylcholine (PC20Ach). The mean of duration of observation was 406 days. There were significant relationships between ∆logPC20Ach and logPC20Ach (r = − 0.877, P < 0.001), FeNOs (r = 0.465, P = 0.002), and FeNOc (r = 0.524, P = 0.004) at baseline, but not with age, the dose of ICS, FEV1, or %FEV1. Moreover, there was a significant relationship between ∆logPC20Ach and ∆FeNOs (r = − 0.386, P = 0.013) and ∆FeNOc (r = − 0.473, P = 0.004), but not with ∆FEV1. Changes in FeNOs and FeNOc correlated with improvements in BHR to acetylcholine in adult asthmatics after ICS therapy. Our findings suggest that offline monitoring of FeNO will facilitate the management of bronchial asthma in patients treated with ICS.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viral infection is concerned with induction of asthma. CD11c+ pulmonary antigen presenting cells (APCs) play a central role in sensitization with inhaled antigens during the acute phase of influenza A viral infection and also reside on bronchial epithelium for the long term after sensitization. To investigate the role of CD11c+ pulmonary APCs in the inhaled antigen sensitization during the acute phase of influenza A viral infection, we analyzed their function.Mice were infected with influenza A virus and were sensitized intranasally with BSA/alum during the acute phase of influenza A viral infection. Expression of surface antigens on CD11c+ pulmonary APCs was analyzed by FACS. Cytokine production from CD11c+ pulmonary APCs, and interaction between CD11c+ pulmonary APCs and naïve CD4+ T cells was assessed by ELISA. Ability of antigen presentation by CD11c+ pulmonary APCs was measured by proliferation assay.BSA antigen sensitization during the acute phase of influenza A viral infection induced eosinophil recruitment into the lungs after BSA antigen challenge and moderately increased expression of MHC class II molecules on CD11c+ pulmonary APCs. The interaction between the CD11c+ pulmonary APCs and naïve CD4+ T cells secreted large amounts of IL-10.BSA antigen sensitization during the acute phase of influenza A viral infection enhanced IL-10 production from naïve CD4+ T cell interaction with CD11c+ pulmonary APCs. The IL-10 secretion evoked Th2 responses in the lungs with downregulation of Th1 responses and was important for the eosinophil recruitment into the lungs after BSA antigen challenge.",

We investigated the usefulness of the combination of the expiration-to-inspiration sound power ratio in the mid-frequency range (E/I MF) of 200-400 Hz and FeNO for comprehensively classifying disease type and evaluating asthma treatment.A total of 233 patients with bronchial asthma were included. The cutoff values of FeNO and E/I MF were set to 38 ppb and 0.36, respectively, according to a previous study. The patients were divided into 4 subgroups based on the FeNO and E/I MF cutoff values. Respiratory function, the percentages of sputum eosinophils and neutrophils, and patient background characteristics were compared among groups.Respiratory function was well controlled in the FeNO low/E/I MF low group (good control). Sputum neutrophil was higher and FEV1,%pred was lower in the FeNO low/E/I MF high group (poor control). History of childhood asthma and atopic asthma were associated with the FeNO high/E/I MF low group (insufficient control). The FeNO high/E/I MF high group corresponded to a longer disease duration, increased blood or sputum eosinophils, and lower FEV1/FVC (poor control).The combination of FeNO and E/I MF assessed by lung sound analysis allows the condition of airway narrowing and the degree of airway inflammation to be assessed in patients with asthma and is useful for evaluating bronchial asthma treatments.",

To our knowledge, however, the effectiveness of drugs for preventing exacerbations of asthma in the autumn has not been studied previously, except for leukotriene receptor antagonists and Omalizmab. : This study compared the prophylactic effectiveness of suplatast tosilate with that of mequitazine in children with asthma symptoms, which is usually exacerbated in the autumn. The study group comprised 27 children aged 2 to 15 years who required treatment for asthmatic attacks during the past year and tested positive at least for mite allergen in the preceding autumn. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive either suplatast or mequitazine. The primary endpoint of this study was the number of days without symptoms during the 8 weeks of treatment. In addition, the Japanese Pediatric Asthma Control Program (JPAC) scores were also recorded every 2 weeks in each group. : Overall, 14 patients received suplatast, and 13 received mequitazine for 8 weeks from September through early October. During follow-up, the number of days without symptoms and the total JPAC scores did not differ significantly between the groups. However, as compared with weeks 1 to 2 of treatment, the mean number of days without symptoms during weeks 7 to 8 increased significantly in only the suplatast group (8.6 vs. 11.5 days; p = 0.004). : Our results suggest that short-term additional treatment with suplatast is useful for preventing asthma symptoms in children with asthma, which is usually exacerbated in the autumn.",

Among the treatment for Parkinson's disease, the number of patients taking dopamine D2 receptor agonist is on the rise. Ropinirole, a selective dopamine D2 receptor agonist, shows a strong inhibitory effect on the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 1 Although several adverse events of ropinirole are well-known, such as sleep disturbance, a drug eruption due to ropinirole has not been reported in English so far. Herein, we describe here an unusual case of a patient with Parkinson's disease who developed multiple fixed drug eruption after ropinirole treatment. We also reviewed the past literature on drug eruption caused by other dopamine D2 receptor agonists further. A 60-year-old female with Parkinson's disease was referred to our department for evaluation of an eruption of 2 days' duration. An erythematous eruption on the extremities had developed three hours after 7th daily administration of ropinirole for her Parkinson's disease. The erythematous lesions gradually became pigmented.

HAE types I and II result from deficient or dysfunctional C1-esterase inhibitor (C1–INH). This Phase 3 study assessed the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of subcutaneous (SC) C1–INH in Japanese patients with HAE. The prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm Phase 3 study recruited patients with HAE types I or II to an initial run-in period, followed by a 16-week treatment period where patients received 60 IU/kg C1–INH (SC) twice weekly. The two primary endpoints were the time-normalized number of HAE attacks per month and C1–INH functional activity at Week 16. Nine patients entered the treatment period and completed the study. Treatment with C1–INH (SC) significantly reduced the mean monthly attack rate from 3.7 during the run-in period to 0.3 during treatment (exploratory p value of within-patient comparison = 0.004). After the last dose of C1–INH (SC) at Week 16, the mean trough concentration of C1–INH was 59.8%, and the mean area under the plasma concentration–time curve to the end of the dosing period and to the last sample were 5317.1 and 13,091.5 h•%, respectively. During the study, there were no deaths, serious adverse events, or adverse events leading to study discontinuation.

    "abstract": "The considerable prevalence and worse outcomes of asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) in COPD have been reported, and optimal introduction of ICS is essential for ACO. However, diagnostic criteria for ACO consist of multiple laboratory tests, which is challenging during this COVID-19 era. The purpose of this study was to create a simple questionnaire to diagnose ACO in patients with COPD. Among 100 COPD patients, 53 were diagnosed with ACO based on the Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for ACO. Firstly, 10 candidate questionnaire items were generated and further selected by a logistic regression model. An integer-based scoring system was generated based on the scaled estimates of items. Five items, namely a history of asthma, wheezing, dyspnea at rest, nocturnal awakening, and weather- or season-dependent symptoms, contributed significantly to the diagnosis of ACO in COPD. History of asthma was related to FeNO >35 ppb. Two points were assigned to history of asthma and 1 point to other items in the ACO screening questionnaire (ACO-Q), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.883 (95% CI: 0.806–0.933). The best cutoff point was 1 point, and the positive predictive value was 100% at a cutoff of 3 points or higher. The result was reproducible in the validation cohort of 53 patients with COPD. A simple questionnaire, ACO-Q, was developed. Patients with scores ≥3 could be reasonably recommended to be treated as ACO, and additional laboratory testing would be recommended for patients with 1 and 2 points.",

    "abstract": "Meropenem is a widely prescribed beta-lactam for hospitalized patients. There are few data on meropenem allergy assessments in inpatients with a reported history of penicillin allergy who require a treatment with meropenem. This can lead to the use of less effective second-line antibiotics that may increase antibiotic resistances. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of a meropenem allergy assessment in admitted patients with a reported history of penicillin allergy that required meropenem for the treatment of an acute infection.A retrospective analysis was performed on 182 inpatients labelled with a penicillin-allergy who received meropenem after an allergy assessment. The allergy study was performed bedside if meropenem was required urgently. The study included skin prick tests (SPTs) followed by an intradermal skin test (IDT) to meropenem, and a meropenem drug challenge test (DCT). If a non-immediate reaction to a beta-lactam was suspected, it was initiated with patch tests.The median age of the patients was 59.7 years (range 28-95) and 80 (44%) were women. A total of 196 sets of diagnostic workups were performed, with 189 (96.4%) of them being tolerated. Only two patients had a positive meropenem IV DCT, both presenting a non-severe cutaneous reaction that completely resolved after treatment.This study evidenced that a bedside meropenem allergy assessment of hospitalized patients labelled with a 'penicillin allergy' who require a broad-spectrum antibiotic for empiric coverage is a safe and effective procedure, avoiding the use of second-line antimicrobial agents.",

Fifteen component bands with IgE binding abilities were detected. The most frequent IgE binding band was observed on the line of 45 kDa (92%), followed by 50 (88%) and 74 kDa (52%). The immunoblotting profile of Hinoki cypress was different from that of Japanese cedar. In the inhibition immunoblotting test, IgE binding activities of 14, 30–35 and 74–85 kDa components in Japanese cedar extract and 14, 30–35 and 60–74 kDa proteins in Hinoki cypress extract were completely inhibited with heterologous extracts. However, those of the 41 kDa proteins and 46 kDa in Japanese cedar extract and 45 and 50 kDa components in Hinoki cypress extract were partially inhibited. These data suggest that 45 and 50 kDa components of Hinoki cypress and 41 and 46 kDa components of Japanese cedar share some cross-reacting and specific epitopes.",

To treat people with birch pollinosis complicated by apple hypersensitivity by peptide immunotherapy, a sequential IgE epitope analysis was performed to study IgE epitopes that recognize birch pollen and apple allergens at the level of peptides. Subjects in the present study were three patients who exhibited clinical symptoms indicative of birch pollinosis during the pollen season. Two of the three patients had apple hypersensitivity and the capsulated hydrophobic carrier polymer (CAP)- radioallergosorbent test (RAST) class for apple was at least 2. The IgE epitope assay was performed by peptide-CNBr gel binding assay. In two of the three patients, IgE bound strongly to Bet vI 51-70 peptide and also to 11–30, 21–40, 11–120, 111–130 and 141–159 peptides. In the other patient, IgE bound to 11–30, 61–80, 111–130 and 141–159 peptides in a comparable manner. The IgE epitopes of Bet v1 and Mal d1 were found in similar locations. The results of sequential IgE epitope analyses on Bet v1 and Mal d1 revealed epitopes near the proximal regions of these allergens. Thus, the three-dimensional structure of Mal d1 is likely similar to that of Bet v1, which suggests that peptide immunotherapy designed for birch pollen is more than likely to be effective against apple allergy.",

In more severe and chronic disease, corticosteroids become less effective. As in other chronic inflammatory diseases, the tissue in which the cellular and mediator processes occur plays a major role in maintaining the response and creating a basis for disease persistence. Herein, we describe evidence that the airway epithelium interacting with the underlying mesenchymal cells recapitulates branching morphogenesis, as observed in the developing lung, to create airway wall remodeling. The reciprocal signaling between the susceptible epithelium and responsive mesenchyme (epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit) offers a new paradigm for asthma and creates new opportunities for developing therapeutics based on reversing the 'chronic wound' phenotype of asthmatic airways.",

    "abstract": "Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is characterized by chemically induced symptoms from multiple organs. These symptoms occur in response to demonstrable exposure to chemically unrelated compounds at doses far below those known to cause harmful effects in the general population. Although the mechanism of this action remains unclear and no acceptable and well-documented treatment for MCS has yet been established, regarding neurogenic inflammation, it has been hypothesized that an increased density of C-fiber neurons is found in symptomatic tissues. Using capsaicin, we examined the sensitivity of the cough reflex in patients with MCS and chronic cough (CC) and compared the findings with those in control subjects. Fifteen patients (four males, 11 females; mean (± SD) age 38.3 ± 16.3 years) suffering from MCS and 29 patients (10 males, 19 females; mean age 46.4 ± 15.9 years) who had cough symptoms lasting 4 weeks or longer and normal chest radiograph findings (CC) were enrolled in the present study. Twenty-nine healthy subjects (14 males, 15 females; mean age 37.9 ± 9.5 years) who had no history of coughing during the previous 6 months and no chronic respiratory diseases were enrolled as controls. Subjects inhaled stepwise incremental concentrations of capsaicin (0.122-62.5 |imol/L) for 15 s. Inhalation was performed at 45 s intervals and the number of coughs per minute was counted. The provocation was terminated when the subject coughed five or more times. Ventilatory functions (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s and the expiratory flow rate at 50 and 75% FVC (V50 and V25, respectively)) were also measured. No significant differences were observed in ventilatory function test findings between the three groups. The log concentration of capsaicin causing five or more coughs (C5) was 0.150 ± 0.630, 0.611 ± 0.691 and 1.120 ± 0.612 | mol/L in MCS, CC and control subjects, respectively. The log C5 in MCS subjects was significantly lower than that in CC and control subjects. Capsaicin is a cough-inducing agent in humans that possibly acts on non-myelinated C-fiber endings. The findings of the present study indicate that the mechanisms underlying MCS may originate in the sensory nervous system.",

Mouse disease models will not be used any longer where key orthologous genes are working differently than in humans. Analysis of cell type-selective transcripts from database searches is now available to minimize the efforts required for drug discovery. As such, it will soon be possible to use computational modeling to analyze integrative biological function and to test hypotheses without performing any in vivo or in vitro experimentation.

The Stat6 gene polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment length polymorphism analysis and the IL-4 receptor Ile50Val polymorphism was examined using PCR methods. Novel dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms were found in the 5′-flanking sequences, positioning at − 865 (Pro A) and − 690 (Pro B) of the Stat6 gene starting codon. The GT repeats in the 5′-flanking sequences were highly polymorphic (Pro A: 14–29 repeats; ProB: 14–20 repeats) with no significant differences in the frequency of allelic and genotypic distributions observed between allergic subjects and controls. In the GT repeat polymorphism of Stat6 exon 1, there was a significant difference in the frequency of genotypic distribution between the two groups (P = 0.003). The Stat6 exon 1 variant had significant linkage disequilibrium with Pro B variants, but not with Pro A. The GT repeat polymorphism was not associated with the IL-4 receptor Ile50Val polymorphism.

We examined whether AD is related to exercise-induced wheezing (EIW), some proxy for EIA. Japanese version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaires were used. For 12,405 asthmatic school children, AD was defined as itchy rash coming and going for at least 6 months at any time in the last 12 months with affecting places of flexural parts of body, and severity of AD was rated according to frequency of being kept awake at night with the itch as follows: never in the past 12 months, less than one night per week and one or more nights per week. Adjusted for frequency of asthma attack, odds ratios (OR) of children with current AD as compared to those without AD for having EIW were 1.32 (95% confidence interval = 1.15–1.52), 1.35 (1.14–1.68) and 1.10 (0.92–1.31) for primary school, junior high school and high school children, respectively. EIW was more likely observed in accordance with increasing severity of AD in the primary school children with ORs of 1.12, 1.59 and 1.54 (p for trend < 0.01), and in the junior high school ones with ORs of 1.18, 1.31, 2.03 (<0.01), respectively.

    "abstract": "Hospitalization is a major cause of medical expenditure for asthma. Budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) may assist in reducing asthma-related symptoms in severe asthma exacerbation. However, its effectiveness for hospitalized patients remains poorly known. The objective of this study is to determine associations of BIS with asthma hospitalization. We retrospectively analyzed 98 patients who were admitted to our hospital due to severe asthma exacerbation (24 treated with BIS in combination with procaterol) from April 2014 to January 2019. Length of stay, recovery time from symptoms (wheezes), and hospitalization costs were compared between the 2 groups according to clinical factors including the use of BIS and sings of respiratory infections (i.e. C-reactive protein, the presence of phlegm, and the use of antibiotics). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors contributing to hospitalization outcomes. The use of BIS was associated with shorter length of stay, faster recovery time from symptoms, and more reduced hospitalization costs (6.0 vs 8.5 days, 2.5 vs 5.0 days, and 258,260 vs 343,350 JPY). Signs of respiratory infection were also associated with hospitalization outcomes. On a multivariate regression analysis, the use of BIS was a determinant of shortened length of stay and reduced symptoms and medical costs for asthma hospitalization along with signs of respiratory infection. BIS may contribute to shorten length of hospital stay and to reduce symptoms and medical expenditure irrespective of the presence or absence of respiratory infection.",

    "abstract": "Allergic reactions have been observed following both direct centipede bites and the clinical use of centipede-containing medicines, such as traditional Chinese medicines utilizing Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans; however, no natural centipede allergen has yet been characterized. An allergen was purified from S. s. mutilans venom using Superdex 75 gel filtration and RESOURCE S ion chromatography, and its primary structure was determined via a combination of LC-MS-MS, MALDI-TOF/TOF and protein sequencing techniques. Its potential allergenicity was evaluated by immunoblotting, ELISAs, skin prick tests (SPTs) and mast cell activation assays. A novel allergen Sco m 5 (210 amino acids long) was successfully purified from crude S. s. mutilans venom. Sco m 5 could promote the degranulation of a human mast cell line, HMC-1. Among centipede-allergic patients, Sco m 5 showed an 83.3% IgE-binding frequency and a 66.7% positive reaction frequency, as detected by immunoblotting and SPTs, respectively. Sco m 5 IgE-binding frequencies of common Chinese population was found to be 9%–16%. Sera positive for Sco m 5 IgE-binding was cross-reactive against venom from the wasp Vespa mandaeinia. The present study isolated and characterized a novel allergen termed as Sco m 5 from the centipede S. s. mutilans. The use of Sco m 5 to identify centipede-allergic individuals could be important, given the high potential allergenicity of Sco m 5 among the general Chinese population, along with the likely possibility of cross-reactivity against wasp venom among centipede-allergic patients.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic pneumonia comprises a group of lung diseases in which eosinophils appear in increased numbers in the lungs. The distinct etiology of eosinophilic pneumonia is unknown, although the previous case series have indicated a relationship between acute eosinophilic pneumonia and the exposure to exogenous substances including the constituents of cigarettes.A 60-year-old nonsmoking female, who had started to harvest and sort tobacco leaves two months before presentation, was admitted because of persistent coughing, breathlessness, and general malaise. Her laboratory findings revealed eosinophilia. Chest computed tomography showed nonsegmental airspace consolidations bilaterally. A bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis also revealed that the numbers of total cells and eosinophils had increased. Although the urine level of cotinine was within the normal range, positive findings were found in the skin scratch-patch tests using tobacco leaf and its extracts, and a biopsy specimen obtained from the positive site demonstrated infiltration of eosinophils in the dermis. The patient was successfully treated with corticosteroids.Green tobacco sickness, a type of nicotine poisoning caused by the dermal absorption of nicotine, is a well known occupational illness of tobacco harvesters. Although it is unclear whether the present case could be identified as a subtype of green tobacco sickness, this is the first report of eosinophilic pneumonia occurred in a tobacco harvester which was possibly induced by tobacco leaf exposure.",

However, the role of Mgat5 in the induction of allergic airway inflammation remains unclear. To elucidate the role of Mgat5 in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation was induced in Mgat5-deficient mice. The OVA-specific lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production levels, OVA-specific IgG1, IgG2a and IgE levels in the serum, and the number of leukocytes and cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were compared between wild-type and Mgat5-deficient mice. OVA-specific lymphocyte proliferation and production of IFN-y and IL-10, but not IL-4, were increased in Mgat5-deficient mice, suggesting that Th2-type immune responses are seemed to be suppressed by increased IFN-y and IL-10 production in these mice. However, Th2-type responses such as OVA-specific IgG1, but not IgE, and IL-5 levels in BAL fluids were increased in Mgat5-deficient mice. Meanwhile, the number of eosinophils was normal, but the numbers of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes were reduced, in these mutant mice during OVA-induced airway inflammation. Mgat5-dependent glycosylation of proteins can modulate acquired immune responses, but it is not essential for the development of OVA-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation.",

Asthmatic children were divided into three groups: (i) group 1, acute asthma attack (n = 191); (ii) group 2, prolonged asthma attack (n = 68); and (iii) group 3, pneumonia without asthma attack (n = 39). The number of specimens was 212, 75 and 44 for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The number of specimens with pathogenic bacteria present in group 1 decreased with age, from 36.8% in infants under 1 year of age to 8.7% in children over the age of 9 years. The species of bacteria in group 1 were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and these were distributed evenly in the samples. In group 2, pathogenic bacteria were present in 34.7% of patients (26/75), peaking at over 40% among children between 4 and 8 years of age. The presence of H. influenzae was dominant in group 2. The percentage of pathogenic bacteria present in group 3 specimens was 40.9%. The data suggest that there is a significant relationship between the presence of bacteria in sputum and clinical symptoms, such as fever and pneumonic episodes, during acute asthma attacks.",

    "abstract": "Asthma therapy including inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has been shown to be effective in many parts of the world, but its use is still limited in Japan. A 6-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was therefore undertaken to assess the efficacy of the ICS budesonide Turbuhaler (budesonide administered via the dry-powder inhaler Turbuhaler) in patients in Japan with mild-to-moderate asthma. Prior to, and during, the study, all concomitant medications, except corticosteroid preparations, were allowed (i.e. all pre-study medication was to be maintained throughout the study). In total, 218 patients randomized to receive budesonide Turbuhaler 200 μg/day (n = 53), 400 μg/day (n = 55), 800 μg/day (n = 57) or placebo (n = 53) were included in the analysis. Due to the increased demand and interest for health economic data in Japan, this retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis reports on the economic impact of budesonide Turbuhaler compared with placebo (i.e. usual care), based on this clinical trial. At each dosage, budesonide Turbuhaler was significantly more effective than the placebo, according to the number of symptom-free and episode-free days. The number of emergency visits, days of lost production and days of hospitalization were all lower in the budesonide Turbuhaler groups, leading to significantly (P < 0.05) reduced total health-care and productivity costs compared with placebo. These findings were generally stable to sensitivity analysis. However, this reduction in costs will obviously have to be compared with the acquisition cost of budesonide Turbuhaler (which was excluded in the analysis as a price had not been determined) when it becomes available on the market. Budesonide Turbuhaler, while improving the health of patients, could thus have a considerable impact on the costs of treating asthma in Japan, by shifting large hospital care costs towards relatively small out-patient medication costs.",

Only flaxseed gave positive results. In addition, we performed an exercise test on a bicycle ergometer (15 min at 150 W) and an oral challenge test with foods, using a double-blind and placebo-controlled study. Only oral challenge with a teaspoon of flaxseed with additional exercise on the bicycle ergometer elicited itching, urticaria, nausea, coughing and dyspnea. The oral challenge with flaxseed followed by exercise induced immediate-type reactions and, thus, led to the diagnosis of food-dependent exercise- induced anaphylaxis to flaxseed.",

To better understand the IgE reactivity of the group 1 allergen from rye grass pollen, we sought to disrupt potential conformational IgE epitopes on recombinant (r) Lol p 1 by the specific replacement of the seven cysteine residues in the protein sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis on the Lol p 1 coding sequence was used to replace all seven cysteine residues with serine residues. rLol p 1 and the seven cysteine variants generated by this method were tested for comparative human IgE reactivity via western blot immunoscreening and densitometry. Alteration of the cysteine residues at amino acid positions 72, 77, 83 and 139 of rLol p 1 was found to reduce the human IgE binding potential of the molecule. However, the most consistent reduction in human IgE reactivity was demonstrated by replacement of C77; human IgE antibodies showed an average 62.7% reduction in reactivity to this molecule. The present investigation has shown that at least one of the cysteine residues within the Lol p 1 protein contributes to the IgE binding properties of this allergen.",

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of a modified immunotherapy (IT) with an allergen-pullulan conjugate (CS-560) in patients with SAR to Japanese cedar pollen (Japanese cedar pollinosis) using objective parameters, such as analyzing the alteration in the proportion of effector cells like mast cells, eosinophils and T cells, and the Th2 and Th1 cytokine profile. We also analyzed the efficacy of modified IT on the severity of symptoms, using subjective parameters, such as the symptom-medication score. Immunotherapy for 15 months duration with the modified drug CS-560 in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis induced an immune deviation from a Th2-to a Th1-type cytokine profile and inhibited the in-season",

A strong reaction occurs following exposure to a large amount of antigen, whereas no reaction occurs in the absence of antigens. In seasonal allergic rhinitis, nasal hypersensitivity increases during the pollen-dispersing season, which is known as the 'priming effect'. The purpose of the present study was to clarify whether repeated nasal challenges bring about increased nasal hypersensitivity in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. Fourteen patients with perennial allergic rhinitis to house dust mites were enrolled in the present study. Repeated challenge tests were performed once daily for 8 consecutive days with a fixed amount of antigen. Sneezing and nasal secretion were slightly enhanced by repeated challenges only on the 2nd and 3rd days, whereas nasal resistance remained unchanged. Increased sneezing and nasal secretion was marked in a group of subjects who were not sneezing at the first challenge, whereas changes in nasal reaction following repeated challenge were less obvious in subjects who were sneezing at the first challenge. In contrast with pollinosis, nasal provocation reactions were not clearly enhanced by repeated provocation. To further understand nasal reactions induced by antigen challenge, studies should be performed under specified conditions (i.e. in an experimental room) with a prescribed quantity of antigens administered, as well as within a study environment.",

    "abstract": "Multiple cytokines play a critical role in orchestrating and perpetuating inflammation in asthma and several specific cytokine and chemokine inhibitors are now in development as future therapy. Anti-interleukin (IL)-5 antibodies markedly reduce peripheral blood and airway eosinophils, but do not appear to be effective in symptomatic asthma. Inhibition of IL-4, despite promising early results in asthma, has been discontinued and blocking IL-13 may be more effective. Inhibitory cytokines, such as IL-10, interferons and IL-12 are less promising, because systemic delivery produces side-effects. Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α may be useful in severe asthma. Many chemokines are involved in the inflammatory response of asthma and several small molecule inhibitors of chemokine receptors are in development. The CCR3 antagonists (which block eosinophil chemotaxis) are in clinical development for asthma. Because so many cytokines are involved in asthma, drugs that inhibit the synthesis of multiple cytokines may prove to be more useful; several such classes of drug are now in clinical development and any risk of side-effects with these non-specific inhibitors may be reduced by the inhaled route.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism whereby olopatadine hydrochloride, a novel anti-allergic drug, ameliorated the allergic nasal obstruction. The levels of TXB2, P-LT and histamine in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) were measured after intranasal antigen challenge in sensitized guinea pigs. Histamine and TXB2 levels in the NLF increased eight- and threefold, respectively, 10 min after antigen challenge, whereas the P-LT level was under the detection limit. Oral administration of olopatadine at 0.1, 1 and 3 mg/kg significantly inhibited the increases in TXB2 and histamine levels. At 3 mg/kg, olopatadine also ameliorated the nasal obstruction caused 10 min after antigen challenge, as determined by acoustic rhinometry. These results suggest that the amelioration by olopatadine of the allergic nasal obstruction involves the inhibition of the release of TXA2 and histamine.",

A 9-year-old boy was referred to our hospital because of fever and a cutaneous eruption. Full blood examination showed a normal hemoglobin level and leukocytosis of 66 400 /μL with 95% mature eosinophils. There was no history of allergy, no clinical or serological evidence of a parasitic infection and no evidence of a connective tissue disease, neoplastic disease, leukemia or immunodeficiency. The patient was treated with prednisolone, which induced a rapid but not sustained remission. Cepharanthin was then given to reduce the dose of the intermittent courses of prednisolone required. Azelastine HCl, prescribed by an otolaryngologist for perennial rhinitis when the patient was also receiving CEPH, unexpectedly reduced and maintained the eosinophil count at normal levels. Ultimately, AZE alone was tried and was ceased after 3.5 months; however, 5 weeks after discontinuation of AZE therapy, the eosinophil count had risen again to > 25 000 /μL. After reinstitution of AZE with CEPH followed by AZE alone, the patient did well for 30 months, so the AZE was ceased. Eleven months later the eosinophil count again increased. Reinstitution of AZE with CEPH in doses proportional to the weight increase that had occurred in the interim resulted in a complete resolution of symtoms. Azelastine HCl with or without CEPH may be effective in HES patients, enabling the adverse effects of long-lasting steroid therapy to be minimized.",

Among the numerous methods to prevent the activation through FcεRI, three versions are described in this article. The first and second ideas involve inhibition of binding between FcεRI and IgE with a soluble form of the FceRI α chain and a humanized antibody directed against the a chain, respectively. Both of these paths involve suppression the histamine release from human peripheral blood basophils in vitro. They also inhibited the allergic reaction in vivo. The soluble α inhibited the anaphylactic reaction in rodents and the Fab fragments of the humanized anti-FcεRI α chain antibody suppressed the dermal response in rhesus monkeys. The third idea involves repression of FcεRI expression by suppressing the transcription of the genes encoding the subunits of FceRI. Although no plausible candidate molecule for actualizing this idea can be identified at present, further analyses of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in the human FcεRI α and β chain genes will lead to the discovery of novel targets for developing anti-allergic agents.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances and introduction of new and effective anti-asthma therapies, including inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers, the mortality and morbidity of asthma is still a worldwide concern. Moreover, asthma is a complex disease (more likely a syndrome) in terms of varied pathogenesis and a marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity. To overcome the clinical limitations in investigating and unraveling this complexity, animal models have been utilized. In many ways, these models have contributed to the clarification of some of the pathogenesis and identified new therapeutic targets for drug development. We have characterized a number of such mouse models of allergic airway inflammation and altered airway function, defining the role of various cells and factors such as mast cells, interleukin (IL)-13 and CD8 + T cells in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and allergic airway inflammation. In these models we demonstrated that mast cells play a role in the development of AHR through stimulation of immunoglobulin receptors (FcRs). Histamine, a potent chemical mediator secreted by mast cells, was shown to contribute to the development of AHR and airway allergic inflammation. In addition, IL-13 was shown to play a critical role in these allergic responses in the lung. To date, CD8 + T cells have not been recognized as much as CD4 + T cells in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders. However, we have recently shown that CD8 + T cells, particularly allergen-primed CD8 + T cells, were potent inducers of IL-13, AHR and allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, a subset of CD8 + T cells (T effector ; Teff) was shown to be important in the development of AHR, allergic inflammation and IL-13. Although further investigations are necessary to fully understand the complex interactions between these inflammatory cells, mediators, cytokines and chemokines, these findings provide new insights into the initiation and persistence of asthma and hopefully will lead to new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of asthma.",

To evaluate a role in subepithelial fibrosis in the asthmatic airway, we investigated CTGF mRNA expression and CTGF producing cells in the airways of a murine asthma model with allergic inflammation. After repetitive inhalation challenges with ovalbumin (OVA), cell numbers and TGF-β1 concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from immunized mice were measured. Collagen deposition in lung tissue was estimated by measuring hydroxyproline content. CTGF mRNA and GAPDH mRNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR method. Immunohistochemistry for CTGF with anti-CTGF antibody was performed. Numbers of eosinophils and TGF-β1 concentration increased markedly in BALF on the 7th day and 14th day after inhalation challenge with OVA. Hydroxyproline content in lung tissue increased significantly on the 14th day after inhalation challenge of OVA compared to control. The ratio of CTGF mRNA /GAPDH mRNA in lung tissue in mice exposed to OVA increased 10-fold compared to those exposed to saline. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the number of CTGF-positive cells increased in bronchial submucosa after inhalation challenge of OVA. Our results suggested that CTGF might be one of the potential molecules involved in subepithelial fibrosis in murine airways with allergic inflammation.",

It is conceivably beneficial to use inbred mice as experimental models to explore whether the effect of probiotics on limiting allergy is under the influence of genetic factors. In this review, firstly, we summarized recent publications regarding the effects of lysed Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 (LFK), which is a preparation of a probiotic lactic acid bacterium strain, on suppressing allergic responses in BALB/c mice. And then, we presented our latest data focused on the effects of LFK on suppressing active cutaneous anaphylaxis and local accumulation of eosinophils in four inbred mouse models by using the BALB/c, C57BL/ 6, C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ strains.

The lysate was observed to migrate in the strip and was washed away by the substrate buffer. When the sample contained the specific IgE, the antigen-specific IgE line was clearly observed on the strip macroscopically. Results were obtained 20 minutes after the application of hemolysed blood sample to immunochromatography, and these results showed positive correlation with those obtained by the AlaSTAT system, which is one of the popular assay kits for specific IgE. The results were not affected significantly by the hematocrit value of the blood sample, by the kind of anticoagulant in the blood collection tube, or by the concentration of the total IgE, provided it was lower than 20000 IU/ml. These results indicate that our system is applicable for point-of-care testing for antigen-specific IgE.",

However, the limitations of such therapy are also well known. Although the anti-inflammatory effects of ICS are initially dose dependent, a plateau of response is reached at medium doses and a further increase of the dose is not associated with any significant additional therapeutic benefit. In contrast, it has been reported that a proportion of patients with severe asthma may benefit from prolonged treatment with higher doses of ICS in terms of a reduction in the frequency of severe acute exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids also exhibit a dose–response relationship for systemic adverse effects, which are most pronounced in patients receiving high doses of ICS. Thus, the long-term systemic burden of steroids should be minimized by always attempting to reduce the dose of ICS to the minimum required to maintain acceptable control of asthma symptoms and instituting, where required, add-on therapy with other controller agents, such as inhaled long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists.",

Suplatast tosilate ameliorates asthma symptoms and airway hypersensitivity by inhibiting production of the Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5. In the present study, a comparative examination of the therapeutic effects of suplatast tosilate was carried out in patients with mild intermittent and mild persistent asthma by randomly allocating 35 adult patients to a suplatast tosilate group (n = 18 ; 100 mg suplatast tosilate three times daily) and a beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) group (n = 17; 200 μg BDP twice daily) for 6 weeks of treatment. The suplatast tosilate group required more time than the BDP group to show improvement in peak expiratory flow, but at week 6 the change from baseline was nearly the same in both groups. A significant improvement was observed for both groups in the peripheral blood eosinophil ratio, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels, induced sputum ECP levels, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and airway hypersensitivity, but induced sputum ECP level was lower in the BDP group than in the suplatast tosilate group. Total IgE levels decreased in the suplatast tosilate group only. We conclude that suplatast tosilate may be useful inlong-term management of mild bronchial asthma.",

Recently, ultraviolet A-1 (UVA1, 340-400 nm) therapy and narrow-band UVB (311 nm) therapy have been developed and applied to treatment of refractory skin diseases. In Europe, narrow-band UVB therapy is already used more often than psoralens plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy for atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and several other skin diseases. Another newly developed device that has improved and expanded the spectrum of skin diseases amenable to phototherapy is UVA1. With this modality, doses of UVA1 (340 to 400 nm) up to 130 J/cm2 are delivered to diseased skin. UVA1 was first used to treat patients with atopic dermatitis, but it has since been found to be efficacious in several other skin diseases, such as localized scleroderma, where other therapeutic options are limited. These two newly developed phototherapies demonstrate that the introduction of new spectra into dermatologic phototherapy has broadened and improved phototherapy as it relates to established indications such as atopic dermatitis.",

Ingestion of causative antigens leads to the development of local symptoms such as numbness of the oral mucosa in most cases and anaphylaxis in a few cases.

Thus, we conducted a questionnaire survey of Japanese university students.We conducted a cross-sectional study of 2688 first-year students using a questionnaire survey in marksheet format and examined the epidemiological characteristics of OAS.Only 2.7% of students were aware of the term \"oral allergy syndrome\". A total of 143 (5.3%) students had OAS. There were significant associations between OAS and other allergic diseases including allergic rhinitis (AR) (OR: 3.8, 95% CI: 2.7-5.5), atopic dermatitis (AD) (OR: 4.6, 95%CI: 3.3-6.6), and bronchial asthma (BA) (OR: 3.0, 95%CI: 2.0-4.5). The onset age of OAS showed bimodal peaks at 0 and 10 years, and the latter peak coincided with the peak onset age of AR.Awareness of OAS was low in our study, which will make it difficult to treat properly and prevent its development. This survey confirmed the association between OAS and other allergic diseases, especially AR, which suggests that OAS is involved in the allergic march. A novel finding was that sensitization to antigens for OAS occurred around the same time as sensitization to antigens for AR. These results will help medical professionals diagnose OAS and develop lifestyle guidelines to prevent OAS-related symptoms such as anaphylaxis.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of mental health problems developed during the COVID-19 pandemic on the course of mastocytosis.Mental health status in 60 adult patients with mastocytosis was prospectively evaluated with the total Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (tDASS-21) and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in the lockdown period (LP) and the return to normal period (RTNP) during the pandemic. The disease course was assessed from emergency and outpatient medical reports, including Scoring Mastocytosis (SCORMA) index and serum baseline tryptase levels, by telephone interviews and clinical visits.The mean FCV-19S and median tDASS-21 scores were significantly higher in LP than RTNP (p < 0.001) and there was a positive correlation between FCV-19S and tDASS-21 in LP (r = 0.820, p < 0.001) and in RTNP (r = 0.572 p= <0.001). Disease-related symptoms including skin lesions, flushing and anaphylaxis attacks increased in 22 patients in LP, and in this group, mean FCV-19S and median tDASS-21 were higher than those without symptom exacerbation (p < 0.001). During the study period, four (6.7%) patients who experienced COVID-19 recovered without any requirement for hospitalization and had not experienced symptom exacerbation.Fear of COVID-19 can be a reason for mental health changes, including depression, anxiety and stress which may further increase mast cell-related symptoms. Therefore, psychological support is important to control the severity of mast cell-related symptoms in mastocytosis during a pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is caused by allergic reaction to allergens such as pollen. Galanin (GAL), a neuropeptide that regulates inflammatory processes, is widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although neuropeptides are implicated in arthritis and chemically induced ileitis, their roles in AR remain unclear.We developed a murine model of AR and generated control, systemic sensitization, mild AR, and severe AR groups. We examined GAL and GAL receptor (GALR) mRNA and protein levels and localization patterns in each group using reverse transcription PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical analyses. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of M871, a GALR2 antagonist, on mice with severe AR.Gal and Galr2 are expressed in nasal mucosa and brain (control) samples from control and AR mice. GAL and GALR2 were expressed at similar levels and localized to ciliated epithelial and submucosal gland cells of the nasal mucosa in all four groups. Intranasal M871 administration significantly reduced the incidence of nose rubbing behaviors and sneezing (p < 0.001 in 30 min, respectively) in severe AR mice relative to that in controls. Mechanistically, we postulate that GALR2 is expressed in B cells, and M871 administration reduces IgE production, as well as the number of B cells in tissues.GAL signaling may not change progressively with increasing nasal sensitization, suggesting that this signaling process exacerbates, rather than directly trigger, AR. GAL-GALR2 signaling likely mediates AR development, suggesting that its inhibition represents a novel therapeutic strategy for AR.",

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is also a common condition and contributes to various diseases by causing chronic inflammation. Recent studies have suggested an association between CSU and SDB.To determine the association between the severity of SDB and that of CSU, we studied consecutive patients with CSU who visited the Sagamihara National Hospital allergy department or dermatology department between April 1 and October 31, 2018. The severity of CSU and SDB was evaluated based on the urticaria activity score 7 (UAS7) and peripheral arterial tone apnea-hypopnea index (pAHI) derived from out-of-center sleep testing (OCST) findings, respectively; their correlation was examined.Of the 37 patients studied, 19 had symptom-free-to-mild CSU (UAS7 ≤15) and 18 had moderate-to-severe CSU (UAS7 ≥16). The pAHI in the latter group was significantly higher than that in the former group (18 vs. 4.2, p = 0.001). In multivariate logistic analysis, moderate-to-severe SDB (pAHI ≥15) was significantly associated with moderate-to-severe CSU even after adjusting for the BMI (adjusted odds ratio 22 [95% confidence interval, 1.7-285]).The severity of SDB is correlated with that of CSU independently of the BMI. Physicians should consider comorbid SDB when treating patients with CSU.",

In addition, the genotypes of the C-509 T polymorphism were investigated in allergic and non-allergic subjects. Sixty-four neonates who met the following criteria were enrolled in this cohort study: 1) full-term vaginally delivery; 2) underwent DNA polymorphism analysis; and 3) questionnaire forms were filled out by parents at 0, 6 and 14 months of age. The umbilical cord blood at 0 months and peripheral blood at 6, and 14 months were collected. Plasma TGFβ1 levels were measured at 0, 6 and 14 months of age. Genomic DNA was extracted from their umbilical cord blood. The genotype of the subjects was examined for the presence of C- 509 T. The plasma TGFβ1 level at 6 months was the highest of the 3 measurements (at 0, 6, and 14 months of age). The TGFβ1 levels at 14 months in allergic subjects were significantly higher than those in non-allergic subjects (p = 0.03). All subjects with bronchial asthma (n = 3) had the TT genotype of the C-509 T polymorphism. The plasma TGFβ1 levels change with age. In addition, TGFβ1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma.",

Therefore, we evaluated the characteristics of patients with asthma who required tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in our hospital. We evaluated 20 patients who had severely exacerbated asthma, requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. An evaluation was made based on their smoking history, the number of days from the onset of the asthma attack to admission, the level of asthma control, treatments before presenting to our hospital, the frequency of hospital visits, the reason for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, and outcome. Results: Of the 20 patients with asthma 13 were men and 7 women, with a mean age of 48.7 years. The characteristics of patients who required tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were as follows: ➀ smokers, ➁ not taking or irregularly taking medication, ➂ using inhaled short-acting 02agonist (SABA) alone as needed, and ➃ not using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Our findings suggest that treatment mainly using ICS, in addition to increased awareness of the dangers of asthma among the patients themselves, are important in preventing severe asthma attacks requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.",

    "abstract": "We have recently found that exposure to acute restraint stress suppresses antigen-specific antibody production, including IgE, in a murine model of allergic rhinitis. Although age-related alterations in immune responses are known, it remains unclear whether aging modulates the antibody production under stressful conditions. In this study, we set out to determine the effects of aging on antibody production under acute restraint stress in mice. Both young and aged CBA/J mice were repeatedly sensitized intranasally with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) without adjuvants. Restraint stress was applied using uniform cylinders once a week for a continuous 8 h period, on 5 occasions in total. Blood samples were taken at 0, 20 and 30 days after primary sensitization, and production of PLA2-specific antibodies and levels of IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-10 and IL-1β in sera were determined by ELISA. Repeated intranasal sensitization with PLA2 induced PLA2-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a production in aged mice. We found that exposure to restraint stress significantly inhibited production of PLA2-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a in aged mice. In addition, antibody production under restraint stress decreased significantly in aged mice when compared with young mice. No IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-10 or IL-1β were detected in sera from non-stressed or stressed aged mice. Aging exacerbates the immunosuppressive role of acute restraint stress in antigen-specific antibody production in mice.",

    "abstract": "In Japan, the number of asthma deaths has been gradually decreasing. However, in the management of asthma, there are still some problems originating from patient-related factors and iatrogenic factors, both of which should be further analyzed. We investigated clinical and background characteristics of 164 patients with asthma who were admitted to our hospital with acute exacerbations, by reviewing their clinical records. Fifty-two patients had received long-term management (LTM) based on the guidelines (the LTM group), while 112 had not (the non-LTM group). In patients whose asthma severity had been intermittent (step 1), the proportion of severe and near fatal exacerbations was significantly higher in the non-LTM group than in the LTM group. However, even in the LTM-group, 23% of mild persistent (step 2) and 38% of moderately and severely persistent (step 3 & 4) patients had severe or near fatal exacerbations. In these patients, the peak expiratory flow rate significantly improved after discharge, and poor adherence was also significantly higher in the non-LTM group than in the LTM group. A multivariate analysis revealed that the factors associated with poor adherence were: 1) no history of previous admission due to asthma exacerbation; 2) the patient was male; and 3) the patient was young (< 60 years). In the LTM group, re-evaluation of the actual severity of asthma and prompt treatment corresponding to the severity of disease should still be encouraged. In the non-LTM group, establishing countermeasures against factors causing poor adherence would be the next step in ensuring strong adherence with LTM.",

Mast cells are known to play a central role in the immediate phase reaction of allergic diseases through the IgE-mediated release of a variety of chemical mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes and prostaglandins. In contrast, T lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils are thought to be responsible for inducing the late phase response. However, whether the mast cell can be simplistically assigned a role in the immediate phase allergic response and whether mast cells are necessary for the ongoing allergic response, including the development of hyperresponsiveness, remains to be completely studied. In the present article, the author will discuss the integrated roles of mast cells in IgE-mediated allergic inflammation, with specific emphasis on the roles of mast cell-derived cytokines in the late phase allergic response and chronic allergic inflammation.",

High anti-OVA IgE production was elicited after sensitization. We confirmed the anaphylactic response in the gut after oral challenge by evaluation of the edema of villi and marked eosinophil infiltration in the lamina propria. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the presence of IL-4-, IL-5- and IL-6-producing cells (PC) and a lack of IFN-γ-PC in Peyer's patch. The kinetics of IL-5-PC and eosinophil infiltration showed a good synchronization. The predominance of the type 2 helper T cell (Th2) cytokine may lead to the anaphylactic response and marked eosinophil infiltration in the gut in our system. It is possible that our system mimics the immunological events that occur in the gut in food allergy.",

    "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) has been reported as a cause of chronic cough (CC) in the United States. It has been reported that 5–21% of CC cases are induced by GER. In Japan, however, detailed clinical features of CC induced by GER have not been described. The present study reports on six Japanese patients with GER-induced CC. The subjects were all females, with a mean age of 72 years. The average body mass index was 37 kg/m2, indicating obesity. No abnormalities were found with regard to concentrations of C-reactive protein, peripheral eosinophil counts, serum IgE concentrations, serum titers of cold agglutinins or antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chest radiograph findings, respiratory function tests or blood gas analyses. Bronchial biopsy was performed in three patients and showed chronic inflammation characterized by lymphocytic infiltration, squamous metaplasia and mucosal basement membrane thickening. In the study population (Japanese patients), GER-induced CC tended to occur in elderly obese women and may be attributable to airway inflammation.",

    "abstract": "In a 1993 survey, allergic rhinitis was identified as the most common allergic disease in Hong Kong, affecting 29.1% of schoolchildren. Recently (1995), the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) also reported 44.5% current rhinitis among Hong Kong teenagers. Our objective was to study the aetiology of allergic rhinitis in Hong Kong using serological tests of allergen sensitization. In 57 allergic rhinitis patients and in the same number of age- and sex-matched controls the following were measured: serum total IgE, mixed aeroallergen IgE (Phadiatop™) and specific IgE versus house dust mite (HDM), cockroach, cat and dog dander, mould mixture (Penicillium, Cladosporium, Aspergillus and Alternaria species) and four local pollens (Bermuda grass, Timothy, ragweed and mugwort). Compared with controls, allergic rhinitis patients (26 males, 31 females; mean (± SD) age 25 ± 11 years) had a significantly elevated serum total IgE concentration (mean ± SEM: 496 ± 88 vs 179 ± 38 kU/L) and an increased proportion of positive Phadiatop (95 vs 33%) and specific IgE tests versus HDM (90 vs 44%) and cockroach (42 vs 9%; Mann-Whitney U-test and χ2 tests all P < 0.005). There was no significant difference in sensitization to other allergens tested. House dust mite and cockroach are ubiquitous in Hong Kong with a warm, humid climate and crowded living conditions. Their identification as aetiological agents of allergic rhinitis should help in the development of environmental strategies for reducing the inhalant allergen load to prevent and control this prevalent and costly health problem in our community.",

In this study, we investigated the incidence of food allergy and other allergic disorders in Japanese patients with IBD. In addition, levels of serum IgE and IgG4 antibodies specific to various food antigens were measured. Twenty-six patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 32 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) were studied. Two sex- and age-matched controls were selected for each patient. The incidence of food allergy (29.2%), drug allergy (28.0%), and atopic dermatitis (28.0%) in patients with CD was significantly higher than in their matched controls (P < 0.05); however, no significant association was observed in UC patients. Levels of serum IgE specific to food allergens were similar among the groups, but the levels of IgG4 antibody specific to soybean, were significantly higher in patients with CD than in UC patients or controls. Our observations suggest that allergic disorders or dysregulation of immune responses to certain intestinal antigens can be found in CD patients in Japan in association with their disease.",

In all patients, changes (increase then decrease) in specific IgE levels were detected after natural pollen exposure. Total IgE and specific IgG concentrations also changed. However, the degree of change in specific IgE was greater than those in total IgE and specific IgG. Then, the geometric means of specific and total IgE levels were compared among the five regions. These levels were found to be highest in the region where the pollen count was the highest. These findings suggest that IgE antibody production is more stimulated after natural pollen exposure compared to IgG antibody production, and is dependent on the amount of allergens.",

As the level of soluble CD14 (sCD14) in serum is considered a marker of monocyte/macrophage activation, we measured the levels of sCD14 in allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD), along with acute infectious and inflammatory diseases, to see its clinical relevance. Serum samples were taken from patients with acute infectious and inflammatory diseases, allergic asthma, and atopic dermatitis. sCD14 was measured with our own ELISA system and its level in each disease was compared with normal controls as well as its disease severity. sCD14 was elevated and correlated with C-reactive protein in infectious and inflammatory diseases (n = 26), confirming that it reflects inflammation. sCD14 was also significantly increased both in asthma (n = 94) and adult chronic AD (n = 22). In asthmatic patients, those with higher sCD14 tended to have more severe symptoms, but there was no statistical correlation between sCD14 and severity. In adult chronic AD patients, a correlation between sCD14 and disease severity was observed. However, sCD14 was not elevated in infant AD patients (n = 18) irrespective of severity, suggesting differences in the degree of monocyte/macrophage involvement in the pathogenesis between adult chronic and infant AD. The levels of sCD14 were shown to be upregulated in allergic diseases and might be useful as a marker of monocyte/macrophage involvement in allergic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Theophylline has been used in the treatment of airway diseases, for more than 50 years with benefit thought to be derived from its ability to elicit bronchodilatation. Recent evidence has, however, suggested that theophylline possesses anti-inflammatory activity. The molecular mechanism of action remains unclear, although inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme, an enzyme which catalyzes the breakdown of cAMP and cGMP, has been proposed. Theophylline is a relatively weak inhibitor of PDE although there is evidence to suggest that PDE activity is elevated in leukocytes from patients with atopic disease. Thus, an altered responsiveness to PDE inhibitors may partly explain the mechanism of action of theophylline. The PDE enzyme exists as the least of seven different isoenzyme forms which can be characterized on the basis of a number of criteria including substrate specificity, sensitivity to selective inhibitors and the effect of allosteric modulators. The type IV isoenzyme is the predominant isoenzyme in inflammatory cells although it exists together with the type III isoenzyme in T-lymphocytes. There is considerable evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies suggesting that selective PDE IV inhibitors have antiinflammatory activity. The following article reviews these studies, together with clinical studies demonstrating that theophylline has anti-inflammatory activity.",

    "abstract": "The T-cell hypothesis of asthma, particularly chronic asthma, is based around the concept that the disease is 'driven' and maintained by the persistence of a specialized subset of chronically activated T-memory cells, sensitized against an array of allergenic, occupational or viral antigens that 'home' to the lung after appropriate antigen exposure or viral infection. Allergens induce a CD4 T-helper (Th) cell response, whereas viruses recognize CD8+ cytotoxic (Tc) cells. In the asthmatic airways there appears to be both CD4+ and CD8+ cells with a type 2 cytokine phenotype (i.e. Th2-and Tc2-types). These cells produce interleukin (IL)-5, IL-3 and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor, which recruit, mobilize and activate eosinophils for subsequent mucosal tissue damage, and IL-4, an essential co-factor for local or generalized immunoglobulin (Ig) E production. This in turn leads to 'eosinophilic desquamative bronchitis' with epithelial shedding, mucus hypersecretion and bronchial smooth muscle contraction. Thus, although the eosinophil is believed to produce airway damage, function appears to be under T cell control. Support for this hypothesis includes the observations that activated T cells and their products can be identified in biopsies from the major variants of the disease (atopic, nonatopic ('intrinsic') and occupational asthma), the colocalization of mRNA for type 2 cytokines to CD4+ and CD8+ cells in atopic and non-atopic asthma, the presence of chronically activated cytokine-producing T cells in corticosteroid-resistant asthma, the association of disease severity with type 2 cytokines, particularly IL-5, and the efficacy of cyclosporine A in chronic steroid-dependent disease. Inhibitors and/or antagonists directed against more precise t cell-associated molecular targets hold promise for the future treatment of chronic asthma.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory mechanisms of β-adrenergic receptor agonists for human mast cell histamine release using human cultured mast cells. Human mast cells were obtained by culturing umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells in the presence of stem cell factor and interleukin-6. Cultured mast cells were sensitized with human myeloma IgE and stimulated with antihuman IgE. Stimulation of mast cells induced the elevation of intracellular cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytosol to the cell membrane, followed by the release of stored histamine. Isoproterenol, salbutamol and dibutyryl cAMP inhibited both the histamine release and PKC translocation, whereas they failed to affect the elevation of [Ca2+]i. H-89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, abrogated the inhibition. The present results suggest that PKA activation induced by β-adrenergic receptor agonists plays a crucial role in inhibiting IgE-mediated histamine release from human cultured mast cells through suppressing PKC translocation.",

Almost all birch pollen antigens were found during the birch pollen season and recognizable amounts of birch pollen antigens were not detectable after the birch pollen season. Most of the birch pollen antigens collected on 5 μm pore filters originated from birch pollen grains.

    "abstract": "Recently, in the field of asthma, there has been a substantial number of clinical trials which include health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as one of the outcomes. These studies employ two types of instruments for assessing HRQoL, generic and disease-specific instruments each being used individually or in combination. It has been proposed that treatments for patients aimed at increasing longevity, prevention of future morbidity, or making patients feel better. To achieve the last purpose, it is considered that HRQoL should be evaluated. Moreover, there are several reports demonstrating only weak to moderate correlations between physiological variables and HRQoL in patients with asthma. This is another reason for the importance of direct evaluation of HRQoL in conjunction with the conventional clinical indices. Pharmacological interventions based on guidelines seem to improve not only pulmonary function but also HRQoL in patients with asthma. However, all managements do not necessarily improve HRQoL, therefore assessing HRQoL is strongly recommended in clinical trials. However, the benefit of including HRQoL in evaluation of patients management is still unknown. It is valid that evaluation of HRQoL in clinical practice can both reveal patients problems that were not spontaneously identified by patients themselves and allow physicians focus on specific problems. Until such data are available, the benefit of assessing HRQoL in clinical practice will remain uncertain. Although conducting more clinical trials that prove efficacy in clinical practice is required, consideration of HRQoL in patients has recently been recognized as an important topic in the asthma field. It can be said that outcomes in health care for asthma will shift from the physiological aspect to humanistic aspect.",

In our study, predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (% FEV1 correlated with the vascularity in the inner layers of large airways but not for small airways. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans of 0.5 mm collimation during acute mild exacerbations revealed mucus plugging, air-space nodules and ground-glass opacities. Mean lung density on CT in acute exacerbations was significantly increased compared with that in remission. These results suggest that the involvement of the small airways and lung parenchyma would be increased during exacerbations. Pathologically, eosinophils were significantly reduced by treatment with chlorofluorocarbon- beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) in the large airways, but not in the small airways. New fine-particle inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), such as hydrofluoroalkane- BDP, can reach the small airways and lung parenchyma in asthmatic patients.

We had previously replaced all working environment latex gloves and latex products with low-allergen or non-latex products. The purpose of the investigation was to evaluate the benefits of the latex allergy countermeasures that were taken in our hospital, and the effects of life guidance education. We investigated 16 latex-allergic HCWs in our hospital. We gave them a detailed questionnaire and tested them by a skin prick test (SPT) with latex extract and specific IgE antibodies against latex using the Pharmacia CAP RAST system, RAST FEIA. We compared these results with earlier results from the time of diagnosis. According to the questionnaire, none of the HCWs had changed their work habits, though all were avoiding the use of latex products as much as possible. Of the 16 patients, 81.2% were eating foods for which cross reactivity with latex has been reported. However, the foods had not induced severe allergic symptoms. In the SPT, 62.5% of scores decreased and 81.2% of patients had decreases in specific IgE antibody levels. After avoiding latex products and following our educational suggestions, the patients' allergy symptoms had generally improved. This indicates that our countermeasures against latex allergy were largely successful.",

It was first described in 1979 in a patient who showed anaphylaxis after shellfish ingestion and exercise.1 Here, we would like to add grapefruit as an instigating food of FDEIA. A 17-year-old female high school student experienced anaphylactic symptoms, which were composed of dyspnea , hives , and Quincke’s edema during physical exercise (sprint training) after lunch. She had eaten lettuce, cabbage, egg, fish cake of cod, rice, cucumber, chicken, ume apricot, and grapefruit for lunch. She had a history of atopic dermatitis and egg allergy during childhood. Her father had solar dermatitis and her mother had cedar-pollinosis. On admission, three months after the initial anaphylaxis, no significant findings were found in the physical examination. She did not have eosinophilia , but had high titers of serum IgE (1539 U ml ). Skin tests revealed positive reactions to cabbage, cod, and grapefruit, but negative reactions to almond, peanut and wheat. Open-labeled oral challenge tests, which were performed using 60 g wet weight of cabbage, cod, or grapefruit, failed to induce any allergic reactions. Ingestion of these foods, followed by exercise (100 kcal on a stationary bicycle), also did not induce any reactions . We administered 500 mg aspirin per os, followed by both food ingestion and exercise . 2,3 Only grapefruit induced anaphylactic reactions such as dyspnea, angioedema of the eyelids , and hypotension, especially in diastolic blood pressure.

    "abstract": "Not only monotherapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) but also the concurrent use of other antiasthmatic agents, including leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), play an important role in the management of asthma. However, few studies have focused on compliance with these drugs and on the relation between drug compliance and drug usage. Data were derived from a survey of pharmacists dispensing antiasthmatic drugs to adults with asthma who visited participating pharmacies from October through November 2002. The patients were limited to regular users of ICS whose medication had not been changed for at least 6 months before the survey. Drug compliance and the daily administration frequency of antiasthmatic agents were evaluated on the basis of pharmaceutical records. Completed data were received for 322 patients. ICS compliance was lower than compliance with oral sustained-released theophylline (OSRT) and compliance with LTRA. ICS compliance significantly correlated with OSRT compliance and with LTRA compliance. There were no significant differences of ICS compliance among ICS alone, ICS + LTRA, ICS + OSRT and ICS + LTRA + OSRT group, while the daily inhalation frequency in ICS + OSRT or ICS + OSRT + LTRA group were higher than those in ICS alone group. Although there was a significant negative correlation between ICS compliance and daily inhalation frequency, neither OSRT compliance nor LTRA compliance significantly correlated with the tablet or capsule numbers per day. These findings indicate that OSRT may increase the compliance of concomitant ICS, and that the compliance of OSRT or LTRA is independent of the numbers of tablets taken per day. These unique characteristics should be considered in the treatment and guidance of patients with bronchial asthma.",

We investigate the therapeutic effects of a meter-dose inhaler of chrolofluorocarbon-beclomethasone dipropionate (CFC-BDP) and dry-powder fluticasone (DP-FP).Lung specimens obtained at operation due for small size lung cancer in 16 asthmatic patients and 16 controls were evaluated immunohistochemically using antibodies of EG2 (eosinophil), AA1 (mast cell), CD68 (macrophage), and CD34 (pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell). We calculated the number of each cell type in 5 fields in the inner and outer areas of large airways (luminal diameter; > or =2 mm) and small airways (<2 mm) using computer software.In asthmatic patients eosinophils were significantly increased in both inner and outer areas of small airways and the number of CD34+ cells was significantly elevated in inner areas as compared with controls. Although the density of eosinophils in the inner area of large airways was significantly suppressed (p < 0.02), there was no such suppression in the inner areas of small airways in asthmatic patients treated with CFC-BDP or DP-FP.It was speculated that inhaled CFC-BDP and DP-FP might deposit mainly in large airways and fail to fully reach small airways, consequently allowing eosinophilic inflammation to continue in small airways.",

To explore possible new aspects of the anti-pruritic mechanism of epinastine, in particular any effects on the peripheral nervous system, we examined epinastine's effects on sensory neurons using cultured murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG). We performed a quantitative assessment of neurite growth and substance P (SP) release from isolated DRG in the presence versus the absence of epinastine. Mechanism(s) of epinastine’s effects on sensory neurons were detected by examining its neurotoxicity, inhibitory action on nerve growth factor (NGF), and modulatory function on NGFreceptors. The percentage of DRG with outgrowing neurites, total number of neurites, and average extension length of neurites were decreased by epinastine in a concentration-dependent manner. Epinastine did not exhibit any evidence of neurotoxicity on sensory neurons, degradation and inactivation ability on NGF, or effects on expression of NGF receptors. Also, no effects on neural progenitor cells of the central nervous system in culture were observed. Epinastine suppressed capsaicin-induced SP release from DRG neurons in a dosedependent fashion. The results demonstrate that epinastine has inhibitory effects on sensory neuronal growth, which may explain its clinical effects including potent anti-pruritic activity.",

The vital statistics throughout Japan show a favorable downward trend in the number of asthma deaths in Japan since 1997. In particular, the asthma mortality rate among persons aged 5 to 34 years was less than 0.3 per 100,000 in 2001. In addition, the number of deaths from asthma attacks decreased more rapidly in the Tohoku district and the rate of reduction was correlated with an increase in the sales of inhaled corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes but not in the sales of inhaled short-acting β-agonists. Moreover, in the 5 year period from 1997 through 2001 it was clear that the number of asthma deaths in persons 75 years and older and those 60 years and older accounted for 61-66% and 86-88%, respectively, of the deaths in persons of all ages. Therefore, the most important future issue about asthma deaths in Japan should be to focus efforts on decreasing the number of asthma deaths in older persons.",

The patient was a 69-year-old woman who presented with a three-week history of persistent cough and fever. The chest radiograph and CT scans revealed multiple consolidations in the middle and lower lung fields bilaterally. Methods & Results: Lung biopsy specimens obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopy showed infiltration of the alveoli by lymphocytes with scattered neutrophils, and microscopic vasculitis of the small arteries. The patient tested positive for antineutrophil- cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) and for anti SS-A & SS-B antibodies ; however, the test for ANCA against proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA) was negative. Conclusions: Based on the presence of the clinical features of the sicca syndrome and positive findings on Schirmer's test and sialoscintigraphy, the patient was given a diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome with Wegener's granulomatosis-like involvement of the lungs. Neither upper airway nor renal involvement was detected.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by repetitious eczematous skin and is Th2 dominant in nature. Atopic dermatitis lesions have been observed to improve in patients during viral or bacterial infection, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV). A Th 1 pathway established to counter viral infection may possibly be the mechanism for the relief of skin lesions in AD. In animal AD models using NC/Nga mice, the effects of local intra- and/or subcutaneous injection of ultraviolet inactivated-HSV were examined for Th1/Th2 regulation through a negative regulation pathway with suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 and 5 using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Lesional skin of HSV-treated mice displayed extensive interleukin (IL)-12p40-positive cellular infiltration compared with non-treated mice and IL-12p40/ signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 4/SOCS5 mRNA expression was noted basically the same in the three groups. Interleukin-4 receptor-positive cellular infiltrates in HSV-treated mice decreased significantly more than in non-treated mice and IL-4 mRNA expression in the three groups was essentially the same, but the expression of STAT6 and SOCS3 mRNA specific for the Th2 regulation pathway was reduced more in HSV-treated compared with non- treated mice. Expression of SOCS3 mRNA in situ in HSV-treated epidermis underwent a far greater reduction compared with expression in non-treated mice. Ultraviolet-inactivated HSV treatment would appear to induce a Th1 cellular response and downregulate that of the Th2 pathway in AD-like lesions of NC/Nga mice by bringing about a reduction of SOCS3 expression in the skin. From the present results, certain HSV DNA components may be effective candidates for a new therapeutic approach in refractory AD.",

The expression of adhesion molecules differs depending upon the cells and tissue. In the present study, to elucidate these differences, a comparative study was performed on the prolongation of eosinophil survival via adhesion molecules. Blood eosinophils were purified using Percoll and anti-CD16 antibody coated magnetic beads. Eosinophils were incubated with or without the various concentrations of adhesion molecules for 18 or 36 h. Eosinophil survival was analyzed by a flow cytometer with staining by annexin V (AV) and propidium iodide (PI). Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, fibronectin (FN) and cellular fibronectin (cFN), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, significantly prolonged eosinophil survival compared with control. The present comparative study for eosinophil survival showed the following tendency: cFN = FN > ICAM-1 > VCAM-1. Moreover, enhancement of prolonged eosinophil survival by connecting segment- 1 was greater than that by FN and cFN. The regulation of adhesion molecules, by not only preventing eosinophil adhesion but also eosinophil activation, may be a potential target in the treatment of allergic inflammatory disorders.",

Three intervention groups were investigated: a procaterol inhalation only group; a procaterol inhalation plus endotoxin injection group (in vivo); and a procaterol incubation group (in vitro). The diaphragm muscle in all groups was dissected and measurements of its contractile properties were performed. The effects of procaterol inhalation shifted the force-frequency curves upward at 30 minutes after inhalation, and inhibited the decline of force-frequency curves due to endotoxin injection in vivo. In vitro administration of procaterol resulted in an increase in the force-frequency curves in a dose-dependent manner. It can be concluded that procaterol has an inotropic effect on the diaphragmatic muscles taken from normal animals as well as on the diaphragm muscles in a septic animal model.",

However, many of the patients enrolled in the original validation study had mild asthma; thus a re-evaluation including severe cases was required to calculate more reliable cut-off values. Pooled analysis of data from the original validation study and the subsequent medication guidance study including adult patients with severe asthma was conducted to calculate the JACS questionnaire cut-off values and to assess their sensitivity and specificity for identifying \"well-controlled\", \"not well-controlled\", and \"poorly controlled\" asthma as described in the Asthma Prevention and Management Guideline 2015 (JGL2015). The data were from 353 patients with mild to severe persistent asthma classified according to JGL2015. The JACS questionnaire cut-off values were 8.0 (sensitivity, 67.9%; specificity, 81.9%) for \"well-controlled\" and \"not well-controlled\" and 4.8 (sensitivity, 85.3%; specificity, 53.3%) for \"not well-controlled\" and \"poorly controlled\". JACS cut-off values can be expected to be more useful for evaluating asthma control status in clinical practice and clinical research, thus improving asthma treatment, in Japan. This analysis was the original validation study (UMIN000016589) and the subsequent medication guidance study (UMIN000024353).",

    "abstract": "Pteridines are metabolites of tetrahydrobiopterin, which serves as co-enzyme of nitric oxide synthase. We sought to investigate the usefulness of pteridines as biomarkers for childhood asthma control. We conducted a single-center prospective cohort study involving 168 asthmatic children aged 4–17 years who visited the periodical asthma checkup program. Serum neopterin and biopterin levels were measured as pteridines at each visit along with measurement of FeNO, respiratory function tests, nasal eosinophil test, blood eosinophil count, and IgE level. We calculated coefficients for relation between pteridines and asthma control, which was assessed by questionnaires (JPAC: Japanese Pediatric Asthma Control Program). A total of 168 participants aged 10.3 ± 3.39 years (mean ± SD) with asthma were recruited. The participants in this study contained 58 patients (34.5%) of complete-controlled based on JPAC, 132 patients (76.0%) of well-controlled group based on GINA. FeNO and serum neopterin level did not correlate with following period's JPAC scores. In contrast, serum biopterin level significantly correlated with following period's JPAC total score (Coefficients 0.398; 95% CI 0.164 to 0.632; p value 0.001) and frequency of wheezing during exercise (Coefficients 0.272; 95% CI 0.217 to 0.328; p value < 0.001). We found serum biopterin effected the following period's control status of asthmatic children, thus monitoring biopterin level will be a useful for management of asthma to adjust treatment.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the protective efficacy of epinastine hydrochloride for signs and symptoms caused by repeated nasal provocation with discs containing orchard grass pollen. A single-dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover clinical study was conducted in subjects with orchard grass pollinosis. The pollen challenge was conducted with the use of provocation discs containing orchard grass pollen. Epinastine hydrochloride suppressed nasal symptoms caused by nasal provocation tests using orchard grass pollen discs. Among the nasal symptoms, the number of sneezing was significantly inhibited 30 minutes and 60 minutes after the administration of epinastine hydrochloride, as compared with placebo. There were no adverse reactions to the study drugs. Our results suggest that nasal provocation tests with discs containing orchard grass pollen is a useful method for evaluating the onset of action of antiallergic drugs. As compared with placebo, epinastine hydrochloride decreased early-phase sneezing and the total nasal symptom score after repeated nasal provocations with orchard grass pollen discs.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for sensitization to Japanese cedar pollen (JCP) and house dust mite (HDM). The purpose was to clarify how children become sensitized to JCP and HDM and to evaluate the risk factors for sensitization to those antigens. A cohort of 267 children aged 6–11 years was surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire for symptoms and environmental factors such as passive smoking and the condition of the subject's home in 1994. A serum examination of JCP- and HDM-immunoglobulin E was also conducted every year from 1994 to 1997. A total of 35% of the children were positive to JCP in the first survey and a further 19% were positive in at least one of the subsequent three annual surveys. Twenty-seven percent of the children were sensitized to HDM in the first survey and a further 12% were sensitized in at least one of the subsequent three annual surveys. The incidence of JCP sensitization in any one year was proportional to the pollen count. No other environmental factors could be associated with the prevalence of either sensitization or the incidence of JCP sensitization, but HDM sensitization was more common in less well-ventilated houses (relative risk (RR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-11.38) and among those who use kerosene stoves (RR = 3.42, 95% CI = 1.26-9.23). The susceptibility to an antigen varies continuously and cannot be divided in a dichotomous manner. The children who had already been sensitized when they were enrolled in this study were of such strong susceptibility to the antigen that they could be sensitized by the minimum exposure to the antigen regardless of the environmental factors. Those with weak susceptibility could be sensitized by an extraordinarily high exposure to the antigen or by environmental risk factors during school age.",

In the present study we demonstrated that BMMC obtained from three different strains of mice, NC, BALB/c and C57BL/6, which are immature mast cells low in histamine content and unresponsive to substance F) increased 10 to 100-fold in their histamine content and acquired responsiveness to substance P after co-culture with NIH/3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of 10 ng/mL of stem cell factor (SCF). This change was observed after 1 week of co-culture and increased over a 3 week period, whereas 3T3 fibroblasts or SCF (100 ng/mL) alone was insufficient to duplicate this phenotypic change in BMMC. It is suggested that the response to substance P of mast cells is not through NK-1 receptors but rather through a different mechanism, since the reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction technique failed to show expression of NK-1 receptor mRNA in BMMC after co- culture as well as before co-culture.",

    "abstract": "We are analysing the initial molecular events stimulated by the high-affinity receptor for IgE, FcεRI. Earlier studies have shown that the first response when the receptor-bound IgE interacts with a multivalent antigen is a transphosphorylation of receptor tyrosines, induced by the approximation of two or more receptors by a constitutively associated src-family kinase (Lyn). The amount of weakly associated kinase regulates the intensity of the response. Several aspects are being analyzed: (i) the sites on Lyn and the receptor that account for the constitutive interaction; (ii) how the intrinsic affinity of a ligand for the receptor-bound IgE influences the responses; and (iii) the mechanism(s) by which low-affinity ligands can act as antagonists. In the latter studies, mast cell responses were followed by monitoring the phosphorylation of tyrosines on several proteins and secretion. At equivalent levels of receptor phosphorylation, a ligand with high affinity stimulated vigorous phosphorylation of downstream components, whereas a low-affinity ligand was unable to stimulate phosphorylation of the same components effectively. Cells stimulated with a mixture of high- and low-affinity ligands, under a protocol where simple displacement of one by the other was prevented, remarkably showed that excess low-affinity ligand inhibited the phosphorylation as well as degranulation by the high-affinity ligand. This antagonism results from a competition for the limiting amount of the constitutive initiating kinase. Related receptors that depend on recruitment of initiating kinases may be subject to similar regulatory mechanisms.",

The purpose of the present study was to define the relative importance of atopy and other risk factors for nasal allergies, including hayfever, among young adults in Melbourne. The subjects were participants in the second phase of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey; 876 adults between 20 and 45 years of age completed a detailed respiratory questionnaire, 745 had skin prick testing with common aeroallergens and 675 underwent methacholine challenge. Total and allergen-specific IgE levels were measured in 701 and 693 subjects by radioimmunoassay and RAST, respectively. Nasal allergies, including hayfever, were reported by 47.5% of randomly selected participants. Females, non- smokers, subjects with a family history of allergies, those with current asthma, a history of eczema and nasal symptoms induced by dust, pollen or food were significantly more likely to have nasal allergies. Oral antihistamines had been used by 45.7% of those reporting nasal allergies and 12.4% had received allergen immunotherapy. The risk of nasal allergies, including hayfever, was increased 6.1-fold by atopy, particularly by positive skin tests to outdoor allergens such as Birch, Timothy grass, plantain, olive, Cladosporium and Rye grass pollen. Total serum IgE was significantly higher in subjects reporting nasal allergies than in those who did not report such allergies. There were significant trends in the prevalence of nasal allergies with increasing titers of specific IgE directed against all allergens tested. In conclusion, the significant independent risk factors for nasal allergies, including hayfever, in young adults were atopy, particularly sensitization to Timothy grass, house dust mites and plantain, current asthma, not smoking, a history of eczema and female gender. Future research needs to distinguish between hayfever and perennial allergic rhinitis, which was not possible in the present study.",

    "abstract": "Mercury sensitization has been historically in question and may be related to recent increases of type I allergic diseases. To clarify the epidemiological factors of mercury sensitization, we investigated factors relating to mercury sensitization in 215 medical students. Their allergic symptoms, family histories and lifestyles were studied by questionnaire. Patch tests were performed with HgCI2 (0.05% aq.) and NiS04 (5% aq.). Anti- Dermatophagoides and anti-Crypfomeria pollen IgE antibodies in sera were also measured. Urinary mercury concentrations were measured in 25 mercury sensitized and 44 non-sensitized subjects (controls). Hair mercury concentrations were also measured in 19 sensitized and 22 non-sensitized subjects. While the positive rate of nickel was 6.0% (13/215), that of mercury was high (13.0%; 28/215). The subjects' individual histories of allergic rhinitis, eczema, urticaria and allergic conjunctivitis were significantly associated with family histories of these conditions (P < 0.01, P < 0.005 and P < 0.005, respectively), as reported in the literature. However, no allergen- specific antibody positivity or past history of allergic disease was associated with mercury sensitization. Mercury sensitized subjects had experienced eczema caused by cosmetics, shampoos, soaps and haircreams significantly more frequently (P < 0.05). The history of mercurochrome usage was not associated with mercury sensitization. The number of teeth treated with metals in mercury sensitized subjects was significantly higher than that in the control group (6.8 ± 4.3 vs 4.8 ± 1; P < 0.05). There were significant differences in urinary mercury concentrations (specific gravity adjusted levels) between mercury sensitized subjects and non-sensitized subjects (2.0 ± 0.9 and 1.3 ± 0.6 (xg/L, respectively; P < 0.001). There were also significant differences in hair mercury concentrations between mercury sensitized and non-sensitized subjects (2.0 ± 0.9 and 1.2 ± 0.5 μg/g, respectively; P < 0.01). These results suggest that mercury sensitization is associated with exposure to mercury in the living environment and that skin symptoms are possibly associated as preceding factors.",

To elucidate whether steroid administration may influence bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in women with BA, a longitudinal study was designed for adult female asthmatics receiving long-term steroid therapy. We measured whole body BMC and lumbar BMD by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in 23 women with BA and compared the results with those from 17 age-matched controls. Both patient and control groups were followed up for at least 1 year (mean (± SD) observation period 94 ± 33 weeks). We divided the asthmatic patients into two groups on the basis of the mode of steroid administration: (i) group A consisted of 10 patients with low dose oral steroid administration (prednisolone 5–10 mg daily); and (ii) group B consisted of 13 patients with low dose beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) inhalation therapy (BDP 400–800 mg daily). There were no significant differences in both baseline values and changes of BMC and BMD among the three groups. These results demonstrate that asthmatic patients show normal bone mass and that both low dose steroid administration and BDP inhalation do not significantly affect BMC in patients with BA over the period studied. We suggest that appropriate steroid use does not augment bone mineral loss in asthmatics.",

In the present study, it is shown that VIP induces eosinophil chemotaxis and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) release in potency comparable with that induced by platelet activator factor, and in a novel synergistic manner with recombinant human interleukin-5. Contrary to chemotaxis, EDN release was sensitive to staurosporine, the protein kinase C inhibitor, as well as intracellular calcium chelation. However, eosinophil treatment with inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (herbimycin A) and phosphatases (pervanadate) resulted in a dose-dependent potentiation and blockage of VIP-induced eosinophil chemotaxis, respectively. Treatment of eosinophils with VIP receptor antagonist did not modify VIP-induced chemotaxis or EDN release. Furthermore, exploration of vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor I expression was lacking in human eosinophils, but not lymphocytes. These results demonstrate two different mechanisms in triggering eosinophil activation of functional responses by VIP, a calcium-dependent degranulation and a calcium-independent chemotaxis, and elaborate on a novel cytokine–neuropeptide interaction in eosinophilic inflammation.",

To clarify the relationship between C. japonica pollen emissions before the main pollen dispersal season and dormancy of the male flowers, pollen emissions from C. japonica trees were observed from November to February, using both flowering tests and an airborne pollen survey. Some C. japonica trees studied shed pollen in November and December, by one of two mechanisms. First, some male flowers turned brown and withered, resulting in the formation of small crevices between the scales and pollen leakage. Second, some pollen was released via elongation of the rachis, which is the normal mode of flowering in spring. These early pollen emissions from male flowers were considered to represent a process of self-thinning or unseasonable flowering. Cryptomeria japonica pollen counts between October and January were closely related to mean monthly temperatures and airborne pollen counts of the following pollen season. The present study clearly shows that some male flowers of the species can bloom and disperse abundant pollen via blooming or withering in November, if the temperature in October is high, in years of high pollen production.",

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in air pollution, the prevalence and incidence of bronchial asthma, which has attracted a great deal of attention in relation to air pollution, is tending to increase in Japan as well as worldwide. Severe air pollution conditions currently exist in China due to sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, resulting from coal burning and motor vehicle exhaust gases associated with the rapid increase in the number of vehicles. Using the same questionnaire in China and Japan, we conducted a comparative study of the prevalence of various respiratory symptoms among schoolchildren in Anshan (n = 4395), Taiyuan (n = 3784 in 1997; n = 3995 in 1999) and Chengdu (n = 7795 in 1991; n = 3000 in 1998) in China and in Yokohama (n = 4161) in Japan. The pollution concentrations in the survey area of China resembled the concentrations observed in heavy industry areas in Japan in the 1970s. Comparisons between schoolchildren in Japan and China showed that the prevalence of persistent cough and persistent phlegm (persistent congestion and phlegm) was higher among schoolchildren in China (e.g. the prevalence of persistent cough in boys in China was 2.4-8.1%, whereas the rate was only 2.1% for boys in Yokohama), whereas the prevalence of wheezing and asthma-like symptoms was higher among schoolchildren in Japan (e.g. the prevalence of asthma-like symptoms was 0.2-1.8% for boys in China, whereas this rate was 9.6% in Yokohama, Japan). If China follows the same path as Japan, that is, proceeds with conversion from coal to oil as its primary energy source, the popularization of motor vehicles and chemical contamination of food, housing and clothing, there is a risk that the prevalence of bronchial asthma in Chinese children will increase in the same way as it has in Japan. It is hoped that research will be conducted to determine the cause of the increases in bronchial asthma in Japan and that preventive measures will be established so that Chinese children do not repeat the experience of Japanese schoolchildren.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine the frequency of IgE antibodies to rPhlp1, rPhlp2, rPhlp5 and rBetv2 in patients allergic to grass pollen. Blood was taken from 436 patients, aged 4-70 years, with allergy to grass. The sample was stratified by 10-year age groups. Specific serum IgE were measured by the immunoenzymatic CAP Fluoroenzyme Immunoassay System. Specific IgE binding to rPhlp1, rPhlp5, rPhlp2, was, respectively, detected in 388 (88.9%), 353 (80.9%) and 265 (60.7%) of 436 patients. Sera from 252 patients (57.7%) showed IgE binding to rPhlp1, rPhlp2 and rPhlp5; sera from 102 patients (23.3%) reacted to rPhlp1 and rPhlp5, but not rPhlp2; 30 sera (6.8%) reacted to rPhlp1 but not rPhlp2 and rPhlp5; 22 sera (5.1%) reacted only to rPhlp5; one serum reacted to rPhlp2 (0.2%); and nine sera (2%) did not react to recombinant allergens. It was found that patients in the age group 0-20 years had higher IgE levels to timothy grass and rPhlp1, rPhlp2 and rPhlp5, than patients in the older age group (41-60 years). We found, as expected, seasonal variation of IgE levels to recombinant allergens and natural allergen. Allergens rPhlp1, rPhlp2 and rPhlp5 were extremely positively correlated with timothy grass and rBetv2, but not rBetv1. These results encourage the use of recombinant pollen allergens for diagnosis and to improve specific immunotherapy in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) involves the administration of gradually increasing amounts of an allergen extract to reduce clinical symptoms of allergy. Well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of SIT in the treatment of allergic diseases, including rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma, and best practice protocols have been established. Nevertheless, application of this potentially curative treatment is restricted, largely due to the risk of serious adverse events, especially in asthmatics. Although efficacy is high for venom-induced allergy, success rates for the more common aeroallergen-induced disease range from 60 to 80% depending on the allergen. The practice of SIT is currently being refined following major advances in our knowledge of basic immune mechanisms. In particular, new T cell-targeted strategies are being explored with the awareness of the pivotal role allergen-specific T cells play in initiating and regulating the immune response to allergens. Current SIT induces decreased IgE class switching and eosinophil activation by downregulating production of the T helper (Th) 2-type cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5. Therefore, allergen preparations that have ablated IgE binding while retaining T cell reactivity should still be clinically effective but have substantially improved safety. These approaches include the use of small peptides based on dominant T cell epitopes of allergens and chemically modified or recombinant allergen molecules. Both approaches have already been tested, with promising results, in animal models; peptide immunotherapy has been shown effective in clinical trials. Defined hypoallergenic molecules or peptides offer ease of standardization in addition to efficacy and safety and will result in more widespread use of SIT in clinical practice. Elucidation of mechanisms for downregulating Th2-predominant responses to allergen by SIT will enable the development of laboratory assays for monitoring clinical efficacy.",

Spirometric functions and blood atopic parameters were compared in these groups with those in 25 age-matched atopic adults with a history of childhood asthma diagnosed by specialists but have no current wheeze symptoms (past-asthmatics) and in 60 counterparts without a previous and current wheezing episode (never-wheezers).Twenty-one of the 50 past-wheezers exhibited AHR (PC(20) < 8 mg/ml).

More blood eosinophils and higher serum levels of total IgE and IgE specific to house dust mites were observed in self-reported past-wheezers with AHR relative to those without AHR.Our findings raise the possibility that self-reported past-wheezers with AHR might form a distinct subgroup with features similar to past-asthmatics, which is one of the risk groups for adult asthma.",

The study was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics after 7-day repeated administration by which the steady state can be achieved, based on the results of an earlier study involving healthy Japanese adult males who received 7-day repeated administration of CIC-HFA. Blood was sampled at multiple time points on Day 7 of treatment for measurement of the serum des-isobutyryl-ciclesonide level. Results: The pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC from time zero to last observed concentration [AUCt], AUC over the dosage interval τ at steady state [AUCss], maximum concentration [Cmax], and terminal elimination halflife [T1/2]) and the temporal changes in the serum levels of des-isobutyryl-ciclesonide after repeated administration of CIC-HFA (200 μg/day) in Japanese children with bronchial asthma differed only slightly from those in Caucasian children with bronchial asthma. No serious adverse events were noted during the study period. Additionally, no abnormalities were detected in the serum cortisol level, other laboratory parameters, or vital signs. Conclusions: Our results suggest that there is little difference in the pharmacokinetics of des-isobutyrylciclesonide up on repeated administration of CIC-HFA between Japanese and Caucasian children with bronchial asthma. And our study suggests that CIC-HFA (200 μg/day, once daily) can be administered safely for 7 days, without raising any safety concerns.",

    "abstract": "Background: Lung function determined by spirometry and the severity of dyspnea correlate weakly in asthma patients. We attempted to determine the risk factors in asthma patients having persistent airway obstruction despite of having only mild subjective symptoms, and to examine the possibility of improving FEV1 by treating asthma on the basis of the bronchodilator change in FEV1. Methods: We examined asthma patients in their 20s and who visited Sagamihara National Hospital for the first time over a period of four years, by reviewing their clinical records. They underwent tests on the bronchodilator change in FEV1 and a test of airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine dihydrochloride. Results: One hundred thirty-eight subjects (mean age, 25.6 years; 51 males, 87 females; current smoking, 30.4%; history of childhood asthma, 48.6%) were enrolled. Among them, 18.8% (26/138) showed persistent airway obstruction (postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC (%) < 80%). Using the multiple logistic regression model, we found that history of childhood asthma and smoking history were the significant isolated risk factors for persistent airway obstruction. Moreover, we determined that the factors associated with the reversibility of airway obstruction in asthma patients without subjective symptoms were history of childhood asthma. Conclusions: In this study, patients not undergoing treatment for asthma were examined. History of childhood asthma and smoking history may be the risk factors for persistent airway obstruction in the asthma patients with mild subjective symptoms. Tests on the bronchodilator change in FEV1 should be performed in patients with history of childhood asthma and smoking history, even if they have only mild subjective symptoms.",

The treatment of HUVEC with TNF- α enhanced eosinophil adhesion in a dose-dependent manner (1–100 U/mL). The adhesion of eosinophils to TNF- α (100U/mL)-stimulated HUVEC was inhibited by TYB-2285 and its metabolites in a dose-dependent manner (10 − 8 –10 − 5 mol/L). These compounds showed stronger inhibitory effects than any other anti-allergic drugs, such as disodium cromoglycat (DSCG), ketotifen and tranilast. TYB-2285, TC-286 and TC-326 did not inhibit the adhesion of neutrophils at the same range (10 − 8 –l 0 − 5 mol/L). In our adhesion assay system, eosinophil adhesion to TNF- α -stimulated HUVEC was blocked by monoclonal antibody against VLA-4 (anti-VLA-4) but not by that against Mac-1 (anti-Mac-1). In contrast, neutrophil adhesion was blocked by anti-Mac-1, but not by anti-VLA-4. The results of the present study demonstrate that TYB-2285 and its metabolites selectively inhibit the adhesion of eosinophils to HUVECs stimulated with TNF- α and also suggest that TYB-2285, TC-286 and TC-326 might block the VLA-4/VCAM-1 pathway selectively.",

We also compared the grades of skin scores, peripheral eosinophil counts, the rate of hypersegmentation of eosinophils and serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) concentrations in eight patients before and after treatment. There was a positive correlation between the skin scores of AD and peripheral eosinophil counts (P < 0.01), between the skin scores of AD and the number of nuclear lobes of eosinophils (P < 0.01) and between eosinophil counts and the number of nuclear lobes of eosinophils when the number of nuclear lobes of eosinophils was fewer than three (P < 0.01). A positive correlation was observed between serum ECP concentrations and eosinophil counts and/or skin scores of AD (P < 0.001). A negative correlation was observed between serum ECP concentrations and the number of nuclear lobes fewer than two (P < 0.05). During therapy, peripheral eosinophil counts and the degree of hypersegmented eosinophils decreased significantly, and this was associated with recovery of skin conditions, but not with serum ECP concentrations. These results suggest that eosinophil hypersegmentation may reflect activated eosinophils and also that the observation of nuclear hypersegmentation in peripheral blood eosinophils is useful to recognize the disease activity of AD.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a disease of usually reversible airways obstruction that has prominent inflammation of the mucosa as an underlying feature. It is a disease of varying severity, with some individuals suffering from only occasional symptoms and others having daily symptoms and requiring large doses of inhaled and oral corticosteroids. Although the different forms of asthma have some common pathological features, the extent of change varies from mild to severe forms. The only cell type that has been widely correlated with disease severity has been the eosinophils, but it is evident that altered function and responsiveness of T cells to steroids plays a key role as a determinant of asthma severity. More recently, attention has focused on restructuring of the airways, which results in, or possibly develops in parallel with, inflammation. This restructuring consists of changes throughout the bronchial wall, beginning with changes in the epithelium, increased collagen deposition, increased microvasculature, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of submucosal glands, goblet metaplasia within the epithelium, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of smooth muscle and, finally, poorly defined changes in the adventitia. Novel treatments have been, and continue to be, developed to target specific components of inflammation and remodeling. However, to date, none has lead to a marked improvement in disease control and further efforts are needed to better understand the mechanisms of asthma, in particular those that are not responsive to corticosteroids.",

We also performed closed patch testing with patch test reagents using the aforementioned antigens prepared from commercially available skin reaction antigens. The dermatologic symptom severity index, duration of disease, total serum IgE, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and eosinophil counts were assessed. The relationship between each of these parameters and the intensity of the response to the patch test was then evaluated. The patch test positivity rate increased in proportion with the duration of antigen application, with a maximum of 15.6% for mite antigen and a minimum of 4.7% for cedar antigen by 72 h. There were no antigens showing negative results in any patients. The positivity rate was lower for patch tests applied on highly keratinized areas of skin. The 72 h positive patch test responses were significantly correlated with total serum IgE, LDH, symptom severity index and specific IgE RAST levels. Most positive patch test responses were considered to be possible late phase reactions of the type I allergic response. However, a small number of patients had IgE RAST negative antigens but positive patch tests. These findings suggest the presence of more than one mechanism by which a positive reaction is elicited.",

The present study was conducted to elucidate the role of T cells in this triphasic cutaneous reaction. Mice were passively senseitized by an intravenous injection of anti-DNP monoclonal IgE antibody. Allergic cutaneous reaction was caused by painting an antigen on the ears of mice and measured an enlargement of the ears. Whereas the magnitudes of IPR and LPR in BALB/c nu/nu T cell-deficient mice were similar to those in BALB/c +/+ mice, vLPR was not observed in nu/nu mice. In addition, FK 506 (3 and 5 mg/kg) and cyclosporin A (30 and 50 mg/kg) clearly suppressed the onset of vLPR without affecting IPR and LPR. Because these findings suggest the participation of T cells in the onset of vLPR, the character of the T cells was investigated by using anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 receptor α chain gene-deficient mice. When mice were treated with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 mAb, the magnitude of the vLPR was augmented by anti-CD4 mAb and suppressed by anti-CD8 mAb, without affecting IPR and LPR. Disruption of the IL-4 gene slightly suppressed IPR, LPR and vLPR, but the lack of the IL-5Rα chain gene did not affect these triphasic responses. The present findings suggest that vLPR is mainly caused by CD8-positive T cells, probably Tc1 cells, and regulated by CD4-positive T cells.",

    "abstract": "Olopatadine hydrochloride is an antiallergic agent with histamine H1 receptor antagonistic action. We investigated the effects of olopatadine on passive anaphylaxis reaction- and compound 48/80-induced conjunctivitis in rats. Allergic conjunctivitis was induced in rats passively sensitized by injection of rat anti-ovalbumin (anti-OVA) serum into the upper subconjunctiva of the right eye, followed by intravenous administration of the antigen and Evans blue dye. After 30 min, the amount of dye leaking into the conjunctiva was measured. Non-allergic conjunctivitis was induced in rats by injection of compound 48/80. Olopatadine or other reference compounds were orally given 1 h before the challenge. The amount of dye leaking into the conjunctiva following passive anaphylaxis was significantly inhibited by oral administration of 0.01-1 mg/kg olopatadine and the ID50 value was 0.093 mg/kg. In the control group, pathological examination revealed edema and lymphocyte infiltration in the conjunctiva and the palpebral skin. Olopatadine, at 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg, reduced the grade of these pathological findings. The other antiallergic drugs (1 mg/kg loratadine, 0.3 mg/kg epinastine, 0.3 mg/kg cetiridine, 1 mg/kg ebastine, 30 mg/kg fexofenadine and 3 mg/kg chlorpheniramine), when administered orally, inhibited the passive anaphylaxis reaction-induced vascular hyperpermeability of the conjunctiva, as was the case with olopatadine hydrochloride. Subconjunctival administration of compound 48/80 induced vascular hyperpermeability, which is presumably mediated by histamine release. Oral administration of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg olopatadine significantly inhibited the amount of dye leakage. Orally administered olopatadine is expected to improve allergic conjunctivitis.",

Serum samples were obtained from a general population of 3-year-old children (612 samples) in the Kanto area and Asahikawa city. The serum levels of total and specific IgE antibodies against food allergens (egg white, milk, soybean, wheat), indoor airborne allergens (house dust, mite, cat dandruff), and outdoor airborne allergens (Japanese cedar or white birch pollen allergens) were determined and analyzed, along with the results of a questionnaire regarding medical history, and allergy-related subjective symptoms. The mean total IgE level of all subjects was 34.7 IU/ml, while that for the Kanto and Asahikawa areas was 44.7 and 22.5 IU/ml, respectively. Twenty six percent of the 612 children were judged positive for indoor airborne allergen-specific IgE, and 6.7% were positive for food allergen-specific IgE. Cedar allergen-specific IgE was detected in 15.6% of the children living in the Kanto area. The total IgE level was strongly correlated with the number of allergens to which the child was sensitized. A relatively large number (28.4%) of 3-year-old children possessed allergen-specific IgE antibodies. The basic data obtained in the general population in these two areas of Japan will be valuable for further evaluations of environmental influences on allergic disease.",

The aim of the present study was to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis of patient education in patients with mild to moderate asthma during 6 months of follow up. We randomly allocated asthma patients who were covered by health insurance to a control group (group C) or a self-management group (group S). Self-management consisted of measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) and monthly individual education and advice by a specialist. Effectiveness was evaluated on the basis of PEF, quality of life, and mean total cost of medical expenses. Furthermore, we asked the patients about symptom improvement and their level of satisfaction with this program. PEF values in group S gradually increased at 3 months after the self-management program and remained at high levels. The total costs decreased by 30% from baseline in group S, whereas they increased by 15% in group C. The cost of one-day visits showed no difference between the two groups, but the frequency of visits to general practitioners decreased in group S as compared with group C. Furthermore, the number of episodes of asthma attacks decreased in group S but not in group C, and 94% of the group S patients replied that they considered the self-management program to have been useful. We conclude that an individual self-management program is not only a safe and effective aid in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma but can also reduce medical expenses.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in early childhood is a risk factor for the development of wheezing, significant decreases in pulmonary function and increases in airway reactivity. Respiratory syncytial virus infection also exacerbates recurrent wheezing attacks in patients with established asthma. Here we review the present understanding of RSV-induced bronchial asthma, especially concerning the role of eosinophils. Recent evidence suggests that eosinophils are important in RSV infection and RSV-induced asthma. For example, the eosinophil count and concentrations of eosinophil cationic protein, an eosinophil toxic granule protein, were elevated in samples of blood and nasopharyngeal secretions from patients with RSV infection or RSV-induced asthma; this suggests that eosinophils degranulate in the respiratory tract during RSV infection. Respiratory syncytial virus can infect human eosinophils, which produce chemokines such as RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1a. We have demonstrated that RSV enhances superoxide production by human eosinophils stimulated with a lipid mediator, such as platelet-activating factor. This response is dependent on p2 integrin, aM02, which is critical for eosinophil effector functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that RSV-infected epithelial cells produce multiple cytokines and chem- okines. We have found that RSV enhances eosinophil adhesion and degranulation following infection of BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells and that another eosinophil toxic granule protein, major basic protein or eosinophil peroxidase, synergistically augments RSV-induced epithelial cell damage and apoptosis in A549 cells. These results suggest that eosinophils and their products enhance RSV-induced airway inflammation in asthma. Closely delineating the mechanism by which RSV enhances eosinophilic inflammation in asthma should be useful in devising more effective therapy.",

    "abstract": "A self-recorded instrument for children with asthma needed to be developed to measure their quality of life (QOL). Therefore, the JSCA-QOL questionnaire was revised into a briefer third version, consisting of 5 domains (25 questions) and a summative scale. The purpose was to examine the possibility of identifying children with poor QOL requiring medical or social support, and to devise a practical form of evaluating a nationwide investigation using this instrument. Doctors at hospital and clinics throughout Japan distributed the JSCA-QOL to 5308 10- to 18-year-old children with asthma. The questionnaires were returned by mail, after having been filled out by the subjects, who authorized their participation in the investigation by signing the questionnaire. A total of 2097 children with asthma, who fully completed the questionnaire, were included in the study. As a result of analysis, it was clear that the characteristics of the low score group (under the 10th percentile of QOL scores) were noticeably different from those of the other groups, in the following ways: (i) many children had moderate to severe asthma, (ii) the answers showed different distributions from those of the other groups, (iii) the answers in most “feeling level” questions showed a significantly different distribution. A radar chart was developed for efficient evaluation of children's QOL profiles. It was very useful to separate the low score group (LSG) with the 10th percentile of the QOL score to distinguish the children who needed special support. The evaluation of the QOL profile was simplified by using the radar chart concept.",

    "abstract": "Injectable methylxanthines are useful drugs in the treatment of asthma. The Asthma Prevention and Management Guidelines (JGL) that are followed in Japan recommend the use of sustained-release theophylline to control the disease and use of injectable methylxanthines to alleviate symptoms. In contrast, the guidelines followed in the west do not promote theophylline use due to safety concerns, and the use of injectable methylxanthines in particular are not recommended. We thus conducted a study on adult patients with bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with theophylline and injectable methylxanthines in Japan in order to assess the safety of these drugs.876 patients were surveyed at 55 medical institutions by the Committee on the Safety of Sustained-Release Theophylline and Injectable Methylxanthines (CST) of the Committee for Asthma Prevention and Management Guidelines of the Japanese Society of Allergology (JSA). 682 of the patients were evaluated for safety.Adverse reactions including facial flushing, palpitations, headache, tinnitus, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting and tachycardia were reported by only 2 (0.29%) of the 682 patients, but none of these were serious.The results confirm that injectable methylxanthines are safe, when used in accordance with the JGL.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background The interleukin-12B gene ( IL - 12B ) encodes the p40 chain of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which promotes cell-mediated Th1 responses and the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) that downregulates IgE production. Chromosome 5q31-q33 near the IL - 12B locus is significantly linked to asthma, as determined by a genome-wide search in the Japanese population. Methods We sequenced exons 1–8 including parts of the introns and promoter region of IL - 12B in asthmatic patients and healthy controls. We examined plasma IL-12 concentrations, IL-12 production by Derf1-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the IL - 12B transcriptional activity. Results IL - 12B promoter polymorphism existed as − 2703 CTCTAA/GC and − 2403 T/C alleles, which were linked to each other. Homozygosity for haplotype 1 ( − 2703 CTCTAA / − 2403 T) was associated with asthma susceptibility in Japanese children ( P − 2703 GC / − 2403 C) (P IL - 12B transcriptional activity was influenced by the − 2403 T/ C allele rather than by the − 2403 CTCTAA/GC allele. Conclusions Homozygosity for haplotype 1, which is associated with reduced IL - 12B transcriptional activity and reduced IL-12 production, is a predisposing factor for asthma susceptibility in Japanese children.",

The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the oral treatment with etretinate improves sclerosis in bleomycin (BLM)-induced sclerotic skin mice. BLM-induced sclerotic skin mice were treated orally with 10 mg/kg etretinate for 1 to 28 days. One control group received only the vehicle, 50 μl peanut oil, while another group received no agents. BLM-treated skin was removed and dermal thickness was measured histologically. Histopathological observation and TUNEL assay were also studied. Messenger RNA (mRNA) ratios for procollagen α 1 (I) chain to β actin from etretinate-treated and control mice were quantified at 1, 6, 14, and 28 days post-treatment, using quantitative RT-PCRs. There was a significant decrease in mean dermal thickness (P < 0.05) and changes in collagen bundles in the etretinate-treated mice group for a 28-day period compared to control groups. TUNEL assay showed that the density of TUNEL-positive cells in the dermis of etretinate-treated mice for a 14-day period was significantly increased (P < 0.05). The ratio of procollagen α 1 (I) chain to β actin mRNA from etretinate-treated mice for a 1-day period decreased significantly compared to that of the control mice, but the ratio from etretinate-treated mice for a 14-day period increased significantly (P < 0.05). Etretinate improved BLM-induced scleroderma. These results suggest that etretinate can be applied to the treatment of SSc skin disorders.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of montelukast, a specific cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, in preventing recurrent asthma attacks was evaluated for post-emergency management of acute asthma exacerbation. Twenty-two patients with a history of chronic asthma whose symptoms were responsive to an inhaled β-adrenergic receptor agonist in an emergency room setting, were randomized into two groups, those with and those without montelukast (n = 11 for each group). Patients in the montelukast group received an oral dose of 10 mg montelukast before leaving the emergency room following rescue treatment with an inhaled β-adrenergic receptor agonist. Patients in both groups were instructed to use an inhaled β-adrenergic receptor agonist for shortness of breath or dyspnea in post-emergency management. Additional β-adrenergic receptor agonist use, subjective asthma symptoms, sleep impairment, additional emergency visits and/or hospitalization were monitored for 24 hours following the emergency room visit. In the montelukast group, the need for a rescue β-adrenergic receptor agonist was significantly decreased; 54.5% of patients in the montelukast group required use of β-adrenergic receptor agonist compared with 100% in the non-montelukast group (P < 0.05). The average number of uses of a β-adrenergic receptor agonist was 2.67 ± 3.58 times/ 24 h in the montelukast group compared with 11.95 ± 3.60 times/24 h in the non-montelukast group (P < 0.01). The average subjective asthma symptom scores were significantly decreased in the montelukast group, whereas no score change occurred in the non-montelukast group. The sleep impairment score was significantly lower in the montelukast group compared with that in the non-montelukast group (P < 0.05). No patients in either group had an emergency visit or hospitalization during this period. The results demonstrate that montelukast can prevent recurrent asthma exacerbations in the home environment.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a complex disorder of inflammation and remodelling largely restricted to the conducting airways. It is a disorder where there are major genetics and environmental factors that interact together to initiate and propagate the disease into a chronic relapsing disorder. Until recently the genetic factors involved in disease pathogenesis have been restricted to variants in known molecules involved in the inflammatory or remodelling pathways. In this review evidence is presented for a new susceptibility gene for asthma, ADAM 33, that was identified by positional cloning. It is suggested that ADAM 33 plays a key role in predisposing to reduced lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness characteristic of asthma. Through an understanding of the disease-related SNPs(in ADAM 33)it may be possible, not only to identify a gene based diagnostic test, but also to focus attention on developing a new treatment that reverses remodelling changes.",

    "abstract": "Epstein Barr virus (EBV) has been suspected of being involved in the development of atopy. There are several studies suggesting a positive as well as negative association between EBV infection and atopic diseases. Here, we carried out a large-scale, systematic investigation to address the issue of the possible association between EBV infection and atopic diseases. Anti-EBV-viral capsid antigen (VCA) antibody titer, anti-EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibody titer, atypical lymphocyte (AtLy) count and EBV-DNA copy number in 106 WBC were examined as evidence for EBV infection, and characteristic parameters of atopic disease such as total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, highest antigen-specific IgE antibody titer (h-RAST) and peripheral blood eosinophil (Eos) count were measured and compared among atopic subjects and non-atopic controls, and correlations between parameters of atopy and EBV infection were subjected to statistical analysis. Anti-EBV, in particular anti-EBNA antibody titer and AtLy count in peripheral blood were markedly higher in patients with bronchial asthma (BA) and/or atopic dermatitis (AD) than in non-atopic controls, especially in early childhood. No similar findings were obtained for antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV). EBV-DNA copy numbers in WBC were elevated in atopic subjects. Correlations between EBV-DNA copy number and other parameters of EBV infection (anti-EBV antibody titer and AtLy count) but those with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and markers of atopic disease (IgE, h-RAST level, and Eos count) were demonstrated. It was found that anti-EBNA seronegative atopics have higher copy numbers of EBV DNA in WBC and more elevated levels of IgE and h-RAST than anti-EBNA seropositive atopics. Anti-EBV VCA antibody titer in individuals aged 15 years and younger and anti-EBNA antibody titer among Japanese were suggested to have declined considerably in the past 15 years. The present study suggests that EBV infection in early childhood could precipitate atopic diseases.",

In this study, we used a reverse-sandwich ELISA for measuring specific non-IgE,-IgG4 (probably, mainly IgG1) to Japanese cedar pollen allergens, and compared the antibody-positive rates and geometric mean antibody titers between pollinosis patients and non-patients (healthy individuals). Antibodies to two major allergens of Japanese cedar, Cry j 1 and Cry j 2, were assayed by the following methods : specific non-IgE,-IgG4 was measured by a reverse-sandwich ELISA ; specific IgE and IgG4 were measured by indirect ELISAs. We detected specific non-IgE,-IgG4 in both the patients and non-patients. In comparison to the IgE antibody, which was detected in a small proportion of the non-patients with low titers, the non-IgE,-IgG4 antibody was present in a higher proportion with higher titers among both the patients and non-patients. Healthy individuals had specific non-IgE,-IgG4 to Japanese cedar allergens in a higher proportion than the specific IgE. The non-IgE,-IgG4 antibody assay may be useful in studies on the prevalence of allergen-specific antibody responders and may help in clarifying the natural history of pollinosis.",

    "abstract": "Early intervention in adult asthma has been evaluated mostly with regard to symptoms, respiratory function and airway hyperresponsiveness, and has rarely been evaluated with regard to airway inflammation. Further, no clinical data concerning prevention of remodeling by anti-inflammatory therapy have been reported. The anti-inflammatory activities of an inhaled steroid and a leukotriene receptor antagonist were compared using sputum induced by inhaled hyperosmotic NaCl solution, and the usefulness of anti-inflammatory treatment for mild intermittent asthma (step 1) was investigated. The subjects of the study were patients with mild intermittent asthma (step 1) who had not received steroid treatment and had only been treated with inhaled β2-stimulants as needed. The subjects were divided into two groups : one group received 400 μg/day of budesonide (BUD group ; n = 15) and the other group received 10 mg/day of montelukast (MK group ; n = 12). The anti-inflammatory activities of BUD and MK were compared by examining respiratory function, exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) concentrations, airway hyperresponsiveness (acetylcholine provocation test) and the sputum induced by inhalation of hyperosmotic NaCl solution at three time points, i.e., before, 1 month after, and 6 months after the start of treatment. It was shown that even in mild intermittent asthma (step 1) the levels of ENO and sputum eosinophil ratio were elevated, indicating that airway inflammation was clearly present and that airway hyperresponsiveness was elevated. The effects of BUD and MK in improving ENO and sputum eosinophil ratio were almost the same. However, airway hyperresponsiveness in both groups were not significantly improved after 1 and 6 months of treatment. Anti-inflammatory treatment is necessary even for mild intermittent asthma (step 1). We believe that early intervention with anti-inflammatory drugs is important for the prevention of airway remodeling, exacerbation of disease and progression to intractable asthma. Either of the two types of drugs, low-dose inhaled steroids or leukotriene receptor antagonists, can be selected as anti-inflammatory drugs for mild intermittent asthma.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the conducting airways. Current asthma treatment guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the first-line maintenance therapy for mild to severe persistent asthma, because ICS are the most efficacious anti-inflammatory medication. Despite treatment with ICS, suppression of inflammation is often incomplete and blockade by ICS of cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) and thromboxane (TX) A2 biosynthesis is limited. The addition of a CysLT1 receptor antagonist to an ICS represents a reasonable alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of asthma patients whose symptoms remain uncontrolled on ICS alone. Indeed, CysLT1 receptor antagonists are demonstrated both to have an additive effect to ICS therapy and to allow the reduction of ICS dosage. Thromboxane modifiers also have an additive effect with low- to moderate-dose ICS. Although the long-term usefulness of add-on therapy of CysLT or TX modifiers (vs long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists) to ICS is unclear, these alternatives are worthy of further consideration.",

Dendritic cells, as the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APC) for the induction of primary immune response to antigen, are deeply involved in the differentiation of na'i've T cells into Th2 cells, thereby developing the development of allergic sensitization. After sensitization, DC may also function as a major APC to control the activation and clonal expansion of memory Th2 cells. In addition, DC are able to produce chemokines to recruit Th2 cells into inflammatory sites, indicating DC are important agents in various phases of allergic inflammation. Recently, we have demonstrated that monocyte chemotactic protein-1 not only regulates the homing of DC, but also modulates DC function. The present paper reviews the role of DC in the regulation of the Th2 response in allergic diseases and discusses the possibility of a new therapeutic strategy targeting chemokine-mediated regulation of DC function.",

    "abstract": "In a recent epidemiological study, 15-20% of the population in Japan was estimated to have allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctival diseases (ACD) have a wide spectrum of clinical severity and the treatment strategy depends on the severity and duration of the disease. Most cases of the non-proliferative type of ACD, such as seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis, can be treated with topical anti-allergic drugs. Of the ACD, vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is characterized by typical proliferative lesions, such as giant papillae and severe corneal lesions. Corticosteroid eye drops should be used in combination with anti-allergic eye drops when an anti-allergic drug is insufficient in cases of VKC and atopic keratoconjunctivitis with proliferative lesions. In spite of the high effectiveness of corticosteroid eye drops, they have important side-effects, such as elevation of intraocular pressure leading to glaucoma. Immunosuppressive agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are alternative topical agents to corticosteroids. Topically administered immunosuppressive agents, such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus, have antifibroblastic actions by inhibiting remodeling-inducing cells and act as a controller in the treatment of ACD. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug eye drops can be used to inhibit remodeling in ACD because of their excellent antiinflammatory and antifibroblastic effects, next to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. Substitution of the topical treatment with corticosteroids by these agents in ACD not only spares the use of corticosteroids and decreases the risk of side-effects, but also brings about a more favorable effect in the long-term control of proliferative-type ACD.",

We aimed to clarify the clinical utility of the basophil activation test (BAT) in the diagnosis of natto-induced hypersensitivity.Five patients with a history of anaphylaxis and chronic urticaria suspected of natto-induced hypersensitivity and seven with chronic spontaneous urticaria clinically unrelated to natto were enrolled in the patient and control groups, respectively. The BAT was performed with two incubation times, 15 min and 1 h, in combination with various concentrations of natto-mucilage extract.In controls, CD203c levels in basophils remained low in the 15-min incubation but were significantly increased in the 1-h incubation. In the patient group, in the 15-min condition, basophil CD203c was significantly upregulated by natto mucilage but not by soybean vs controls (P = 0.001). Low concentrations of natto mucilage were sufficient to upregulate basophil CD203c in the anaphylaxis cases, but high concentrations were required to induce the same effect in the urticaria cases. Finally, the dose-dependent pattern of the BAT results differed significantly between the anaphylaxis and urticaria cases (P = 0.006). Thus, a strong background reaction was observed in the BAT with 1 h incubation; 15 min of incubation was sufficient to identify patients with natto-induced hypersensitivity and may distinguish the clinical phenotype of natto-induced hypersensitivity, i.e., anaphylaxis or urticaria.The BAT with a 15-min incubation period is useful in diagnosing natto-induced hypersensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The addition of leukotriene modifier (LM) may be a useful approach for uncontrollable asthma despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), especially in asthmatics comorbid with allergic rhinitis (AR), although little is known about its molecular mechanism. We evaluated the additive effects of LM with ICS on pulmonary function and airway inflammation in asthmatics with or without AR. Eighteen uncontrolled steroid-treated asthmatics, nine with and nine without AR, were enrolled. Spirometry, peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements, and exhaled breath condensate sampling were performed before and 8 weeks after LM administration. The lowest PEF over the course of one week, expressed as a percentage of the highest PEF (Min%Max PEF), was used as an index of fluctuation of the airway caliber. Airway cytokine expression was analyzed with a protein array. A significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of the predicted value (%FEV1) and Min%Max PEF was seen in the subgroup of asthma with AR. Although there was no significant difference in the baseline cytokine values between the groups, the exhaled RANTES level was significantly reduced by LM in the asthma with AR group. The changes in the RANTES level were significantly related to the changes in the %FEV1 and Min%Max PEF values. LM caused a greater improvement in pulmonary function and airway inflammation in asthmatics with AR. The RANTES-mediated pathway may be involved in the improvement of the airflow limitation and airway lability by LM additive therapy in asthmatics receiving steroid therapy.",

Little is known, however, about how the time and amount of solar irradiation during pregnancy affects such risks in children. We aimed to find out how solar irradiation during pregnancy affects sensitization to aero-allergens and the prevalence of allergic diseases in children. This population-based cross-sectional study involved 7301 aged 6 years and aged 12 years children. Maternal exposure to solar irradiation during pregnancy was evaluated using data from weather stations closest to each child's birthplace. Monthly average solar irradiation during the second and third trimesters was calculated with rank by quartiles. Risks of allergic sensitization and allergic disease were estimated. Relative to the first (lowest) quartile, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for allergic sensitization in the fourth (highest) quartile was lowest within solar irradiation during pregnancy months 5–6 (aOR = 0.823, 95% CI 0.720–0.942, p < 0.05). During months 9–10, the aOR for allergic sensitization for the fourth was higher than the first quartile of solar irradiation (aOR = 1.167, 95% CI 1.022–1.333, p < 0.05). Similar results were observed when solar irradiation was analyzed as a continuous variable during months 5 (aOR = 0.975, 95% CI 0.962–0.989, p < 0.001) and month 9 (aOR = 1.018, 95% CI 1.004–1.031, p = 0.003). Increased solar irradiation during months 7–8 increased the risk of asthma (aOR = 1.309, 95% CI 1.024–1.674, p = 0.032). Maternal exposure to solar irradiation during the second trimester of pregnancy associated with reduced aeroallergen sensitization, whereas solar irradiation during the third trimester was related to increased sensitization to aeroallergens.",

To clarify the usefulness of AD in infants as a predictor for the later development of BA, we examined the prevalence of and the risk factors for the later development of BA in infants with AD in four prefectures in Japan. We registered 157 infants with AD (100 boys and 57 girls) for the study and 151 infants (95 boys and 56 girls) were successfully followed up for a mean duration of 1 year. Atopic dermatitis was cured and improved in 23 and 70% of the patients, respectively, during the follow-up period. Boys developed mite allergy more frequently than did girls during the follow-up period (P < 0.05). Twelve boys and two girls were diagnosed as having BA during the period, without any correlation with the outcome of the AD, and 12 boys developed wheezing but were not diagnosed as having BA by a physician. Male sex, a positive family history of BA, but not that of AD, and the appearance of mite-specific IgE during the follow-up period were identified as significant risk factors for the development of BA. The combination of a positive family history of BA and mite-specific IgE and the same combination in the boys had high specificity (55 and 56%, respectively) and sensitivity (60 and 50%, respectively) as risk factors. The data suggest the involvement of genetic factors in the early development of BA in young children with AD and indicate that AD in infants and young children with these risk factors is a useful predictor for the development of BA within a short period.",

Ovalbumin–liposome and OVA–alum predominantly induced IgG 2a and IgG 1 anti-OVA production, respectively. These results suggest that OVA–liposome and OVA–alum induce type 1 and type 2T helper (Th) immune responses, respectively. To further investigate this issue, we examined the cytokine production induced by these two distinct adjuvants. Spleen cells taken from mice immunized with either OVA–liposome or OVA–alum were cultured in vitro with OVA and the cytokine production from each culture was analyzed. It was demonstrated that spleen cells from mice immunized with OVA–liposome produced more interferon (IFN)-γ than those immunized with OVA–alum and, furthermore, interleukin (IL)-4 was produced only by spleen cells from mice immunized with OVA–alum. These results favor the notion that OVA–liposome and OVA–alum induce Th1 and Th2 cytokines, respectively. Interestingly, the production of IL-2, a Th1 cytokine, was higher in the OVA–alum-immunized group and the production of IL-10, a Th2 cytokine, remained at low levels in both groups after primary immunization; levels of IL-10 increased in the OVA–liposome-immunized group after secondary immunization. These results do not agree with the above notion and, thus, suggest that it may be important to consider the balance between IFN-γ-producing cells and IL-4-producing cells rather than that between Th1 and Th2 cells for the regulation of IgE antibody production.",

Characteristically, lipid body numbers increase when eosinophils and other leukocytes are participating in inflammatory processes. Moreover, lipid bodies are numerous in other sites active in eicosanoid formation, such as the amnion epithelium at parturition. Our interests in lipid bodies relate to the roles that these structures play in arachidonate metabolism by eosinophils and other leukocytes involved in inflammation. Findings indicate that lipid bodies in these leukocytes can function as intracellular domains that are both depots of esterified arachidonate and sites at which regulated enzymatic events relevant to arachidonate metabolism can occur. Lipid bodies are discrete intracellular structures whose formation is specifically inducible early, whose increased numbers correlate with the 'priming' responses of leukocytes to form enhanced amounts of both cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoids and whose inhibition of formation correlates with reduced synthesis of these eicosanoids. Inhibition of lipid body formation represents a novel pharmacologic target to block the formation of eicosanoid mediators of inflammation.",

To elucidate the role of Ca2 + as a second messenger, eosinophils were depleted of intracellular Ca2 + which, per se, did not modify eosinophil chemotaxis. To gain insight of the possible intracellular signal transduction, we blocked pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gj proteins as well as several protein kinases. It was found that the inhibition of tyrosine kinase with herbimycin A and the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) with MEK-1 inhibitor (PD98059) significantly blocked chemotaxis; however, inhibition of protein kinase C with staurosporine, protein kinase A with H-89 and Gi proteins with PTX did not affect chemotaxis.

Adhesion molecules, which are expressed on bronchial epithelium, play an important role in the pathogenesis of epithelial damage and airway inflammation. We analysed ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression on human bronchial epithelial cell line, NCI-H292, after influenza virus A infection. ICAM-1 was expressed on control cells constitutively. Influenza virus A infection caused a three-fold increase in ICAM-1 expression on NCI-H292 cells. Supernatant of virus-infected cells was analysed for the concentration of IL-1β and TNF-α but these cytokines were not detected. VCAM-1 was not expressed on control cells and did not change after cytokine stimulation or virus infection. These findings suggest that influenza virus infection may induce ICAM-1 expression on bronchial epithelium without intervention of leukocytes, and ICAM-1 expressed on epithelium plays a major part in the pathophysiology of airway inflammatory disease caused by viral infection.",

The aims of this study were to develop a conventional purification procedure for M-177 and then to analyze some of the immunochemical properties of M-177. Mite extracts obtained from purified mite bodies were a suitable material for preparing M-177, because the purified mite extract contained large amounts of M-177. The purification of this allergen from the extract was achieved by ethanol fractionation, anion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The purified antigen was immunochemically equivalent to that of a preparation obtained by a previous affinity method using an anti-Mag 3-immobilized column. The yield of this purification procedure was 36.8% of the initial amount of M-177 in the extract, 40-fold greater than that of the previous immunoaffinity method. Our purification method was useful for preparing this allergen. The purified M-177 reacted in skin tests in 11 of 16 miteallergic patients, compared to 10 of 16 with Der f 2. The amount of M-177 in the purified mite extract determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition was as much as 0.95% of the total protein, which was higher than the amounts of Der f 1 (0.52%) and Der f 2 (0.32%). The potent allergenic activity and large amount of M-177 in the mites indicate that it is an important mite allergen.",

We have shown previously that the incidence of immediate hypersensitivity to A. restrictus is comparable to that for Aspergillus fumigatus and Alternaria alternata in asthmatic children. Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) inhibition was used to determine whether A. restrictus shares similar allergenic components with A. fumigatus and A. alternata. Mycelial mats of the three species cultivated on completely synthetic media were used for extract preparation. IgE antibodies to each fungus were measured with RAST using a polyvinyl chloride microplate as a solid phase. Analysis of a serum pool obtained from nine asthmatic children with a positive RAST to A. restrictus showed that A. restrictus inhibited the RAST to A. restrictus, A. fumigatus and A. alternata by more than 80%. Similar results were observed with A. fumigatus and A. alternata. Additionally, when 13 serum samples with a positive RAST to A. restrictus were tested separately, A. restrictus substantially inhibited the A. restrictus RAST in all subjects tested. A. fumigatus and A. alternata inhibited the A. restrictus RAST in 10 and 8 of the samples studied, respectively. These findings indicate that A. restrictus shares allergenic components with A. fumigatus and A. alternata.

Nitric oxide is a potent bronchodilator, and NO released from airway epithelial cells and inhibitory nonadrenergic non-cholinergic nerve terminals may attenuate airway hyperresponsiveness. However, a large amount of NO produced by inducible NO synthase may facilitate airway inflammation, which then leads to airway hyperresponsiveness. Although the role of NO remains controversial, the measurement of exhaled NO may well be of value in the clinical management of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Atopic diseases in children often develop in series and atopic dermatitis usually occurs first. To clarify the serial development of atopic dermatitis and bronchial asthma in atopic children in Japan, the present and/or past history of atopic dermatitis in patients with bronchial asthma was examined. Patients (n = 280) with bronchial asthma in five prefectures in Japan were examined at a mean (± SD) age of 8.2 (± 4.5) years and asked about prior and/or concurrent atopic dermatitis. The mean (± SD) age of the patients at the onset of bronchial asthma was 3.0 (± 2.3) years. There was a present or past history of atopic dermatitis in 54% of the patients, and 47 and 72% of those had developed atopic dermatitis within the first 6 and 12 months of life, respectively. In 86% of the patients with both bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis developed first. The mean (± SD) duration from the onset of atopic dermatitis to the time of examination was 7.3 (± 4.3) years, and atopic dermatitis had been cured in 49% of the patients within this period regardless of the therapy used. Patients with atopic dermatitis had a higher rate of atopic dermatitis in their families (43%) compared with those without atopic dermatitis (23%). These data show that half of the children with bronchial asthma first develop atopic dermatitis in early infancy and that it is relatively easily cured.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a disease of chronic airway inflammation that is characterized clinically by bronchial hyper-responsiveness and airflow limitation. Chronic inflammation, coupled with ongoing repair of airways damaged by the persistent inflammatory process in asthma, results in permanent structural and functional airway changes (remodeling) that can lead to irreversible airflow obstruction. Current guidelines emphasize treatment of the underlying inflammatory process in asthma and recommend early, long-term anti-inflammatory treatment to diminish or prevent the irreversible component of airflow obstruction. Furthermore, they recognize that inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents available for the treatment of asthma. Patient adherence to prescribed inhaled corticosteroid medication is associated with decreased airway inflammation, improved pulmonary function and symptom control. Moreover, marked declines in morbidity and mortality due to asthma have been attributed to appropriate use of inhaled corticosteroids. Strict patient adherence with prescribed anti-inflammatory medication is crucial for obtaining optimal therapeutic benefit for patients with asthma. Despite the proven effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids, patient adherence to prescribed therapy is often low, resulting in increased patient morbidity. Complex dosing regimens contribute greatly to patient non-adherence. Thus, new once-daily regimens of inhaled corticosteroid treatment have been introduced as means to improve patient adherence and provide optimal therapeutic benefit. In the present review, the complex inflammatory and remodeling processes in asthma and their contributions to the clinical manifestations of the disease will be discussed. Currently available, once-daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment options and the advantages of these therapeutic options in the treatment of persistent asthma also will be discussed.",

Oral administration of TWH extract once per day for three weeks dose-dependently suppressed peripheral blood eosinophilia and serum IgE levels, which are enhanced by M. cortii infection. Significant suppression of both eosinophilia and serum IgE levels were first noted in mice treated with 300 μg/kg of the extract. The maximum inhibition was observed when mice were treated with 410 μg/kg TWH extract. The ability of spleen cells to produce interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 in response to M. cortii somatic antigen was also significantly suppressed when donor mice were treated with more than 400 μg/kg of the extract. Extraxct treatment at a daily dose of 400 μg/kg suppressed costimulatory molecule (CD40 and CD86) expression on spleen cells induced by M. cortii infection.

    "abstract": "We investigated the relationship between peak expiratory flow (PEF), age and standing height in 2785 Japanese volunteers (1047 males), aged 15–84 years, who had never smoked and who satisfied other strict criteria of normality. Many reports of regression equations for PEF by country and ethnicity are prepared using Wright or mini-Wright PEF meters, which have been calibrated by human subjects. Yet, no study has been performed in any country to determine the reference values of PEF on the American Thoracic Society (ATS) scale, which is calibrated by a computerdriven mechanical pump. Peak expiratory flow was measured with mini-Wright meters calibrated on the Wright scale. All subjects were taught how to perform a forced expiratory maneuver: the highest of three PEF values was recorded and standing height was measured. The Miles equation was used to convert mini-Wright PEF values (traditional scale) to values using the new ‘mechanical’ PEF, which the ATS has recommended (ATS scale). In the analysis of the data, a model based on age, age squared and age cubed was used to derive curvilinear regression equations for PEF on age and standing height for each sex. There was adequate representation of subjects of each sex at all ages to 74 years. Curves plotted from the regression equations rose during adolescence and early adulthood, reached maximum values at 35 years in males and 40 years in females and then declined in an approximately linear manner. For both sexes, standing height fell progressively with increasing age. From the regression equations, predicted values of PEF can be derived for any Japanese adult aged 15–74 years. We were able to obtain predicted equations for PEF in normal Japanese adults using both the Wright and ATS scales. Direct comparison of our regressions with those reported in other populations was limited by differences in methodology and analysis. In comparable studies of Chinese and Indian populations, the PEF values in those studies were appreciably lower than ours. Our regressions were remarkably similar to those reported in a study of British subjects that used virtually identical entry criteria and methods.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic airway inflammation and increased cough sensitivity without bronchial hyperresponsiveness are the pathologic and physiologic features of bronchodilator-resistant non-productive cough-associated global atopic tendency, abbreviated herein as atopic cough. Histamine H1 receptor antagonists are effective in relieving the cough in nearly 60% of patients with atopic cough. However, there is no direct evidence that histamine H1 receptor antagonists can reduce cough hypersensitivity associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation. The purpose of the present study was to clarify this issue. The number of coughs caused by inhalation of increasing concentrations of capsaicin (10− 8, 10− 6 and 10− 4 mol/L) was counted 24 h after the administration of an aerosolized antigen in actively sensitized conscious guinea pigs and then bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Azelastine (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) or terfenadine (0.2 or 2 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally 60 min before capsaicin provocation 24 h after the antigen challenge in sensitized guinea pigs. In addition, azelastine (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) was administered 90 min before the capsaicin challenge in naïve guinea pigs. The cough response to capsaicin and the number of eosinophils in BAL fluid (BALF) were significantly increased after antigen challenge. Azelastine and terfenadine significantly reduced the increased cough response after antigen challenge, while azelastine had no effect in naïve animals. In conclusion, histamine H1 receptor antagonists reduce antigen-induced increases in cough sensitivity in sensitized guinea pigs without direct inhibition of a common cough reflex pathway.",

The present paper describes tests to see if the airway responsiveness induced by acetylcholine (ACh) or capsaicin, which causes a release of endogenous tachykinins from the sensory nerve, changes with age in guinea pigs. Changes in lung resistance (RL) were measured to monitor airflow obstruction caused by intravenous ACh or capsaicin in anesthetized immature guinea pigs (aged 2 weeks), and to compare with those of adult guinea pigs (aged 11 weeks). It was shown that both ACh and capsaicin induced a rapid and dose-dependent increase in RL both in immature and adult animals. The two age groups had similar responsiveness to ACh or capsaicin in terms of potency or sensitivity. The response induced by capsaicin was not affected by atropine. In addition, capsaicin caused no extravasation of Evans Blue dye as an index of airway plasma exudation in both age groups. The airflow obstruction induced by i.v. capsaicin is mainly due to a cholinergic-unrelated smooth muscle contraction. These results suggest that airway smooth muscle responsiveness to cholinergics or capsaicin is comparable in both immature and adult guinea pigs in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Fermented soybean (natto)-induced hypersensitivity reactions (natto allergy) are rare and can result in late-onset anaphylaxis. The allergen in natto is considered to be poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA), and marine sports are a risk factor for natto allergy due to epicutaneous sensitization to PGA from cnidarian stings. However, no research on natto allergy in fishery workers has yet been performed.We conducted a chart review of inpatients diagnosed with anaphylaxis due to natto at Hokkaido Prefectural Haboro Hospital between April 1, 2009, and August 31, 2020. We also administered self-report questionnaires about food hypersensitivity reactions to Japanese fishery workers, including members of the Kitarumoi Fishery Cooperative Association and part-time workers in this area, from February 1 to May 31, 2021.We found six inpatients (29 inpatients with food-induced anaphylaxis among approximately 11,000 community-dwelling residents) with late-onset anaphylaxis due to natto; all were involved in scallop aquaculture. The questionnaires revealed that 27 participants had natto allergy. We divided the fishery workers into a scallop aquaculture (Scallop) group (n = 211) and other fishery group (n = 106). The Scallop group was significantly associated with natto allergy after adjustments for confounders (OR: 5.73, 95% CI: 1.46-22.56) by logistic regression analysis. In the Scallop group, older age, experience in repairing nets, and a longer length of work experience were significantly related to participants with natto allergy (n = 23), but not participants without natto allergy (n = 181).Our results indicated an association between scallop aquaculture and natto allergy.",

    "abstract": "Information on changes in asthma prevalence and the treatment status for asthma is used as basic information for taking medical and administrative measures against asthma. However, this information among adults is relatively limited.To elucidate changes in the prevalence of asthma and treatment status over time among Japanese adults, health insurance claim data from some health insurance societies covering salaried employees and their dependents were studied longitudinally. Claim data from FY1999 to 2007 were obtained from two health insurance societies, and data from FY 2011 to 2019 were obtained from three different health insurance societies, and changes in standardized asthma prevalence among subjects aged 20-59 years, proportion of asthma patients prescribed ICS, leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), and LABA, and the mean number of acute asthma exacerbations per year were analyzed.The prevalence of asthma increased from 1.6% in 1999 to 3.0% in 2007 and 2.9% in 2011 to 4.6% in 2019. Increased trends in asthma prevalence from 2011 to 2019 were more noticeable in subjects in their 50s than those in their 20s for both sexes. The number of emergency visits related to asthma was 1.5 per year in 1999, which decreased to 0.8 per year in 2019. The proportion of people prescribed all anti-asthma medications (ICS, LTRA, and LABA) increased over time.The prevalence of adult asthma among Japanese salaried employees and their dependents has increased over the last 20 years, suggesting more attention should be paid to the prevention of this disease in adults.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common disease of the nasal cavity and is classified into two major endotypes, which are neutrophilic and eosinophilic. Some patients with neutrophilic and eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis are refractory to treatment, and the mechanism of drug resistance is not completely understood.Nasal polyp samples were collected from patients with non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (nECRS) and eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS). Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were performed simultaneously. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was conducted to extract genes involved in drug resistance. Then, GO analysis results were validated via real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analysis.The nasal polyps of patients with ECRS were enriched with 110 factors in the genes and 112 in the proteins, unlike in those of patients with nECRS. GO analysis on the combined results of both showed that the factors involved in extracellular transportation were enriched. Our analysis focused on multidrug resistance protein 1-5 (MRP1-5). Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that the MRP4 expression was significantly upregulated in ECRS polyps. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the MRP3 and MRP4 expressions significantly increased in nECRS and ECRS, respectively. MRP3 and MRP4 expressions were positively correlated with the number of neutrophil and eosinophil infiltrates in polyps and associated with the tendency to relapse in patients with ECRS.MRP is associated with treatment resistance and is expressed in nasal polyps. The expression pattern had different features based on chronic rhinosinusitis endotype. Therefore, drug resistance factors can be associated with therapeutic outcomes.",

However, the role of regulation of CYP27A1- 27-HC axis in asthma is unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the contribution of the axis to the pathophysiology of asthma. House dust mite (HDM) extract was intranasally administered to C57BL/6 mice and the expression of CYP27A1 in the airways was analyzed by immunostaining. The effect of pre-treatment with PBS or CYP27A1 inhibitors on the cell fraction in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed in the murine model. In vitro, BEAS-2B cells were treated with HDM and the levels of CYP27A1 expression were examined. Furthermore, the effect of 27-HC on the expressions of E-cadherin and ZO-1 in the cells was analyzed. The amounts of RANTES and eotaxin from the 27-HC-treated cells were analyzed by ELISA. The administration of HDM increased the expression of CYP27A1 in the airways of mice as well as the number of eosinophils in the BALF. CYP27A1 inhibitors ameliorated the HDM-induced increase in the number of eosinophils in the BALF. Treatment with HDM increased the expression of CYP27A1 in BEAS-2B cells. The administration of 27-HC to BEAS-2B cells suppressed the expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1, and augmented the production of RANTES and eotaxin. The results of this study suggest that aeroallergen could enhance the induction of CYP27A1, leading to allergic airway inflammation and disruption of the airway epithelial tight junction through 27-HC production.",

    "abstract": "Human basophils promote IgE-dependent oral allergen-induced anaphylaxis in humanized mice Dear Editor, Food-induced anaphylaxis (FIA) is a life-threatening immediate and systemic hypersensitivity reaction caused mainly by an IgE-mediated response to a food antigen.The systemic anaphylactic reaction causes hypothermia and affects the functions of multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal, cutaneous, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems.Mast cells (MCs) and basophils express the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) that transmits activating signals when an IgE-antigen complex cross-links FcεRI.After the activation, MCs release pre-formed and newly synthesized mediators such as histamine and platelet-activating factor (PAF), which correlate with the severity of FIA.The role of MCs in FIA has been demonstrated using several MCs-deficient mouse models, and the absence of MCs ameliorated systemic anaphylaxis.However, these studies required the parenteral or repeated oral allergen challenge to elicit systemic anaphylaxis. 1 On the other hand, even though the basophils activation test, an in vitro assay stimulating basophils with a food allergen, helps diagnose food allergy, the role of human basophils in the effector phase of FIA is less characterized than that of MCs. 2 To address whether human basophils are involved in the pathogenesis of FIA induced by a single oral challenge with an allergen, we established an FIA model using NOD.Cg-prkdc scid il2rg tm1Sug / ShiJic (NOG)-transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing human IL-3 and GM-CSF under the control of SRa promoter (NOG-EXL) (In-Vivo Science, Tokyo, Japan).These mice were transplanted with human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34 þ hematopoietic stem cells (huNOG-EXL mice).In the huNOG-EXL mice, human CD34 þ hematopoietic stem cells give rise to differentiation into human myeloid cells, including MCs and basophils. 3A previous report demonstrated that although passive IgE-mediated cutaneous and systemic anaphylaxis can be established by the intravenous challenge of a monovalent allergen in huNOG-EXL mice, these mice showed incomplete development of oral allergen-induced anaphylaxis. 4We hypothesized that challenging a monovalent antigen is weak to stimulate FcεRI signaling in MCs or basophils required to elicit oral allergen-induced anaphylaxis.Therefore,",

    "abstract": "Maintaining good asthma control minimizes the risk of exacerbations and lung function decline and is a primary goal of asthma management. The Japanese Pediatric Asthma Guidelines (JPGL) employs different classification criteria for control status from other guidelines, stressing a higher level of control. Based on JPGL, we previously developed a caregiver-completed questionnaire for assessing and achieving best asthma control in preschoolers. In this study, we aimed to develop a questionnaire for school-age children and adolescents. A working questionnaire comprising 14 items for patients and 34 items for caregivers was administered to 362 asthma patients aged 6–15 years and their caregivers. Separately, physicians filled out a questionnaire to determine JPGL-defined control. Logistic regression analysis was performed to construct a model to predict control levels using data from a randomly selected set of completed questionnaires from two-thirds of the subjects. Validation was performed using the remaining questionnaires. A set of 7 questions, encompassing self-assessed control status at the time of the visit and in the past month, and nocturnal/early morning asthma symptoms for patients and frequency of asthma symptoms, dyspnea, rescue beta-agonist use, and asthma hospitalization for caregivers, were selected and the 7-item model showed a good statistical fit with AIC of 110.5. The model has been named the Best Asthma Control Test for School Children and Adolescents (Best ACT-S). Best ACT-S scores differed significantly in the hypothetical direction among the groups of different JPGL-defined control levels, step-up/down treatment decisions, and presence/non-presence of exacerbations in the previous year. The Best ACT-S is a valid questionnaire for children/adolescents aiming for best asthma control.",

    "abstract": "Intraepithelial γδ T cells appear to be an essential regulatory T cell subset for the induction and regulation of humoral and cellular immune responses in the mucosa-associated tissues. These cells form a mucosal internet and intranet with epithelial cells which lead to a reciprocal regulation for activation and cell growth. Removal of the TORS gene (γδ-/- mice) results in a reduction of epithelial cell turnover and downregulates the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are capable of producing interleukin (IL)-7 and stem cell factor which can activate mucosal γδ T cells expressing IL-7R and c-kit. Further, cell surface immunoregulatory molecules expressed on epithelial cells inhibit the proliferation and cytokine synthesis of γδ T cells stimulated via the TOR-OD3 complex. Thus, direct cell-to-cell interactions between mucosal γδ T cells and epithelial cells occur via their secreted cytokines and their cell surface immunoregulatory molecules to maintain the homeostatic regulation of the mucosal immune system. γδ-/- mice possess significantly lower numbers of immunoglobulin A (IgA) producing cells in mucosa- associated tissues, including intestinal lamina propria and salivary glands, when compared with normal control mice. Furthermore, the levels of antigen- specific IgA B cell responses in γδ-/- mice decreased when they were immunized orally. Mucosal γδ T cells possess an ability to maintain an IgA response in the presence of systemic tolerance. These results clearly indicate that γδ T cells play an important role in the regulation of antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses. Taken together, a triad mucosal lymphocytes intranet which connects among γδ T cells, αβ T cells and IgA B cells is necessary for the induction and regulation of IgA antibody responses in mucosal areas.",

    "abstract": "Human IgE synthesis is largely dependent on the production of interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13 and the expression of CD40 ligand. Such B cell help is not only provided by CD4+ T cells, but also by CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells, mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. The IL-4 receptor a chain (IL-4Ra) expressed on B cells is shared by the functional IL-4R and IL-13R and is a crucial component required for signal transduction leading to germline Ce transcription, which is a prerequisite for IgE isotype switching. Interleukin-4 activates Janus kinase (JAK)1, JAK3 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and, subsequently, induces nuclear translocation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)6 and nuclear factor (NF)-kB, which interact at the level of the Iε promoter. The two variants of the IL-4Rα, which have been identified in association with atopy, are associated with enhanced responsiveness to IL-4. Ligation of CD40 on B cells up-regulates IL-4- or IL-13-driven germline Cε transcription and further induces deletional switch recombination that results in IgE isotype switching, mature Cε transcription and IgE synthesis. Signaling pathways mediated by CD40 include activation of Lyn, PI3-K, JAK3 and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase subfamily, multimerization of tumor necrosis factor-a receptor-associated factor (TRAF)2, TRAF3, TRAF5 and TRAF6 and translocation of NF-kB and STAT3. In addition, Ku70/86, DNA-dependent protein kinase and rad51/54 may be involved in switch recombination. Taken together, activation of kinases, induction of second messengers, nuclear expression of transcription factors and localization of DNA-binding proteins are integrated to produce the terminal differentiation of a B cell into an IgE-secreting plasma cell. Elucidation of the detailed mechanisms of IgE isotype switching will contribute to the development of potential new therapeutic procedures for the regulation of the IgE response in atopic patients.",

The medication requirements, peak expiratory flow (PEF) circadian variations, forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of the vital capacity (FEF25-75), maximal expiratory flow at 50 and 25% vital capacity (V50 and V25), and specific airway resistance (SRaw) were evaluated over a 3-year period in patients treated with IT. When compared with the results for control asthmatic patients who had not been treated with IT, statistically significant amelioration regarding the PEF circadian variations, %FEF25-75, %V50and %V25was observed in IT-treated patients during the study. Although the improvement for medication requirement during the study was not different statistically between the two groups, we concluded that long-term house dust IT may result in amelioration of pulmonary functions, which may account for its clinical effectiveness in the treatment of asthmatic patients.",

The aim of this study was to assess changes in endogenous corticosteroid and catecholamine levels in allergic eosinophilic inflammation in rats, using metabolic cages. Brown Norway rats (female, 6 weeks old) were sensitized with intraperitoneal injections of ovalbumin on days 0 and 2 and challenged with either an aerosol of ovalbumin or saline for 30 min on day 21. Levels of urinary 11- hydroxycorticosteroid (OHCS), a primary metabolite of corticosterone; epinephrine and norepinephrine were determined in pooled samples taken 0–24 h before and 8–32 h after the challenge. Serum adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosterone levels and cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were assessed 32–36 h after the challenge, as well as lung eosinophil peroxidase activity, an indirect index of eosinophil infiltration. The numbers of total cells and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung eosinophil peroxidase activity were significantly increased in the ovalbumin-challenged rats compared with the saline-challenged rats. While urinary OHCS and serum corticosterone levels were significantly increased after challenge in the ovalbumin-challenged rats, compared with the saline-challenged rats (2.1 ± 0.1 × 10− 1 vs 1.7 ± 0.1 x 10− 1 mg/g creatinine, P < 0.05 and 482 ± 49 vs 348 ± 19 ng/mL, P < 0.02, respectively), serum adrenocorticotropic hormone levels did not differ between the two groups. Urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion also did not differ between the two groups. It is concluded that endogenous corticosterone, but not catecholamine, increases as a pathophysiologic adrenal response, possibly to protect lung during allergic eosinophilic inflammation.",

It is essential to survey the pollen and mold around the patient's environment for the diagnosis and treatment of airborne allergy. Rotorod samplers were installed at well-ventilated places in seven collecting stations in Seoul, the capital of Korea, which has a population of 12 million. Airborne particles carrying allergens were collected daily from each station for 2 years (1 October 1995 to 30 September 1997). After being stained with Calberla's fuchsin, they were identified, counted and recorded. The weather in Seoul was also recorded. Pollen was found from the middle of February through to the end of December. The peak date for pollen was 12 May (peak mean daily count: 701 grains/m3/day) and for mold it was 23 June (peak mean daily count: 936 spores/m3/day). Alder, birch, pine, oak, maple, elm, juniper, willow, and gingko trees were prevalent during the tree season, lasting from the middle of February to late July. Then sagebrush, ragweed, Japanese hop, and pigweed followed during the weed season, which lasts from the middle of July to the end of December. In skin prick test results, house dust mite was the most common positive allergen in Seoul, followed by cockroach. Among the pollens, mugwort was the most common positive, followed by ragweed mix, alder, birch, and grasses mix. Among the molds, there were high counts of Cladosporium and Alternaria during the year, excluding January. Ascospore of Leptospheria was highest during the monsoon season.",

In the present study, we investigated the inflammatory factors in the HM1-activated macrophage in both non-immunized splenocytes and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from mite-immunized and HM1-exposed mice. Dermatophagoides farinae feces (Dff) extract was divided into HM1 and HM1-depleted fraction (DH) by size-exclusion chromatography. Transcriptional gene induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-12 and cytokine-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in splenic macrophages stimulated with HM1 or DH was analyzed by using semiquantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Nitric oxide (NO) production was measured by using diaminofluoresceins (DAF), fluorescence indicators. Gene expression of TNF-α, IL-12 p40 and iNOS was observed with HM1 stimulation of splenic macrophages from non-immunized mice. In addition, the release of NO induced by HM1-stimulated splenic macrophages increased in a dose-dependent manner. However, splenic macrophages stimulated with DH induced TNF-α and IL-12 p40, but not iNOS, gene expression. Similarly, significant iNOS mRNA expression was detected in alveolar macrophages recovered from HM1-exposed mice, but not from DH-exposed mice. In the present study, HM1 induced iNOS mRNA expression and NO production both in vitro and in vivo. The present results suggest that the ability of HM1 to induce NO production may be one of the causes aggravating airway inflammation in HM1-exposed mice.",

To investigate the role of IL-4 in the development of antigen-induced airway inflammation and BHR, we used two different inbred IL-4 gene-knockout mice; one was BALB/c, which is known to be a high IgE responder, and the other was C57BL/6, known to be a low IgE responder and a lower responder to acetylcholine (ACh) in the airways. Mice were immunized with antigen at intervals of 12 days. Starting 10 days after the second immunization, mice were exposed to antigen three times every fourth day. Twenty-four hours after the last antigen challenge, bronchial responsiveness to ACh was measured and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. In sensitized BALB/c mice, repeated aeroallergen challenge induced dramatic eosinophilia in the airways and severe increases in bronchial responsiveness to intravenous ACh, along with increases in serum antigen-specific IgE. In contrast, immunized C57BL/6 mice, after antigen provocation, developed a minor influx of eosinophils into the airways and only moderate increases in bronchial responsiveness without antigen-specific IgE in serum, indicating that the genetic background influenced not only IgE synthesis, but also the degree of airway inflammation and BHR. Moreover, disruption of the IL-4 gene in both strains of mice abolished allergen-induced BHR, airway eosinophilia and IgE response. Together, these findings suggest that the differences in genetic background can directly influence the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma, including the role of IgE, and that IL-4 has a crucial role in the development of allergen-induced BHR independent of genetic background.",

    "abstract": "It is a well-known fact that IgE is a key substance that induces an allergic reaction in extravascular tissue. However, it remains to be elucidated how IgE in the circulating blood transfers to the site of the allergic reaction in the extravascular tissue. In the present paper, rat IgE passage through cultured rat aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) was first examined using a dual-chamber system. Second, we examined the effects of histamine, which is thought to affect endothelial permeability, on IgE passage through the RAEC in comparison with the effects of albumin and IgG2a. The permeability constant (PC) was used to evaluate the degree of IgE passage through the RAEC. The value of the PC for rat IgE (0.58 ± 0.11 x 10− 5cm/s) was lower than that for IgG2a and albumin (0.88 ± 0.28 x 10− 5 and 0.93 ± 0.26 x 10− 5 cm/s, respectively) under conditions of non-exposure to histamine. In contrast, the PC of rat IgE was significantly increased by exposure to histamine (10− 10 mol/L) at 12 h after exposure. However, the PC for IgG2a and albumin were not significantly increased following exposure to histamine. The enhancement by histamine of IgE passage through the RAEC was not inhibited by diphenhydramine, a histamine H receptor antagonist, but were inhibited by cimetidine, a histamine H2 receptor antagonist. On the basis of results from the present study, histamine, acting via H2 receptors, enhances the permeability of rat IgE across the RAEC monolayer. The increased permeability of endothelial cells induced by histamine may contribute greatly to the transfer of IgE from circulating blood to extravascular tissue.",

Interstitial pneumonia and, rarely, exacerbation of bronchial asthma have been reported as adverse pulmonary effects of IFN-α treatment. The purpose of the present study was to clarify whether IFN-α treatment affects pulmonary function and airway responsiveness in patients with chronic hepatitis C. We studied 17 patients (nine males and eight females; mean age 46 years; range 30–62 years) with chronic active hepatitis C diagnosed by serum tests and liver biopsy. Pulmonary function tests included vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced expiratory flow in the middle half of the forced vital capacity (FVC25–75%), total lung capacity and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lung (DLCO), which was adjusted for hemoglobin concentration. Airway responsiveness was measured by methacholine inhalation challenge and determination of the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). These tests were performed before and 3 months after initiation of IFN-α therapy. No patient developed interstitial pneumonia, although there was a tendency for the hemoglobin-adjusted DLCO to decrease. Other pulmonary function test parameters were not affected. Overall, there was no significant change in PC20 (from 15.0 to 11.4 mg/mL). In three patients whose initial PC20 was within the normal range, airway hyperresponsiveness was induced and one patient developed bronchial asthma after IFN-α therapy. These findings suggest that IFN-α induces airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in a few patients with chronic hepatitis C.",

The aim of the present study was to determine whether AMP could be used in a dose–response manner to evaluate nasal function and to evaluate the reproducibility of nasal function measurements with nasal challenge testing using histamine and AMP in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. Methods: Nine patients were challenged on three separate occasions for each challenge with doubling doses of either histamine (0.25–8 mg/mL) or AMP (25–800 mg/mL). Challenge measurements were made of peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR), acoustic rhinometry (AR) and rhinomanometry (Rhino). The provocation concentration (PC30) was calculated in order to produce: (i) a 30% fall in PIFR; (ii) a 30% fall in AR and (iii) a 30% increase in nasal airway resistance in Rhino and a symptom score of 10 (of 40). The mean intrasubject coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for baseline and the corresponding PC. Results: Baseline CV prior to histamine were 15.1, 19.6 and 15.8 for PIFR, AR and Rhino, respectively; prior to AMP, baseline CV were 12.7, 19.6 and 10.6% for PIFR, AR and Rhino, respectively. For histamine challenge, the PC30 were 26.5, 27.4 and 38.7% for PIFR, AR and Rhino, respectively. For AMP challenge, the PC30 CV values were 46.2, 30.8 and 49.5% for PIFR, AR and Rhino, respectively. There was no significant difference in the provocative dose required to cause a predetermined change in response or the response at 1 mg/mL histamine and 100 mg/mL AMP. Conclusions: Adenosine monophosphate may be used as a challenge agent for nasal challenge testing, although it results in greater variability than histamine.",

    "abstract": "This is the first report about the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pranlukast in children. The aim of the present study was to assess the PK parameters of pranlukast in children and to compare them with those in adults. Six healthy adult male volunteers and 22 children with bronchial asthma at 3–14 years of age were enrolled in the study. Both 225 and 112.5 mg pranlukast hydrate dry syrup was administered orally to adults, whereas 3.5 mg/kg pranlukast hydrate dry syrup was given to children. Blood samples were obtained at approximately 20 time points per adult (n = 121) and at two or three time points per child (n = 54). Population PK analysis was performed using NONMEM (Globomax, Hanover, MD, USA). The concentration-time-course of pranlukast was described by using a one-compartment model with first-order absorption. The robustness of the final model was evaluated using 200 bootstrap samples. Apparent clearance (CL/F) was 1.81 and 1.14 L/h per kg in children and adults, respectively. According to subgrouping of children, no significant difference was observed in CL/F between infants (3–6 years of age) and schoolchildren (7–14 years of age). The interindividual variability of CL/F accounted for 48.7%. The additive and proportional residual variability was 7.33 ng/mL and 73.8%, respectively. All fixed effect parameters fell within 10% of the bootstrapped mean. Compared with adults, children showed a higher CL/F and more rapid elimination after ingestion of pranlukast hydrate dry syrup. However, no significant variation was seen in CL/F between infants and schoolchildren.",

    "abstract": "There is a major problem from asthma in Japan due to its high prevalence, morbidity, economic cost and mortality. The striking feature of the time trends in asthma mortality in Japan is the two epidemics of asthma mortality in young people that occurred at the same time as similar epidemics in a number of other countries. These epidemics are likely to be due, at least in part, to the overuse of specific β-adrenergic receptor agonist drugs, namely isoprenaline and fenoterol. Following recent warnings by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare against the use of fenoterol and the resulting reduction in fenoterol sales, together with other changes in management consistent with the recommendations of the Japanese Asthma Guidelines, the asthma mortality rate has again fallen in Japan. However, Japan still has case fatality rates that are disproportionately greater than those in other countries. One approach that can be taken to reduce the high asthma mortality rate in Japan is to develop and implement a community based asthma self-management plan system of care whereby patients are provided with a practical system by which they can assess the severity of their asthma, a treatment regimen for both long-term therapy and management of a severe attack, and written guidelines provided by their medical practitioners in which assessment and treatment are integrated in a simple format. In controlled studies, this management approach has been shown not only to markedly reduce asthma mortality, in terms of reduction in hospital admissions and nocturnal wakening, but also to markedly reduce mortality from asthma. The Japanese Asthma Guidelines have advocated this approach, which is referred to as the 'asthma management zone system'. Through implementation of this system of care, together with other management initiatives, it is likely that the mortality rate from asthma will fall further over forthcoming years.",

Its afforestation area today has reached 4.5 million hectares, making up 45% of the afforestation area in Japan. Cryptomeria japonica pollinosis was first reported in 1964. The prevalence of this disease has increased yearly and now affects over 10% of the Japanease population. In order to establish an accurate prediction method of airborne pollen counts for C. japonica, research into the relationship between the amount of airborne pollen, the distribution of C. japonica forests and flowering conditions has become very important. In order to clarify differences in airborne pollen counts at different altitudes, four gravity samplers (Durham's type) were set up at four observation points that were located from the coast to the side of a mountain up to 780 m altitude in Toyama Prefecture, Japan. The male flowering index and distribution of C. japonica forests were determined in order to evaluate the quantity of male flowers. The relationship between airborne pollen counts, the distribution of C. japonica forests and the male flowering index at each observation point was examined. There was a high positive correlation between the male flowering index of C. japonica and airborne pollen counts. The male flowering indices, as well as the distribution of C. japonica forests at different altitudes, were closely associated with airborne pollen counts at different altitudinal observation points. The flowering index and the distribution of C. japonica forests are useful indicators for the accurate prediction airborne pollen counts of C. japonica.",

However, in asthma in the elderly, there are cases where physicians hesitate to introduce the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy based on the diagnosis that the use of inhalants is difficult due to the existence of a functional lesion accompanying asthma. In cases where self-administrated inhalation therapy is difficult to execute due to the accompaniment of a functional lesion and in cases where sufficient curative effects of steroids are not produced in self-inhalation, administration of assisted inhalation resulted in improvement of clinical symptoms and pulmonary function and was proven effective.

We examined the effects of BUD/FORM inhalation, endotoxin injection, and BUD/FORM inhalation plus endotoxin injection on diaphragm contractile properties and nitric oxide (NO) production. After these three treatments, the diaphragm muscle was dissected, and its contractile properties were measured. Histochemistry for the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase was performed for each muscle to assess NO production. The force-frequency curves showed an upward shift 1 h after inhalation (p < 0.05) in the BUD/FORM inhalation only group. The force-frequency curves showed a downward shift 4 h after injection (p < 0.001) in the endotoxin injection groups. In the BUD/FORM inhalation plus endotoxin injection groups, a downward shift in the force-frequency curves at 4 h after endotoxin injection was prevented. NO production was inhibited in the BUD/FORM inhalation plus endotoxin injection group compared with that of the endotoxin injection only groups. BUD/FORM inhalation has an inotropic effect on diaphragm muscle, protects diaphragm muscle deterioration after endotoxin injection, and inhibits NO production. Increments in muscle contractility with BUD/FORM inhalation are induced through a synergistic effect of an anti-inflammatory agent and 02-agonist.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis is one pathogenesis of allergic airway disease. potent angiogenic factor is platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), also known as thymidine phosphorylase (TP) in the field of cancer-associated research. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is another representative angiogenic factor. Both factors were added to the culture system of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with IL-4 and anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Total IgE levels in the supernatants and signal transduction of stimulated PBMC were evaluated. Addition of PD-ECGF enhances in vitro IgE production by PBMC in the presence of IL-4 and anti- CD40 mAb, but VEGF does not enhance IgE production. Although PD-ECGF catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of thymidine to 2-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate (2DDR), treatment of 2DDR has no effect on IgE production by human PBMC. Both IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb induce PD-ECGF by human PBMC. Thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI), 5-chloro-6-[1- (2-iminopyrrolidinyl) methyl] uracil hydrochloride reduce IgE production via blocking of STAT6- phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest TP involvement in the enhancement of IgE production and suggest that TPI is a novel strategy against IgE-related allergic disease.",

This will be discussed in light of the controversy of the potential adverse effect of regular use of long-acting β-agonists. We studied the effect of formoterol on the late asthmatic response (LAR) and airway inflammation in guinea-pigs. Formoterol suppressed the LAR, antigen-induced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, although isoproterenol failed to inhibit these parameters. β-Adrenergic hyporesponsiveness, and cholinergic and a- adrenergic hyperresponsiveness have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. A decrease in β-adrenoreceptor function can result either from exogenously administered β-agonist or from exposure to allergens resulting in a late bronchial reaction. There is increasing evidence that eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes which are of primary importance in the late bronchial reaction are also modulated by β2- adrenoreceptors. In functional studies of guinea-pig or human isolated trachea and lung parenchyma, PAF and certain cytokines significantly reduced the potency of isoproterenol to reverse methacholine- or histamine-induced contraction. The effect of glucocorticoids on pulmonary β-adrenergic receptors and responses suggests an important role for glucocorticoids to increase β-adrenergic receptors and responsiveness.",

Responses to the questionnaire on the diagnosis, patient education and management of asthma indicated that a reduced number of patients with severe asthma were seen in 1993 in both Pediatric and Internal Medicine Departments compared with 5 years before, despite the increase in total number of asthma patients in Japan. Specifiic IgE radioallergosorbent test (RAST) measurements were frequently performed instead of skin testing for diagnosis, and eosinophil count and bronchodilator response served as an adjunct to the diagnosis. Patients were frequently asked detailed questions about aspirin-induced asthma, which accounted for 8.8, 2.2 and 1.5% of patients with asthma in the adult, schoolchildren (6–16 years) and infant (≤ 5 years) groups, respectively. In achieving ‘control of asthma’, first priority was given to coping with the symptoms in children aged 5 years or less and to enabling routine daily life activities in patients 6 years of age or older. Usefulness of peak flow measurements was widely recognized and a detailed plan for allergen avoidance (house dust) was often given to patients.",

For the prevention of death from asthma, it is essential to study the risk factors. However, there has been almost no such study performed in Japan and, for this reason, we performed the present study to elucidate the background of the recent cases of death from asthma. This study was performed on cases of death from asthma at the Tokyo Medical Examiner’s Office over a period of 5 years (1993-1997). There were 456 cases under study, with the age at death ranging from 4 to 96 years (average age 58.5 years). The male to female ratio was 1.8:1 and there was a tendency for a marked increase in the number of cases of death from asthma in women aged 60 years and older. The annual number of deaths was lowest in 1997, being 67 cases. The monthly number of deaths was higher in December and February and was lower in the months of June, July and September. Among the cases investigated, 60.2% died within 3 h after the onset of an asthmatic attack. In the cases of patients living alone, the chance of receiving emergency medical care was significantly lower compared with cases where patients lived with other people. Of the cases of death from asthma, 36.6% of patients were in the habit of drinking and 27.7% smoked. In an investigation of the 247 deaths that occurred during the 3 year period from 1995 to 1997, there were 140 cases (56.7%) for which emergency medical care was offered to treat the asthmatic attack. In 126 cases (90.0%), cardiopulmonary arrest was observed on arrival at hospital. Of these cases, a heart beat was restored in 27 patients (21.4%). In 133 of 456 deaths (29.2%), patients had used a metered dose inhaler (MDI). Among these cases, 80 patients (60.2%) seemed to have been using a MDI up to the time immediately before death. Those living alone have a significantly lower likelihood of receiving emergency medical care immediately before death compared with those living with other people. The cases of acute death within 3 h after the onset of the asthma attack accounted for 60.2% of all cases and this seems to be important for future studies of the medical care of deaths due to asthma.",

Two serum samples were taken, one before the start of therapy and one between 12 and 15 weeks after the first immunization. Immunotherapy was performed with two allergy vaccines comprising a standardized extract aluminum-adsorbed grass pollen mix and a standardized extract of grass pollen mix adsorbed onto calcium phosphate. One treated patient showed a specific IgE conversion from negative (< 0.35 kUA/L) to positive in the capsulated hydrophilic carrier polymer (CAP) test for Phl p 2, 1 and 4 (1.89, 0.84 and 0.68 kUA/L, respectively). The sera of 10 of 11 patients treated with alluminum-adsorbed grass pollen extract showed a significant increase in specific IgG4 towards natural Timothy grass pollen extract and purified allergens, as well as significant IgG4 levels towards Phl p 1 (P = 0.000238) Phl p 2 (P = 0.000289), Phl p 4 (P = 0.000585), Phl p 5 (P = 0.000364), Phl p 6 (P = 0.000346) and Phl p 11 (P = 0.039623; Mann–Whitney U-test) 12 weeks after the onset of immunotherapy. The sera of seven of 11 subjects treated with calcium phospate-adsorbed grass pollen extract had significant IgG4 levels against Timothy pollen allergens, as well as significant IgG4 titers against Phl p 1 (P = 0.004703), Phl p 4 (P = 0.000282), Phl p 5 (P = 0.015480), Phl p 6 (P = 0.013012) and Phl p 11 (P = 0.005178).

Both the alluminum-adsorbed and calcium phosphate-adsorbed grass pollen extract allergy vaccines induced significant titers of specific IgG4 towards Phleum pratense pollen extract (P = 0.008376 and 0.01148, respectively). These results indicate that grass pollen immunotherapy elicits an array of antibody specificities that reflect the allergen content and the potency of allergen extracts; this could be of pivotal importance to define optimal allergen extract doses.",

Clinical improvement is accompanied by a reduction in nasal mucosal eosinophils, although the mechanism is unknown. Nasal biopsies were taken from 37 adults before immunotherapy and during the peak pollen season following 2 years treatment. Biopsies were processed for immunohistochemistry for CCR3, adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1) and apoptotic cells (terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP–digoxigenin nick end-labeling; TUNEL), as well as for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 mRNA-positive cells. Results were compared with eosinophil numbers in the nasal mucosa. Analysis of the clinical data confirmed that the proportion of patients who showed greater than 60% improvement in symptoms (47 and 15%) and in rescue medication (79 and 10%) were significant for the immunotherapy group compared with placebo group (P < 0.03 and P < 0.02, respectively). Seasonal increases were observed for VCAM-1 expression (P = 0.05) and IL-13 mRNA-expressing cells (P < 0.05) in the placebo group, but not in the immunotherapy group. The differences for VCAM-1 expression achieved significance between groups (P = 0.05). There was no significant difference in either ICAM-1 expression or in the number of CCR3 + cells, TUNEL + apoptotic cells and IL-4 mRNA-expressing cells. Successful grass pollen immunotherapy was associated with inhibition of seasonal increases in nasal eosinophils, IL-13 mRNA-expressing cells and VCAM-1 expression, but no change in CCR3 expression or in the number of apoptotic cells. The reduction in eosinophils after immunotherapy may be due to suppression of eosinophil recruitment to the nasal mucosa rather than enhanced apoptosis.",

This study clinically evaluated whether its easy handling and inhalation process were affected by the aging factor or not, compared with those of the FP Diskhaler® and Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP). Twenty-four elderly patients with stable moderate asthma (12 aged 65-74 years and 12 aged 75 years or older) who were accustomed to using the Diskhaler® were evaluated by measuring the required time for finishing one-time inhalation with the device, compared with 7 patients aged less than 65. Ten elderly patients (5 aged 65-74 years, and 5 aged 75 years or older), who used the BDP, were also similarly evaluated and compared with 8 patients aged less than 65. All subjects then switched to use with the Diskus® and the required time for finishing one-time inhalation was measured soon after and 2 weeks after the change. The patients' usage impressions were also questioned. The mean required times (seconds) were significantly different between patients aged 75 years or older, and with patients less than 65 years of age; 45.8 ± 8.1 vs. 31.8 ± 12.3 (p = 0.046) in the BDP group, and 56.8 ± 25.3 vs. 33.3 ± 18.5 (p = 0.047) in the Diskhaler®, respectively. Soon after changing to the Diskus®, those times became insignificant in both groups. After 2 weeks, the required time for using the Diskus® was significantly shortened in all age groups. 50.0% patients in the BDP group and 79.2% in the Diskhaler® group finally chose the Diskus®. The FP Diskus® inhalation was not affected by the aging factor and all patients could quickly get accustomed to using it, suggesting its clinical efficacy for older patients.",

    "abstract": "Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy is a mainstay of bronchial asthma management. Many clinical studies have indicated that an early start with higher doses of ICS contributes to a better prognosis for asthmatic patients, with improved pulmonary functions, airway hyperresponsiveness and quality of life. The current asthma guidelines suggest that once control is achieved, the dose of ICS should be reduced (stepped down) to the minimal level required to control the disease. The rationale for stepping down the dose includes: 1) minimizing adverse effects, 2) contributing to a precise determination of disease severity and 3) achieving better compliance with the therapeutic regimen. However, a one-time reduction in the ICS dose of over 50% results in a high exacerbation rate (50-78%), and predictive markers for the step-down have not yet been established. Leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or inhaled long acting 02-stimulant (LABA) have led to successful step-down among patients who require a high dose of ICS to control their condition. When asthma becomes less controllable and thus requires a step-up of therapy, adding LTRA, LABA or theophylline (still a good choice in terms of cost effectiveness) results in better control than doubling the dose of ICS. However, stepwise management is mainly applied to patients with mild to moderate asthma. Severe asthma pathophysiologically differs from mild to moderate asthma and problems in applying stepwise management remain unresolved. Thus, efforts must be targeted towards developing more effective therapeutic strategies with which to manage all types of asthma.",

An increase of mirovillous cells, squamous metaplasia, and goblet cells is observed in many patients with chronic sinusitis. The decreased ciliary area increases postoperatively in the maxillary ostium and in the maxillary sinus. There is no significant difference in the number of goblet cells between normal controls and chronic sinusitis. On the other hand, the number of submucosal acinar cells in chronic sinusitis is significantly higher than that in normal controls. Nasal polyps show a diversity of histogical findings. Although squamous metaplasia and goblet cells hypertrophy is observed in many patients, epithelial shedding, which is characteristic of asthma, is not observed in nasal polyps. The most striking finding of glands in nasal polyps is long shape. Histochemical analysis reveals deposition of types I, III, and V collagens in nasal polyps. Myofibroblasts, which are abundant in nasal polyps but rare in nasal mucosa, could be involved in the growth process of nasal polyps by inducing extracellular matrix accumulation. Although accumulation of extracellular matrix is a main feature of nasal polyps, its pathogenesis is not clearly known.",

The precise mechanisms responsible for the rhinovirus infection-induced exacerbations of bronchial asthma remain uncertain. However, several reports have demonstrated airway hyperresponsiveness, increases in chemical mediators in airway secretions, such as kinin and histamine, and airway inflammation in patients with bronchial asthma after rhinovirus infection. Rhinovirus infection induces the accumulation of inflammatory cells in airway mucosa and submucosa, including neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils. Rhinovirus affects the barrier function of airway epithelial cells and activates airway epithelial cells and other cells in the lung to produce proinflammatory cytokines, including various types of interleukins, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and RANTES, and histamine. Rhinovirus also stimulates the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and low-density lipoprotein receptors in the airway epithelium, receptors for major and minor rhinoviruses. Rhinovirus infection is inhibited by treatment with soluble ICAM-1 and by the reduction of ICAM-1 expression in airway epithelial cells after treatment with either glucocorticoid or erythromycin. Both soluble ICAM-1 and erythromycin have been reported to reduce the symptoms of common colds. Herein, we review the pathogenesis and management of rhinovirus infection-induced exacerbation of bronchial asthma and the relationship between rhinovirus infection and airway allergy.",

Methods: We challenged wild-type and IL-6-deficient mice with ovalbumin (OVA) inhalation after sensitization to OVA. Results: OVA challenge induced an intrapulmonary eosinophil infiltration and airway hyperresponsiveness in wild-type mice with increased serum IgE levels and enhanced intrapulmonary mRNA expression of T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines, IL-5 and IL-13. IL-6-deficient mice developed a similar level of airway hyperresponsiveness despite an attenuated eosinophil infiltration and reduced elevation in serum IgE levels after oVa challenge. After OVA challenge, intrapulmonary IL-5 and IL-13 mRNA expression was less evident in IL-6-deficient mice than wild-type mice, while intrapulmonary IFN-y mRNA expression was more enhanced. Intravenous administration of anti-IL-6 antibodies during sensitization period in wild-type mice caused similar effects as observed in IL-6 deficient mice.

Environmental estrogens or endocrine disruptors are possibly involved in the etiology of the increase in autoimmune diseases as one of environmental factors. In aged BWF1 mice, a murine model for SLE, B lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC/CXCL13) is ectopically and highly expressed in target organs such as the thymus and kidney. B1 cells, a specialized cell population that are distinguished from conventional B cells (B2 cells) by their origin, cell surface phenotype, unique tissue distribution, self-reactivity, etc., preferentially migrate towards BLC. Aberrant B1 cell trafficking to the target organs may result in activation of autoreactive CD4 T cells, autoantibody production, and impaired mucosal immunity in the gut during the development of SLE. Interestingly, B1 cells show a higher sensitivity to environmental estrogens than conventional B (B2) cells to produce autoantibodies. Thus, B1 cell can be a useful target for evaluating the pathological significance of environmental estrogens in the development of autoimmune diseases.",

Among these T lymphocytes, Th2 cells are involved in the regulation of the IgE immune response and local allergic inflammation, which underlie allergic diseases. Various cytokines produced and released by Th2 cells play important roles in the development of many allergic diseases, including asthma, and the exacerbations of their disease states. Therefore, targeting of Th2 cell-derived cytokines is a rational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of asthma. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents can potently inhibit Th2 cytokine-mediated responses, but have no selectivity for Th2 cells: they also exert pharmacological activity against cells other than inflammatory cells, thereby potentially causing adverse side-effects. However, suplatast tosilate is the only specific Th2 cytokine inhibitor that can be used clinically and it has been used widely in Japan as a maintenance drug in the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis. There is considerable evidence of the effectiveness of suplatast tosilate in patients with mild asthma or moderate persistent asthma. Furthermore, an effect on cough variant asthma and a steroid-sparing effect have also been reported for suplatast tosilate.",

A novel therapeutic approach that causes a Th1-dominant response under conditions of Th2-skewed immunity has been investigated. Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a widely used anti-tuberculosis vaccine that strongly induces a Th1-predominant immune response. A potential role for BCG in the treatment of allergic diseases has been reported. In the present study, we investigated whether subcutaneous inoculation with a low dose (1 × 105) of BCG vaccine can attenuate allergic inflammation of the airway in a murine model of asthma. Female BALB/c mice were vaccinated on day 0 with a subcutaneous. injection of 1 × 105 CFU of BCG, and sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA, i.p., with alum) on day 7 and 14, respectively. After a 2-week interval, they were exposed to aerosolized OVA (1%). In another experiment, BCG-sensitized splenic CD4+ T cells were adoptively transferred before sensitization. We found that BCG-vaccinated mice had fewer eosinophils in BALF and less severe allergic inflammation. The expression of IL-4 as well as Eotaxin and TARC was down-regulated in the vaccinated mice, while that of both IL-12 and IFN-γ was up-regulated. Moreover, the transfer of splenic CD4+ T cells from vaccinated mice into naive mice before OVA-sensitization prevented the development of allergic inflammation. These splenic CD4+ T cells produced much IFN-γ. The subcutaneous administration of (low-dose) BCG vaccine suppressed allergic inflammation via Th1-skewed immunity and might have clinical applications in immunotherapy for asthma.",

CpG motifs that essentially work in an antigen-nonspecific fashion, however, turn into novel immunomodulators that can manipulate acquired immunity in an antigen-specific manner if oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODNs) are directly conjugated to the antigen. CpG ODNs with potent polyclonal Th1-inducing ability show promise for application in immunotherapy whereby neutralization of dominant allergy-prone Th2 cells is achieved by inducing allergen-specific Th1 cells. The underlying mechanisms include an unexpected enhancement of dendritic cell function as a linker between innate and acquired immunity. In the foreseeable future the mainstream therapeutic role of corticosteroids in anti-inflammatory therapy for allergic diseases could possibly be replaced by immunotherapy using CpG ODN-conjugated antigens.",

There are numerous disease-specific instruments that can be used for patients with asthma, such as Juniper et al.'s Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), the Living with Asthma Questionnaire (LWAQ), the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and Marks et al.'s Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). The characteristics of each instrument should be considered in the selection of specific HRQoL questionnaires for clinical research.

Urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) and 11-dehydro-TXB2 (11 DTXB2) levels are often used to assess the production of CysLTs and TXA2. However, few studies have examined the products of these two mediators in the same asthmatic patients. To define the potential roles of CysLTs and TXA2 in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma in children, their urinary levels were measured in the present study. Urinary LTE4 and 11DTXB2 levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA), respectively. Urine samples from asthmatic children were measured during the stable condition and during an acute attack. Urinary LTE4 levels during an acute attack (median 476 pg/mg creatinine; range 191–1100 pg/ mg creatinine) and during the stable condition (median 332 pg/mg creatinine; range 128–965 pg/ mg creatinine) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of controls (median 233 pg/mg creatinine; range 103–389 pg/mg creatinine). Urinary 11DTXB2 levels during an acute attack and during the stable condition (median 1666 (range 110–5105) and 1009 (range 46–6070) pg/mg creatinine, respectively) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of controls (median 252 pg/mg creatinine; range 41–716 pg/mg creatinine). Comparing different stages of asthma, LTE4 levels during an acute attack were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than during the stable condition; however, there was no difference in urinary TXB2 levels. The present findings suggest that high levels of CysLTs and TXA2 are associated with the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. The measurement of urinary LTE4 and 11DTXB2 would be useful in understanding the individual pathogenesis of asthmatic children.",

Since most asthma deaths take place at home it is mandatory to keep in mind that adequate management should be commenced as early as possible at home when a severe asthmatic attack develops especially in high-risk patients. For preventive care, the main objective should be to avoid severe hypoxemia with resultant cardiac arrest that may occur during severe asthmatic attacks at home and during transportation. A total of 97 patients were studied with near-fatal asthmatic attacks requiring mechanical ventilation at least once during the period from January 1979 to November 1993, these patients were seen at Okinawa Chubu Hospital and survived without significant morbidity. They were considered at high risk for recurrence of life-threatening asthmatic attacks and death and were therefore persuaded to undergo a trial of immediate self-oxygenation at home and during transportation to an emergency department whenever a severe attack developed. Only 61 patients agreed to our request. Among those who agreed to install home oxygen, 24 subsequently developed severe attacks requiring mechanical ventilation outside hospital during following 15 years. Sixteen of them immediately started oxygenation at home in addition to the anti-asthma medication, continuing the process all the way to emergency center; all survived. Eight Patients did not actually take their home oxygen and four of them died p < 0.05). Among the 36 patients who declined home oxygen trial, 13 experienced recurrences of severe asthmatic attacks outside the hospital ; nine of them died. Long-term follow up disclosed that 8.1 percent of those receiving home oxygen offered to them (n = 61) died from an asthmatic attack. On the other hand, 30.5 percent of those who refused to have home oxygen (n = 36) died within a 15 years period (p < 0.05).",

However, corticosteroids modulate directly neither eosinophil adhesiveness nor the expression of adhesion proteins on endothelial cells in vitro. Therefore, it is likely that the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on the tissue infiltration of eosinophils is the consequence of indirect mechanisms, mainly via the inhibition of cytokines. Interestingly, theophylline, which is generally accepted as a bronchodilator, attenuates eosinophil adhesion to endothelial cells in vitro at a clinically therapeutic concentration. Furthermore, theophylline inhibits the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on endothelial cells that had been stimulated with IL-4 plus tumor necrosis factor-a. Thus, theophylline possibly exerts an inhibitory effect on both the adhesive property of eosinophils and the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells. These findings possibly indicate that theophylline would be adequate to supplement the actions of corticosteroids in asthmatic airway inflammation, partly via its inhibitory effect on the interaction between blood eosinophils and endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 (Stat6) is a key transcription factor involved in interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-1 3-mediated biological responses. Recently, we reported the association between the dinucleotide (GT) repeat polymorphism in the first exon of Stat6 and allergic subjects in a Japanese population. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether this GT repeat polymorphism is associated with bronchial asthma, including childhood asthma and atopic and non-atopic adult asthma. Stat6 gene polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment length polymorphism analysis. In the first exon of Stat6, polymorphic PCR products were classified into six alleles (12–17 GT repeats). A significant difference was found in the genotypic frequency of the GT repeat polymorphism between controls and child asthmatics (P = 0.015), but not atopic or non-atopic adult asthma. The frequency of the 15 repeat allele (wild type) was lower in child asthmatics than in controls (P = 0.0047; odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-2.23), whereas shorter repeat alleles (12, 13 and 14 GT repeat) were higher in child asthmatics than in controls (P = 0.0064; OR (95%CI) 1.66 (1.15-2.39)). Genetic variations in the Stat6 gene may be associated with a predisposition for childhood asthma.",

The present study was conducted because specialists are responsible for increasing the use of guidelines, but the current state of asthma care provided by specialists in primary clinical settings has not been clarified. In collaboration with five primary medical facilities throughout Japan, severity of asthma, contents of asthma therapy, and the implementation rate of pulmonary function testing and peak flow measurements were analyzed for 1007 outpatients ≥ 40 years old with stable bronchial asthma. In all patients, peak inspiratory flow (PIF) was measured during examination. Either ICS or ICS/long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) was used in almost all patients with at least mild persistent asthma. Although treatments adhered to the guidelines, therapeutic steps did not match asthma severity in many patients with mild intermittent asthma. Large gaps existed between facilities that measure pulmonary function and PEF in daily clinical practice and those that do not. While mean PIF value for all subjects was well maintained at 102.0 ± 29.1 L/min, some patients may not have been able to inhale efficiently in terms of PIF (5.1% of Turbuhaler® users and 5.7% of Diskhaler® users). When stepping down asthma therapy, some confusion in policy may exist, leading to guideline mismatches. Differences in the implementation of pulmonary function and PEF measurements, as indicators for long-term management, need to be minimized among specialists. For maintaining effective inhalation, inspiratory flow should be periodically checked.",

    "abstract": "Bee stings are a common health problem throughout the world and can sometimes result in fatal anaphylactic reactions. We have studied Asian bee (Apis cerana indica, Apis cerana nigrocincta and Apis dorsata) venoms and have discovered a novel protein with a molecular size of 50 kDa (p50), as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which has not been reported in the venom of the Western honey-bee, Apis mellifera (AM). The p50 protein showed a unique affinity to human α1-microglobulin (α1-m). As a result, p50 was purified using an affinity column with α1-m. The p50 protein was further purified by an affinity column with a monoclonal antibody raised against p50 in mice. The p50 protein induced an inflammatory reaction following injection into mouse ear; that is, degranulation of mast cells, edema, hyperemia and hyperpermeation of the local capillaries were observed. The reaction was very similar to that seen when phospholipase A2 of AM, a representative bee venom, was administered by injection. The inflammatory reaction induced by p50 was completely inhibited by mixing p50 with α1-m prior to injection. These results indicate that p50 is a unique venom component of the Asian bee that induces the inflammatory reaction and that human α1-m may be involved as a protective mechanism against bee stings of at least some Asian bee species.",

    "abstract": "A strong link between bronchiolitis and asthma has been indicated. Bronchiolitis that occurs in infants is manifested physiologically by a widespread narrowing of the air passages and, clinically, by asthma-like symptoms.The major cause of bronchiolitis is respiratory syncytial virus infection. While the precise pathophysiologic sequences of infection are incomplete, many observations have suggested that there is an infiltration of eosinophils in the airways. Current studies have shown that the respiratory syncytial virus penetrates the pulmonary defenses and initiates immunologic responses. The histamine and leukotriene mediators that are released produce an inflammatory reaction and the chemotactic factors bring eosinophils to the site of the reaction. Degranulation of eosinophils can release eosinophil cationic protein into the airways. Our finding that chemoattractants for eosinophils, interleukin-8 and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted) were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates of infants with bronchiolitis suggests that such chemokines from epithelial cells may induce an eosinophil infiltration in the airway. Similar allergic inflammatory changes have been observed in asthma and in epithelial cells infected with respiratory viruses. Future investigation of the mechanism by which bronchiolitis can induce asthma will provide benefits in the treatment and prevention of asthma in sensitive individuals.",

TNFα and IL-1in the cell- free supernatants were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

No antigen-specific IgE was detected in cord blood, whereas in infants younger than 6 months of age, 38.5% of AD infants and 6.6% of the non-atopic controls showed IgE against f1 (≥ 0.70 Ua/mL) and 14.3 and 4.0%, respectively, showed low levels (0.15–0.70 Ua/mL) of the IgE.

Specific IgE antibody titration against the purified allergens Der f1 and Der f2 from HDM, and against Cry J1 and Cry J2 from Jc, was performed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radio-immunoassay (RIA) in sera from all subjects. HLA class II oligotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reaction sequence specific oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO) method on the DRB1*, DQA1*, DQB1* and DPB1* alleles using peripheral blood cells. The high IgE responders ≥ class 4 to the purified allergens were identified by using the IgE antibody reference concentration obtained by ELISA, RIA and routine IgE CAP RAST. Compared to the controls, the patients with both rhinitis and asthma showed significantly higher frequencies of DRB1* 0901, DQB1* 0303, and DPB1* 0401 alleles. High IgE responsiveness to HDM was associated with DRB1* 1101, 0901, DQB1* 0303, and DPB1*0401 alleles. The patients with anti-Der f1 IgE antibody concentration exceeding 72.2 ng/mL showed significantly elevated frequencies for DQB1*0401 and DPB1*0401 alleles, and those with anti Der f2 IgE antibody concentration exceeding 46.2 ng/mL showed significantly elevated frequencies for DPB1*0401 and 0901 alleles. High IgE responsiveness to Jc with Cry j1 and Cry j2 was associated with the DRB1* 1201 alleles.",

    "abstract": "Stinging insect allergy is a relatively common medical problem, responsible for an estimated 40 fatalities per year in the USA and considerable anxiety and lifestyle modification. There are no criteria to identify people at risk of initial venom anaphylaxis. Reactions may occur at any age and are unrelated to the time interval of prior venom exposure. There is an approximate 60% re-sting reaction rate in people who have had sting anaphylaxis and have positive venom skin tests. Re-sting reactions are more likely to occur in adults than in children and in people who have had more severe anaphylactic symptoms. Positive venom intradermal skin tests confirm the diagnosis of potential stinging insect allergy in people who have had sting reactions. Venom immunotherapy provides almost 100% protection from further sting reactions. It is recommended for all people who have had venom anaphylaxis and have positive skin tests, except for children who have dermal reactions only. Details of venom dosing are well established. The adequate duration of venom immunotherapy is still an unresolved issue. Conversion to a negative skin test appears to be an absolute criterion to discontinue treatment. In the presence of a persistent positive skin test, 3-5 years of immunotherapy is generally sufficient. People who have had severe reactions, such as loss of consciousenss, may require indefinite therapy.",

We report a case of pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia (PIE) syndrome accompanied with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B cell lineage. A 42-year-old man with a long-term history of bronchial asthma consulted the local hospital due to high fever and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. He was diagnosed as having non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and was referred to our hospital. Marked blood eosinophilia and infiltrative shadows in both middle lung fields were recognized. After six courses of chemotherapy, including prednisolone, the shadows were ameliorated, although cervical lymphadenopathy did not show any regression, indicating refractory lymphoma. To investigate pulmonary shadows, we performed transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the peak of disease activity before systemic chemotherapy. The eosinophil recruiting and activating factor interleukin (IL)-5 was undetectable in both serum and BAL fluid. Moreover, in the specimen obtained from lung biopsy, tissue eosinophilia was pathologically recognized, but IL-5 was not detected by immunohistochemical staining. These findings indicate that, in this case, any factors other than IL-5 derived from lymphoma cells may be concerned with PIE.",

    "abstract": "Background: We previously reported that crosslinking of IgG Fc receptor II (FcγRII) induces intracellular calcium mobilization, but not histamine release in human basophils. To clarify functional activities of FcγRII on human basophils, we analyzed the FcγRII-mediated signaling events in the human basophilic leukemia cell line KU812F. Methods: Flow cytometric methods were used to investigate the effect on intracellular calcium mobilization of cross-linking of FcγRII. KU812F cells were pre-incubated with anti-FcγRII monoclonal antibody (IV.3). After the addition of various concentrations of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein or buffer alone, cells were stimulated with goat antimouse IgG F(ab')2 (GAM) and analyzed with the flow cytometer. Next, in order to test the signaling events after cross-linking of FcγRII, we examined tyrosine kinase activity. The time-course of tyrosine phosphorylation after cross-linking of FcγRII and the effect of genistein on this tyrosine phosphorylation were tested by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation was also performed to identify the type of tyrosine kinase associated with signal transduction of FcγRII. Results: The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein inhibited intracellular calcium mobilization caused by cross-linking of FcγRII in a dose-dependent manner. Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation after FcγRII cross-linking was shown by immunoblot analysis and this phosphorylation was inhibited by genistein. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn and Syk was observed upon cross-linking of FcγRII. Conclusions: Tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for the signaling pathway through FcγRII and tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn and Syk, at least, is actively involved in this signal transduction.",

We explored the capacity of peripheral blood B cells from pollinosis patients to produce anti-JCP specific IgE. Peripheral blood B cells from 16 pollinosis patients and 9 normal subjects were cultured with mitomycin-C treated T cells with immobilized anti-CD3 for 10 days. B cells from pollinosis patients produced higher amounts of anti-JCP specific IgE than those from normal subjects upon stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3 activated autologous T cell, whereas the production of anti-JCP specific IgM were comparable between normal subjects and patients. Exogenous IL-4/L-5 or anti-CD3 stimulated patients’ T cells could not induce the production of anti-JCP specific IgE from normal B cells. These results indicate that B cells from normal individuals contain comparable numbers of precursors that are committed to produce anti-JCP specific IgM to patients’ B cells. Moreover, the data confirm that the class switching of IgM to IgE within anti-JCP specific B cells contributes to development of Japanese cedar pollinosis.",

Here, we investigated whether CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells mediate the suppressive effects of α-GalCer treatment on EC. To deplete CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells, neonatal mice were thymectomized and intraperitoneally injected with anti-CD25 Ab. At 6 weeks of age, these mice were immunized with ragweed (RW) in aluminum hydroxide. Ten days later, the mice were challenged with RW in eye drops and 24 hours later, the conjunctivas and spleens were harvested for histological and flow cytometric analyses, respectively. α-GalCer or vehicle was injected 2 hours prior to RW challenge. In addition, α-GalCer was injected into thymus-intact EC-developing mice that had not been treated with anti-CD25 Ab. α-GalCer treatment significantly suppressed EC in the thymus-intact mice that had not been treated with anti-CD25 Ab. In contrast, α-GalCer treatment of thymectomized and anti-CD25 Ab-treated mice did not affect the severity of EC or splenic CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T-cell numbers.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Asthma is defined as a lung disease characterized by airway obstruction and/or narrowing. This condition is usually reversible, either spontaneously or with treatment. In addition, an important feature of the disease is airway inflammation. Attention to this is a major focus of therapy. Somewhat related to the inflammatory condition and somewhat to hereditary and environmental factors is the feature of airways hyper-responsiveness. Much of what is currently taught in the United States today concerning asthma pathophysiology and treatment emanates from guidelines that were issued in 1991 and that are currently being revised. This guideline initiative has been sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health. As a large and influential government agency, the NHLBI has provided the financial and human resources to distribute important information to patients, their families and doctors. There are several aspects that should be stressed concerning these guidelines. The importance given to the concept of airway inflammation in contrast to the idea of simple bronchospasm being the main feature of asthma has already been highlighted. Related to this is the idea of early intervention with anti-inflammatory therapy rather than use of beta-agonist bronchodilators alone. It has been difficult to achieve acceptance of this concept by patients and physicians, because chronic use of a medication is foreign to many and is also costly. A great deal of the time of American asthma specialists is devoted to educating their patients on the importance of chronic anti-inflammatory therapy. Another important focus is the environment. The role of the housedust mite, indoor pets, molds and cock-roaches in increasing airway inflammation in allergic asthmatic patients is receiving growing attention. Diagnosing the allergic component of the disorder with allergy skin tests or RAST and then acting on the environment to remove major allergens is now considered to be of paramount importance. Another important aspect of care that has been overlooked in the past is the need to monitor pulmonary function with some regularity. This should be done at visits to both the asthma specialist and family doctor. Some patients require daily home monitoring with the use of a peak flow meter. Both patients and physicians have failed to recognize that significant airway obstruction can occur before there are symptoms. Pulmonary function monitoring is the only way that this situation can be tracked and recognized early in the development of an attack. American physicians are trained to believe that the success of their treatment plan depends on communication with patients and families. They generally recognize the need to simplify the regimen, to provide written information reinforcing their instructions, to repeat these at each visit, and to observe the patient who uses metered dose inhalers. Many communities in the US have support groups for patients and families with asthma, which allow people to come together to share their concerns and frustrations. This seems to enhance compliance with medical therapy, as patients feel they are more involved in their disease than if they were passive recipients of information. Federal programs are ongoing to assess the outcome of these support interventions.",

In contrast, Tanypus punctipennis and Rheotanytarsus kyotoensis showed low allergenicities, suggesting a low level of human contact and/or a lack of allergenic components. Furthermore, species that emerge from eutrophic waters in a large mass, such as Macropelopia paranebulosa, Paratrichocladius rufiventris and Chironomus yoshimatsui, showed strong allergenicities in all the tests.

Mycelial mats of the three species cultivated on completely synthetic media were used for extract preparation. IgE antibodies to each fungus were measured with RAST using a polyvinyl chloride microplate as a solid phase. Analysis of a serum pool obtained from nine asthmatic children with a positive RAST to A. restrictus showed that A. restrictus inhibited the RAST to A. restrictus, A. fumigatus and A. alternata by more than 80%. Similar results were observed with A. fumigatus and A. alternata. Additionally, when 13 serum samples with a positive RAST to A. restrictus were tested separately, A. restrictus substantially inhibited the A. restrictus RAST in all subjects tested. A. fumigatus and A. alternata inhibited the A. restrictus RAST in 10 and 8 of the samples studied, respectively.

Several cellular responses to glucocorticoids have been characterized in steroid-resistant asthma. Based on molecular biological studies, excessive expression of glucocorticoid receptor p and c-fos, an inducible transcription factor, was suggested to result in steroid resistance.

A tuberculin skin test had been negative approximately 30 years ago and annual chest X-ray examination had shown no evidence of tuberculosis over the past 5 years. Fiberoptic broncoscopic examination showed no evidence of bronchial tuberculosis or perforated lymph nodes. Because acute tuberculous lobar pneumonia in the lower lung field is rare, except in patients receiving oral corticosteroids or with immunodeficiency conditions, in this patient the inhalation of corticosteroids may have predisposed him to the onset of this condition.",

In the present study, we incorporated Y-24180 into lipid microspheres (LM) and its activity was evaluated in vivo. When Lipo Y-24180 was intravenously given 3 min before PAF injection, the maximal bronchoconstriction was reduced. The mean (± SEM) PAF-induced respiratory flow resistance in Lipo Y-24180 (1 μg/kg)-treated animals at 0.5 min was 19.0 ± 8.0%, which was significantly lower than that of the vehicle-treated control (61.5 ± 13.0%; P < 0.05). Three and 10 μg/kg Lipo Y-24180 almost completely inhibited the respiratory flow resistance. Alone, Y-24180 dose-dependently suppressed the bronchoconstriction; however, a significant decrease was only seen in 10 μg/kg-treated animals. There were also significant differences between the Lipo Y-24180 (1 μg/kg)-treated group and Y-24180 (1 and 3 mg/kg) treated groups. Aerosol inhalation of Lipo Y-24180 (10 μg/mL) caused no significant suppression; however, a significant inhibition was observed in guinea pigs that were administered more than 30 μg/mL. Therefore, it would be concluded that Lipo Y-24180 would have a potency as a bronchodilator and would be promising as both an injectable drug and an inhaler.",

We conducted a study with grass pollen-allergic patients and compared allergen-specific IgE and IgG4 before and 5 months after the onset of immunotherapy. Twenty-seven patients were treated with a mixture of two grass species: Phleum pratense and Dactilis glomerata. Sera of patients were tested for IgE and IgG4 against four recombinant allergens (RA): rPhl p 1, 2, 5 and rBet v 2. Specific IgE and IgG4 to timothy and olive pollen were also evaluated. No change in total and specific IgE levels to RA was seen, except to rPhl p 5. We found a decrease in specific IgE levels to olive after immunotherapy. Ten of 10 patients with specific IgE against a single recombinant allergen or two RA showed the same pattern of sensitization before and after 5 months of immunotherapy and the administration of 4000 U/mL allergen extract. Interestingly, we found a significant increase in specific IgG4 to rBet v 2 and olive after grass immunotherapy. These results indicate that application of two grass species in immunotherapy may be sufficient to induce an IgE and IgG4 response to RA, grass and olive extracts. The observations in the present study indicate that monitoring of antibodies against RA is necessary to evaluate patients' pattern of sensitization and emphasize the need of component-resolved immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The application of molecular biology to the discovery of novel pathways to inhibit allergic tissue responses is becoming a reality. Particularly promising approaches are the use of vaccines and pharmacologic agents to downregulate the polarized T Helper (Th)-2 lymphocyte response through enhancement of interferon-y production. Selective inhibition of specific mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13 and eotaxin, should lead to a new class of anticytokine therapeutic agents. At the cellular level, more effective inhibition of mast cell activation and strategies to remove IgE as the triggering stimulus hold promise. With the discovery of susceptibility genes for allergic disease, the next decade is likely to witness substantial further developments in this field, with a strong focus targeted on induction mechanisms and disease prevention. If the current epidemic of allergic disease continues, then there is a strong incentive to identify those environmental factors that are responsible so that appropriate interventions can be introduced. These may include alterations to the maternal and infant diet to program the developing immune response or, in genetically susceptible individuals, the early introduction of a protective vaccine to reset the T lymphocyte balance more in favour of a Th-1 response. In this regard, the development of cytosine and guanosine nucleotide repeats and antigen-specific DNA vaccines look especially promising. In established allergic disease, the task of reversing sensitization is daunting. Safer and more efficacious allergen vaccines, whether using DNA or peptide approaches, offer the most promising approach for fundamentally changing the allergic immune response. Patients would also greatly benefit from more effective and orally active mast cell inhibitors and small molecules that could either remove IgE or effectively interrupt its capacity to signal through its cell surface receptors. In the meantime, the epidemic of allergic disease requires urgent attention, not only in the provision of specialist centers for providing accurate diagnosis and for administering treatment (including immunotherapy), but in a clear recognition that these disorders are caused by changing environmental factors and, as a consequence, deserve attention at the level of public health.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pranlukast in clinical practice. More than 2500 outpatients with mild to severe persistent asthma answered an input questionnaire, which consisted of 33 items assessing asthma symptoms in terms of six activities of daily living during the previous 2 weeks. Of these patients, 1138 received treatment with pranlukast and answered the same questionnaire 4–6 weeks after the start of treatment. In 923 of these 1138 patients, we examined the impact of concomitantly used inhaled steroids, β2-adrenergic agonists or sustained-release theophylline on the effectiveness of pranlukast treatment. One hundred and sixty-seven control patients completed the questionnaire twice but did not receive pranlukast treatment. We found a significant decrease in the number of asthma symptoms reported among both the 1138 patients treated with pranlukast and the 167 control patients. However, the magnitude of the decrease in symptoms was significantly (P < 0.001) greater with pranlukast treatment. Moreover, pranlukast was equally efficacious in the presence and absence of concomitantly used inhaled steroids, β2-adrenergic agonists or sustained-release theophylline. In conclusion, pranlukast was shown to have clinical effectiveness in the treatment of mild to severe persistent asthma symptoms.",

In the present study, we examined the effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on fibronectin production by HLF in order to clarify these issues. We stimulated HLF with various concentrations of IL-4 and IL-13 for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h and fibronectin concentrations in the culture supernatants were determined by ELISA The results showed that IL-4 and IL-13 induced fibronectin production in a time- and a concentration-dependent manner. Anti-transforming growth factor (TGF)β1 antibody (ab) inhibited TGF-β1 induced fibronectin production but not IL-4- and IL-1 3-induced fibronectin production, indicating that TGF-β1 is not involved in the IL-4- and IL-13-induced fibronectin production by HLF. These results indicate that IL-4 and IL-13 are capable of inducing fibronectin production by HLF and play an important role in the production of airway remodeling by inducing fibronectin production as well as allergic inflammation.",

A panel consisting of a few recombinant allergens, namely rPhI p 1, rPhl p 2, rPhl p 5 and profilin, was sufficient to diagnose grass pollen allergy in patients allergic to grass pollen. Serum samples from 528 consecutive outpatients with IgE antibodies towards at least one allergen (IgE level > 0.35 kAU/L) were selected for this retrospective study. Total and specific serum IgE to rPhl p 1, rPhl p 2, rPhl p 5, rBet v 1, rBet v 2, latex, birch, hazel, mugwort, wall pellitory, Dermatophagoides pteronissinus, Alternaria tenuis, cat and apple were measured by the immunoenzymatic capsulated hydrophilic carrier polymer (CAP) FEIA system (Pharmacia & Upjohn). Of 123 polysensitized patients with antilatex Ig1E, 12 (9.76%) had symptoms after latex exposure. Ten of 12 subjects monosensitized to latex had symptoms after latex exposure. Symptomatic patients had higher IgE levels to latex than symptomless patients (P = 0.046). A higher prevalence of antilatex IgE was seen in sera containing specific IgE to rPhl p 1, rPhl p 5 and rBet v 2. A good correlation (Spearman's r = 0.52; P = 0.001) between high levels of antilatex IgE and total serum IgE was found. The findings of the present study may support the concept that a high proportion of sera containing IgE to rBet v 2, rPhl p 1 and rPhl p 5 simultaneously contain antilatex IgE. Therefore, patients with specific IgE to these recombinant allergens with no history of current latex exposure may need additional evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Although the mechanisms controlling the resolution of inflammatory processes are still not clear, it is thought that a number of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and eosinophils, and ingestion of these cells by macrophages may be involved in the apoptotic cell process in allergic or non-allergic nasal tissues. We postulated that apoptosis of inflammatory cells may occur in vivo in nasal mucosa, thus regulating allergic and non-allergic inflammation, and to test this hypothesis we examined apoptotic cells in the nasal tissue of surgical specimens. Human turbinates were obtained after conchotomy performed on patients with nasal obstruction refractory to medication. Nasal tissues were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded tissues were stained for apoptotic cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (dUTP) nick end-labeling (TUNEL). To identify cell types undergoing apoptosis, double staining was performed by combining TUNEL and immunohistochemistry. The majority of TUNEL-positive cells were identified as leukocytes. Most TUNEL-positive cells found in these tissues represented granulocytes. A higher proportion of TUNEL-positive cells was found to be macrophages and most TUNEL-positive macrophages had intact nuclei and contained phagocytosed TUNEL-positive material (assumed to be apoptotic cells or bodies) in the cytoplasm. These experiments represent the demonstration of cell type-specific apoptosis in human nasal mucosa. The results may have an important clinical implication and also promote further investigation to control the apoptosis of these cells in health and disease.",

In the present study, the effects of eotaxin, a selective chemoattractant for eosinophils, on the expression of MMP mRNA were examined. Incubation with chemotactically active concentrations of eotaxin for 24 h enhanced the expression of mRNA for membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP), but not of mRNA for MMP-2 and MMP-9. An increase in the protein level of MT1-MMP was also detected in the cell lysate of eotaxin-treated eosinophils.

Further investigation showed that the principal ingredient, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), produced a positive reaction, whereas the injection solvent with the principal ingredient removed produced a negative reaction. When compounds similar to PLP were tested, pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxamine and pyridoxal produced a negative reaction, whereas pyridoxine 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) produced a positive reaction. Adenosine 2'-phosphate and adenosine 5'-diphosphate were also tested and these produced a negative reaction. When a histamine-release test was performed, PLP and PMP produced a positive reaction, whereas PN produced a negative reaction. When all tests were performed on three control subjects, the results were all negative. In this very rare case, phosphate radical conjugates with a pyridine nucleus became haptenic-epitope and an immediate-type reaction occurred.

    "abstract": "Cough variant asthma (CVA) is recognized as a precursor of bronchial asthma (BA). However, the cough response to bronchoconstriction differs between these similar diseases. Repeated bronchoconstriction and the resulting imbalance of endogenous lipid mediators may impact the cough response. We investigated the influence of repeated bronchoconstriction on the cough response to bronchoconstriction using naïve guinea pigs. Bronchoconstriction was induced for 3 consecutive days and changes in the cough response and lipid mediators, such as PGE2, PGI2, and cysteinyl-LTs (Cys-LTs), in BAL fluid (BALF) were assessed. We investigated the effect of endogenous PGI2 on the cough response by employing a PGI2 receptor antagonist. In order to investigate the cough response over a longer period, we re-evaluated the cough response 2 weeks after repeated bronchoconstriction. The number of coughs induced by bronchoconstriction were significantly decreased by repeated bronchoconstriction. The levels of PGE2, PGI2, and Cys-LTs, and the ratio of PGI2/PGE2 were significantly increased, following repeated bronchoconstriction. This decrease in the cough response was suppressed by pretreatment with a PGI2 receptor antagonist. Two weeks after repeated bronchoconstriction, the cough response returned to the same level as before repeated bronchoconstriction along with a concomitant return of lipid mediators, such as PGE2, PGI2, and Cys-LTs and the ratio of PGI2/PGE2. Our results suggest that repeated bronchoconstriction and the resulting imbalance of endogenous lipid mediators contribute to the difference in cough responses to bronchoconstriction in CVA and BA.",

Elderly subjects with chronic airflow obstruction (group R; n = 60), consisting of COPD and BA, were compared with subjects without respiratory symptoms (group C; n = 53). Both daily activities and sleep quality were assessed by force-gravity (GF) measurement using an accelerometer. The night study showed that both total sleeping period and frequency of GF in group R were increased significantly compared with group C. Subjects with BA showed fewer movements differing from those in COPD subjects. The daytime study indicated that the frequency of GF was greater in group C than in group R, suggesting reduced daily activities in group R. Subjects with BA showed more movement than COPD subjects. Hypercapnia was a significant factor causing COPD subjects to move more frequently during sleep and a decrease in peak flow rate was a significant factor in the reduction of movement during the day in subjects with BA. It is assumed that elderly subjects with COPD or bronchial asthma require a longer sleep period than subjects without respiratory symptoms because of the deterioration of sleep quality in the former group and the sleeping pattern differs between subjects with COPD and BA. Hypercapnia is considered a possible factor disturbing sleeping quality in COPD, whereas decreased peak expiratory flow rate is a factor reducing daytime activities in subjects with BA.",

We studied three different bronchial challenge tests (methacholine inhalation challenge, cold air inhalation challenge and exercise-bronchodilation tests) at school age in 29 children born at or before 38 weeks gestation (median 35 weeks gestation) from multiple pregnancies. The children had been followed up from birth and were examined at the age of 7-15 years (median age 10 years). Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was found in 28-34% of children when these tests were analyzed separately. Eight children (28%) were exercise responders; two of them and three additional children were bronchodilator responders. Thus, 11 children (38%) had a pathologic result in the exercise-bronchodilation test. Ten children (34%) responded to cold air and nine children (31%) responded to methacholine inhalation. At least one test was pathologic in 18 children (62%), but only two children (7%) responded in all three challenges. A positive result in the exercise-bronchodilation test was associated with cold air reactivity, but not with methacholine reactivity. The exercise and cold air tests detected predominantly the same children. No differences were found in bronchial challenge test results between children who, at birth, were appropriately grown and those who had intrauterine growth retardation. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was common (up to 62%) at school age in children born as moderately preterm. The outdoor exercise-bronchodilation test found 61% of all BHR cases. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was not associated with intrauterine growth status. The most sensitive test was the cold air inhalation challenge and a good agreement was seen between this test and the exercise challenge outdoors.",

Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral interstitial shadows and pleural effusion. We suspected AEP and performed fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The eosinophil fraction was elevated at 59% in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). From the history of inhalation of heated rubber at the working place and hypereosinophilic counts in the BALF, he was given a diagnosis of AEP associated with heated rubber fume exposure. His symptoms and chest radiographic findings were drastically improved by corticosteroid therapy. Heated rubber fume can be a causative substance for AEP. In similar situations, physicians should consider AEP and order various examinations for confirmation.",

These T cells were stimulated with various peptide analogues, followed by determination of proliferative responses and IFN-γ production. Replacement of Leu at peptide position 2 (P2) by amino acids which are less hydrophobic than the wild type (Val, Ala) or those with similar structural or neutral charge (Thr, Ser), induced increased IFN-γ production from T cells. This phenomenon was associated with structural features of TCR, especially the length of CDR3 region of TCRα. Amino acid replacement at the other positions did not induce increased IFN-γ production. Amino acid substitution at P2 frequently induces increased IFN-γ production in a clone-specific manner, which is associated with the structure of CDR3 in TCRVα chains.",

Some genetic polymorphisms have a correlation with allergic phenotypes, however there is only a statistical association without a precise molecular mechanism being demonstrated. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms from a proteomic perspective should contribute to a better understanding of diseases and indicate possible therapeutic approaches. Recent advances in identification and characterization of many immunological molecules have led to a shift to profiling research, clinical proteomics, of already known factors. However, analysis of such biomarkers in allergies requires methodological improvements because allergic reactions can be greatly influenced by subtle changes of factors. These subtle changes cannot be detected by conventional techniques such as 2D-PAGE, and the grammar behind the system is not well recognized by conventional proteomics. Examples of innovative methods useful for proteomic approaches to allergies are discussed here ; especially high throughput screening and structural methods for allergy targeting.",

Plasma concentrations of beclomethasone 17-monopropionate (17-BMP), a major metabolite of BDP, following an inhaled dose of HFA-BDP (200 μg as four inhalations from 50 μg/actuation) in five Japanese children with bronchial asthma were quantified and analyzed by a non-compartmental analysis to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters. The area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable time (AUC0 -t) was 1659 ± 850 pg • h/mL (arithmetic mean ± standard deviation (SD)), the maximum concentration observed (Cmax) was 825 ± 453 pg/mL and the apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) was 2.1 ± 0.7 hours. The time to reach Cmax (Tmax) was 0.5 hours in all patients. No special relationship was observed between these parameters and age or body weight. These parameters were compared with the previously reported parameters of American children with bronchial asthma. The Japanese/American ratio of the geometric means of each parameter was 1.36 for AUC0 -t, 1.04 for Cmax and 1.4 for t1/2.

In the present study, we tried to establish an allergic model of nasal obstruction using Brown Norway (BN) rats to evaluate the effects of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors in this model. The volume of the nasal cavity was measured with an acoustic rhinometer. Decrease in the volume of the nasal cavity was taken as nasal obstruction. BN rats were actively sensitized with ovalbumin conjugated with aluminium hydroxide. Intranasal antigen instillation induced biphasic nasal obstruction in sensitized BN rats. Early and late phase responses (EPR and LPR) were observed peaking at 0.5 and 6 hours after the antigen challenge, respectively. Chlorpheniramine did not inhibit EPR or LPR at 10 mg/kg, although the dose was sufficient for the compound to exert its anti-histamine activity. Prednisolone inhibited both responses at 30 mg/kg. Rolipram and CDP-840, PDE4 inhibitors, inhibited both responses at 100 mg/kg. KF19514, a PDE1/4 dual inhibitor, inhibited EPR at 0.1 mg/kg or more and inhibited LPR at 10 mg/kg. The present study provides a simple model of allergic biphasic nasal obstruction in BN rats, and also suggests that the PDE4 inhibitor may alleviate nasal obstruction in patients with allergic rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Avoidance of allergens is one of the most effective treatments of allergenic diseases, including pollinosis. Although various masks and goggles for pollinosis sufferers are commercially available, little work has been done on preventing adhesion of pollen to the human body and clothes. We have examined the effect of polymer coating on adhesion of cedar pollen to skin, hair and fabrics, and found that a lecithin polymer (LP), containing both cationic and anionic sites, is highly effective in reducing adhesion levels. Methods We evaluated the changes in electrostatic charge and frictional coefficient of sample surfaces after coating with an anionic polymer (AP), a cationic polymer (CP), a nonionic polymer (NIP), or LP (each applied by spraying 0.10% polymer solution in ethanol/water). Pollen adhesion level was evaluated by observation of the number of cedar pollen particles on video microscope (VMS) images and by quantification of cedar pollen antigen Cry j1 with a sandwich ELISA system. Adhesion of pollen to human skin or hair was also examined by VMS observation. Results LP-coated samples showed a significant reduction in electrostatic charge level and frictional coefficient. We presumed that these properties are closely related to the significant reduction in the adhesion level of cedar pollen or Cry j1 compared with CP, AP or NIP-coated samples. A similar effect was seen on LP-treated skin, and LP-treated waxed hair. Conclusions Our results suggest that coating with LP could help in the management of pollinosis by reducing the contact level of patients with cedar pollen antigens.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify the predictive factors, among laboratory test data and patient background variables, of an efficient response to the anti-allergic agent suplatast tosilate in patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma. The subjects were 44 patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma on inhaled steroid therapy who were enrolled in a phase II clinical trial of suplatast (300 and 600 mg/day). Improvements in respiratory function parameters and symptom scores during the first 4 weeks of administration of suplatast were assessed to evaluate the response to the drug. Logistic regression analysis was used to relate the response to the independent variables. Secondly, to test whether these results were applicable to clinical practice, we examined the data from a phase III clinical trial of suplatast. Twenty-two patients were assessed as responders according to our criteria. The percentage of blood eosinophil (%EOS, P = 0.015) and basophil (%BASO, P = 0.019) counts were identified as significant variables to predict responders. When cut-off levels for %EOS and %BASO were set at 7.5 and 1.2, respectively, the sensitivity for prediction of responders with lower %EOS and %BASO was 81.8% (18/22). Furthermore, when we applied the same cut-off levels to subjects of a phase III clinical trial of suplatast, the sensitivity of prediction was found to be as high as 75.0% (6/8). These results indicate that %EOS and %BASO are good candidates to predict the response to suplatast among patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma on inhaled steroid therapy. These predictors may contribute, in combination with genomic information, to stratified medical treatment tailored to the individual needs of patients.",

To estimate the precise intrinsic activity of β-agonists, relaxation responses should be examined on maximally contracted airway smooth muscle. The aim of this study was to compare the relaxation responses to β-agonists under different tonic conditions of airway smooth muscle. We examined the relaxation response to β-agonists on the isolated tracheal ring preparations in guinea-pigs precontracted with different concentrations of carbachol, leukotriene D4 or substance P, and compared these results with that of spontaneously developed muscle tone. Relaxation responses to β-agonists were diminished depending on the extent of carbachol-induced tone in the tracheal muscle. The degree of hyporesponsiveness was greatest in treatment with tulobuterol, procaterol and isoproterenol, but least with adrenaline, formoterol and salmeterol. Diminished relaxation responses to β-agonists were partially reversed by pretreatment with AF-DX 116, a muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist. When the tracheal muscle was precontracted with different concentrations of leukotriene D4 (1–100 nM) or substance P (0.1-10 μM), a diminished relaxation response to procaterol was not observed. All β-agonists tested were partial agonists for relaxation of the carbachol-contracted guinea-pig tracheal muscle, where adrenaline rather than isoproterenol had the highest intrinsic activity.",

In the present review, salmeterol (SM), a LABA inhalant with a long-acting bronchodilator effect, was compared with the recently introduced tulobuterol patch (TBP) in terms of safety and efficacy, based on their respective clinical effects on childhood asthma. From a clinical perspective, both drugs had a preventive effect by suppressing the morning dip and exercise-induced asthma when used concomitantly with an inhaled corticosteroid, and both agents were associated with a lower incidence of adverse effects on the cardiovascular system than oral β2-adrenergic receptor agonists. Based on these findings, both SM and TBP are concluded to be highly efficacious and safe bronchodilator agents that are appropriate for the long-term management of childhood asthma.",

After stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with mite extracts, levels of gene transcription were examined in CD3 + T cells from allergic patients. Stimulation of PBMCs from mite specific IgE positive subjects resulted in specific upregulation of MAL transcription levels that was mediated by IL-4 secretion. The MAL protein in IL-4 stimulated primary T cells preferentially localized in glycolipid-enriched membrane (GEM) microdomains. When MAL was exogenously expressed in primary T cells, CD3ζ was concomitantly enriched, along with the expression of MAL, in GEM microdomains. GEMs are important for the formation and stabilization of TCR signaling complexes. Therefore, MAL may play a role in the formation of GEMs in activated T cells and the high expression of MAL may contribute to Th2 immune response.",

    "abstract": "Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) is a highly specific ligand for CCR 4. TARC may contribute to the recruitment, activation, and development of Th2 polarized cells that express CCR4. These characteristics have led investigators to hypothesize that TARC is involved in the development of Th2 responses. Suplatast tosilate ((±)-[2-[4-(3-ethoxy-2-hydroxy-propoxy) phenylcarbamoyl] ethyl] dimethylsulfonium p-toluenesulfonate) is an anti-allergic agent that selectively suppresses the synthesis of Th2 cytokines. We examined the effect of suplatast tosilate on TARC production and CCR-4 expression in vitro. Furthermore, we attempted to clarify whether TARC production was suppressed after clinical administration of suplatast tosilate. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from patients with allergic rhinitis who tested positive to house dust. PBMCs were stimulated with mite antigen. TARC mRNA was detected by real time PCR. The amount of TARC was estimated using an ELISA kit. PBMCs expressing CCR-4 were sorted by flow cytometry. The plasma level of TARC was examined in patients with chronic allergic rhinitis before and after treatment with suplatast tosilate for 4 weeks. Suplatast tosilate significantly reduced TARC production by PBMCs. TARC mRNA was also suppressed in a concentration dependent manner. However, suplatast tosilate did not inhibit the expression of CCR-4 on PBMCs. The plasma level of TARC was significantly decreased in patients administered suplatast tosilate. Suplatast tosilate suppressed TARC production by PBMCs and decreased the plasma level of TARC in patients with chronic allergic rhinitis.",

We set out to study whether exposure to hazelnut allergen by occupational contact increases hazel pollen and hazelnut sensitivity and causes workplace-related allergic symptoms in hazelnut processing factory workers. The study group consisted of 308 employees working in a hazelnut processing factory and 138 subjects with similar age ranges formed the control group. All subjects were asked to fill in a questionnaire about allergic symptoms and then underwent skin prick tests with 9 allergens (Betula verrucosa, Corylus avellana, Quercus robur, D. farinae, D. pteronyssinus, Mould mix, hazelnut, peanut and walnut). There were no workplace-related symptoms in the study group. No significant difference was found in the rate of allergic and respiratory symptoms between the study and control groups. The skin prick tests showed that birch (Betula verrucosa) and hazel (Corylus avellana) pollen sensitivities were higher in the study group than in the control group (p < 0.01 and p = 0.021, respectively). All the other skin prick test results were similar among the two groups. This study showed that occupational exposure to hazelnut caused skin sensitivity to hazel and birch pollen, but this was not associated with an enhanced risk for allergic diseases.",

CysLTs activate cell migration, in particular eosinophils, endothelial or epithelial cell adhesion and release of cytokines and other oxidative inflammatory mediators. Cytokines may also activate the release of CysLTs from eosinophils and other myeloid cells and also enhance the expression of the CysLT1 receptor creating an inflammatory amplification cycle.

The PIR-A requires the homodimeric Fc receptor common y chain for its efficient cell-surface expression and for the delivery of activation signaling. In contrast, PIR-B inhibits receptor-mediated activation signaling in vitro upon engagement with other activating-type receptors, such as the antigen receptor on B cells and the high-affinity Fc receptor for IgE on mast cells. Although the ligands for PIR-A and PIR-B remain unknown, recent studies on PIR-B-deficient mice have provided us with valuable insight into the physiological significance of PIR-B, particularly in its regulatory role in balancing the humoral immune response.",

The autonomic function of asthma sufferers differs from that of normal children. Therefore, we investigated whether there are 1/f fluctuations in asthmatic children during an asthma attack and whether asthmatic children have a different rhythm of 1/f fluctuations in the 24 h after an asthma attack. We recorded 24 h electrocardiographs of eight asthmatic children (three females, five males; median age 8.5 years; range 7-11 years) at the time of an asthma attack and during a non-attack period and examined the 1/fβ fluctuations on HR and its rhythm over a 24 h period using the MemCalc system (GMS, Tokyo, Japan). The 1/f fluctuations on HR were calculated by the expression on a log10(frequency)–log10(power density) scale of the HR variability. The values of β (1/fβ fluctuations of HR) for asthma attack and non-attack periods were 0.9 ± 0.07 and 0.96 ± 0.08, respectively (t = 1.59; P = 0.13). During the asthma attack period, the rhythm was median 7.9 h (range 6.1–11.1 h), compared with 22.7 h (range 1 2.2–36.4 h) during the non-attack period (t = 0; P < 0.001). During an asthma attack, the rhythm of 1/f fluctuations is ultradian (cycle length under 20 h), compared with various rhythms during a non-attack period. In future, we will clarify the relevance of the ultradian rhythm of 1/f fluctuations over a 24 h period and the biological life-support system at a point of time of an asthma attack.",

    "abstract": "Although it has been reported that cellular senescence is important in the pathogenesis of asthma, the differential effects of diesel exhaust particle (DEP)-induced cellular senescence on the development of asthma according to age have not been thoroughly studied. We first confirmed that DEP induced cellular senescence in mouse lungs, and then that DEP-induced cellular senescence followed by intranasal instillation of a low-dose house dust mite (HDM) allergen resulted in murine asthma. Second, we examined age-dependent differential effects using 6-week-old (young) and 18-month-old mice (old), and tested whether the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays an important role in this process. Finally, we performed in vitro experiments using human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) originating from young and elderly adults to identify the underlying mechanisms. DEP induced cellular senescence in the airway epithelial cells of young and old mice characterized by increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, S100A8/9, and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expressions. DEP-induced cellular senescence with subsequent exposure to a low-dose HDM allergen resulted in asthma in young and old mice. Rapamycin (mTOR pathway inhibitor) administration before DEP instillation significantly attenuated these asthmatic features. In addition, after treatment with a low-dose HDM allergen, S100A9 and HMGB1 over-expressed HBEC originating from young and elderly adults greatly activated co-cultured monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). This study showed that DEP-induced senescence made both young and old mice susceptible to allergic sensitization and resultant asthma development by enhancing DC activation. Public health efforts to reduce DEP exposure are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is produced by resident cells in the airway, such as airway epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle cells and alveolar macrophages, and is always present in the airway. Various exogenous and endogenous stimuli cause immediate increases in PGE2 from several-fold to multiples of 10-fold. Prostaglandin E2 controls the function of cells that contribute to immune and inflammatory responses, such as lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells, and exhibits suppressor activity in the initial and advanced stages of allergic airway inflammation (establishment of sensitization, induction of early asthmatic response, chemotaxis of inflammatory cells and continuation of the late asthmatic response). Therefore, if the endogenous protective effects of PGE2 are weakened or absent, inflammation and hypersensitive responses readily occur in the airway. Although the effects of PGE2 remain to be clarified, the possibility of the involvement of decreased PGE2 activity in the pathogenesis of asthma exists. However, in aspirin-induced asthma the role of PGE2 as a protective factor, through an as yet undetermined mechanism, is marked. It is thought that, in this type of asthma, symptoms may be induced by the elimination of the protective action of PGE2 by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). It is possible that PGE2 agonists that produce little airway irritation and drugs that raise the endogenous PGE2 level have potential as new types of anti-inflammatory or anti-asthma drugs.",

Morning PEF was significantly increased from 313.5 ± 13.1 (mean ± SEM) L/min to 325.7 ± 12.2 L/min at 1 week, 335.5 ± 12.7 L/min at 2 weeks, 338.6 ± 13.4 L/min at 3 weeks, and 340.0 ± 13.2 L/min at 4 weeks in 35 patients treated with ozagrel but not in the other 35 patients treated with a placebo. The percent increase in the morning PEF was significantly greater with ozagrel than with the placebo. It is speculated that inhibition of thromboxane synthesis by medium dose of steroid inhalation therapy may be insufficient in some asthmatics.",

A wide variety of adhesion molecules is involved in the binding of eosinophils to the vascular endothelium and their subsequent transmigration from the circulation to the airways, while little is known about CD44 expression on eosinophils. In the present study we introduce a novel staining combination with which surface markers on eosinophils can be analyzed without purification prior to staining and examined whether the expression of CD44 on peripheral blood eosinophils could be monitored as a marker of the control of BA. Staining of eosinophils with anti-CD16 and anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibodies enabled us to delineate eosinophils as VLA-4highCDl6- cells from other leukocyte populations in the whole blood. CD44 was constitutively expressed on resting eosinophils and expression increased following cytokine-mediated activation. In all BA patients examined, CD44high eosinophils were enriched in sputum relative to peripheral blood, indicating that eosinophils in sputum were more activated than those in the blood. By comparing the extent of CD44 expression on blood eosinophils from poorly controlled and well-controlled asthma patients, we unexpectedly found that the density of CD44 expression is lower on blood eosinophils from the poorly controlled group. Thus, the extent of CD44 expression on blood eosinophils defined as VLA- 4highCD16- cells is a novel marker indicative of the management of BA.",

This reaction was associated with marked airway neutrophilia without significant infiltration of eosinophils. A selective PDE IV inhibitor, T-440 (10-30 mg/kg), and a non-selective PDE inhibitor, theophylline (10 mg/kg), significantly inhibited airway obstruction and neutrophilia when administered orally. An anti-allergic drug, ketotifen (1 mg/kg), caused slight inhibition of airway obstruction, whereas it did not affect airway neutrophilia. These results suggest that neutrophilic inflammation plays a role in the airway obstructive reaction and that PDE has a regulatory role in obstructive airway disease associated with airway inflammation.",

There are no criteria to identify people at risk of initial venom anaphylaxis. Reactions may occur at any age and are unrelated to the time interval of prior venom exposure. There is an approximate 60% re-sting reaction rate in people who have had sting anaphylaxis and have positive venom skin tests. Re-sting reactions are more likely to occur in adults than in children and in people who have had more severe anaphylactic symptoms. Positive venom intradermal skin tests confirm the diagnosis of potential stinging insect allergy in people who have had sting reactions. Venom immunotherapy provides almost 100% protection from further sting reactions. It is recommended for all people who have had venom anaphylaxis and have positive skin tests, except for children who have dermal reactions only. Details of venom dosing are well established. The adequate duration of venom immunotherapy is still an unresolved issue. Conversion to a negative skin test appears to be an absolute criterion to discontinue treatment. In the presence of a persistent positive skin test, 3-5 years of immunotherapy is generally sufficient. People who have had severe reactions, such as loss of consciousenss, may require indefinite therapy.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of a positive family history with asthma and levels of serum IgE and IgE antibodies were examined in 136 patients with asthma in relation to age at onset of the disease. The frequency of subjects with a family history of asthma ranged from 37.9 to 75.0% in all groups classified by age at onset. The frequency of patients with a high serum IgE level (≥ 150 IU/mL) was higher (51.7–63.2%) in all groups than the frequency of patients with a low serum level (< 150 IU/mL). The mean level of serum IgE was significantly higher in patients with a family history than in those without a family history, in subjects between the ages of 50 and 59 years at onset (mean age 63.4 years; P < 0.02) and in those over the age of 60 years at onset (74.0 years; P < 0.01). The number of patients with a positive RAST score either to house dust mite (HDM), cockroach, and Candida tended to decrease as the age at onset increased. However, the frequency of positive RAST to HDM was higher in patients with a family history and who were over the age of 50 years at onset compared with those patients between the ages of 40 and 49 years at onset, although the frequency was significantly higher in patients with family history than in those without family history (P < 0.02). These results suggest that IgE-mediated allergic reactions are significant not only in those patients who are younger, but also in elderly patients with asthma.",

    "abstract": "In cases of occupational asthma due to reactive chemicals, an appreciable number of patients have persistent asthmatic symptoms and airway inflammation even after several years' avoidance of the cause agents. A case of late respiratory systemic syndrome (LRSS) caused by phthalic anhydride is reported. The patient showed a progression of bronchial asthma due to house dust mite and developed a new bronchial sensitization to horse hair during the 5 year follow-up period. The patient was diagnosed in September 1990 as having LRSS due to phthalic anhydride. He was atopic and had worked in a factory preparing materials for paints for 8 years. After leaving his workplace and commencing treatment with anti-asthmatic medications, his asthmatic symptoms and airway hyper-responsiveness were much improved for 1year (PC20 methacholine level was increased from 0.44 to 4.4 mg/mL). For several months before the second admission (October 1992) his asthmatic symptoms were again aggravated and methacholine PC20 decreased to 1.1mg/mL without improvement in the following 3 years. The level of serum specific IgE antibody to phthalic anhydride has been gradually decreasing, while specific IgE to two types of house dust mite and horse hair has been increasing year by year during the last 3 years' follow-up period. These findings suggest that chronic exposure to inhalant allergens can induce the progression of allergen-induced airway inflammation, and result in new bronchial sensitization to inhalant allergens. Careful follow-up study is needed to detect new developments of allergen-induced bronchoconstriction in occupational asthma patients with persistent asthmatic symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Several mechanisms of immunologic tolerance have been proposed, including deletion, anergy and active suppression. Deletion and anergy have been reported based on data from both in vivo and in vitro experiments, but evidence to support the involvement of active suppression in tolerance has been elusive, principally because of the difficulty in defining regulatory T (Tr) cells with immunosuppressive activity. However, data characterizing the function of Tr cells has recently begun to emerge both from experiments in the field of oral tolerance and from others utilizing transgenic (Tg) mice. One such model which we described uses Tg mice expressing a foreign physiological soluble antigen, beef insulin (BI), while another uses T cell receptor (α/β) Tg mice, whose T cell receptors (TCR) are specific for ovalbumin (OVA). Using such models, adoptive transfer of the Tr clones specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) from orally tolerant mice into naive mice was shown to protect the animals from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) has been shown to be responsible for the immuno-suppression. Tr clones functioning in self-tolerance have also been obtained from mice expressing TCR or BI transgenes. T cell cultures from OVA specific TCR expressing Tg mice were stimulated in the presence of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and OVA peptide to produce Tr clones. The Tr clones secreted IL-10 and TGF-β as immunosuppressive factors. Tr clones with a different characteristic have been obtained from BI Tg mice. Adoptive transfer of the Tr clones into normal mice suppressed the BI specific antibody response. These Tr clones have type II Th cytokine profile and produced TGF-β as an inhibitory cytokine. TGF-β production also led to functional bystander suppression in the BI Tg mice. These three different types of Tr clones show considerable heterogeneity in the cytokine profiles. Further investigation of Tr cells will be important for our understanding of autoimmunity and the development of tactics for the therapy of autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "Inhaled corticosteroid therapy remains the basis for the treatment of chronic asthma. Recent understanding of its use includes the benefits of early introduction, and of its plateaued dose-benefit effects. Additional beneficial effects on asthma control and prevention of asthma exacerbations can be obtained by combining middle-to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid with long-acting β-agonists and slow-release theophylline. Leukotriene inhibitors, particularly leukotriene receptor antagonists, are novel treatments that may also be combined with inhaled steroid therapy. Although current asthma treatments are very effective, a subgroup of asthma patients (difficult or therapy-resistant asthma) do not respond adequately to these treatments and need maintained oral corticosteroid therapy. New asthma treatments are particularly needed for this group. New treatments for asthma include more potent topical corticosteroids which have less potential for side-effects, inhibition of eosinophil chemotaxis and activation such as anti-IL-5, anti-eotaxin, eotaxin receptor antagonist, anti-VL-A4, anti-IgE therapy, restoring Th-1/Th-2 balance either by increasing Th-1 or reducing Th-2 T-cell activity, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, and specific inhibitors of PDE4. These treatments may be considered as either controllers, remitters (inducing remission of disease), or preventors according to their modes of action and their clinical effects. Currently, there does not appear to be any prospect of a cure for asthma.",

Furthermore, the effect of a LT receptor antagonist on HD allergen-induced bronchoconstrictive and cough responses was investigated. Treatment with a LT receptor antagonist resulted in disappearance of cough, improvement of respiratory function, decrease in eosinophil percentage in induced sputum and increase in capsaicin and histamine threshold.

While the cause is immunologic, little is known about the mediators involved. To investigate these mediators, three nurses with contact urticaria syndrome caused by exposure to cefotiam hydrochloride (CTM), and five normal controls were evaluated. IgE antibodies specific for CTM were detected by the radioallergosorbent technique (RAST). In response to CTM, cytokines were released from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and sulfidoleukotrienes were released from peripheral blood leukocytes. RAST counts in the three nurses with this syndrome exceeded those in the normal controls. The stimulation index of the leukotrienes released from the peripheral blood leukocytes in response to CTM also exceeded those in the normal controls. Higher levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were also detected in the supernatant of the patients' PBMC. The results suggest that contact urticaria syndrome caused by exposure to CTM was induced by an immunologic mechanism via IgE antibodies, and that GM-CSF and leukotrienes may be involved in this reaction.",

To elucidate the role of NO in asthma, we examined the expired NO concentrations in relation to the type (atopic, mixed, non- atopic), and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of asthmatics, as well as the influence of steroid treatment. Twenty-seven normal subjects, 48 asthmatics, 8 subjects with allergic rhinitis, and 13 subjects with pulmonary emphysema participated in the study. The expired NO concentration was significantly higher in asthmatics and patients with allergic rhinitis than in normal subjects (P< 0.01). No significant difference was observed between the expired NO concentration in patients with pulmonary emphysema and that of normal subjects. The expired NO concentrations were significantly lower in non- atopic asthma than in atopic asthma. Nitric oxide levels were significantly lower in severe asthma than in mild asthma. High doses of steroid treatment are often used in severe asthma. The dose of inhaled beclomethasone and expired NO concentrations showed a negative correlation (r = − 0.51587, P< 0.004). Drip infusion of hydrocortisone tended to increase the exhaled NO concentration just after drip infusion, however, it decreased after 24 h. These results suggest that steroid treatment decreases the expired NO concentrations in asthmatics, although it cannot be concluded that NO increases the severity of asthma. The measurement of expired NO concentrations is an easy, non-invasive test, which may be a useful tool for monitoring the condition of asthmatics.",

Herein, we describe a case of AIH with spontaneous remission and exacerbation. A previously healthy young Japanese woman presented with features of acute hepatitis. The patient was not acutely infected with hepatotrophic viruses and the possibility of drug-induced AIH was also excluded. A diagnosis of AIH was made from subjective symptoms and laboratory data, which showed increased levels of liver enzymes, total bilirubin, IgG and positive titers of antinuclear antibody. Finally, liver biopsy revealed an expansion of portal tracts and infiltration of mononuclear cells, including plasma cells. This patient experienced a total of three episodes of acute exacerbation of AIH during the past 5 years, two of which subsided spontaneously. An immunosuppressive drug was used to control the last episode of acute exacerbation of AIH, which was very similar to acute hepatitis. The immunosuppressive drug was withdrawn 7 months after the last epoisode of acute exacerbation of AIH and the patient is now passing an uneventful course. There are cases of spontaneous remission and acute exacerbation of AIH, although the underlying mechanism of this pathological process is yet to be determined. Liver biopsy is needed to diagnose these cases. Periodic follow up of these patients is required for proper management.",

It is one of the leading causes of the deterioration of the general condition of asthmatics and the limitation of physical activity. Therefore, early recognition and provision of adequate therapy is necessary. However, it is not possible to achieve this without first having information about the features of the bronchial response. The aim of the present study was to determine the bronchial response to exercise and to establish a connection between bronchial response and the clinical features of the disease in asthmatic children. One hundred and three clinically stable children with different clinical severities of asthma were studied with a standardized step-up exercise test. The airway response to exercise was investigated by peak flowmetry to measure the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Bronchial permeability was determined before and after exercise at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min and then hourly for the next 11 h. These determinations were repeated at the same time points on a non- exercise (control) day. The test resulted in four types of response to exercise: (i) non-obstructive; (ii) isolated early airway response (EAR); (iii) dual-waved; and (iv) prolonged EAR. The frequency of these responses in the study population was 33.0, 39.81, 26.21 and 0.97%, respectively. No significant difference in clinical features, such as severity and duration of disease, baseline values for PEFR, atopic status, age and gender, was observed with different forms of response to exercise. However, children with moderate and severe asthma had significantly more frequent EIB- positive type responses than children with a mild form of asthma. Responses to exercise in asthmatic children are heterogeneous and, quite possibly, are particular to each individual patient.",

An animal model of bronchial asthma was created and lung tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. Compared with periods without an asthmatic attack, the PFN level was significantly lower during periods with more severe asthmatic attacks in 15 patients with bronchial asthma. In contrast, the SFN level was significantly higher during periods with more severe asthmatic attacks. In a guinea pig model of asthmatic bronchitis, FN was positively stained in the subepithelial or submucosal tissue and abraded epithelial cells in the alveolar space during asthmatic attacks. Marked eosinophilic infiltration was also noted in the same tissues and cells. A negative correlation was noted between the number of peripheral eosinophils and the PFN level. In contrast, a positive correlation was noted between the number of sputum eosinophils, which reflects the severity of asthmatic attacks, and the SFN level. An experimental study was performed to investigate the relationship between eosinophils and FN. A positive relationship was noted between eosiophil chemotaxis, increased adherence of activated eosinophils and FN levels. It is suggested that FN may enhance allergic reactions at an early or acute phase of bronchial asthma.",

We also examined sputum levels of thromboxane (TX) B2 and histamine because these mediators are considered to be as important as sLT. The induced sputa by 3% hypertonic saline inhalation were treated with high-performance liquid chromatography and levels of sLT, TXB2 and histamine were measured with enzyme immunoassay kits. These compounds tended to be elevated in asymptomatic asthmatic patients compared with healthy controls, but the differences were not significant. Levels of sLT and TXB2 showed no difference between atopic and non-atopic patients, but histamine levels were higher in atopic patients than in non-atopic patients. However, sputa during the exacerbation contained significantly higher levels of sLT than those during the asymptomatic state. In contrast, neither histamine nor TXB2 showed any changes with exacerbation. These results suggest that sLT may be one of the most potent for mounting the exacerbation of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Flowcytometric analysis of purified eosinophils requires several hours to accomplish due mainly to purification of cells; moreover, it requires more than 20 mL blood and expensive reagents. The aim of the present study was to develop a method of direct flowcytometric analysis for eosinophils using whole blood. Peripheral blood obtained from five healthy individuals (mean age 42 years) and 10 patients with eosinophilia (mean age 40.3 years) were used for analysis. We stained antigens (CD9 or CD16) and fixed cells with parabenzoquinone (PBQ) or paraformaldehyde (PFA) after hemolyzation followed by treatment with N-octyl-β-glucopyranoside (OG). On comparison of forward scatter with side scatter dot plots among samples treated with hemolyzation alone, PBQ fixation and PFA fixation, PBQ fixation showed the best results in discriminating eosinophils from other leukocyte fractions on the cytogram. Following fixation and permeabilization of cells, EG2, a secretory form of eosinophil cationic protein, was stained as an intracellular antigen. Flowcytometric analysis for EG2 showed a high positivity rate only in the eosinophil fraction. There were no differences in EG2 positivity or mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) between heparinized and EDTA-treated blood. Comparison of samples treated with OG at 6.0 and 7.4 mg/mL showed that the latter had a higher MFI for EG2 without significant change in the positivity rate. The findings show that intra- and extracellular properties of eosinophils can be analyzed with whole blood using PBQ fixation and OG treatment at a concentration of 7.4 mg/mL. Direct flowcytometric analysis of eosinophils saves time and requires only a small amount of blood, both of which are advantageous for patients and laboratory workers.",

    "abstract": "Using severe combined immunodeficiency mice engrafted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atopic patients, we analyzed the regulatory effects of anti-CD154 antibody on the in vivo induction of human interleukin (IL)-4 and IgE expression. Although anti-CD154 treatment of engrafted mice abrogated mature Cε transcription and IgE production, IL-4 mRNA levels were enhanced by the treatment. In addition, anti-CD154-induced enhancement of intracellular IL-4 synthesis was detectable in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. Furthermore, upregulation of germline Cε transcription could be seen in anti-CD154-treated mice. These results demonstrate that blocking the CD154-CD40 interaction with anti-CD154 differentially regulates IL-4 synthesis in T cells and IgE production in B cells. Our data also indicate that antibody ligation of CD154 on T cells causes enhanced synthesis of IL-4, thereby contributing to upregulation of germline Cε transcription in B cells.",

    "abstract": "The relevance of obesity on asthma control in identical twins Dear EditorAsthma is a multifactorial disorder characterized by typical symptoms, airway inflammation, and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR).The asthma control should be considered the goal of its management; asthma is clinically classified as controlled, partly controlled, and uncontrolled (http://www.ginasthma.com).The asthma control test (ACT) may be an easy way to assess the patient's perception of asthma control. 1 On the other hand, also obesity is characterized by mild inflammation. 2Cross-sectional and caseecontrol surveys reported that obesity and overweight increased the odds of asthma incidence, 3 and weight loss is associated with asthma improvement in obese subjects. 4Consequently, there is convinced belief that a link between obesity and asthma exists. 5Body mass index (BMI) is considered a universal indicator of adiposity according to WHO criteria (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en).In this regard, we previously reported that BMI positively related with BHR severity in patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis. 6Moreover, a BMI 25, such as overweight, is a risk factor for having impaired lung function, BHR, and bronchial inflammation in patients with allergic rhinitis. 7These outcomes underline the close link between adiposity and asthma.Therefore, this topic is particularly interesting for the clinician.In this regard, a recent paper addressed this issue and underlined the close association between asthma and obesity. 8or these reasons, we would like to present a particular case concerning two identical twins with asthma.They are males, 30 years old, and are still living with parents.They began with preschool wheezing at 2 years.Then, they had several hospital admissions for recurrent exacerbations.Allergic rhinitis and asthma were diagnosed at 6 years.Respiratory, both nasal and bronchial, symptoms are perennial with symptom deterioration during the spring.Further, both developed oral allergic syndrome after eating apple and peach.Typically, they ever become ill for viral respiratory infection at the same time and then typically together have asthma exacerbation.Their history is very specular also concerning allergic symptoms occurrence.In fact, living in the same familiar environment, they are exposed practically to the same triggers, including viral infections and inhaled and food allergen exposure.The only relevant difference concerns the job: one (twin A) is a harbour clerical, the other (twin B) is a taxi driver.Recently, a reassessment of asthma and allergic rhinitis has been performed.Table 1 summarizes the principal parameters Peer review under responsibility of Japanese Society of Allergology.",

    "abstract": "I read with interest the article by Takashi Yoshimasu and Fukumi Furukawa on eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori associated urticaria1 and entirely agree that future guidelines on urticaria should highlight this issue with an aim to formulate separate management strategy for these patients. In fact, our last published guidelines on chronic urticaria discuss the importance of this infection in both acute and chronic (episodic) urticarias.2 Active surveillance for detection of H pylori is one of the strategies I have adopted in my practice given the high incidence of this infection and gastric cancer in this region (H pylori seroprevalence rates in Bangladesh 92%, Kuwait 84% and India at 79%).3 I would therefore like to share my experience of H pylori associated urticaria from my clinic in eastern India. Of 25 dyspeptic patients screened for H pylori with upper GI endoscopy over last year, 6 (5 males, 1 female) were found to be positive for rapid urease test at endoscopy (mean age 42.2 years, range 29-54 years). The duration of urticaria (spontaneous, pressure and solar) ranged from 1-6 years and all patients were on multiple antihistamines including ebastine and montelukast (leukotriene receptor antagonist) at various time points and never achieved complete remission (CR, i.e., always required to be on anti-histamines). Two patients were positive for anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, while one had prostatomegaly. All improved symptomatically and achieved CR within 3 months after receiving H pylori eradication therapy (pantoprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 750 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg for 14 days) and combination of fexofenadine 180 mg with hydroxyzine 25-50 mg. In contrast, 6 children (aged 7-15 years) with chronic episodic urticaria screened for the presence of H pylori IgG antibodies using ELISA were negative, and improved on pantoprazole and fexofenadine over 6 months. It is important that clinicians recognize that H pylori not only pose a substantial burden in terms of gastric cancer, but also in some patients with chronic ‘ idiopathic’ urticaria where directed investigations and treatment may prove beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance use of short-acting adrenergic agents can cause tachyphylaxis, increased non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity, poorer clinical control, a worsened late allergic reaction and possibly an increased risk of death; therefore, 'as needed' use is preferable. The choice of a first line anti-inflammatory drug, between inhaled corticosteroids and non-steroidal drugs (cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium), has to be made considering their risk–benefit ratio. Although in severe patients the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids is clearly superior to that of cromolyn, in mild-to-moderate patients the efficacy is comparable. In terms of safety, non-steroidal drugs have a better safety profile than inhaled corticosteroids, which can cause growth suppression even at regular doses, especially in mild-to-moderate patients. Although some investigators have raised the possibility of irreversible airway obstruction if treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is delayed, studies by my group and others, using non-steroidal drugs as first line, have not confirmed that suspicion. In conclusion, a step-wise approach in children is still justified, starting with non-steroidal drugs (cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium) in mild persistent asthma and using inhaled corticosteroids only in patients poorly controlled by the non-steroidal drugs.",

Thus, the effects of IL-10 were examined on the production of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-5, IL-1 β, IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-γ by antigen (Dermatophagoides farinae, Df)- stimulated mononuclear cells obtained from asthmatic patients who were sensitized with the antigen and from healthy subjects in vitro. Production of IL-5 and IL-2 was enhanced by Df antigen in the asthmatic subjects, but not in the healthy controls. In contrast, levels of GM-CSF, IFN-γ and IL-1 β production were enhanced by the antigen in both groups. Exogenous IL-10 (10 ng/mL) inhibited the production of GM-CSF, IFN-γ and IL-iβ induced by Df antigen in both groups and also inhibited the production of IL-5 and IL-2 induced by the antigen in the asthmatics subjects. The inhibition of GM-CSF production by IL-10 was stronger than that by IL-4. These results indicated that the responsiveness to the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on the production of inflammatory cytokines is not abrogated in asthmatic patients and that IL-10 may be useful in the treatment of bronchial asthma.",

Five-fold applications of DNFB on ears once per week elicited severe contact dermatitis with marked infiltration of inflammatory cells and elevation of anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-IgE antibody in the serum. The Am-80 significantly inhibited ear swelling in a dose-dependent manner. In the histopathologic study, infiltration of inflammatory cells was clearly decreased by Am-80.

The effects of Am-80 on the transcriptional level of cytokines, interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-4 in cervical lymph nodes were investigated. Marked elevation of mRNA for all cytokines was observed and Am-80 potently inhibited the expression of IFN-γ mRNA, but not IL-1 and IL-4 mRNA. These findings indicated that Am-80 may inhibit the contact dermatitis at the post-sensitization phase by inhibiting IFN-γ production at the transcriptional level in mice.",

The oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter (SpO2), and the peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured before and 10 min after furosemide inhalation. Although a little improvement in SpO2 and PEF was observed after the furosemide inhalation, the results were inferior to those with an inhaled β2-agonist (procaterol hydrochloride). Long-term furosemide therapy was performed in two cases; however, amelioration of the SpO2 levels (> 90%) and PEF (> 80% of personal best) was not observed within 8 days of medication with furosemide.

Three treatment sets, an oxitropium bromide inhalation only group, an oxitropium bromide inhalation plus endotoxin injection group (in vivo) and an oxitropium bromide incubation group (in vitro) were studied as to diaphragm muscle contractile properties. Oxitropium bromide inhalation shifted force-frequency curves upward at 2 h after inhalation (p < 0.05) and inhibited the decrease of force-frequency curves due to endotoxin injection in vivo. Incubation with oxitropium bromide of untreated diaphragm muscle and diaphragm muscle injected with endotoxin did not increase the force-frequency curves dose-dependently in vitro; however, it caused both types of muscle to be fatigue resistant. We speculate that the increment of muscle contractility with the inhalation of oxitropium bromide was induced by the antagonization of musucarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR). In addition, the changes of fatigue resistance provoked by oxitropium bromide, which also is speculated to antagonize mAChR, may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with COPD.",

    "abstract": "Treatment strategy that reduces dependence on long-term medication for chronic asthma is preferable. The purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy of an early intensive intervention for inducing inactive asthma in adults and identify factors that affect the efficacy. A prospective study was conducted on subjects who had asthma for two years or less. An intensive intervention consisting of systemic corticosteroid treatment for two weeks followed by inhaled corticosteroid for further 16 weeks with concomitant administration of bronchodilator(s) was administrated on 109 subjects. As a control group, 33 subjects were treated according to the current asthma treatment guidelines for 18 weeks. The primary outcome of the intervention was assessed with symptomatology and use of medication during 12 months after the cessation of treatment period. At one year after the intervention, significantly more patients in the intensive intervention group (41%) than in the control group (24%) had no respiratory symptoms and were medication-free or had experienced minor upper respiratory symptoms (inactive asthma) (P = 0.01). The intensive intervention maintained a significant factor associated with one-year inactive asthma (adjusted odds ratio: 3.61, 95% confidence interval: 1.2010.84; P = 0.02). Infection as onset cause, asthma duration and pre-treatment %FEV1.0 were also identified independently associated with inactive asthma. As the limitation, the study was not randomized trial. Intensive therapy in the early stage is very likely to contribute to increasing one-year asthma inactivity, which may reduce patients' dependence on long-term management by medical treatment.",

Airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells are known to produce these cytokines in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; however, it has not been determined whether mechanical strain could induce cytokine production by ASM cells. In addition, in the present study we also examined the effect of inhalant corticosteroids, namely fluticasone propionate (FP) and budesonide (BUD), on RANTES and eotaxin production. To clarify these issues, human ASM cells cultured on silicone culture rubber dishes that had been incubated with or without inhalant corticosteroids were stretched or compressed. The ASM cells were simultaneously stimulated with TNF-α. The concentration of RANTES and eotaxin in the culture supernatants was determined. The results showed that: (i) mechanical strain, including stretch and compression, stimulated ASM cells to produce RANTES and eotaxin; and (ii) FP and BUD inhibited mechanical strain-induced and TNF-α-stimulated RANTES and eotaxin production by ASM cells. These results indicate that mechanical strain is capable of inducing RANTES and eotaxin production by ASM cells and that inhalant corticosteroids effectively inhibit RANTES and eotaxin production by mechanical strain-loaded ASM cells, as well as by TNF-α-stimulated cells. Mechanical strain and inflammatory stimuli are capable of inducing chemokine production; therefore, suppressing the contraction of, as well as chemokine production by, ASM cells is important for controlling the production and the progression of allergic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The mainstay of chronic asthma management consists of using pharmacological agents that induce bronchodilatation, such as short-acting β-adrenergic receptor agonists (bronchodilators or relievers), and that control the chronic inflammatory process, such as corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory or controllers). Short-acting β-adrenergic receptor agonists are the best relievers, whereas inhaled corticosteroids, by inhibiting eosinophilic and lymphocytic inflammation and mediator/cytokine expression, remain the mainstay chronic treatment of asthma. Long-acting β-adrenergic receptor agonists are best used in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids, providing additive bronchodilatation, better asthma control and reduced exacerbation rates in patients with moderate to severe asthma. Slow-release theophylline combines bronchodilator and some anti-inflammatory effects and is best used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids. Leukotriene inhibitors, by either inhibiting the effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes or reducing their production, also cause some bronchodilator effects with inhibition of eosinophilic inflammation. They are effective in mild-tomoderate asthma, but low-dose inhaled steroids are more efficacious; leukotriene inhibitors also provide additive effects in combination with inhaled steroids. Increased understanding of the immunology and inflammatory responses has led to the identification of novel targets and to the development of potentially new therapies. These include immunologic targets, such as those against T cells and T cell-related targets, anticytokine therapies and anti-IgE approaches. New effective therapies are particularly needed for patients with severe asthma who do not respond to currently available treatments.",

    "abstract": "Triggering of the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) can lead to various functional outcomes, such as activation and proliferation, anergy or cell death. This differential signaling is mainly determined by the quality and quantity of TCR signals, the nature of accessory signals and the differentiation/maturation status of the T cell. In this regard, T cell development and differentiation of the two major T helper (Th) subsets, namely Th1 and Th2 cells, can also be viewed as examples of differential signaling. In the present report, we review two T cell-selective signaling molecules (protein kinase C (PKC) θ and SLAT), which we have studied extensively and that appear to play important roles in the process of differential signaling. The novel PKC isoform PKCθ is selectively expressed in T lymphocytes and is essential for TCR-triggered activation of mature T cells via activation of the nuclear factor-κB and activator protein-1 pathways. Productive engagement of T cells by antigen-presenting cells (APC) results in recruitment of PKCθ to the T cell-APC contact area, the immunological synapse (IS), where it interacts with several signaling molecules to induce activation signals essential for productive T cell activation and interleukin-2 production. These events are associated with PKCθ translocation to membrane lipid rafts, which also localize to the IS. The Vav/Rac pathway promotes the recruitment of PKCθ to the IS or lipid rafts as well as its activation. SLAT is a novel adapter protein, which we isolated recently. It is selectively expressed in Th2 lineage cells, where it is found associated with the TCR-coupled protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. Our initial characterization of SLAT indicates that, by regulating the overall strength of TCR signaling, it may play an important role in differential signaling processes, which promote the differentiation and activation of allergy promoting and anti-inflammatory Th2 cells.",

    "abstract": "The first successful lung transplantation (LTx) was performed in 1983. Since then, more than 10 000 LTx have been performed in the world, with approximately 1000 new cases each year in recent years. Lung transplantation is established as the ultimate treatment for end-stage pulmonary diseases. Clinical application of LTx was delayed in Japan because of difficulty in acceptance of brain death. The Japanese Brain Death Act (JBDA) for organ transplantation was enforced in October 1997. Now, LTx from a brain-dead cadaver donor (BDCD) becomes a clinical option for end-stage lung diseases in this country. Four LTx centers were selected and the registration of candidates for LTx started in August 1998. In total, up until May 2001, 51 patients had been registered on a waiting list. Patients’ diseases for LTx in Japan are different from those in the US and Europe. So far, primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH; n = 23), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/interstitial pneumonia (IPF/IIP; n = 8), lymph- angioleiomyomatosis (LAM; n = 7) and bronchiectasis (BE; n = 6) are the major indications for LTx in Japan. Fourteen patients (27%) have died while waiting for LTx and only eight patients (14%) have received lung allografts. The BDCD are quite precious and, thus far, only 13 donors have become available after enforcement of the JBDA. Although the average utilization of BDCD for LTx was reported to be only 10–20%, positive utility of marginal donors in Japan has led to a higher rate (five of 13; 36%). Six LTx were performed from five BDCD. These included five single LTx (LAM n = 3; IPF/IIP n = 2) and one bilateral LTx (PPH n = 1). Because there are few BDCD in Japan, living-donor lobar LTx (LDLTx) is thought to be the optimal choice for selected patients. Eight LDLTx (BE n = 2; bronchiolitis obliterans n = 2; IPF/IIP n = 2; LAM n = 1; and PPH n = 1) have been performed. All recipients who received a LTx in Japan are alive and doing well at present.",

    "abstract": "Asthmatics are considered to be at high risk for pulmonary complications during general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. The purpose of the present study was to determine the usefulness of perioperative corticosteroids for mild asthmatics in preventing perioperative exacerbation of asthma. Airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine was determined in patients with intermittent (n = 27) and mild persistent (n = 48) asthma before general anesthesia who underwent surgery between January 1990 and January 1999. All patients were treated with corticosteroids during the perioperative period, consisting of a course of oral prednisolone 10–20 mg/day for 1–2 days pre-operatively, methylprednisolone 80–125 mg 2 h before the operation, followed by 80 mg methylprednisolone just after the operation. The incidence of perioperative bronchospasm was evaluated based on medical records. Airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine was determined in six other asthmatics before and after a similar regimen of perioperative corticosteroids treatment. Only three cases (4.0%) developed mild asthma during the perioperative period. No evidence of adverse effects of corticosteroids was noted in any case. The use of the same therapeutic regimen in another six asthmatics significantly suppressed airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine. Our results suggest that perioperative corticosteroids are effective in preventing perioperative bronchospasm in stable asthmatics during surgery under general anesthesia by suppressing airway hyperresponsiveness.",

    "abstract": "In the 1990s, the definition of asthma changed as we realized that asthma is fundamentally an inflammatory disorder. It was also shown in both adults and children that treatment should be initiated with antiinflammatory medication (preferably inhaled steroids) and delayed treatment may worsen lung function outcome. There is increasing evidence that, in both children and adults, early and effective therapy with inhaled steroids results in long-term remission in the majority of patients. In future, even intermittent asthma symptoms will be treated with inhaled steroids. The first signs of asthma should be treated effectively, even in small babies. In children with atopic dermatitis, early pharmacotherapy may prevent asthma and in children with hay fever, specific immunotherapy may reduce the asthma risk. Airway eosinophilia predisposes a patient to asthma. The benefit of early intervention in patients who show eosinophilic airway inflammation but have normal or near normal lung function has been recently demonstrated. It seems that we should treat 'asthma even before asthma', if the disease is defined in terms of lung function. Persistent asthma is difficult to reverse, but early stages of asthma could be more responsive to novel therapies, such as drugs modifying the pro-inflammatory cytokines or monoclonal antibodies against IgE. The emerging new methods to assess airway inflammation will cast light on the origin of asthma, as well as on the determinants of disease persistence. Along with the development of practical inflammatory markers, the doctor gets a clearer picture of the disease. This means a better understanding for the doctor and better tailored treatment for the patient and this will further improve treatment results.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a common condition, and diagnosis, severity, and control of the disease can be determined both subjectively and objectively. It is important to assume that recurrent breathlessness is due to asthma in primary care. Treatment without a definite diagnosis and a careful monitoring of the disease risks unnecessary side effects and costs, and may fail to identify and address the real issue. Physical examination of the patient is one of the initial steps to diagnose asthma, where abnormal lung sounds including wheezing and rhonchi are characteristic. In this issue of Allergology International, Nagasaka 1 describes that an increase of the frequency and or intensity of lung sounds is associated with airway wall oscillation and vortex shedding in central airways, and that this change may be more sensitive to airway narrowing than the appearance of wheezing and rhonchi. 2 He also emphasizes the importance of a forced expiratory wheeze, which is an early sign of airway obstruction in patients with mild asthma, and points out possible usefulness of a recently developed computerized and automated analysis of lung sound in the management of the disease. 3 There is ample evidence that endogenous nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in regulating airway function and that upregulation of NO by inflammatory cytokines and mediators in the airways can be monitored easily in exhaled air. Munakata 4 implicates in this issue that exhaled NO ( FeNO ) is a non-invasive marker of airway inflammation. In asthma, increased FeNO reflects eosinophil-mediated inflammatory pathways moderately well and predicts good responses to treatment with inhaled corticosteroid. 5",

In this study, we investigated the clinical usefulness of the mean hourly number of acid refluxes, designated as the mean number of acid refluxes/hour (h) during the upright position in addition to the pH index for the diagnosis of GERD. The subjects were 22 preschool asthmatic children. When the reflux index was over 4% or the mean number of acid refluxes/h during the upright position were three times more frequent than those during the supine position even if the reflux index was below 4%, we prescribed famotidine. Children whose asthmatic symptoms improved with famotidine were included in a GERD group. Children who did not meet the criteria by pH monitoring were included in a non-GERD group in asthmatic children. The GERD group was comprised of 9 children. In 2 out of 9 GERD group children, the reflux index was below 4%. The median of the mean number of acid refluxes/h during the upright position was 12.9 in the GERD group, and 3.15 in the non-GERD group. The mean number of acid refluxes/h during the upright position were associated with asthmatic symptoms (p < 0.05). Reflux during the upright position was associated with asthmatic symptoms. The mean number of acid refluxes/h during the upright position in addition to the reflux index could be useful in the diagnosis of GERD when associated with asthma.",

AI is publishing theme issues that include reviews in important fields of current research activity written by eminent experts. The theme of this issue is “ Primary Immunodeficiency and Related Diseases”. Cutaneous manifestations are displayed as both concomitant or more rarely main symptoms in immunological disorders such as immunedeficiency disease, autoimmune disease, or autoinflammatory disease. Patients with immunedeficiency often have cutaneous abnormalities ( eczema, telangiectasia, molluscum contagiosum, warts, etc.) and chronic eczema is a common problem, including atopic dermatitis-like skin lesion. On the other hand, autoinflammatory disease, which is categorized as a group of inflammatory disorders that are non-infectious, non-allergic, nonautoimmune and non-immuno-deficient, also displays distinctive cutaneous manifestations. 1 Tadashi Ariga discusses about Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), including the renewed clinical and basic researches for WAS. WAS is characterized clinically with the triad; immunodeficiency, bleeding tendency with microthrombocytopenia and severe eczema. Topical tacrolimus would be effective in some WAS patients with severe eczema. The pathogenesis of eczema in WAS remains unknown; however, the similar basis for atopic dermatitis could be considered, because high level of IgE and inbalanced cytokine production patterns (Th1 < Th2) are generally observed. 2 Minegishi and Saito discusses comprehensively reviewed hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES). HIES is a complex primary immunodeficiency, characterized by atopic dermatitis-like skin lesion associated with extremely high serum IgE levels and susceptibility to infections with extracellular bacteria and fungi. Yoshiyuki Minegishi is an excellent pioneer for clinical and basic researches of HIES and identified that most of the patients with HIES have dominant negative mutations in STAT3. 3",

A231 87-stimulated synthesis of cysteinyl LT and LTB4 was measured by HPLC in the absence or presence of various concentrations of Koboku in rat basophilic leukemia-1 (RBL-1) cells. In a dose-dependent manner, Koboku inhibited synthesis of cysteinyl LT and LTB4 by up to 92.3 and 100%, respectively. Immunoglobulin E-mediated release of cysteinyl LT and LTB4, which was measured by specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) was also inhibited by Koboku in RBL-2H3 cells. Sites of inhibition of Koboku in the metabolic pathway of LT synthesis were phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), but not LTC4 synthase or LTA4 hydrolase. We conclude that the anti-allergic effect of Koboku may be attributable, at least in part, to the inhibition of LT synthesis.",

The isotonic contraction of β-escin-treated skinned tracheal muscle from guinea-pig was measured. When the intracellular Ca2 + concentration was maintained at 1 μmol/L in the presence of guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP; 100 μmol/L), neither isoproterenol (10nmol/L) nor salbutamol (60 nmol/L) affected Ca2 + sensitivity, but a significant decrease in Ca2 + sensitivity was observed in the presence of okadaic acid (1 μmol/L). The decrease in Ca2 + sensitivity was a slow response and was blocked by pretreatment with propranolol (1 μmol/L). Forskolin (1 μmol/L) did not affect Ca2 + sensitivity. These results suggest that adrenergic b 2-agonists may activate protein phosphatase through an unknown pathway involving the β2-receptor, which enhances dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain and/or thin filament proteins, resulting in relaxation of the tracheal smooth muscle.",

However, there are no predictive factors that help to determine which patients with asthma are likely to be tapered off inhaled corticosteroids successfully. We examined whether any factor or combination of factors could help the clinician safely discontinue inhaled steroid therapy. Thirty-six asthmatic children whose symptoms were stable on low-dose beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) were divided by parental choice into two groups: maintenance BDP (n = 11) and no BDP (n = 25). Methacholine inhalation tests were performed at the beginning of the study and after 1 month. Twelve children (48%) who had BDP discontinued developed exacerbations after 2–3 months, whereas there were no problems in the maintenance group. The no BDP group was retrospectively divided into two subgroups: exacerbation (+) and (−). The threshold to methacholine in the exacerbation (+) subgroup decreased significantly in advance of clinical symptoms. The two subgroups were analyzed statistically by two-group discriminant function analysis. The change in threshold to methacholine, the dose and potency of drugs, duration of asthma and gender (female) correlated with exacerbation. These results suggest that discontinuation of inhaled steroids should be done carefully, even in stable asthmatic children. The methacholine inhalation test, gender, drugs and history may be used as references for discontinuing inhaled steroids.",

To investigate inherent airway reactivity, we compared tracheal reactivity to various chemical mediators in NC, BALB/c, C57BL/6 and A/J mice in vitro. NC mice showed significantly greater reactivity to acetylcholine than BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and a reactivity comparable to that of A/J mice, which are known as high responders. Then, airway reactivity to acetylcholine was investigated in those strains in vivo. NC mice again showed comparable airway reactivity to that seen in A/J mice and a significantly greater reactivity than that seen in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. To investigate the effects of airway inflammation on airway reactivity to acetylcholine in vivo, NC and BALB/c mice were sensitized to and challenged with antigen. Sensitization to and challenge with antigen induced accumulation of inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils, in lung and increased airway reactivity in NC and BALB/c mice. These results indicate that NC mice exhibit inherent and antigen-induced airway hyperreactivity. Therefore, NC mice are a suitable strain to use in investigating the mechanisms underlying airway hyperreactivity and such studies will provide beneficial information for understanding the pathophysiology of asthma.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to examine the effects of adrenomedullin (AM) on airway epithelial cells. Primary cultures of guinea-pig tracheal epithelial cells and the human bronchiolar epithelial cell line NCI-H441 were used. Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and stable end-products of nitric oxide were assayed. Adrenomedullin (10− 6 mol/L) stimulated cAMP production in guinea-pig epithelial cells. Indomethacin (10− 5 mol/L) significantly decreased the basal level of intracellular cAMP in guinea-pig epithelial cells, but not in NCI-H441 cells. However, AM did not stimulate production of PGE2, a major product that can increase cAMP formation. In the case of NCI-H441 cells, AM (10− 8 – 10− 6 mol/L) did not significantly affect intracellular cGMP levels or nitrite content in conditioned medium. Adrenomedullin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) each stimulated cAMP production in NCI-H441 cells, but AM-stimulated cAMP production was antagonized by the CGRP fragment CGRP8–37. These findings suggest that AM stimulates cAMP production and functionally competes with CGRP for binding sites in airway epithelial cells, at least in human epithelial cells, but that it does not stimulate the release of PGE2 and nitric oxide. Though cyclooxygenase products contribute to some extent to cAMP formation in guinea-pigs, AM independently stimulates intracellular cAMP formation in airway epithelial cells.",

Significantly, a higher proportion of FcεRI-binding IgE in SAC than that in AKC may reflect the differences in pathologic states of AKC and SAC that are caused by a disparity in immune responses in these diseases.",

The airway responsiveness (AR) was evaluated by specific airway resistance. The inhalation of P-L-L significantly enhanced AR to methacholine, and increased TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1α in the BALF. The enhanced AR and the increase of TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1α were both significantly inhibited by pretreatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; anionic protein; 10 mg/mL for 6 min inhalation). Furthermore, thromboxane (TX) synthase inhibitor (ozagrel), thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonist (ONO-3708), and bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (BBRA; Nα-adamantaneacetyl-D-Arg [Hyp3, Thi5,8, D-Phe7]-bradykinin) inhibited the cation-induced AHR.

Production of various cytokines and IRBP-specific antibody, as well as IRBP-specific proliferation response, was assessed. Complete inhibition of EAU in rats, both by clinical and histologic criteria, was achieved with 50 mg/kg CAM when administered daily for 14 days following IRBP immunization. Partial inhibition was observed at lesser doses of CAM. This CAM-mediated response was accompanied by diminished production of cytokines interleukin-2, interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as a reduction in IRBP-specific antibody production. Furthermore, administration of CAM either in the induction phase only (days 0–7) or in the effector phase only (days 9 or 11 to day 20) was also capable of suppressing EAU, as assessed histopathologically on day 20. We conclude that CAM is effective in suppressing EAU in rats and its mechanism of action appears to involve modulation of T cell function.",

Bronchial responsiveness to HI and SP was assessed by calculation of-log PC250 HI and -log PC250 SP, respectively, where the PC250 is the provocative concentration producing a 250% increase in lung resistance. Endotoxin increased bronchial responsiveness to SP but not to HI and caused airway inflammation characterized by accumulation of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) without increasing SP-induced airway microvascular leakage assessed by the extravasation of Evans blue dye. The actively sensitized animals showed a tendency to increase the value of -logPC250 SP (P < 0.1) compared with that of non-sensitized control animals. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying preferential bronchial hyperresponsiveness to SP, neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activities in the airways were measured. Neutral endopeptidase activities were significantly decreased in actively sensitized animals and were further decreased in endotoxin-exposed animals. There was a significant inverse correlation between NEP activity and bronchial responsiveness to SP (r = − 0.55; P < 0.001), while no such relationship was observed for HI. These data suggest that NEP mediates endotoxin-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness to SP and that active sensitization may affect bronchial responsiveness to SP in guinea pigs.",

To examine whether late nasal symptoms were associated with infiltration of T cells and eosinophils and also with preferential expression of T helper 2 (Th2) cell type cytokine mRNA, nasal biopsies were performed before and 24 h after latex provocation and were processed for immunohistology and in situ hybridization. Latex induced early and late nasal responses. After latex provocation, the numbers of T cells and eosinophils were markedly increased compared with number on the control day. In situ hybridization confirmed Th2 type cytokine mRNA expression at 24 h after latex provocation.

Because no studies have evaluated the efficacy of PEF zone management on the basis of patients' physical activity, we studied the appearance of exercise-induced asthma (EIA) using treadmill exercise challenging in asthma patients whose PEF values had been maintained in the green zone for at least 3 months. Exercise-induced asthma was induced in nine of 44 (20.5%) asthma patients. The acetylcholine concentration required to cause a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (log PC20) was significantly lower in patients with EIA (2.39 ± 0.21 μg/mL) compared with patients without EIA (3.22 ± 0.12 μg/mL; P < 0.03). These results suggest that PEF green zone management alone does not ensure the ability to perform vigorous physical activity, especially in patients whose airway reactivity remains enhanced. Therefore, airway reactivity should be considered for asthma management.",

We investigated the effect of TJ-96 on leukotriene (LT)C4 release from eosinophils and basophils isolated from healthy volunteers. Pre-incubation of eosinophils with TJ-96 inhibited ionophore- or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)-induced LTC4 generation by eosinophils in a dose-dependent fashion. The TJ-96 was more potent in the release by ionophore (IC50 = 60 mg/mL) than the release induced by FMLP (IC50 = 300 mg/mL). Maximal inhibition was observed when eosinophils were pretreated with TJ-96 for 5 min. Although TJ-96 at high concentrations inhibited IgE-mediated histamine release from human basophils, inhibition of IgE-mediated LTC4 release was not statistically significant. The potent inhibitory activity was found in the extract of Glycyrrhiza root, one of the herbal components of TJ-96, but the inhibitory effects were not due to either glycyrrhizin or liquiritin, the main elements of the Glycyrrhiza root. These results raise the possibility that the clinical efficacy of TJ-96 is derived, at least in part, from its potent inhibitory effect on LTC4 release from eosinophils.",

    "abstract": "Monocytes/macrophages have recently been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. As the level of soluble CD14 (sCD14) in serum is considered a marker of monocyte/macrophage activation, we measured the levels of sCD14 in allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD), along with acute infectious and inflammatory diseases, to see its clinical relevance. Serum samples were taken from patients with acute infectious and inflammatory diseases, allergic asthma, and atopic dermatitis. sCD14 was measured with our own ELISA system and its level in each disease was compared with normal controls as well as its disease severity. sCD14 was elevated and correlated with C-reactive protein in infectious and inflammatory diseases (n = 26), confirming that it reflects inflammation. sCD14 was also significantly increased both in asthma (n = 94) and adult chronic AD (n = 22). In asthmatic patients, those with higher sCD14 tended to have more severe symptoms, but there was no statistical correlation between sCD14 and severity. In adult chronic AD patients, a correlation between sCD14 and disease severity was observed. However, sCD14 was not elevated in infant AD patients (n = 18) irrespective of severity, suggesting differences in the degree of monocyte/macrophage involvement in the pathogenesis between adult chronic and infant AD. The levels of sCD14 were shown to be upregulated in allergic diseases and might be useful as a marker of monocyte/macrophage involvement in allergic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Asthma in the elderly needs more attention in an aging society. However, it is likely to remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. This study aimed to clarify clinical characteristics of new-onset asthma in the elderly, describing the prevalence, predictive factors, and comorbidities after asthma diagnosis of new-onset asthma in the elderly in the general population. This community-based prospective cohort study enrolled 9804 generally healthy participants (30–74 years old) in Nagahama City, and conducted a follow-up assessment after 5 years. Elderly participants were those aged ≥65 years at baseline. Patients with new-onset asthma were defined as participants without asthma at baseline assessment and with asthma at the follow-up assessment. Among the 7948 participants analyzed in this study, 28 (1.4%) elderly and 130 (2.2%) non-elderly had new-onset asthma. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed low forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) and high blood eosinophil counts at baseline as predicting factors for new-onset asthma in the elderly. Additionally, subsequent incidence of new-onset asthma was higher in elderly participants with both predictors (high blood eosinophil counts and low FEV1/FVC at baseline) than those with none or one of the predictors before asthma diagnosis. Lastly, elderly patients with new-onset asthma had more frequent comorbidity of moderate to sleep disordered breathing than those non-elderly. Eosinophilic inflammation and airflow obstruction may predict subsequent new-onset asthma after the age of 65 years. Revealing the characteristics of new-onset asthma in the elderly can aid in the prevention of underdiagnosed asthma.",

In general, a younger and atopic population is usually involved and the lesions are acute, usually less than 6 weeks in duration and it is relatively easy to show a cause and effect, usually by history. The cause of chronic urticaria, which is defined as urticaria lasting longer than 6 weeks, is much more difficult to identify and 80–95% of patients are classified as idiopathic. Many of the patients react with a wheal and flare to their own serum or plasma indicating that they have a histamine-releasing agent in their own serum. Most of these subjects will have urticaria which clears with time but a small minority continue to have urticaria for the rest of their lives. Treatment for patients having known causes is to avoid the triggers and all patients with chronic urticaria need to be treated with H1 antihistamines. Sometimes an H2 antihistamine is added or a tricyclic 'tranquilizer' which has anti H1 and H2 blocking action needs to be used. Those patients who do not respond may need treatment with prednisone which should be reduced to the smallest dosage and discontinued as soon as possible. Patients with hereditary angioedema respond to danazol, stanozol or epislan-aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid.",

    "abstract": "Overwhelming evidence now points to asthma as a chronic inflammatory disease involving the airways. The T lymphocyte takes primacy in driving the inflammatory response through upregulation of cytokines, specifically those encoded in the IL-4 gene cluster: IL-4 and IL-13 (IgE isotype switching); IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF (eosinophil and basophil recruitment); and IL-9 (mast cell maturation). Additional cytokines of importance include TNFa and a range of related C-x-C and C-C cytokines. Although allergens are involved in initiating the Th-2 T-cell response, other factors are likely to operate that expand and maintain the inflammatory reaction. These include a potential role for superantigens and autoimmune mechanisms as well as the recruitment of accessory cytokine producing cells, especially mast cells and eosinophils. Leucocytes recruited from the microvasculature through interactions with specific adhesion molecules release an array of mediators, which in addition to causing bronchoconstriction also lead to damage to the epithelium and underlying structures. Neutral proteases from mast cells, metalloproteases from eosinophils and an array of mediators from the formed elements of the airway all contribute to the tissue destruction remodelling process. It was concluded that asthma is a dynamic disease process involving an interplay between inflammation and repair processes and that the differing proportions of these could account for the various disease phenotypes associated with severity and progression.",

    "abstract": "Allergen-specific Th2 cells from atopic individuals generally belong to the T helper 2 (Th2) subset producing, among other cytokines, high levels of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, but low levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ following activation. Both IL-4 and IL-13 induce IgE synthesis, which is inhibited by IFN-γ. IL-4, but not IL-13, also directs differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th2 cells. Furthermore, IL-5 induces the differentiation of eosinophils and eosinophilia, whereas IL-3, IL-4 and IL-10 produced by Th2 cells, synergize with c-kit ligand in promoting mast cell growth. These observations indicate that allergy is a Th2 cell disease, and that targeting of allergen-specific Th2 cells may provide an efficient way to intervene in allergic inflammation. Three different approaches aimed at inhibiting the function or differentiation of allergen-specific Th2 cells are discussed. It is shown that an IL-4R and IL-13R antagonist inhibits IL-4-driven Th2 cell differentiation and human IgE production both in vitro and in SCID-hu mice. In addition, it is discussed that allergen-specific Th2 cells can be rendered anergic following stimulation with allergen-derived peptides, representing T cell activation inducing epitopes. These anergic Th2 cells fail to produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, to proliferate, and to provide help to B cells for IgE synthesis after rechallenge with allergen- and antigen-presenting cells. Finally, it is shown that IL-4-driven allergen-specific Th2 cell differentiation can be redirected into a Th0 and Thl cell differentiation pathway by stimulating these IL-4-driven allergen-specific Th cell populations in the presence of IL-12, or by co-stimulating these cells via a novel T cell receptor, designated signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM). The clinical implications of these approaches are discussed.",

Diamine oxidase (DAO histaminase), which inactivates histamine, is located in the intestine and kidney and is released into plasma. Plasma DAO activity in asthmatic children was measured by a recently developed high performance liquid chromatographic method using histamine as the DAO substrate. Diamine oxidase activity was higher in severely asthmatic children than in those with mild asthma. A time course study during the acute exacerbation phase revealed that DAO activity rose during acute asthmatic attacks and then decreased gradually over several days. Although the mechanisms of plasma DAO activity increase during acute asthmatic attacks could not be explained, data showed that plasma DAO activity is an important index of histamine metabolism in asthmatics and may relate to some mechanisms of acute exacerbation of airway inflammation. Consequently, fluctuations in plasma DAO can be used as one of various indices of instability in management of asthma.",

    "abstract": "The cytokine network plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic asthmatic lung. As the influence of smoking on cytokine expression should be considered in delineating the cytokine network, the effects of a single exposure and chronic exposure to smoke on the number and cytokine expression of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells were evaluated. From a total of 126 BALB/c mice, BALF cells were obtained and analyzed using the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique (RT-PCR). The bodyweights of chronic smoking mice were found to be lower when compared to those mice that had not been exposed to smoke. The total number of BALF cells increased after smoking without significant differences in cell classification. Spontaneous mRNA expression of interleukin-1α (IL-1α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-1β) was detected in all cases. The time courses of their expression patterns after exposure to smoke were similar between the chronic and single smoking mice, except for TGF-β. The levels of IL-1β, IL-1β and TGF-β mRNA increased immediately after the exposure to smoke in chronic smoking mice, whereas the levels of TGF-β mRNA increased 2 h after exposure in the single smoking mice. Moreover, the increase of IL-1α and TGF-1β mRNA in the early phase after exposure was exaggerated in chronic smoking mice. Thus, repeated exposure to smoke may have caused some alterations in the expression mechanism of cytokines such as TGF-β and IL-1α in BALF cells, while it seemed to cause a repeated pattern of acute inflammation after each exposure. In the evaluation of cytokine expression in BALF cells in smokers with various lung diseases, it is recommended that before taking samples a sufficient time interval after the last exposure to smoke be allowed to avoid the effect of acute inflammation caused by smoking.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of salmeterol, which, in recent years, has become available for the treatment of asthma in Japan, on the productivity of patients with asthma. Relevant data were extracted from the medical records of 54 patients aged ≥ 15 years with moderate or severe asthma. Loss of productivity was estimated via the human capital approach in the year before and the year after introduction of salmeterol. Lost productivity was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) after salmeterol's introduction compared to the period before its introduction in both paid labors and unpaid ones. Reduced loss of productivity avoided loss of approximately 800,000 yen in the paid ones and 61.3 days in unpaid ones. It was estimated that loss of about 105.4 billion yen in the paid group and 64.5 billion yen in the unpaid group could be avoided if this result was expanded to the wider society. In paid labors, productivity loss was avoided when symptoms were absent during the day, irrespective of the presence or absence of symptoms during the night, whereas, in the unpaid group, the loss was avoided when symptoms were absent during the day or night. It was considered that improvement of clinical symptoms, which occurred in association with the introduction of salmeterol, resulted in avoidance of losses in productivity that had previously occurred in patients with asthma.",

We compared αMβ2 expression, cellular adhesion and superoxide anion (02-) release of human eosinophils and neutrophils under uniform conditions. Eosinophils and neutrophils from normal volunteers were purified by a magnetic cell-separation system and a one-step gradient method, respectively. Cells were stimulated with platelet-activating factor (PAF) or complement 5a (C5a) on human serum albumin (HSA)-coated surfaces. Expression of aMp2 was measured by flow cytometry with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD11b monoclonal antibody. 02 ~ release was assayed by chemiluminescence using a Cypridina luciferin analogue as the amplifier. Cellular adhesion was assessed by measuring fluorescence intensity of calcein-AM, which was preincorporated in the cell cytoplasm. Cellular morphology was observed with a light microscope. αMβ2 expression on the neutrophil cell surface was greater than that on eosinophils, both at rest and on stimulation. In contrast, eosinophils exerted significantly greater cellular adhesion and O2- release on HSA- coated surfaces than neutrophils. Morphologically, eosinophils showed marked flattening and deformity, while neutrophil shape change was minimal. Eosinophils and neutrophils showed different activation profiles with stimulation of PAF or C5a on HSA-coated surfaces. In eosinophils the intensity of cellular adhesion and O2- release paralleled the upregulation of αMβ2, while in neutrophils the amount of αMβ2 surface expression appeared to be less associated with the degree of cellular adhesion and O2- release.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade it has become clear that asthmatic patients who are clinically unresponsive, or “resistant” to glucocorticoid therapy may have T cells which manifest resistance to glucocorticoid inhibition. This is shown by failure of glucocorticoid not only to repress the production of pro-inflammatory, asthma-relevant cytokines such as IL-5, but also to induce the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10. Molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance are beginning to be defined, and include inappropriate production of transcriptional regulatory proteins (which may bind to and inactivate the glucocorticoid receptor), cytokine-induced modifications of the glucocorticoid receptor (such as phosphorylation), which alter its capacity to bind to ligand, and complex interactions which regulate histone acetylation status and the quaternary structure of DNA itself. Continued study of these phenomena will lead to a better understanding of the “normal” physiological mechanisms of glucocorticoid action, and may point to new, alternative avenues of therapy for glucocorticoid resistant asthmatics who suffer from severe disease, and for whom as yet no adequate therapy is available.",

The patient had mild asthma and was admitted with a femoral fracture in August 1996. Although she was given NSAIDs, including rectal diclofenac and oral loxoprofen, there was no worsening of asthma. After discharge, she was followed as having NSAID-tolerant asthma. When she developed perennial rhinitis and anosmia subsequent to an upper respiratory tract infection, asthma control was well maintained. Later, she experienced three episodes of severe asthmatic attacks after intake of aspirin or ketoprofen. Thus, we investigated her NSAID tolerability in September 1999. Sodium tolmetin inhalation challenge demonstrated a positive reaction, leading to the diagnosis of aspirin-induced asthma. Open challenges with loxoprofen and diclofenac also provoked positive reactions. The present case illustrates the potential variability of aspirin-induced asthma. Aspirin or NSAIDs challenge tests should be performed when nasal symptoms, particularly anosmia, develop or worsen.",

    "abstract": "In the 1960s when air pollution levels were high in Kanagawa prefecture as same as in other Japanese metropolises, the prevalence of asthma increased distinctly. Air pollution has been reduced rapidly from the 1970s, but asthma morbidity has not decreased and therefore air pollution has not been considered as an essential factor in asthma development. However, air pollution may be considered as a risk factor for infantile asthma. To clarify the influence of air pollution on infantile asthma development, we compared the background of adult asthmatics who were born in 1960s and in 1970s. We studied 10,823 adult asthma patients who underwent examination at Sagamihara hospital from 1972 to 1995. We investigated the ratio of young onset (equal to or less than 19 years old, 3264 cases) asthma in adult asthma year by year. In order to ascertain the influence of air pollution on airway hypersensitivity, we compared the asthmatics born in 1960s (born in 1963–1970) when air pollution was severe with those born in 1970s (born in 1971–1978) when air pollution levels were reduced. Childhood onset (less than 15 years old) asthma held a constant ratio in adult asthma from 1972 to 1980. However, infancy onset (0–4 years old) asthma increased in 1980, peaked in 1988, and then decreased. From a viewpoint of the birth year, young onset asthma has increased since 1945. In particular, the ratio of infancy onset (0–4) asthma had become distinctly higher than the other onset groups since 1960, peaking in 1970 and then decreasing. The fluctuation of infancy onset asthma coincided with the indices of air pollution in Japan. Lung function tests in the three groups (group I ; born in 1955–62, group II ; born in 1963–70, group III ; born in 1971–78) did not have a difference among each other. However, we were able to find a difference in threshold of non-specific airway hypersensitivity. The airway hypersensitivity of the infancy onset asthmatics born in 1960s was much more enhanced than that of the asthmatics born in 1970s. The dramatic increase of infancy onset asthmatic born after 1960 coincided with the increases in levels of air pollution. The infancy onset adult asthmatics born in 1960s were more hypersensitive to nonspecific bronchial stimuli than those born in 1970s. This strongly suggested that the air pollution of 1960s might have accelerated the development of infancy onset asthma and aggravated non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity.",

This study included asthma patients aged 60 or older who were hospitalized under a clinical pathway that provided the treatment of asthma exacerbation, thorough examination, and patient education simultaneously. The patients were divided into two groups, those in whom asthma developed at age 60 or older (lateonset group) and those in whom asthma developed before age 60 (early-onset group). Both groups received step-down therapy with fluticasone dry powder after discharge, and asthma severity was compared between two time points: at 1 year and 2 years after the start of treatment. One-third of all patients with asthma were aged 60 or older, and half of these had late-onset asthma. There was an inverse correlation between serum IgE levels and the age of onset. The positive rates of specific IgE antibodies to Japanese cedar pollen or house dust mite were significantly lower in the late-onset group than in the early-onset group. Pulmonary functions were equivalent between the two groups. However, asthma severity on admission was lower in the late-onset group. Response to treatment was better in the late-onset group, especially at 1 year of treatment. Asthma in elderly patients may be divided into early-onset persistent asthma and late-onset asthma with short duration. Late-onset asthma is less IgE-mediated, less severe, and has a better prognosis after appropriate treatment with inhaled fluticasone, and patients are more likely to drop out. For elderly patients with asthma, early detection, repetitive patient education and early intervention with inhaled corticosteroid therapy are important.",

Suplatast tosilate has been reported to inhibit IL-3-dependent murine mast cell development, and therefore is expected to suppress mast cell growth proliferation at disease sites. However, there are differences between the growth factors required by human and mouse mast cells. Methods: Human mast cells were grown in serum-free culture condition from cord blood mononuclear cells with suplatast tosilate. Mast cell number was assessed from the cell numbers counted by a flow cytometer with constant flow rate and Kit + percentage. Immunochemistry for tryptase was also examined on the cytocentrifuged preparations. Results: Suplatast tosilate (100 μg/ml) dramatically inhibited human mast cell development from cord blood progenitors. On the other hand, the growth of 8-wk old mast cells that developed in serum-free media, and which reached over 95% in purity and still maintained proliferation ability, and the growth of the human mast cell line HMC-1 cells were not inhibited by suplatast tosilate. Conclusions: Suplatast tosilate may be useful for control of human mast cell numbers at the local sites by inhibiting their development from their progenitors.",

Attempts to express their effectiveness in quantitative terms has led to the concepts of potency, which designates the concentration range over which the agonist becomes effective, and the intrinsic activity, which designates the maximal effect produced by agonist at saturating concentrations. In the present review we describe developments in which the molecular effects of the common β-adrenergic agonists on their cognate receptors can be related to their effectiveness. This approach is based on the activation/inactivation cycle of G proteins. It has been formalized so that the effectiveness (that is the efficacy) of each individual β-adrenergic agonist can be expressed as a single numerical value. The agonists may, therefore, be listed is order of efficacy. For the β-adrenergic agonists for which there is accurate data the order is : epinephrine > fenoterol≈procaterol > albuterol≈zinterol≈terbutaline > dobutamine > tulobuterol > ephedrine. The formal model of β-adrenergic agonism also allows a novel approach to the question of agonist specificity and a more rational appraisal of which drugs might be most useful for particular purposes.",

To examine whether a –401A/G polymorphism in the RANTES promoter gene is associated with the susceptibility to AD in Japanese, we determined the genotypes of the polymorphism in 145 Japanese students and 65 patients with AD. DNA was isolated from the mononuclear cells by using SepaGene (Sanko) and analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The frequency of –401A allele was 0.39 in the healthy subjects without AD. This was not significantly different from that in the patients with AD (0.41). We also failed to show association between the polymorphism in the RANTES promoter gene and the production of IgE.

However, I will describe a case in which these drugs showed different therapeutic effects on clinical symptoms during the daytime and eosinophilic inflammation in the peripheral airway. A 70-year-old male patient with non-atopic bronchial asthma who was treated with 400 μg/day of Budesonide Turbuhaler® (BUD-TH) changed from Pranlukast (225 mg, twice daily) to Montelukast (10 mg, one tablet before sleeping), resulting in worsening clinical symptoms consisting of sputum and cough in the daytime, mainly at lunch time. Due to the fact that the symptoms did not improve sufficiently, instead of increasing the dose of BUD-TH, we investigated the clinical symptoms and pulmonary functions as well as measured the mean eosinophil count, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eotaxin in the hypertonic saline-induced sputum prior to administration of Pranlukast, and 4 and 8 weeks after the re-administration of Pranlukast from Montelukast. Following the re-administration of Pranlukast, the clinical symptoms disappeared within a few days and pulmonary function improved within 4 weeks. Eosinophils in the induced sputum almost completely disappeared for 4 weeks. The sputum ECP and eotaxin before and 4 weeks after the re-administration of Pranlukast changed from 700 μg/l to 192 μg/l, and 69.9 pg/ml to 30.6 pg/ml, respectively. After 8 weeks, no sputum induction was found. The clinical difference between these two similar antagonists may be caused by the time difference relating to when and how often each drug is administered, suggesting the existence of the lunchtime dip.",

In a model of asthma with influenza A virus infection, dendritic cells play an important role during antigen sensitization and antigen challenge. However, the role of T cells in the asthma-influenza A model was unclear. The aim of the present study was to assess the roles of T cells during antigen sensitization and antigen challenge in the asthmatic model. C57BL/6 mice were infected with influenza A virus and were sensitized with inhaled antigen during the acute phase of the virus infection. Anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies were administered during antigen sensitization or antigen challenge to evaluate the role of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in this murine model of asthma. The onset of asthma was determined by eosinophil recruitment into the lung. During antigen sensitization, depletion of either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells resulted in an absence of eosinophil infiltration into the lung after antigen challenge. However, during antigen challenge, depletion of CD4 + T cells did cause such an absence of eosinophil infiltration. During antigen sensitization, both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were required in C57BL/6 mice for exacerbation of asthma. During antigen challenge, CD4 + T cells were important for the onset of asthma, whereas CD8 + T cells do not affect eosinophil recruitment into the lung.",

Because the vasculature and blood perfusion are commonly altered in CVD, we have attempted to analyze pulmonary disorders from the viewpoint of pulmonary vessels and perfusion. Based on routine pulmonary function tests, many patients were observed to have a decreased diffusion capacity (DLco) isolated from or comparative to lung volumes. In these patients, matched ventilation/ perfusion scintigraphy revealed a decrease in pulmonary peripheral perfusion. These findings may be an early sign of pulmonary hypertension, which develops as a result of several pathophysiological causes in CVD. When a remedy for each pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension was applied, more than half the patients recovered, at least initially; therefore, early diagnosis, including the methods described above, and treatment are important. With regard to pneumonitis in amyopathic dermatomyositis, which has been considered to develop acutely, we observed its progression to be subacute in its early stage. Along with this disease, pneumomediastinum characteristically develops simultaneously with vasculopathy. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, which must be perfused into the blood stream, sometimes induce lymphocyte alveolitis or pneumonitis in good responders, with a decrease in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count and immunoglobulin levels. Examinations, differential diagnoses, therapies and studies from the viewpoint of the blood circulation and vessels may be important and useful for clinical studies and for the further investigation of pulmonary involvement in CVD.",

Adherence to nylon, serum chemotaxis and phagocytosis–bactericidal activity were assayed. A Candida albicans strain was used for the experiments of phagocytosis–bactericidal activity. Adherence to patients’ neutrophils was found in normal patients (22.6 ± 1.89%) and healthy controls (26.1 ± 1.59%; P > 0.05). In contrast, the chemotactic ability of the patients’ sera was inferior to that of healthy control patients (leucotactic index 20.25 ± 0.76 vs 28.04 ± 0.46 μm, respectively; P < 0.0001). Patients’ neutrophils phagocytosed 102.77 ± 6.03 microorganisms per 100 cells, while controls phagocytosed 138.05 ± 7.60 microorganisms per 100 cells (P < 0.001). Bactericidal activity was also severely impaired in patients compared with controls (17.19 ± 1.67 vs 33.23 ± 1.96%, respectively; P < 0.0001). The observed host defense disorders provide additional information that helps to explain the increased susceptibility of these patients to bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "Although eosinophils and fibroblasts are believed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of chronic allergic inflammation, the interaction between eosinophils and fibroblasts has not been thoroughly elucidated. Stem cell factor (SCF) is one of the important cytokines produced by fibroblasts. In the present study, we examined the effects of some cytokines and eosinophils on SCF production by human lung fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were cultured with or without interleukin (IL)-4 for up to 48 h. In some experiments, eosinophils were added to the wells after incubation with or without IL-5 for 3 h and cells were cultured for up to 48 h. At the end of the culture period, SCF in the supernatants was measured by ELISA. In addition, the expression of SCF mRNA was examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Interleukin-4 significantly enhanced SCF production, whereas tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ and IL-1α showed suppressive effects on SCF production. When fibroblasts were cultured with IL-4 plus IL-5-activated eosinophils, SCF production was significantly enhanced in comparison with IL-4 alone. Experiments using polymerase chain reaction amplification revealed that IL-5-activated eosinophils enhanced SCF production by fibroblasts through transcriptional gene activation. These results suggest that some factor from activated eosinophils may interact in a synergistic fashion with IL-4 to further augment SCF production by fibroblasts and that eosinophils may play an important role in the activation of fibroblasts in chronic allergic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Although interleukin (IL)-12, IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-γ are key cytokines that control the T helper (Th) 1/Th2 balance in human allergic disorders, details of their interactions in humans have not been clarified. Recently IL-10, one of the Th2 cytokines, has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect against allergic responses. To clarify the effect of IL-12 on the production of IFN-γ and IL-10, in the present study we examined responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from asthmatics to stimulation by Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) antigen in the presence of exogenous IL-12. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Df-sensitized (n = 7) and non-sensitized (n = 5) asthmatics were stimulated by Df antigen after incubation with exogenous IL-12 (100 pg/mL). Interferon-γ and IL-10 produced in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. The effect of IL-12 on lymphocyte proliferation was assayed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation in both groups. The production of IFN-γ by PBMC was significantly enhanced by incubation with IL-12 in both patient groups (P < 0.05), while IL-12 did not affect the production of IL-10 in either group. Lymphocyte proliferation induced by Df antigen was significantly higher in the Df-sensitized group (P < 0.01). This lymphocyte proliferation was significantly enhanced by exogenous IL-12 only in the Df-sensitized group (P < 0.05). These observations indicate that IL-12 enhances Th 1 -shifted immune responses without affecting IL-10 production and suggest that IL-12 may effectively inhibit the Th2 dominant state of bronchial asthma by regulating the Th1/Th2 balance.",

There was an increase in membrane fluidity at the surface of PMN from asthmatic children. Oxatomide treatment significantly decreased PMN membrane fluidity. These data suggest that oxatomide may induce changes in the physicochemical properties of the PMN plasma membrane in asthmatic subjects. These changes may modify the functional activities of PMN.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of S. aureus on T cell-mediated immune responses in contact hypersensitivity caused by a hapten or a protein with large molecule. Staphylococcus aureus or phosphate-buffered saline was inoculated on experimental contact dermatitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene (TNCB) or house dust mite antigen. At various times after inoculation, the experimental lesions were examined histologically and immunohistochemically. Furthermore, the kinetics of cytokine patterns (interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-5) in each lesion were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In TNCB-challenged lesions inoculated with S. aureus, the levels of IL-2 mRNA decreased; in contrast, mRNA levels of IL-4 and IL-5 were upregulated. In mite antigen-challenged lesions, IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA expression was detected throughout the period of the investigation, even without S. aureus inoculation. Interferon-γ mRNA expression in mite dermatitis without S. aureus inoculation was observed only in the later period and IL-2 mRNA expression in mite dermatitis with S. aureus was suppressed and observed much later than in the control group. Infestation of S. aureus on skin lesions in experimental contact hypersensitivity induces a shift in the immune reaction from a Th1- to a Th2-dominant response.",

To clarify the effect of macrolides on the initiation of immune responses, we investigated changes in the expression levels of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, a major histocompatibility complex class II antigen, and of costimulatory molecules, such as CD54, CD80 and CD86, on monocytes following administration of macrolides. The expression of HLA-DR, CD54, CD80 and CD86 on cultured human peripheral mononuclear cells following stimulation by interferon (IFN)-γ and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) was analyzed using flow cytometry in the presence and absence of macrolides. The macrolides tested inhibited the expression of CD54, CD80 and CD86 on cultured monocytes following stimulation by IFN-γ and LPS, while the expression of HLA-DR on monocytes was not affected. Suppression of CD80 expression was the most significant among the costimulatory molecules tested and occurred in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that macrolides may downregulate the expression levels of costimulatory molecules, such as CD80, and may normalize the hyperimmune responses that may be responsible for the chronic intractable inflammation.",

    "abstract": "A number of recent studies has demonstrated a critical role for mast cells and mast cell-derived cytokines, especially tumour necrosis factor (TNF), in the control of host defense mechanisms during inflammation. In the presesnt study, we investigated whether TNF-deficient (TNF−/−) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-deficient (GM-CSF−/−) mice expressed defects in normal mast cell function. Because the first step in the passive cutaneous anaphylactic (PCA) reaction is fixation of the antibody to mast cells, we tried to obtain a PCA in TNF−/− and GM-CSF−/−mice. While an anti-dinitrophenyl IgE monoclonal antibody induced a strong PCA reaction in wild-type mice, it was not possible to obtain a PCA reaction in either TNF−/− or GM-CSF−/− mice. We next examined whether mast cells were present in these mice and if so, did they have functional FcεRI receptors on their surface. The number of mast cells in smears from the peritoneal fluid of the TNF−/− and GM-CSF−/− mice was similar to that seen in wild-type mice. However, the expression of FcεRI on mast cells from the peritoneal fluid of TNF−/− and GM-CSF−/− mice, measured by either rosetting assay or FACScan analysis, was compromised compared with wild-type mice. Previous studies have established that defects in FCεRI expression often have found that IgE production was compromised in both TNF−/− and GM-CSF−/− mice. The observed defects may partially explain the immunodeficiency of these cytokine-deficient animals during infection.",

IgE binds to FcεRI on mast cells. However, it is not clear whether different zones within the nasal mucosa harbor different quantities of IgE-bound mast cells. We stained IgE and mast cells from the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis using a double-labeling technique with anti-IgE and antitryptase antibodies and compared the intensities of IgE staining of mast cells. In the allergic nasal mucosa, mast cells displayed more IgE staining in the lamina propria than in the epithelial layer. Mast cells displayed more IgE-staining in the allergic nasal mucosa than in the non-allergic mucosa. We speculate that the quantity of IgE that binds to mast cells depends on the quantity of IgE in nasal mucosal tissue.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is a characteristic feature of bronchial asthma, yet its precise mechanism remains obscure. Human studies have demonstrated that T helper 2 cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5, are involved in the development of airway inflammation and BHR. In the present study, we examined the role of IL-5 in the onset and aggravation of bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine in two strains of IL-5 transgenic (Tg) mice, derived from the C3H/HeN and BALB/c strains. Three inhalations of antigen (ovalbumin) caused an increase in the number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and a significant elevation in serum IgE in wild-type mice. In contrast with wild-type animals, systemic overproduction of IL-5 resulted in massive airway eosinophilia, especially around the peribronchi and perivascular regions of the tissues, after repeated antigen provocation. In C3H/HeN background IL-5 Tg mice, repeated antigen provocation did not induce BHR similar to that of wild-type mice. In contrast, antigen-induced BHR was observed in BALB/c-background mice, but there were no significant differences between the magnitude of BHR in wild-type and IL-5 Tg mice. Furthermore, antigen-induced IL-5 production in BALF was detected in both C3H/HeN and BALB/c mice and was elevated to a similar degree in both wild-type and IL-5 Tg mice. These findings suggest that systemic overproduction of IL-5 or airway eosinophilia is not, by itself, important in the development or aggravation of antigen-induced BHR in mice.",

Platelet-activating factor induced tyrosine phosphorylation of many intracellular proteins, including 42, 123 and 150 kDa proteins. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that the 123 kDa phosphorylated protein was proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK-2; also known as related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK), cell adhesion kinase (β (CAK(β) and calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK)). Furthermore, blocking of cellular adhesion through β2 integrin by anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK-2 as well as the degranulation response. These findings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK-2 is involved in a signaling pathway mediated by cellular adhesion through β2 integrin in PAF-activated eosinophils.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that an adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient patient treated with T cell-directed gene therapy had an increase in serum IgE levels, despite a marked inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. In the present report, we have analyzed the phenotypic and functional profiles of the patient's lymphocytes obtained during the clinical trial. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that were freshly prepared from the patient, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were negative for CD40 ligand (CD40L; CD154) and Fas ligand (FasL; CD95L), while CD20+ B cells constitutively expressed CD40 and HLA-DR and were negative for CD80, CD86 and Fas (CD95). The expression of CD23 was detected on the majority of CD20+ B cells and expression was upregulated by interleukin (IL)-4. Furthermore, the patient's PBMC, which already expressed both germline and mature Ce transcripts in vivo, spontaneously secreted IgE and responded to IL-4 with increased IgE production during in vitro culture. When stimulated with anti-CD3ε monoclonal antibody (mAb), CD8+ T cells from gene-transduced T cells displayed high production of interferon (IFN)-γ, low production of IL-4 and IL-13 and comparable levels of CD40L and FasL expression; however, lined CD8+ T cells from circulating T cells expressing the transgene produced IL-4 and IL-13 together with smaller amounts of IFN-γ and preferably expressed CD40L rather than FasL. Two such CD8+ T cells, in conjunction with the presence of IL-4, supported CD40L-mediated B cell proliferation and IgE production after stimulation and fixation. These results indicate that ADA-deficient B cells are functionally mature and that gene-transduced CD8+ T cells and lined CD8+ T cells containing the transgene exhibit T helper 0- and T cytotoxic (c) 2-like phenotypes, respectively. Our data also suggest that immuno-logic reconstitution with genetically modified CD8+ T cells may promote IgE production.",

    "abstract": "The intrusion of airborne allergens into airways elicits eosinophilic inflammation, as represented by bronchial asthma. It has been shown that excessive amounts of allergen in murine trachea lead to an unexpected evasion of deleterious eosinophilic inflammation by inducing T cell tolerance. In the present study, the mechanisms of tracheal high-dose tolerance are examined with regard to accessory cell functions and the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on tolerance. Antigen-induced tracheal eosinophilia was suppressed on instillation of high doses of antigen into the trachea, while concurrent instillation of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with the antigen restored the diminished responses. The restoration of eosinophilic infiltration by GM-CSF occurred in parallel with an increase in interleukin (IL)-4 production by CD4+ T cells from the mediastinal lymph nodes. This was found to reflect the empowerment of antigen-presenting cells by GM-CSF, because the impaired ability of Ia+ cells from the tolerant mice to stimulate IL-4-producing T cells is restored by GM-CSF administration. The prevention of tolerance by up-regulating accessory cell functions is a feature unique to GM-CSF, because another pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-iβ, failed to empower antigen-presenting cells. Thus, besides the induction of transforming growth factor-β-secreting CD4+ T cells, high-dose tolerance in the trachea includes an impairment of the accessory cell functions that support IL-4 production from T cells, which was reversed by GM-CSF. This report is the first demonstration that GM-CSF breaks the T cell tolerance of IL-4-producing T helper cells.",

Hypertonic saline inhalation was used to non-invasively induce sputum samples in 34 patients with bronchial asthma and 21 healthy subjects. The sputum samples were reduced with dithioerythritol and absolute numbers of lymphocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations were assessed by direct immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. To assess the effect of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) on induced sputum, numbers of lymphocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations in sputum also were evaluated after 4 weeks of BDP inhalation treatment in seven asthmatic patients. An adequate sample was obtained in 85.3% of patients with asthma and in 79.2% of the healthy subjects. Induced sputum from patients with asthma had increased numbers of lymphocytes (P = 0.009); CD4+ cells (P = 0.044); CD4+ cells-bearing interleukin-2 receptor (CD25; P = 0.016); and CD4+ cells bearing human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR (P = 0.033). CD8+ cells were not increased in asthmatic patients. In patients treated with inhaled steroids, numbers of lymphocytes, CD4+ cells, CD25-bearing CD4+ cells and HLA-DR-bearing CD4+ cells in sputum decreased from pretreatment numbers (P = 0.016, 0.002, 0.003 and 0.002, respectively). Analysis of lymphocytes in induced sputum by flow cytometry is useful in assessing bronchial inflammation, and activated CD4+ lymphocytes may play a key role in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation in bronchial asthma.",

    "abstract": "We examined the functional heterogeneity of eosinophils from an adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patient with eosinophilia. A 63-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of lymphadenopathy. The leukocyte count was 10 400 /mm3, with 36.0% eosinophils and 3.0% abnormal lymphocytes. The diagnosis of ATL was based on the presence in serum of anti- human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 antibody and on histologic demonstration of ATL cells. The mononuclear cells spontaneously produced eosinophil-related cytokines (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, 5600 pg/mL; interleukin (IL)-5, 375 pg/mL). Peripheral eosinophils were fractionated into normodense eosinophils (NE) and hypodense eosinophils (HE) by a Percoll density gradient method, and these cells were compared in terms of several heterogeneous functions. The NE were more chemotactically attracted to IL-5 than the HE. More apoptotic cells appeared among the NE than among the HE and this difference was correlated with the positive rate of Fas antigen on eosinophils. Survival of the HE was longer than that of the NE. Survival of the HE was prolonged by IL-5 stimulation, but survival of the NE was not. These data suggest that functionally heterogeneous eosinophils were present in this ATL patient with eosinophilia and that IL-5 enhanced this heterogeneity. The response of eosinophils to IL-5 may have contributed to the patho- genesis of eosinophilia in this patient.",

The mean (± SD) age of the subjects was 7.2 ± 0.7 years, 28% were girls and 42% were atopic. A total of 31 children (37%) had asthma with regular medication: 20 were taking cromones, and 11 were taking inhaled steroids. In the asthma group, the median concentration of eNO was 14.9 p.p.b.

The levels for atopic children on cromones tended to be higher than for those on inhaled steroids; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. We conclude that eNO concentrations associate significantly with atopic asthma.",

Activated eosinophils were significantly reduced in the corticosteroid-premedicated group (CS +) compared with the unpremedicated (CS-) group. In contrast, no significant reduction was observed in CD4-positive T lymphocytes between the two groups. The number of CD25-positive T lymphocytes was more suppressed in the premedicated than in the unpremedicated group. The effect of corticosteroid on eosinophils in bronchial mucosa develops within a few days. However, for a clinically significant effect, long-term corticosteroid treatment may be needed to inactivate and displace T lymphocytes from the airway mucosa.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial asthma has been recognized as an inflammatory disorder in this past decade. This leads to an assumption that perfect control of inflammatory cells may cure this disease. However, herein we report on an asthmatic whose airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) did not change after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The concentrations of acetylcholine to produce a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s 15 days before and 98 days after BMT were 900 and 480 μg/mL, respectively. Asthma treatment with beclo-methasone dipropionate and theophylline was continued before and after BMT and a conventional supporting therapy for BMT with cyclosporine A and methylprednisolone, followed by oral administration of tacrolimus hydrate alone inhibited graft-versus-host disease. Plasma interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IgE, but not interferon-γ, levels decreased after BMT. Note that the second measurement of airway sensitivity was performed under systemic administration of tacrolimus. The presented case suggests that replacement of bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells is not enough to reverse once-established AHR. Hence, AHR and airway inflammation may develop independently in some part, but both need to be present for asthma to be present in this asthmatic.",

    "abstract": "There has recently been an accumulation of evidence suggesting that endothelial cells (EC) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. We examined the prevalence and isotypes of anti-EC antibodies (AECA) in the sera of children with asthma and determined the antigenic targets associated with AECA reactivity. Levels of each class of AECA were determined by cellular ELISA in 156 children with asthma and in 203 control children. Sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis were performed in samples that contained high levels of AECA. In the cellular ELISA, the IgE class of AECA was detected significantly more frequently in children with asthma (25/156; 16.0%) than in healthy controls (2/203; 1.0%; P < 0.01). There were no differences in the frequencies of detection of IgG, IgA and IgM classes of AECA between patients and controls. The IgE-AECA was more frequently detected in younger children (23/69 vs 2/87 for children younger and older than 4 years of age, respectively). There was no correlation between the level of IgE-AECA and that of total IgE or house dust mite-specific IgE. In western blot analysis, IgE antibodies against a component of EC with a molecular mass of 75 kDa were detected in 20 of 25 patients (80.0%) positive for IgE-AECA, but they were less frequently detected in patients negative for IgE-AECA (2/34 (5.9%); P < 0.01). These results demonstrate that a small fraction of asthmatic children has IgE-AECA and that the antigenic target of IgE-AECA is a component of the EC with a molecular weight of 75 kDa.",

Cytochalasin D, at concentrations that induced distinct shape changes of RBL-2H3 cells, enhanced the Ag-induced 5-HT (serotonin) release and formation of phosphatidylbutanol (PBut), a specific and stable metabolite produced by PLD activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Concomitantly, Ag-induced 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) accumulation as well as phosphatidic acid (PA) production were increased by the drug. In contrast, cytochalasin D had no effect on PLD activation in response to phorbolmyristate acetate, an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), and Ca2+ ionophore A23187. These results suggest that cytoskeletal components may modulate Ag-induced PLD activation upstream of PKC and Ca2+ in RBL-2H3 cells.",

These findings indicate that local hyperresponsiveness of the non-diseased organ is influenced by an individual's atopic status. Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was measured after stimulation with HDM in groups 1, 2 and 3 and was found to be similar in all three groups. A correlation between bronchial hyperresponsiveness and in vitro cytokine production was noted in asthma patients.

The tissue density of mast cells in the epithelial layer and of eosinophils and CD4 + T cells in the subepithelial layer did differ between the two groups. These results indicate that perennial allergic rhinitis goes through a transition stage from onset to a few years, and thereafter becomes a chronic condition.

    "abstract": "Essentially all asthmatics demonstrate a marked sensitivity to inhaled methacholine and histamine, termed non-specific bronchial (airway) hyperresponsiveness (BHR). Airway hyperresponsiveness is a characteristic not only of asthmatics, but can be found in many persons with allergic rhinitis as well as in members of asthmatics' families. The presence of BHR usually precedes the development of clinically identifiable asthma. In recent years there has been an emphasis on inflammation, inducing hyperresponsiveness. However, these factors increase airway hyperresponsiveness by a magnitude of only three-fold compared with normal subjects. The important question is not why asthmatics respond, but why normal subjects do not. The normal subjects are quite able to maintain normal airway function in the presence of high concentrations of methacholine or histamine in vivo but not in vitro, suggesting the presence of protective mechanisms in vivo that are either lacking in, or are less effective in, the asthmatic subjects. There is a strong correlation between the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness and the severity of asthma. In order to determine whether methacholine sensitivity could be used as a potential genetic marker, we studied 750 subjects from 53 asthma families and 26 control families. The best sensitivity and specificity is at 200 breath units. Only 6% of the allergic rhinitis subjects showed a high positive response, but 30% overlapped with asthmatics in that they reacted with 200 breath units or less. There was a group of non-atopic subjects from asthma families who responded by 200 breath units, but there was a significantly lower percentage from normal families. Being from an asthma family is a risk factor in terms of subsequent development of asthma and increased airway reactivity. The parent data suggest that airway reactivity is transmitted to succeeding generations. Studies of twins have revealed that the concordance of asthma is higher in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins, but environmental factors are at least as important as genetic factors. Animal models of asthma comparing genetic strains can provide an important link between airway hyperresponsiveness and the allergic response. The inheritance of asthma fits a polygenetic pattern rather than a single-gene pattern.",

A total of 22 participants from 11 countries met to discuss standardization of the concept, therapeutic methods, as well as the future of immunotherapy. The meeting was co-chaired by J Bousquet, RF Lockey and H-J Mailing. At the beginning of the meeting, we discussed the term 'allergen vaccine', which appeared in the title of the position paper, 'Allergen immunotherapy: Therapeutic vaccines for allergic diseases'. Despite some reservations the committee agreed to use the term 'allergen vaccine'. The idea of the allergen immunotherapy, which was first tried by Curtis in 1890 on patients with pollenosis, originated in a 'vaccine' to protect immunologically against out-coming foreign bodies. Polatino, horse antiserum to pollen allergen, which was developed by Dunbar in 1903, really originated from an idea of antiserum vaccine against microorganisms, and even allergen-specific hyposensitization therapy tried by Noon in 1911,1 was also based on the concept of vaccination against pollen-toxins. The purpose of immunotherapy should be the primary or secondary prevention of hyperreactivity by the induction of hypo-responsiveness to the allergenic substances, which are causative to IgE antibody production. Therefore, there may be some differences in the concept between immunotherapy to allergic diseases and vaccination. However, a mechanism producing clinical effectiveness has not conclusively been clarified yet. Each of the theories proposed by successive researchers, such as theories of blocking antibodies, suppressor T cells, shift to Th1 from Th2 dominance and tolerance/anergy, are still considerable candidates for explaining immunological effectiveness. From a practical point of view, standardization of the allergens, efficacy, risk and indication of immunotherapy were discussed and revised several times, and finally a consensus was reached by the co-chairpersons on the",

However, it has not yet been determined whether selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes III and IV that catalyze cAMPto 5'-adenosine monophosphate have the ability to inhibit ASM cell proliferation. To evaluate the effectsof PDE inhibitors on ASM cell proliferation, ASM cells isolated from bovine tracheae were cultured in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), with or without a non-selective PDE inhibitor (theophylline), a selective PDE III inhibitor (cilostazol), and a selective PDE IV inhibitor (rolipram). The number of ASM cells cultured with 5% FBS was significantly reduced by the presence of theophylline at 10− 3 and 3 × 10− 4 mol/L, cilostazol at 10− 5, 10− 6 and 10− 7 mol/L, and rolipram at 10− 4 and 10− 5 mol/L. The release of lactic dehydrogenase from ASM cells cultured with any concentration of these agents was not significantly different from that with medium alone. Inhibitors of PDE III and IV were demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on ASM cell proliferation induced by FBS. Our results suggest the value of the further development of PDE inhibitors for the treatment of hyperplasia of ASM cells characteristic of airway remodeling, in addition to bronchospasm and airway inflammation, in bronchial asthma.",

    "abstract": "T-helper (Th) 2 cells, which produce interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 upon stimulation of their T cell receptors, play an important role in the development of human allergic diseases. However, the precise mechanism involved in the differentiation of Th2 cells is not well understood compared with that of Th1 cells. The selective differentiation of Th1 or Th2 subsets is established during priming under the influence of a variety of factors. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is one of those factors. Prostaglandin E2 produced by antigen presenting cells directly affects the naive CD4+ T cells, causing them to differentiate into Th2 cells. This effect is mediated by the elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) at the early stage of T cell activation. IL-4 and PGE2 lead naive CD4+ T cells to differentiate into Th2 cells cooperatively, by distinct signal transduction. Both PGE2 and IL-4 inhibit the hypomethylation of the proximal regulatory regions of the genomic IFN-γ gene, whose hypomethylation has been suggested as being important for the IFN-γ production by CD4+ T cells stimulated through their antigen receptors. Prostaglandin E2 facilitates Th2 differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells by acting not only on T cells directly but also on antigen presenting cells by inhibiting their IL-12 production. The production of PGE2 by monocytes is increased significantly in allergic patients. These results, taken collectively, suggest that PGE2 plays an important role in facilitating the differentiation of Th2 cells in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) can be separated into two groups: (i) that in which the causes are known; and (ii) that in which the etiologies have not been determined. Meanwhile, complement is essential for the inflammatory response and complement systems have been recognized as factors involved in organizing ILD. In the present study we investigated whether there were any differences in complement-related membrane proteins on lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) between different ILD. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were obtained from 12 patients and eight healthy individuals. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against C3b/C4b receptor (CR1), C3bi receptor (CR3), membrane cofactor protein (MCP) and decay accelerating factor (DAF) and were then labeled with fluorescein isothio-cyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer.The results demonstrate for the first time that CR3 and DAF are elevated on alveolar macrophages, and that MCP and DAF are increased on BALF lymphocytes in sarcoidosis. The possible roles of complement-related membrane proteins in the pathogenesis of immune processes that are ongoing in sarcoidosis are still obscure, but our results may provide some useful information on the mechanisms underlying sarcoidosis.",

    "abstract": "Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM; CDw150) is a 70 kDa glycoprotein. Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule is constitutively expressed on memory T cells, CD56+ T cells, a subset of T cell receptor γδ+ cells, immature thymocytes and, at low levels, on a proportion of peripheral blood B cells. Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule is rapidly upregulated on all T and B cells after activation. Engagement of SLAM by F(ab’)2 fragments of an anti-SLAM monoclonal antibody (mAb A12) enhances antigen-specific T cell proliferation. In addition, mAb A12 was directly mitogenic for T cell clones and activated T cells. T cell proliferation induced by mAb A12 is independent of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-12 and IL-15, but is cyclosporin A sensitive. Ligation of SLAM during antigen-specific T cell proliferation resulted in upregulation of interferon (IFN)-γ production, even by allergen-specific T helper cell (Th) 2 clones, whereas the levels of IL-4 and IL-5 production were only marginally affected. The mAb A12 was unable to induce IL-4 and IL-5 production by Th1 clones. Co-stimulation of skin-derived Der P1-specific Th2 cells from patients with atopic dermatitis via SLAM resulted in the generation of a population of IFN-γ-producing cells, thereby reverting their phenotype to a Th0 pattern. Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule is a high-affinity self ligand mediating homophilic cell interaction. In addition, soluble SLAM enhances both T and B cell proliferation. Collectively, these data indicate that SLAM molecules act both as receptors and ligands that are not only involved in T cell expansion but also drive the expanding T cells during immune responses into the Th0/Th1 pathway. This suggests that signaling through SLAM plays a role in directing Th0/Th1 development.",

    "abstract": "Humoral and cellular immune responses communicate with each other via Fc receptors (FcR) expressed on various hematopoietic cells. Recent studies on several FcR knockout mice demonstrated pivotal roles of an IgG/FcγR system in the regulation of immune responses and the onset of hypersensitivity. The γ subunit of FcR is an essential component of the complex and is required for both receptor assembly and signal transduction. FcR γ chain-deficient mice have lost the functional expression of FcεRI, FcγRI, and FcγRIII and are unable to mount several types of hypersensitive reactions, including the skin Arthus reaction. In contrast, FcγRII-deficient mice exhibit augmented humoral immune responses and IgG-mediated anaphylaxis reactions. Thus, the regulatory system of murine hypersensitive responses involves both positive and negative signaling through FcR. In B cells, FcγRIIb modulates membrane Ig-induced Ca2 + mobilization by inhibiting Ca2 + influx through phosphorylation of its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif and recruitment of cytoplasmic phosphatases. Elucidation of the detailed mechanisms of negative regulatory signaling in the inflammatory effector cells by FcγRIIb as well as several groups of potent inhibitory molecules expressed on such cells should be valuable in the development of novel therapeutic procedures for allergic disorders.",

    "abstract": "The effect of interleukin (IL)-4 on eosinophil chemotactic lymphokine (ECL) production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with purified protein derivative (PPD) was examined. The PBMC stimulated with PPD in the absence of IL-4 failed to produce evident ECL. However, PPD-induced eosinophil chemotactic activity (ECA) production was markedly enhanced in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment of PBMC with IL-4. The most potent enhancement was induced by IL-4 at a concentration of 30 U in tuberculin-sensitive PBMC. Short-term pretreatment (30 min to 3 h) was sufficient for the enhancement, whereas longer-term treatment was less effective. Eosinophil chemotactic lymphokine was found to be a CD4+ T cell-derived factor with an isoelectric point of approximately pH 7.0 and without heparin affinity, unlike chemokines such as RANTES and eotaxin. The effect of IL-4 on the production of other cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-5, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was also examined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells produced all these cytokines when they were treated with PPD, even in the absence of IL-4. When PBMC were pretreated with IL-4, interestingly not only IFNy but also IL-5 production was suppressed by pretreatment with IL-4, although ECL production was enhanced by the pretreatment. In the case of RANTES and GM-CSF, significant amounts of these cytokines were produced, even without antigenic stimulation, and IL-4 pretreatment did not result in an enhancement of their production. It is thus suggested that IL-4, existing in allergic lesions, plays a crucial role in eosinophil accumulation mediated by the T cell-derived ECL.",

The purpose of this study is to determine the role of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system in patients who had an anaphylactic reaction induced by allergen immunotherapy with pollen, house-dust and mold extracts. Plasma levels of angiotensin-I, angiotensin-II, angiotensin converting enzyme and aldosterone were measured in 20 patients who experienced anaphylaxis during allergen immunotherapy. The control group consisted of 15 immunotherapy patients without any history of anaphylaxis. The Mann-Whitney U-test was performed for comparison of the two groups, and a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Angiotensin-I, angiotensin-II, angiotensin converting enzyme and aldosterone levels were similar in both the study and control groups and no statistical significance was found between the two groups (P > 0.05). The RAAS does not appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of anaphylactic reactions due to allergen immunotherapy with pollen, house-dust and mold extracts.",

    "abstract": "Inhaled corticosteroid therapy remains the basis for the treatment of chronic asthma. Recent understanding of its use includes the benefits of early introduction, and of its plateaued dose-benefit effects. Additional beneficial effects on asthma control and prevention of asthma exacerbations can be obtained by combining middle-to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid with long-acting β-agonists and slow-release theophylline. Leukotriene inhibitors, particularly leukotriene receptor antagonists, are novel treatments that may also be combined with inhaled steroid therapy. Although current asthma treatments are very effective, a subgroup of asthma patients (difficult or therapy-resistant asthma) do not respond adequately to these treatments and need maintained oral corticosteroid therapy. New asthma treatments are particularly needed for this group. New treatments for asthma include more potent topical corticosteroids which have less potential for side-effects, inhibition of eosinophil chemotaxis and activation such as anti-IL-5, anti-eotaxin, eotaxin receptor antagonist, anti-VL-A4, anti-IgE therapy, restoring Th-1/Th-2 balance either by increasing Th-1 or reducing Th-2 T-cell activity, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, and specific inhibitors of PDE4. These treatments may be considered as either controllers, remitters (inducing remission of disease), or preventors according to their modes of action and their clinical effects. Currently, there does not appear to be any prospect of a cure for asthma.",

    "abstract": "Prediction of yearly atmospheric pollen counts is a very important component in the prevention of allergenic symptoms. We investigated the relationship between atomspheric pollen counts and the formation of male flowers of Cryptomeria japonica D. Don (C. japonica). An atmospheric pollen survey of C. japonica was conducted from 1983 to 1996 using a Durham's sampler. A regression analysis was performed between the total pollen count and July temperature in previous years. The atmospheric pollen counts of C. japonica had a high positive correlation with the mean temperature in July of the previous year. However, the predicted using average mean July temperature records of the previous year were insufficient, especially in years following high pollen count. In experimental conditions, using 60 C. japonica trees in pots, the formation of male flowers was shown to increase with a rise in incubation temperature. In a forest of C. japonica, our results showed that the length and weight of new needle growth from old needles, which produced many flowers in the previous year, were shorter and lighter, respectively. These aerobiological and plant physiological studies provide evidence that a smaller number of pollen counts are a common result in a year following one in which many male flowers are produced, even if the mean July temperature of that year was high.",

Eosinophils obtained from guinea pig peritoneal fluid sensitized with horse serum were purified. Luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was induced by stimulation with monoclonal anti-CD23 antibody, but not by mouse serum (controls). The mean (± SEM) value of LDCL was 20.6 ± 1.3X103 c.p.m. This reaction consisted of an initial rapid phase and a propagation phase and ended within lOmin. Guinea pig eosinophils were histochemically stained with monoclonal anti-CD23 antibody. The major product generated in the LDCL response was superoxide, as determined by the measurement of superoxide by cytochrome c reduction and the complete inhibitory effect of superoxide dismutase on the LDCL response. Pretreatment with either pertussis toxin or cholera toxin inhibited the LDCL reaction. Depletion of bivalent ions by EDTA inhibited this response and the protein kinase C inhibitor D-sphingosin inhibited both 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol-induced and FcϵRII-mediated LDCL. These findings suggest that the NADPH-protein kinase C pathway may be involved in the FceRII-mediated LDCL response in guinea pig eosinophils.",

The asthmatic patients were divided into three groups according to the ratio of the chemotactic response to ECF-PI5 and -PI9 (PI5/PI9). A type 1 response occurred when eosinophils responded to both ECF-PI5 and to ECF-PI9, a type 2 response occurred when eosinophils responded to ECF-PI5 only and a type 3 response occurred when eosinophils responded to ECF-PI9 only. Of 31 asthmatic patients, 21 exhibited a type 2 response, six exhibited a type 1 response and the remainder exhibited a type 3 response. In contrast, 23 of 25 healthy donors exhibited a type 1 response and none of them exhibited a type 2 response. This typing of asthmatic patients was apparently correlated with the clinical symptoms of the patients. All patients exhibiting a type 1 response were diagnosed with mild and episodic asthma and none of them had taken oral prednisolone. In contrast, many patients exhibiting a type 2 response were diagnosed with moderate, persistent and perennial asthma. Indeed, eight of these 21 patients had taken oral prednisolone. The patients exhibiting a type 3 response were diagnosed with mild to moderate and episodic asthma, but none of them had taken oral prednisolone. Furthermore, according to the total percentage migration to five ST02-derived ECF, asthmatic patients were further divided into two groups: high- and low-responding groups. Sixteen of 21 patients exhibiting a type 2 response belonged to the high-responding group, whereas all patients exhibiting a type 1 or type 3 response belonged to low-responding group. The present results indicate that such chemotactic heterogeneity of eosinophils to ST02-derived ECF is closely associated with the severity of BA, particularly with regard to the necessity of steroid therapy.",

In this article, we present a working hypothesis (helical hypothesis) that may explain the programmed nature of various biological events simply and naturally. Future investigations on the factors that regulate the gene transcription of cytokine clusters, including intereukin (IL)-4 and IL-5, may provide an answer for controlling atopic as well as other hereditary (genetic) diseases.",

The mean levels (95% confidence intervals) of sCD23 in the sera of 40 patients with multiple myelomas, nine patients with myeloma-related diseases (seven primary macroglobulinemia and two chronic lymphatic leukemia) and 30 matched controls were 2.7 (1.9-3.8), 9.9 (5.1-19.2) and 1.5 (1.3-1.7) ng/mL, respectively, showing a significant increase in sCD23 in the circulation of patients with myelomas (P<0.01) and myeloma-related diseases (P < 0.001). The potential biologic importance of sCD23 in myelomas and related diseases is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The role played by the interaction of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelins (ET) in the modulation of airway function, and the modulation of β-adrenergic-mediated bronchodilator responses by ascorbic acid in the presence or absence of endogenous NO induced by ET in anesthetized guinea-pigs was examined. Endothelins induced a concentration-dependent increase in respiratory resistance, and pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methylester, (L-NAME), significantly increased ET-mediated bronchoconstriction. In addition, ET-3-mediated bronchoconstriction following pretreatment with L-NAME was reversed by L-arginine. These findings suggest that the response to the administration of ET-3 can be attributed to the release of NO from the guinea-pig airway. Neither inhaled isoproterenol nor salbutamol significantly affected ET-3-mediated bronchoconstriction, but pretreatment with L-NAME markedly enhanced isoproterenol-mediated bronchodilatation. These findings suggest that endogenous NO induced by ET-3 may attenuate isoproterenol-mediated bronchodilator responses. Ascorbic acid, an antioxidant, enhanced isoproterenol-mediated bronchodilator responses following precontraction with ET-3, but pretreatment with L-NAME reduced this effect of ascorbic acid. The findings suggest that ascorbic acid attenuates the effect of endogenous NO on β-adrenergic-mediated bronchodilator response via its antioxidant activity. Since 10-7 mol/L ET-1 does not induce the release of NO from the guinea-pig airway, ascorbic acid cannot enhance isoproterenol-mediated bronchodilator responses. It seems likely that endogenous NO plays an important regulatory role in modulating β-adrenergic-mediated bronchodilator responses in the airway.",

    "abstract": "Sera from 27 patients with mite-sensitive allergic rhinitis, without atopic dermatitis and bronchial asthma, were examined for anti-Der f I and anti-Der f II IgE antibody contents by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-Der f I and anti-Der f II IgE antibody levels were 14.78 ± 1.34 and 32.68 ± 0.88 ng/mL (mean ± SEM), respectively. The anti-Der f II IgE antibody was predominant over the anti-Der f I IgE antibody in these patients. In comparison with the results of a previous study the present study indicates that the ratio between serum anti-Der f I and II IgE antibodies in patients with allergic rhinitis indicated the same pattern as in that of patients with bronchial asthma, while the inverse was the case in patients with atopic dermatitis. These results indicate that immunological features and major allergen molecules could be different in different atopic diseases. At present it is not clear where this difference comes from, but the route of immunological sensitization (via respiratory tract vs via skin) might result in the difference.",
