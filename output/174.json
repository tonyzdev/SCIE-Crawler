Subjects were assessed at the first session, at the end of the treatment (6 weeks) and at 1 month follow-up. The groups were assessed and compared with Visual Analogue Scale (based on rest, activity and night pain), Neer and Hawkins Tests, Scapular Retraction Test (SRT), Scapular Assistance Test (SAT), Lateral Scapular Slide Test (LSST) and shoulder disability (Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)).Intensity of pain was significantly decreased in both groups with the treatment (p < 0.05). The WII Group had significantly better results for all Neer test, SRT and SAT than the EX Group (p < 0.05).Virtual reality exergaming programs with these programs were found more effective than home exercise programs at short term in subjects with SAIS.Level I, Therapeutic study.",

The individuals included in the study were divided into two groups according to their gender and BMI (18.5<BMI<25 and 25<BMI). The body composition was determined with Tanita Body Composition Analyser. PT thickness and stiffness was measured with ACUSON S3000 Ultrasonography Device using 9L4 ultrasonography probe. QF concentric muscle strength of the individuals was measured with Biodex® System 4 Dynamometer at 60°/sec angular speed.It was found that PT stiffness was higher in males compared to females (p<0.001). It was found that PT stiffness was lower in obese individuals compared to individuals with normal weight (p = 0.017). A negative and weak correlation was found between BMI and PT stiffness (r = -0.26, p = 0.032), whereas a negative and moderate correlation was found between fat percentage and PT stiffness (r = -0.50, p<0.001). A moderate correlation was found between BMI and PT thickness (r = 0.54, p<0.001). It was found that peak torque at 60°/sec angular speed had a moderate correlation with PT stiffness (r = 0.44, p<0.001) and PT thickness (r = 0.45, p<0.001).PT stiffness is correlated and affected by gender, BMI and QF muscle strength whereas PT thickness is correlated and affected only to BMI and QF muscle strength.",

In comparisons between the groups, pain with movement and DASH scores in the therapeutic group were significantly lower at the 5th day (p<0.01). There were significant improvements in night pain, pain with movement, DASH score, shoulder external rotation muscle strength, and pain free shoulder abduction ROM in the therapeutic group at the 12th day (p<0.05). Passive shoulder flexion ROM increased more in the sham group at the 12th day (p<0.05).The addition of KT application to the exercise program appears to be more effective than the exercise program alone for the treatment of SIS.",

Sixty patients with displaced clavicular fractures were randomized into operative (29 patients) and nonoperative (31 patients) groups. Three patients in the operative group did not accept the surgery, and seven patients in the nonoperative group did not complete the one-year follow-up. Outcomes were assessed using the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, Constant shoulder score, specific questions regarding patients' final satisfaction, physical examination, measurement of the shortening of the clavicular length, and plain radiographs. There was one nonunion in the operative group and one in the nonoperative group. The nonunion in operative group was the result of the only infection in this group. Four malunions were developed in the operative group and nineteen malunions in the nonoperative treatment, (p<0.001). Three patients in the operative group were completely dissatisfied with their treatment. Eighteen patients in the nonoperative group were partially satisfied. Pain was the main reason for dissatisfaction in this group. The mean shortening of the clavicle was 26.5 mm in the nonoperative group and 4.0 mm in the operative group. The mean DASH score for the operative and nonoperative groups were 8.6 and 21.3, respectively (p<0.001); and the Constant shoulder scores were 89.8 and 78.8 (p<0.001). Open reduction and internal fixation of comminuted fractures of the clavicle using a reconstruction plate is an effective treatment modality. Despite the variety of complications, this method has a higher satisfaction rate than conservative treatment.",

The study included 29 patients (3 men, 26 women) who underwent arthroscopic repair of stage 2 and 3 rotator cuff tears. Patients were randomized in two groups: the accelerated protocol group (n=13) and slow protocol group (n=16). Patients in the accelerated protocol group participated in a preoperative rehabilitation program for 4-6 weeks. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and for 24 weeks postoperatively. Pain was assessed by visual analog scale, and functional activity level was assessed by The Disabilities of The Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. The active range of motion was initiated at week 3 after surgery for the accelerated rehabilitation protocol and at week 6 for the slow protocol. The rehabilitation program was completed by the 8th week with the accelerated protocol and by the 22nd week with the slow protocol. There was no significant difference between the slow and accelerated protocols with regard to pain at rest (p>0.05). However, the accelerated protocol was associated with less pain during activity at weeks 5 and 16, and with less pain at night during week 5 (p<0.05). The accelerated protocol was superior to the slow protocol in terms of functional activity level, as determined by DASH at weeks 8, 12, and 16 after surgery (p<0.05). The accelerated protocol is recommended to physical therapists during rehabilitation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair to prevent the negative effects of immobilization and to support rapid reintegration to daily living activities.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the types and the frequency of fractures, both in the pediatric and adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic and to find out the differences in comparison to the non-pandemic period. METHODS: Patients who were admitted to the hospital with a new fracture during pandemic period (March 16 to May 22, 2020) were evaluated. Control group consisted of patients with new fractures admitted to the hospital in the same date range in 2018 and 2019. The patients were divided into two groups as ≤16 years old (group 1) and >16 years old (group 2). The evaluation was based on the age and gender of the patients and localization of the fractures. Hospitalized and surgically treated patients were evaluated as well. RESULTS: A total of 1794, 1747, and 670 fractures were observed in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Mean age of the patients in group 1 was found to have decreased in the pandemic period (p<0.001). The most common fracture sites in the pediatric population were the distal forearm and distal arm, whereas hand, distal forearm, and foot were most common fracture sites in adults, in both pandemic and non-pandemic periods. The proportional increase in femoral and tibial shaft fractures in group 1, and toe, tibial shaft, and metacarpal fractures in group 2 was found to be statistically significantly (p<0.05). In group 1; 6.8%, 7.7%, and 14.6% of the fractures were treated surgically in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively (p<0.001). For group 2, these rates were 20.1%, 18.6%, and 18.1%, respectively (p=0.67). There were 48, 29, and 26 open fractures in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively (p=0.066). In pandemic period, duration of the hospital stay was significantly shorter for distal humerus and proximal femur fractures (p values= 0.001 and 0.017, respectively). CONCLUSION: We observed that the frequency of fractures decreased by approximately one-third during the pandemic period compared with that in the non-pandemic period. The mean age of the patients with a fracture in the pediatric group was found to have decreased also. Finger fractures in pediatric patients and metatarsal fractures in adult patients were found to have significantly decreased during the pandemic. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Diagnostic study.",

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CBM (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database) searches were performed. Studies selected for data extraction were those that addressed the accuracy of at least 1 physical diagnostic test for ACL rupture in comparison with a clinical reference standard such as arthroscopy, arthrotomy, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The references of the included studies were also reviewed. Searches were limited to English and Chinese languages. Sixteen studies that assessed the accuracy of the 3 tests for diagnosing ACL ruptures met the inclusion criteria. Study results were, however, heterogeneous. The Lachman test is the most sensitive test to determine ACL tears, showing a pooled sensitivity of 87.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.90). The pivot shift test is the most specific test, showing a pooled specificity of 97.5% (95% CI 0.95-0.99); additionally, it has the highest positive likelihood ratios (LR+) of 16.00 (95% CI 7.34-34.87). The Lachman test has the lowest negative likelihood ratios (LR-) of 0.17 (95% CI 0.11-0.25). In cases of suspected ACL injury, it is recommended to perform the pivot shift test, as it is highly specific and has greater likelihood and discrimination of accurately diagnosing ACL rupture. The Lachman test has great efficacy in ruling out a diagnosis of ACL rupture because of the lowest negative likelihood ratios.",

    "abstract": "Orthopedic injuries, especially fractures of long bones as well as multiple fractures and comminuted fractures, are very common after destructive disasters (e.g., earthquakes, wars, and hurricanes). Another frequent problem is traumatic rhabdomyolysis, which may result in crush syndrome, the second most frequent cause of death after direct traumatic impact following earthquakes. To improve outcomes, interventions should be initiated even before extrication of the victims, which include maintenance of airway patency and spine stabilization, stopping traumatic bleeding by any means, and initiating fluid resuscitation. On-site amputations have been extensively debated to liberate the victims if the release of trapped limbs is impossible. Early after the rescue, a primary survey and triage are performed, a fluid resuscitation policy is planned, complications are treated, the wounds are decontaminated, and the victim is transported to specialized hospitals. A triage and primary survey are also performed at admission to the hospitals, which are followed by a secondary survey, physical, laboratory, and imaging examinations. Washing and cleaning of the soft-tissue injuries and debridement in open, necrotic wounds are vital. Applications of fasciotomies and amputations are controversial since they are associated with both benefits and serious complications; therefore, clear indications should be defined. Crush syndrome has been described as the presence of systemic manifestations following traumatic rhabdomyolysis, the most important component of which is acute kidney injury that may contribute to fatal hyperkalemia. The overall mortality rate is around 20% in crushed patients, which underlines the importance of prevention. Treatment includes maintaining of fluid electrolyte and acid-base balance, application of dialysis, and also prevention and treatment of complications. The principles and practices in disaster medicine may differ from those applied in routine practice; therefore, organizing repeated training courses may be helpful to provide the most effective healthcare and to save as many lives as possible after mass disasters.",

    "abstract": "Proximal humeral fractures account for approximately 5% of all fractures. New plating techniques have been developed to improve stability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate functional outcome following plate fixation with the Proximal Humeral Internal Locking System (PHILOS) and to analyze potential implant-related complications.The PHILOS plate was used for internal fixation of displaced proximal humeral fractures in 28 patients (20 females, 8 males; mean age 60.7+/-12.9 years). Fractures were caused by low-energy trauma (fall from standing height) in 21 patients, and by an accident while skiing or cycling in seven patients. Involvement was on the right in 16 cases and on the left in 12 cases. According to the Neer classification, 8, 12, and 8 patients had displaced 2-, 3-, or 4-part fractures, respectively. All patients received a similar physical therapy program following internal fixation with the PHILOS plate. The patients were assessed clinically and radiographically after a mean follow-up of 25.2+/-11.8 months. Functional outcome was assessed using the Constant-Murley score adjusted for age and gender. Range of motion and shoulder abduction strength were measured. The patients were also evaluated with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS). Complications during the follow-up period were recorded.Twenty fractures (71.4%) healed in good anatomical position. At the end of the follow-up period, the mean Constant-Murley score was 57.9+/-21.7, and the mean age- and gender-adjusted Constant-Murley score was 67.5+/-23.6. The results were excellent or good in 16 patients (57.1%), moderate in one patient (3.6%), and poor in 11 patients (39.3%). The mean DASH and VAS scores were 28.3+/-24.3 and 75.4+/-21.2, respectively. Eleven complications (39.3%) were seen during the follow-up period. Reoperation was required in eight patients (72.3%). Complications included avascular necrosis of the humeral head in two patients (7.2%), subacromial impingement in six patients (21.4%), loosening of a locking head screw in one patient (3.6%), and transiently decreased radial nerve sensation in two patients (7.2%). Subacromial impingement was mainly caused by the superior plate position.Our results demonstrate that the PHILOS plate provides sufficient fracture stabilization in the treatment of proximal humeral fractures of elderly patients.",

The Kujala patellofemoral score is a functional evaluation instrument to evaluate knee problems related to the patellofemoral system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of the Turkish version of the Kujala patellofemoral score in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.After obtaining permission from Kujala et al., the Kujala patellofemoral score was translated into Turkish. The translated version was administered to 40 patients (32 women, 8 men; mean age 33+/-12 years; range 17 to 54 years) twice at a two-week interval to test internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale. All the patients had patellofemoral pain syndrome and did not receive any treatment before administration of the scale. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to assess internal consistency and Spearman's correlation analysis was used to assess test-retest reliability.Cronbach's alpha calculated for internal consistency of the Kujala patellofemoral score was 0.84. Correlation coefficients of the items to estimate test-retest reliability ranged from 0.613 (p=0.004) to 1.000 (p=0.000), with the mean correlation coefficient of 0.944 (p=0.000).There has been no functional assessment scale validated for Turkish patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. Internal consistency of the Turkish version of the Kujala patellofemoral score showed good reliability and test-retest results showed high reliability, suggesting that it is an appropriate functional instrument for Turkish patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.",

All patients had rehabilitation for 12 weeks. Pain level was evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the range of motion (ROM) was measured with a goniometer. The Modified American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (MASES) score was used in functional assessment. Flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation strengths were measured with a manual muscle test. All patients were evaluated before, and at the 4th and 12th week of the rehabilitation. All groups experienced significant decrease in pain and an increase in shoulder muscle strength and function by both the 4th and 12th weeks of treatment (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of function (p>0.05). However, the greatest improvement in functionality was found in Group 2. Supervised exercise, supervised and manual therapy, and home-based exercise are all effective and promising methods in the rehabilitation of the patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. The addition of an initial manual therapy may improve the results of the rehabilitation with exercise.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and steroid injections in patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis. A total of 50 patients with chronic plantar fasciitis were included in the study and divided into 2 groups. In the PRP group (n=25), PRP taken from the patients' blood was activated using calcium chloride and injected in a single dose. In the steroid group (n=25), a single dose methylprednisolone with local anesthetic injection was given. Clinical evaluation was made using the American Foot and Ankle Score (AFAS) and the visual analog scale (VAS). No complications were seen in any patients. Mean AFAS was 85.5 ± 4.2 at 6 weeks and 90.6 ± 2.6 at 6 months in the PRP group and 75.3 ± 4.8 and 80.3 ± 4.7, respectively, in the steroid group (p<0.001). The difference in the mean VAS between the PRP group (2.4 ± 0.8 and 1 ± 0.8) and the steroid group (4 ± 1.1 and 2.6 ± 0.9) at the 6th week and 6th month was statistically significant (p<0.001). Changes in AFAS and VAS scores were significantly higher in the PRP group (p<0.001). The application of PRP appears to be more effective than steroid injection in terms of pain and functional results in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.",

The present study aimed to identify parameters that can be used to estimate survival in DM patients undergoing below-knee amputations for diabetic foot problems.A total of 470 patients (299 males, 171 females) with a mean age of 64.32 years who underwent below-knee amputation for diabetic foot problems between 2004 and 2014 were enrolled in the study. The length of time from the operation to time of death was recorded in days. Patient details were obtained, including age during surgery, BMI, oral antidiabetic and insulin usage, dialysis therapy history, lower extremity endovascular intervention, previous amputation at the same extremity, the need for stump revision surgery during follow-up, and above-knee amputation at the same site. Biochemical test results of pre-operative HbA1c, ESR, and levels of CRP, BUN, and creatinine were also obtained.A total of 333 patients (70.9%) died and 137 (29.1%) survived post-surgery. Survival rates were 90% in the first 7 days, 84% in the first 30 days, and 64% after the first year. Patient median life expectancy post-surgery was 930 ± 106 days. Hemodialysis treatment (p = 0.001), endovascular intervention (p = 0.04), sex (p = 0.004), age (p = 0.001), BUN level (p = 0.001), and duration of insulin use (p = 0.003) were shown to be effective predictors of mortality.Life expectancy is low (<3 years) in DM patients requiring below-knee amputations for untreatable foot problems. Survival could be predicted by duration of insulin use, age, sex, and renal insufficiency.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

A modified guideline, therefore, was published in 2008 with several recommendations. This new version has not yet been translated or culturally adapted for Turkish-speaking populations. The purpose of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the modified CMS and its test protocol, as well as define and measure its reliability and validity. The modified CMS was translated into Turkish, consistent with published methodological guidelines. The measurement properties of the Turkish version of the modified CMS were tested in 30 patients (12 males, 18 females; mean age: 59.5±13.5 years) with a variety of shoulder pathologies. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to estimate test-retest reliability. Construct validity was analyzed with the Turkish version of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). No difficulties were found in the translation process. The Turkish version of the modified CMS showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC=0.86). The correlation coefficients between the Turkish version of the modified CMS and the ASES, SF-12-physical component score, and SF-12 mental component scores were found to be 0.48, 0.35, and 0.05, respectively. No floor or ceiling effects were found. The translation and cultural adaptation of the modified CMS and its standardized test protocol into Turkish were successful. The Turkish version of the modified CMS has sufficient reliability and validity to measure a variety of shoulder disorders for Turkish-speaking individuals.",

There was no significant difference for the operation time, incision size, hospital stay, and Harris hip score between the groups. Also, no statistically significant differences in the rates of nonunion (4.5% vs. 0) and avascular necrosis of the femoral head (9.1% vs. 7.1%) were observed. However, the screw group experienced significantly less surgical blood loss (32.4 ± 24.7 ml) than the blade group (87.2 ± 46.6 ml; P = 0.041). The incidence of femoral neck shortening above 10 mm in the screw group was significantly higher than that in the blade group (15.9% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.031). The blade group had a significantly lower incidence of screw migration than the screw group (4.8% vs. 22.7%, P = 0.016).The DHS-BLADE and cannulated compression screws might be equally effective in terms of postoperative fracture union. However, the DHS-BLADE has advantages over cannulated compression screws for preventing femoral neck shortening, screw migration, and cut-out.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare single-shot adductor canal block and continuous infusion adductor canal block techniques in total knee arthroplasty patients.We prospectively randomized 123 patients who were scheduled for unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty surgery into single shot (n = 60; mean age: 67.1 ± 6.9 years) and continuous (n = 63; mean age: 66.9 ± 6.8 years) adductor canal block groups. Postoperative visual analog scale pain scores, need for additional opioids and functional results as; timed up and go test, the 30-s chair stand test, 5 times sit-to-stand test, the 6-min walking test, the time to active straight leg raise, time to walking upstairs, maximal flexion at the time of discharge, duration of stay in hospital were compared between the two groups.Pain scores were lower in the continuous adductor canal block group as compared to the single-shot adductor canal block group throughout the postoperative period (p = 0.001). Rescue analgesia was required for 6 (10%) patients in the single shot group and for 1 (1.59%) patient in the continuous group (p = 0.044). Patients in the continuous adductor canal block group displayed better functional results than the single-shot adductor canal block group with respect to active straight-leg rise time (25.52 ± 4.56 h vs 30.47 ± 8.07 h, p = 0.001), 6-min walking test (74.52 ± 29.38 m vs 62.18 ± 33.32 m, p = 0.035) and maximal knee flexion degree at discharge (104.92 ± 5.35° vs 98.5 ± 7.55°, p = 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups for other functional and ambulation scores.Pain control following total knee arthroplasty was found to be better in those patients treated with continuous adductor canal block as compared to those treated with single-shot adductor canal block. Patients treated with continuous adductor canal block also displayed better ambulation and functional recovery following total knee arthroplasty.Level I, Therapeutic Study.",

Adequate sample size was determined as 1,990 and a total of 2,035 individuals (1,194 females, 841 males) were enrolled. Participants were inquired about age, occupation, sex, height, weight, history of LBP, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking. Depression symptoms were evaluated using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised.The prevalence of lifetime LBP was 51%, and the prevalence of chronic LBP was 13.1%. Overall, 63.2% of women and 33.8% of men had LBP at least once in their lives (p=0.001). With regard to occupation, the highest incidence of LBP was seen in housewives (64.2%; p=0.0001), whose age and body mass index (BMI) were also higher compared to employed women. Depression (p=0.016) and increased BMI (p=0.000) were found to increase the risk for LBP, whereas smoking, hypertension, or diabetes were not correlated with the prevalence of LBP. Poverty was found to be the leading cause (39.7%) for not presenting to a physician.Among risk factors reported for LBP, many are also effective in Turkish population. Special attention should be given to the education of housewives in terms of low back protection, healthy nutrition, and family planning. Poverty seems to be a significant barrier to patient presentation to physicians, requiring extended social security coverage.",

According to the AO classification, there were 12 type AII-1, 12 AII-2, 3 AII-3, 3 AIII-1, 5 AIII-3 fractures. The mean time to surgery was 13 days (range 5 to 32 days). Closed reduction was achieved in 31 patients. The patients were evaluated clinically (Harris hip score) and radiographically after a mean follow-up of 32.4 months (range 26 to 52 months) and complications were recorded.Reduction was assessed as good or acceptable in all the patients. The mean tip-apex distance was measured as 24.2 mm (range 16 to 40 mm). Complete union was achieved in all but two patients. The mean Harris hip score was 82.1. The results were excellent in 11 patients (31.4%), good in 15 patients (42.9%), fair in seven patients (20%), and poor in two patients (5.7%). Radiographic complications mainly included secondary varus displacement in nine patients (25.7%), and calcification at the tip of the greater trochanter in two patients (5.7%). Secondary varus displacement was due to cut-out of the proximal screws (n=2), screw loosening due to collapse of the fracture site (n=2), and reverse Z-effect (n=5). Clinical results were good in two patients with calcification at the tip of the greater trochanter. Of nine patients with secondary varus displacement, the results were excellent or good in six patients, fair in two patients, and poor in one patient. Five patients (14.3%) required a subsequent operation.The correct position of the osteosynthesis material and use of an intramedullary nail providing a stronger fixation of the proximal part may reduce mechanical complications following the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric hip fractures.",

    "abstract": "The measurement of the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) of the foot is a controversial issue in orthopedics. Several methods have been developed to define and determine the MLA, but none of them are universally accepted. The purpose of this study was to compare some statically obtained radiographic angles with the dynamic plantar pressure distribution measurement system for the evaluation of the MLA in healthy individuals. A total of 95 subjects (72 females, 23 males; mean age 37.8 years; range 11 to 85 years) were retrospectively evaluated. All the subjects were referred to the pedobarography laboratory for varying causes, had foot radiographies, and were evaluated as having normal feet. On standard lateral weight-bearing radiographs of the foot, the lateral talocalcaneal angle, talo-first metatarsal angle, talohorizontal angle, and calcaneal pitch angle were measured. The plantar pressure distribution was measured by the EMED-SF system. To evaluate the MLA, the arch index method was used. The arch index was calculated by the ratio of the pressure area of the midfoot to the sum of the forefoot, midfoot, and the hindfoot areas. Correlations between the radiographic angles and the arch index were analyzed by the Pearson correlation test. The mean values of the lateral talocalcaneal angle, talo-first metatarsal angle, talohorizontal angle, and calcaneal pitch angle were 43.2, 7.2, 29.5, and 41 degrees, respectively. The mean value of the arch index was 0.12 (range 0.04 to 0.17). There was no significant correlation between the arch index and gender (r=-0.10, p>0.05). The talo-first metatarsal (r=0.38) and talohorizontal (r=0.19) angles were found to be in significant correlation with the arch index (p<0.05), whereas the talocalcaneal (r=-0.16) and calcaneal pitch (r=-0.10) angles did not show correlation with the arch index (p>0.05). The arch index method is a simple and reproducible pedobarographic measurement for the evaluation of the MLA. However, the angles measured on statically obtained radiographs and showing correlations with the arch index may give similar results concerning the MLA. Both static and dynamic methods can be utilized in the evaluation of the MLA.",

A total of 3,175 students (1,538 girls, 1,637 boys) of grades 6 to 8 were selected from 16,103 students using a stratified sampling method. Examination for scoliosis was made by the forward bend test and palpation of the spine.Fifteen children (0.47%) were found to have scoliosis, including 10 girls (66.7%) and five boys (33.3%). The prevalence of scoliosis was significantly higher in girls (0.65% vs. 0.31%; p<0.05). The mean lateral curvature of the spine was 6.9 degrees (range 5 degrees to 20 degrees ), being 7.9 + or - 4.6 degrees in girls, and 5.4 + or - 0.9 degrees in boys. The mean age was 13.5 + or - 1.2 years (range 12-15 years). The severity of the curvature showed no significant relationship with gender and age groups (p>0.05). The levels of involvement were lumbar vertebrae in 73.3% (n=11), thoracic vertebrae in 13.3% (n=2), and thoracolumbar vertebrae in 13.3% (n=2). Spinal curvature was to the right side in 12 cases (80%), and to the left in three cases (20%). Girls and boys did not differ significantly with respect to the severity and direction of the curvature (p>0.05). During a two-year follow-up of children with scoliosis, no progression of the curvature was observed, including one child who wore a Milwaukee brace.School screenings may be performed as part of prevalence studies; however, routine school screening for scoliosis is debatable.",

Traumatic injuries were more frequent in matches and were linked with increased age. Overuse injuries were two times higher during training than matches in the U-17 team. The majority of traumatic match injuries (78.3%) led to time loss and the majority of time loss injuries occurred due to traumatic mechanism (62.1%). The majority of muscle and entire ligament injuries occurred during training and contusions during competition.

    "abstract": "This finite element analysis aimed to examine the effect of medial cortical support and medial screw support on loads at the implant-bone interface of locking plate fixation of proximal humeral fractures with a medial gap. An intact humerus from a healthy volunteer was used as the basis for a 3-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design (CAD) model. The 3D CAD model of the locking plate system was based on information in the manufacturer's catalogue. The proximal part of the humerus was osteotomized to create standard three-part fractures, which were then divided into a -MSC group (which lacked medial cortical support, and in which fractures with a 5-mm medial bone gap simulated this lack) and +MCS group (which had medial cortical support, and in which fractures with medial cortical-to-cortical contact simulated this). Both fracture groups were respectively fixed with either +MSS (in which medial screw support was simulated by the addition of two calcar screws to the locking plate system), or with -MSS (in which the lack of medial screw support was simulated by absence of the two additional calcar screws to the locking plate system). All the modeling was conducted to represent 90° arm abduction. On the screw-bone interface, medial screw support and medial cortical support decreased maximum shear stress by 17% and 23% respectively. On the locking plate, medial screw support and medial cortical support decreased maximum von Mises stress by 11% and 22% respectively. However, a combination of these two appeared to decrease maximum shear stress by 56% for the screw-bone interface, and maximum von Mises stress by 54% for the locking plate. Placement of calcar screws combined with good medial cortical contact in varus in locking plate fixation of proximal humeral fractures with a medial gap may provide optimal stability for the fixation.",

A total of 42 patients (mean age 64 ± 8.8) with grade 3 and grade 4 knee osteoarthritis according to Kellegren- Lawrence criteria and who were scheduled for total knee arthroplasty were enrolled in the study. TNF-alpha and MMP-13 levels were measured preoperatively from venous blood samples and intraoperatively from knee synovial fluid via ELISA. Preoperative and 1 month postoperative knee functions were assessed by McMaster Universities Arthritis Index. Grade 4 synovial fluid MMP-13 (4.76 ± 5.82) was elevated compared to grade 3 (3.95 ± 4.45) (p = 0.438), whereas grade 3 serum MMP-13 (1.128 ± 0.308) was found elevated compared to grade 4 (1.038 ± 0.204) (p = 0.430). Grade 4 serum TNF-α (0.253 ± 0.277) was elevated compared to grade 3 (0.206 ± 0.219) whereas grade 3 synovial fluid TNF-α (0.129 ± 0.052) was elevated compared to grade 4 (0.118 ± 0.014). Positive correlation was observed between synovial fluid MMP-13 levels and postoperative WOMAC scores. Mean serum TNF-α level (0.226 ± 0.246 pg/ml) was found higher compared to synovial level (0.124 ± 1.59), synovial MMP-13 level (4.31 ± 1.24) was found higher compared to serum level (1.089 ± 1.519). Despite the systemic increase in TNF-α levels concordant with osteoarthritis grade, MMP-13 levels are elevated via local manner with a significant correlation with WOMAC scores.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to document long-term symptoms and functional results following war-related knee disarticulation, trans-femoral amputation, and hip disarticulation.An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in a 7-day recreational camp in Iran. One thousand patients with unilateral hip disarticulation, trans-femoral amputation and knee disarticulation due to war-related injuries were invited to undergo a thorough physical examination. Among the invited persons, 58.7% (587 subjects) responded to our invitations. A complete examination related to phantom pain, phantom sensation, stump pain, back pain, and sound limb joints pain with a self-constructed questionnaire was performed. In addition, Amputee Mobility Predictor (AMP) instrument with a prosthesis was completed to assess the function of patients.The mean duration of time since amputation was 22 years. The most common symptoms reported by participants were phantom sensation (82%), back pain (69%), and phantom pain (63%). In addition, total scores of AMP with a prosthesis in persons with knee disarticulation and trans-femoral amputations were 20.8 and 28, respectively. The knee disarticulation was associated with higher scores of AMP with a prosthesis compared to transfemoral amputation (p < 0.01).The results of this study showed that patients with lower limb amputation suffer from significant clinical and functional problems. The findings may be useful to adopt new strategies in planning rehabilitation programs to improve quality of life and health status of patients with war-related lower limb amputation.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "Giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) is a primary, osteolytic, benign tumor of the bone. Surgery is the commonly used treatment; however, recurrence remains a problem. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANKL) is responsible for the formation of osteoclastic cells. Discovery of RANKL and its human monoclonal antibody, denosumab, led to use of denosumab for treatment of GCT. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and pathological results of treatment of GCT with denosumab and to assess adverse effect profile and recurrence rate.Thirteen patients with 14 lesions were enrolled in the study. Mean age was 38.3 years. Patients were given subcutaneous injections of denosumab (120 mg) every 4 weeks (with additional doses on days 0, 8 and 15 in cycle 1 only) and were radiologically evaluated for tumor response. Pain and functional status were measured using Visual Analog Score (VAS) and Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score (MSTS). Adverse effects were analyzed after each cycle.Participants were 5 men and 8 women. Mean follow-up was 17 months. One lesion was Campanacci grade I, 8 were grade II, and 5 were grade III. Eight lesions were recurrent, and remaining were primary lesions. After average of 9 cycles (range: 4-17 cycles), all tumors underwent radiological regression. Ten lesions were removed surgically. More than 90% of giant cells were found to have regressed in all pathological specimens. On last follow-up, average VAS was 1 and MSTS was 87%. Fatigue and joint and muscle pain after injections was reported by 46% of patients, and mild hypocalcaemia was seen in 1 patient.Denosumab has been shown to be a successful drug in treatment of GCT. Denosumab can be used as neoadjuvant for all recurrent lesions, grade II lesions with high surgical risk, grade III lesions, and metastatic cases of GCT.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

The mean age was 29.2 years (23-45). Each participant performed elbow extension tasks in five different degrees (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180°) of shoulder elevation with three repetitions. Kinematics data and surface electromyography signal of each head of the triceps brachii were recorded. Recorded kinematics data were then applied to an inverse kinematics musculoskeletal modeling software function (OpenSim) to analyze the triceps brachii's muscle force. Correlation between muscle force, muscle activity, elbow extension, and shoulder elevation angle were compared and analyzed for each head of triceps brachii.At 0° shoulder elevation, the long head of the triceps brachii generates a significantly higher muscle force and muscle activation than the lateral and medial heads (p < 0.05). While at 90°, 135° and 180° shoulder elevation, the medial head of the triceps brachii showed a significantly higher muscle force than the long and the lateral heads (p < 0.05).Each head of the triceps brachii has a different pattern of force and activity during different shoulder elevations. The long head contributes to elbow extension more at shoulder elevation and the medial head takes over at 90° and above of shoulder elevation. This study provides further understanding of triceps brachii's for clinicians and health trainers who need to investigate the functional role of the triceps brachii in detail.",

However, most studies followed up patients in short to middle-term within 5 years, and the longer-term efficacy of SB and DB ACL reconstruction is still beyond consensus. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the longer-term efficacy between double-bundle (DB) and single-bundle (SB) techniques.PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles published up to November, 2017 with an English language restriction. The searches were limited to human subjects and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In addition, the reference lists of identified articles were checked manually to avoid missing other potentially eligible studies. This process was performed iteratively until no additional articles could be included. The quality of the included studies was assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. All statistical analyses were performed with Review Manager soft-ware.A total of five RCTs involving 294 patients were included finally. No studies were excluded due to insufficient data or low quality. The pooled results showed no statistically significant difference between SB and double bundle DB reconstructions for Lysholm, IKDC, pivot shift, KT scores, and the development of osteoarthritis at a minimum of 5 years. No significant heterogeneity was found across all outcomes.The best available evidence demonstrated that SB and DB techniques could yield similar efficacy for ACL reconstruction. And no superiority was founded in DB ACL reconstruction with a minimal 5-year follow-up. Given that, the relatively simple and proven techniques of SB ACL reconstruction may be preferable for orthopedic surgeons.Level I, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "Objective We aimed to analyze the risk factors for clavicle fractures in newborns with shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus injury and to determine whether their incidence is associated with local characteristics. Methods This study was conducted as a retrospective trial between January 2017 and December 2018. Patients with clavicular fracture who were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit of a community hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The clavicular fracture cohort was first divided into two groups and then two subgroups: patients with/without shoulder dystocia and patients with/without a brachial plexus injury. Peripartum and neonatal risk factors of these patients were reviewed using the patient information system. Any additional neurological or musculoskeletal trauma was noted. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus injury. Results A total of 46 patients with shoulder dystocia in 25 (54%) and brachial plexus injury in 12 (26%) were included in the study. The birth weight of patients with shoulder dystocia was 4,164.2±412.7 g, and that of patients without was 3,535.8±865.2 g (p=0.003). In 11 of 14 patients (44%) in whom labor was induced and whose infant had a fractured clavicle, the infant also had shoulder dystocia (p=0.029). Brachial plexus injury was found in 8 (66.7%) of 14 infants who were born by induced labor and who had a clavicular fracture (p=0.002). The regression analysis revealed that age and induction of labor were independent risk factors for brachial plexus injury (odds ratio=1.599 and 81.862, respectively). Gestational weight gain (p=0.003) and neonatal birth weight (p=0.047) were also found as independent risk factors for shoulder dystocia. Conclusion Evidence from this study has shown that not only birth age or birth weight but also excessive weight gain by mother and induction of labor may increase the risk of clavicula fracture with brachial plexus palsy. Advanced maternal age, multiparity, and deliveries after 39 weeks seem to be risk factors for a clavicular fracture with a brachial plexus injury. Level of evidence Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

These patients were divided randomly into two groups of 16 where one group was operated on using conventional surgery and the other group was operated on using 3D model-assisted surgery. During surgery, instrumentation time, amount of blood loss and intraoperative fluoroscopy exposure were recorded. Moreover, the status of the screws in the pedicles was assessed as described by Learch and Wiesner's and regional sagittal angles (RSA) were measured preop and postoperatively.It was found that there was a statistically significant difference in instrumentation time, blood loss and intraoperative fluoroscopy exposure in the 3D model-assisted surgery group (61.9 ± 4.7 min, 268.4 ± 42.7 ml, 16.3 ± 1.9 times) compared to the conventional surgery group (75.5 ± 11.0 min, 347.8 ± 52.2 mL, 19.7 ± 2.4 times) (t=4.5325, P < 0.0001 and t=4.7109, P < 0.0001 and t=4.4937, P < 0.0001, respectively) Although the screw misplacement rate of the conventional surgery group was higher than that of the 3D model-assisted surgery group, the only statistically significant difference was in the medial axial encroachment (t=5.101 P=0.02) . There was no severe misplacement of pedicle screws in either group. There were no statistically significant differences between postoperative RSA angles and were in both groups restored significantly.The results of this study have shown us that the 3D model helps surgeons see patients' pathoanatomy and determine rod lengths, pedicle screw angles and lengths preoperatively and peroparatively, which in turn shortens operative time, reduces blood loss and fluoroscopy exposure.Level I, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the complications encountered following locking plate fixation of proximal humerus fractures.The study included 103 patients (70 females, 33 males; mean age 62 years; range 21 to 90 years) who were treated with open reduction and locking plate fixation for proximal humerus fractures between September 2005 and April 2009. Fixation was performed using the PHILOS locking plate in 93 patients, and S3 humerus plate in 10 patients. Postoperatively, a shoulder-arm sling was applied for six weeks and a standard rehabilitation program was used in all the patients. Intraoperative, acute postoperative, and late postoperative complications were assessed on radiographs. Varus inclination was defined as less than 120 degrees of the inclination angle on immediate postoperative radiographs, and varus displacement as postoperative increases in the varus angle. The mean follow-up period was 19 months (range 2 weeks to 43 months).Complications were seen in 10 patients (9.7%; mean age 67 years). The PHILOS plate was used in nine patients and S3 plate was used in one patient. Five patients (4.9%) had varus inclination with a mean inclination angle of 112.6 degrees (range 105 degrees to 118 degrees), four patients (3.9%) developed varus displacement with a mean inclination angle of 102.5 degrees (range 95 degrees to 110 degrees), and intra-articular screw penetration was seen in five patients (4.9%). The remaining complications were fixation failure (n=1, 1%), implant fracture (n=1), and deep infection (n=1). Screw penetration exceeded 3 mm in three patients, requiring revision surgery. The mean ages of patients with varus inclination, varus displacement, and screw penetration were 76.6, 74.4, and 71 years, respectively. Three patients with varus inclination (60%) developed varus displacement. Screw penetration was observed in three patients (60%) with varus inclination, and in all patients with varus displacement. The mean Constant-Murley shoulder score was 67.8 (range 50 to 90) in patients who developed a complication.Our findings show that locking plate and screw systems represent a significant treatment option in the treatment of comminuted and displaced humerus fractures, with low complication rates. Accurate indication, protection of the head's inclination angle through appropriate surgical approach and proper technique, and fine calculation of screw length are essential for successful functional results.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the relationship between the lumbosacral morphology and degree of intervertebral disc degeneration in a large sample of young patients. In addition, the relation between various morphological parameters (sacral table angle and sacral kyphosis) and lumbar disc herniation or degeneration was also evaluated. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of low back pain patients referred to our department in 2008-2009 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with prior lumbar spinal surgery, serious congenital anomalies on MRI, incomplete or complete lumbosacral trancision, severe scoliosis, spondylolysis, or spondylolisthesis were excluded from the study. A sample of 131 females between 20-30 years of age was studied. Patients were evaluated for the presence of intervertebral disc herniation or degeneration, and the degree of degeneration was assessed. Angles of lumbar lordosis, sacral table, and sacral kyphosis were also measured for each patient. The degree of intervertebral disc degeneration increased in parallel to the decrease in the sacral kyphosis and lumbar lordosis angles, and to the increase in sacral table angle. A statistically significant difference with regard to the angles of lumbar lordosis, sacral kyphosis, and sacral table was determined between individuals with (23.37±7.09°, 163.09±9.48°, 104.34±5.47°, respectively) and without intervertebral disc degeneration (26.94±7.39°, 168.94±10.52°, 100.83±4.32°; p=0.006, p=0.001, p=0.0001, respectively). In addition, a statistically significant difference with regard to the angles of lumbar lordosis, sacral kyphosis, and sacral table was determined between individuals with (22.82±6.94°, 162.23±9.53°, 104.94±5.19°, respectively) and without intervertebral disc herniation (27.25±7.26°, 169.39±9.96°, 100.48±4.33°; p=0.001, p=0.0001, p=0.0001, respectively). The degree and risk of intervertebral disc degeneration and herniation increases in parallel to the decrease in sacral kyphosis and lumbar lordosis, and to the increase in sacral surface angle.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the radiographic and functional results of the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) system in patients with unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures.The study included 45 patients (25 women, 20 men; mean age 72 years; range 27 to 97 years) who underwent osteosynthesis using the PFNA for unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures. The fractures were in the right hip in 25 patients, and in the left hip in 20 patients. The fractures were classified according to the AO system. One patient had an open fracture due to firearm injury (Gustilo-Anderson 3A). The patients underwent surgery within a mean of eight days (range 2 to 21 days) from injury. The mean hospital stay was 13.5 days (range 4 to 25 days). Closed reduction was achieved in all the patients. The results were assessed clinically and radiographically. The neck-shaft angle of the femur (collodiaphysial angle) and the tip-apex distance were measured. The position of the helical screw within the femoral head was determined using the method of Cleveland and Bosworth. Clinical evaluation was made using the Harris hip score. Perioperative and postoperative complications were recorded. The mean follow-up period was 17.3 months (range 6 to 23 months).The mean operation time was 37.8 min (range 22 to 118 min) and the mean blood loss was 225 ml (range 150 to 450 ml). During surgery, femoral shaft fracture occurred in three patients, and greater trochanter fracture occurred in nine patients. Union was obtained in all the patients. Reduction was poor in four patients (8.9%), acceptable in seven patients (15.6%), and good in 34 patients (75.6%). The mean collodiaphysial angle was 136.7 degrees (range 125 degrees to 148 degrees). The tip-apex distance was <25 mm in 36 patients (80%), and =or>25 mm in nine patients (20%). The position of the helical screw in the femoral head was appropriate in 38 patients (84.4%). Postoperative complications included secondary varus (n=2, 4.4%), calcification at the tip of the greater trochanter (n=7, 15.5%), sensitivity over the fascia lata (n=7), medial thigh pain (n=11, 24.4%), and screw cut-out (n=1, 2.2%). Nine patients developed femoral shortness (mean 9.4 mm; range 8 to 13 mm). Screws showed lateral displacement in five patients (11.1%), which was less than 5 mm in four patients. Secondary surgery was required in four patients (8.9%). The mean Harris hip score was 77.8. Harris hip scores were very good in 11 patients (24.4%), good in 19 patients (42.2%), moderate in nine patients (20%), and poor in six patients (13.3%).Due to advantages of high union rate, early postoperative mobilization, and short operation time, PFNA osteosynthesis is the method of choice for surgical treatment of unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures..",

    "abstract": "We evaluated functional results of patients treated with open reduction and internal fixation with the parallel-plate technique for complex distal humerus fractures.Twenty-one patients (14 males, 7 females; mean age 47 years; range 16 to 85) underwent open reduction with olecranon osteotomy and internal fixation with the parallel-plate technique for distal humerus fractures accompanied by highly intra-articular or metaphyseal comminution (n=10), intra-articular comminution and osteoporosis (n=7), and intra-articular and metaphyseal comminution with bone loss (n=4). According to the AO classification, there were 12 C3, six C2, and three C1 type fractures. Eight patients had open fractures. The mean time to surgery was six days (range 1 to 17 days). Functional results were evaluated using the Mayo elbow performance score, Jupiter elbow score, and DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) score. The mean follow-up was 28 months (range 12 to 48 months).The mean total range of motion was 90.2+/-31.1 degrees, flexion was 118.1+/-17.4 degrees, and extension was 27.8+/-17.4 degrees. The mean Mayo elbow performance score and DASH score were 86.1+/-12.6 and 7.6+/-9.5, respectively. According to the Jupiter elbow scores, the results were excellent in seven patients, good in 11 patients, moderate in two patients, and poor in one patient. Radiographically, solid union was achieved in all the patients. Heterotopic ossification of varying degrees was seen in seven patients, two of whom underwent resection of heterotopic ossification due to severe limitation of movement. Debridement was performed in one patient due to the development of deep infection. Chondrolysis of the elbow occurred in one patient. Patients with open fractures had significantly lower range of motion than those with closed fractures (p<0.05), but the Mayo elbow performance score and DASH score did not differ significantly in this respect (p>0.05).Functional results are satisfactory in distal humerus fractures treated with stable osteosynthesis and parallel-plate technique that allow early active motion.",

The study enrolled 142 consecutive patients (79 women, 63 men; mean age 52.02±20.05 years) undergoing either elective or trauma-related surgery. The patients were introduced to the consent process, which involves a verbal and written explanation of the orthopedic condition, surgical procedure, and intraoperative and postoperative risks. At postoperative 1-3 days, patients were asked to recall the orthopedic condition, procedure they underwent, and risks of the surgery. The rate of recall by patients was 131/142 patients (92.3%) for diagnosis, 86/142 patients (60.6%) for surgical procedure, and 32/142 patients (22.5%) for potential complications. Fifty-nine patients (41.5%) could not recall any potential complications. Gender did not influence the ability to describe the operation or potential complications (p>0.05). Advanced age negatively affected recall of information about the surgery and complications (p<0.01), and educational level was correlated with the recall rate (p<0.05). Forty-two patients (29.6%) claimed to have read the consent form before signing it. A greater percentage of patients undergoing elective surgery had read the consent form (p<0.05). Rate of not recalling any potential complications was higher in the trauma group compared with the elective surgery group (p<0.01). Patients had poor retention of information presented during the consent procedure. Further attention should be focused on enhancing patients' understanding of several components of the informed consent process for surgery.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of injuries treated at a hand and microsurgery hospital between 1992 and 2005.This is a descriptive retrospective study based on medical records of a hand and microsurgery hospital in İzmir for the years 1992-2005. A total of 8,946 injuries involving 8,817 patients were included. Data on diagnosis were recorded according to ICD-10. Intent, activity when injured, mechanism of injury, object/substance producing injury, and place of injury were recoded according to International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI).The most common types of injury were amputations (32.3%), fractures (23.7%), and open wounds (19.9%) of the wrist and hand. Most injuries were sustained by males; 28.4% of injuries occurred during summer. According to activity, 76.3% were injured during paid work, 10.4% during transportation, 9.1% during unpaid work, and 3.8% during leisure time sports and exercise. Injuries most commonly occurred while operating a machine. The risk of hand injury was elevated in those younger than 35 years of age, males, persons outside İzmir province, and in Social Security Instution (SSI) insured workers (p<0.001). The riskiest activity for hand injuries was paid work. Compared to baseline, the risk of hand injuries was 29 times [95% confidence interval (CI) 16.36-50.40] as high in industrial or construction areas, and 50 times (95% CI 17.29-143.96) as high in commercial placesHand injuries are important because of their consequences, such as permanent disability and their high treatment costs. This study points out many important risk factors, and has contributed the development of hypotheses about injury types, under-notification of occupational injuries, and child labour. The inclusion of medical records from such specialized hospitals into national databases will aid in the prevention of these injuries, and induce developments in diagnosis and treatment.",

This study included eleven femora and 4 tibiae from 14 patients (9 male, 5 female; mean age: 26.9 years; range: 14 to 51 years) who underwent limb lengthening using motorized intramedullary femoral nails (Fitbone(®) TAA). Average preoperative limb shortening was 4.9 (range: 2.5 to 7.5) cm. Distraction was initiated on the seventh postoperative day. Serial radiographs and Paley's bone and functional outcome scoring systems were used to evaluate the results. Mean follow-up period was 33.5 (range: 7 to 88) months. Mean distraction index value was 1.2 (range: 0.7 to 2.1) days/mm and mean bone-healing index value was 43.7 (range: 13.8 to 144) days/cm. The average lengthening achieved was 51.7 (range: 25 to 75) mm. The distraction mechanism of the nail did not function properly in two patients, restricted transient knee motion was observed in four patients, and delayed consolidation was observed in four patients. Other complications included valgus deformities and superficial infections surrounding the antenna of the intramedullary nail, as well as femur fractures at the proximal end of the nail. Bone scores were excellent in 11 segments and were good in one segment. Functional scores were excellent for all 12 patients. While usual complications related to the external fixators, such as pin-track infections and mobilization difficulties were not encountered, the development of additional complications such as dysfunction of the distraction mechanism should be monitored with the use of motorized intramedullary nails in limb lengthening.",

Hospital charts and radiographs of all patients in both groups were analyzed. Thirty-one patients in the study group were followed both clinically and radiologically.The dislocation rate after primary THA was 1.1% (56/5,205) and the redislocation rate after a first occurrence was as high as 39%. There was a positive correlation between the time intervals from the surgery to first dislocation and from the first dislocation to second dislocation (r=0.4). Most of the primary dislocations occurred within a short period of time after surgery, thus favoring consecutive dislocations. Female gender, as well as revision arthroplasty, was associated with a higher incidence of dislocations. No relation was found between the orientation of the acetabular cup and dislocation.To prevent redislocations after the first occurrence, we suggest thorough evaluation of possible technical faults which should be addressed surgically. Considering the high redislocation rate, we also advocate a stringent conservative treatment regime especially after the first THA dislocation.",

The study included 90 patients with complaints of postoperative pain following cemented total hip replacement divided into two groups based on the intensity of postoperative pain as measured using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Patients with NRS scores of 5 or higher were included in the study group and those with NRS of less than 5 were included in the control group. The Hamilton scales for anxiety and depression and the DS14 test for the identification of Type D personality were used for psychological evaluation. In the study group, more patients were female (29 vs. 13) and had more anxiety (13 vs. 3), depression symptoms (11 vs. 2), and Type D personality (18 vs. 9) than the control group. Mean preoperative NRS was 7.2 ± 1.7 in the study and 6.0 ± 1.2 in the control group (p<0.001).

Men had higher 1- and 5-year mortality rates after second hip fractures (12.1% and 41.2%, respectively) than women (17.4% and 47.3%, respectively).Patients with hip fractures would have a 2-7 fold of risk of a second fracture within 6 years. Women were more prone to a second hip fracture than men but men had a higher mortality rate.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether simple anthropometric measurements, such as height, weight, body mass index (BMI), age, and thigh circumference can be used to accurately predict the diameter of hamstring tendons for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery.One hundred sixty-four consecutive male patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using quadruple hamstring autograft between January 2010 and December 2011 were prospectively evaluated. Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, BMI, age and thigh circumference were recorded preoperatively. The thickness of the quadruple hamstring autograft was intraoperatively determined using sizing cylinders. Correlation coefficients (Pearson's r) and stepwise, multiple linear regression were used to determine the relationship between the outcome variable (hamstring graft diameter) and the predictor variables (age, height, weight, BMI, thigh circumference).Correlation analysis revealed a positive relation between the height, weight and graft thickness (p=0.000 and p=0.002, respectively). Taller and heavier patients tended to have thicker quadrupled hamstring graft. However, age, thigh circumference, and BMI did not correlate with the graft thickness (p=0.700, p=0.290 and p=0.727, respectively). Stepwise, multiple linear regression indicated that height was statistically important as a predictor for hamstring graft diameter (R2=0.157, p=0.0001) and yielded the following regression equation for predicting quadrupled hamstring graft thickness: graft thickness = [(height in cm) x 0.052) - 1.07] mm.Height can be used as a practical and accurate measurement to preoperatively predict quadruple hamstring graft diameter in male patients. Identification of possible hamstring tendon autograft insufficiency allows for preoperative determination of additional graft source possibilities, resulting in a more prompt surgical strategy.",

Three hundred fifty-two patients meeting the above definition of ASD were analyzed for measures of HRQL (Oswestry disability index [ODI], SRS-22 [Scoliosis Research Society-22], and SF-36 [Short form-36 health survey] questionnaires) at presentation. Age groups were defined as 18-40, 40-60, and >60 years. Deformity was analyzed as either degenerative (DS) or idiopathic (IS) (294 patients; 71 degenerative, 223 idiopathic).There were significant differences between age groups--predominantly between the lower age group (18-40) and others--for all HRQL parameters except SRS-22 mental health and SF-36 mental component score. Similarly, HRQL measures for DS and IS deformities were significantly different. Regarding location of main curves, thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL/L) (70.2%) was dominant for the DS group and thoracic (55%) for the IS group. Mean age was 65 years for the DS group and 36 for the IS group, which were significantly different. Radiographic parameters were also significantly different between these groups, with IS patients having more coronal deformity and better sagittal balance.ASD patients are very heterogeneous at presentation, depending on age and diagnosis. There is a distinct need to stratify ASD as early and late presentation ASD and/or by diagnosis. Patients with IS deformity may be very different from those with DS deformity, even at time of presentation. These differences must be taken into consideration in treatment of these patients, as well as for the analysis of the results of treatment.",

The mean duration of symptoms at the moment of the PRP treatment was 8.3 months. Primary outcome measurement was perceived improvement in symptoms for each anatomic compartment for upper and lower limbs at 6 months after treatment. Also, a visual analog scale (VAS) score (pain intensity on a 0-10 scale) was used for pain scoring questionnaire before treatment, 6 weeks and 6 months following the PRP injection(s). To identify factors associated with the likelihood of a better clinical outcome, patients were categorized on the basis of their perceived improvement in symptoms 6 months after the PRP injection(s)-that is, as lower (less than 50% global improvement) or higher (more than 50% global improvement).A visual analogue scale score and perceived improvement in symptoms were significantly lower after peritendinous injection in 6-week and 6-month follow-ups compared with the baseline (P < 0.001) except for peroneal and Achilles tendons. Overall, 83% of patients indicated moderate to complete improvement in symptoms. The most common injection sites were the lateral epicondyle, Achilles, and patellar tendons. Furthermore, 30% of patients received only 1 injection, 30% received 2 injections, and 40% received 3 or more injections. A total of 85% of patients were satisfied (more than 50% global improvement) with the procedure. In addition, upper limb tendons, increase in the age, and female gender were associated with a higher likelihood of perceived improvement in symptoms.In the present retrospective study assessing PRP injections in the treatment of chronic tendinopathy, a moderate improvement (>50%) in pain symptoms was observed in most of the patients. Our research found that results were most promising with patellar and lateral epicondylar tendinopathy in the short to medium term. Female patients, patients with upper extremity tendinopathy and older patients appeared to benefit more from PRP injection.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

The FA grade was evaluated using Goutallier grading system. Non-operated hips of subjects were used as the control. Age, duration after the operation, gluteal muscle FA, and the relationships with HHS were evaluated.FA was more evident in the operated hip (p < 0.05), and was more in the gluteus minimus than in the gluteus medius in both hips (p < 0.05). Patients' age was not correlated with gluteal muscle FA in the operated hip (p > 0.05), whereas there was a positive correlation with the contra-lateral hip (p < 0.05). Duration after surgery did not affect gluteal muscle FA in the operated hip. Older age and FA of either the operated or healthy hip resulted in poorer HHS (p < 0.05). HHS had the strongest correlations with patient age (p < 0.001) and FA (p = 0.026) of the gluteus minimus of contralateral hip.Following THA, there was marked FA in the operated hip compared to that in the contralateral hip. In these cases, degree of FA in the replaced hip did not correlate with patients' age. Fatty atrophy of the gluteus minimus precedes that of gluteus medius.

A case series of 26 elite professional football players diagnosed and treated for posterior ankle impingement syndrome were included for the study. All of the athletes received conservative treatment with physical therapy modalities initially. If the first line medical treatment and rehabilitation was ineffective to alleviate the symptoms, ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection was proposed and thereafter the patients underwent posterior ankle arthroscopy if the complaints are still unresolved. The pain scores (AOFAS, VAS), and time to return to play were the main outcome measures. The complaints of 18 (69.2%) players were subsided with non-surgical treatment whereas three of acute cases and five of the chronic cases did not respond to medical treatment and arthroscopic surgery was performed for eight athletes. Eighteen players returned to training for a mean time of 36.3 days (24-42 days) after conservative treatment. The patients who underwent arthroscopic surgery returned to training for a mean time of 49.8 days (42-56 days) after the surgery. All athletes returned to their previous level of competition after treatment without any complications or recurrence in a mean follow-up 36.5 months (19-77 months). Non-surgical treatment modalities were effective in 2/3 of posterior ankle impingement syndrome in elite football players.

The average duration of symptoms was 2.3 years. MRI scoring system was used to grade the CET injuries and associated injuries in the elbow joint. Three independent radiologists retrospectively reviewed MRI images. Inter- and intra-observer reliabilities for diagnosing lateral epicondylitis were calculated using kappa statistics, and Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to analyze relationships between degree of CET injury and the associated abnormalities of elbow joints. Statistical relations were considered significant for p values of <0.05. In addition, using Spearman's rank correlation analysis, CET injuries and associated abnormalities of elbow joints were correlated with clinical symptoms using visual analog scale pain scores.Various degrees of CET injuries were found in total of 51 patients. Radial collateral ligament and lateral ulnar collateral ligament (RCL/LCL) was the most common accompanying elbow abnormality other than CET injuries. Inter- and intra-observer agreements of CET and RCL/LUCL injuries on MRI were excellent. There were significant correlation between degrees of CET and RCL/LUCL injuries (correlation coefficient r = 0.667, p < 0.01) and between degree of RCL/LUCL injuries and visual analog 11-point pain box scale (VAS) scores (correlation coefficient r = 0.478, p = 0.033).MRI showed excellent inter- and intra-observer reliabilities for the evaluation of lateral epicondylitis. In addition to common extensor tendinopathy, RCL/LUCL abnormality was the most common accompanying finding and degree of RCL/LUCL injuries positively correlated with degree of CET injuries. Furthermore, degree of RCL/LUCL injuries positively correlates with severity of pain.Level IV, Diagnostic study.",

    "abstract": "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common injuries in adolescent athletes, especially in those who bear high stress on their knees due to shearing forces. The goal of the surgical procedures in skeletally immature patients is to restore joint stability avoiding the adverse effects on the growth process. The aim of this study was to verify the return of the skeletally immature professional athletes to sports in the long-term, following ACL reconstruction with the original all-inside technique and with manual drilling.This study included 24 athletes (14 boys, 10 girls; mean age: 13.15 years, range: 9-14 years) who had radiographic evidence of open physes, were less than 14 years of age at the time of surgery and those with a minimum follow-up of eight years. All patients completed a questionnaire, the IKDC subjective knee evaluation form, and Tegner Activity Scale. Biomechanical outcomes of the KT-1000 arthrometer, gait analysis, and stabilometric and isokinetic results were also evaluated. A plain radiograph of both lower limbs was taken to obtain a precise measurement of the limb length and mechanical axis angles.The patients returned to sport activities in a mean time of 6.43 months. No rerupture or resurgery due to growth abnormalities was observed. The mean difference in length between the operated and contralateral legs was 0.4 (range: -0.2 to 0.7) cm. The mean side-to-side difference measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer was 5.2 (range: 3.5 to 7) mm in the preoperative and 0.8 (range: 0 to 2.5) mm in the postoperative measurements.In conclusion, the original all-inside technique with manual drilling with a half tunnel and short graft seems to be a very effective technique for the surgical management of ACL injuries in pediatric/adolescent athletes. A good rate of return to sports at pre-injury levels or higher, high patient satisfaction and a decent motor and proprioceptive function is possible as shown by our analysis.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

Quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method. A total of 10 publications involving 268 Kümmell's disease patients with neurological deficits were included in this review, with 7 studies of low- or very low-quality. There were 37.7% and 62.3% of patients receiving AR and PO, respectively. For clinical outcomes, AR group showed no significant differences in pain, neurological dysfunction, and imaging outcome improvements compared with patients who underwent PO. However, the incidence of implant-related complications including loose screw, screw fracture, screw disconnection, and plate dislodgment, was higher in AR group compared with PO group (21.6% vs. 14.3%). As another major complication, AR group more often required a second surgery. This systematic review demonstrated that both AR and PO could improve pain, neurological dysfunction and imaging outcomes. However, serious comorbidities, multilevel corpectomies and/or severe osteoporosis highly required PO. Design discrepancies were found in the current studies, further higher-quality studies are warranted. Level III, therapeutic study.",

However the optimal plate configuration is not clear in the literature. The aim of this study was to compare the biomechanical stability of the parallel and the orthogonal anatomical locking plating systems in intraarticular distal humerus fractures in artificial humerus models.Intraarticular distal humerus fracture (AO13-C2) with 5 mm metaphyseal defect was created in sixteen artificial humeral models. Models were fixed with either orthogonal or parallel plating systems with locking screws (Acumed elbow plating systems). Both systems were tested for their stiffness with loads in axial compression, varus, valgus, anterior and posterior bending. Then plastic deformation after cyclic loading in posterior bending and load to failure in posterior bending were tested. The failure mechanisms of all the samples were observed.Stiffness values in every direction were not significantly different among the orthogonal and the parallel plating groups. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in plastic deformation values (0.31 mm-0.29 mm) and load to failure tests in posterior bending (372.4 N-379.7 N). In the orthogonal plating system most of the failures occurred due to the proximal shaft fracture, whereas in the parallel plating system failure occurred due to the shift of the most distal screw in proximal fragment.Our study showed that both plating systems had similar biomechanical stabilities when anatomic plates with distal locking screws were used in intraarticular distal humerus fractures in artificial humerus models.",

The following data associated with risk factors were recorded for 92 patients: age, gender, pre-fracture activities of daily living (ADL), type of fracture, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, therapeutic procedure, type of anesthesia, length of time after fracture until operation, postoperative mobility, and duration of hospitalization. A multivariate logistic regression test was used to evaluate the correlation between the risk factors and first- and second-year mortality rates. Third-year mortality rate after surgery was analyzed and compared with the general mortality rate in a similar population of the same age group living in the same city.The mortality rate was 18.5% (17 patients) after the first-year follow-up and 25% (23 patients) after the second year. The mortality risk after hip fracture was found to be 11.7 times greater than the similar age group population in the third year. In addition, there was a significant relationship between a low (dependent) preoperative ADL score, advanced age (>80 years), male gender, high ASA score and poor ability to walk (unable to walk), and first- and second-year mortalities (p<0.05). However, no significant relationship was found between fracture type, fracture side, anesthesia type, time from fracture to surgery, or duration of hospitalization and mortality (p>0.05).Advanced age, male gender, a high ASA score, a dependent preoperative ADL score, and a postoperative inability to walk were determined to be the most important risk factors affecting mortality in elderly patients with hip fracture. The mortality risk was 11.7 times greater than that of a population with similar characteristics.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

Analysis was performed with Revman 5.3 software.Sixteen studies with 2388 patients, covering 905 cases with proximal junctional kyphosis and 1483 cases without proximal junctional kyphosis, were included in the study. The high-risk factors for the development of proximal junctional kyphosis were found to be high body mass index, osteoporosis, severe fatty infiltration of paravertebral muscles, small functional area of paravertebral muscles, lumbar lordosis over-correction, lack of ligament reinforcement device at the proximal vertebrae and upper instrumented vertebra at the thoracolumbar segment, and pelvic fixation. The results were statistically significant.Evidence from this study has revealed that the independent risk factors for proximal junctional kyphosis complications after correction surgery of adult spinal deformity are high body mass index, osteoporosis, severe degeneration of paravertebral muscles, lumbar lordosis overcorrection, fixed fusion to the pelvis, and lack of ligament reinforcement device at the proximal vertebrae and upper instrumented vertebra at the thoracolumbar segment.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

Data on motorcycle accidents/injuries are relatively limited in Turkey. This study sought to determine the injury profile of patients involved in motorcycle accidents.This retrospective study included 212 patients (204 males, 8 females; mean age 36+/-16 years; range 2 to 79 years) who were hospitalized for injuries caused by motorcycle accidents. Data on age and sex, injury patterns, length of hospitalization were recorded. Injuries were grouped according to localization.The frequencies of injuries in descending order were as follows: musculoskeletal system injuries (n=106, 50%), skull injuries (n=103, 48.6%), maxillofacial injuries (n=38, 17.9%), thoracic (n=15, 7.1%), vertebral (n=10, 4.7%), and abdominal (n=6, 2.8%) injuries. Multiple fractures in upper and lower extremities were seen in 17 (8%) and 43 (20.3%) patients, respectively. The most frequent extremity injuries were tibia-fibula fractures (17.9%) followed by shoulder injuries (11.3%). Both extremity and skull injuries were seen in 23 patients (10.9%). The mean hospital stay was 12.2+/-16.8 days (range 1 to 150 days). Eight patients required intensive care for a mean of seven days. As a complication, one patient (0.5%) with olecranon and tibial plateau fractures developed pulmonary embolism. Motorcycle accidents resulted in mortality in nine patients (4.3%).Since motorcycle accidents are preventable or associated risks for injuries are reducible, risk factors for our country should be determined, necessary laws and restrictive regulations should be put into practice, and educational programs should be implemented.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate knee proprioception in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS).The study included 28 patients (18 females, 10 males; mean age 28 years; range 16 to 48 years) with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral PFPS and 27 normal volunteers (13 females, 14 males; mean age 26 years; range 19 to 32 years) without any complaint related to the knee. The mean duration of complaints was 35.8 weeks (range 2 weeks to 3 years). In both patient and control groups, proprioception of the knee was measured by means of active joint position sense at four different target angles (15 degrees , 30 degrees , 45 degrees , 60 degrees ) with the use of a digital goniometer and the results were compared.Proprioceptive errors were greater at all target angles in the affected knees compared to those measured in the contralateral knees and both knees of the controls. Differences between affected knees and contralateral knees ranged from 1.01+/-0.25 degrees to 1.65+/-0.43 degrees and were significant at three target angles (15 degrees , 30 degrees , 60 degrees ; p<0.05). Comparisons between the affected knees and both knees of the controls also showed significant differences at all target angles ranging from 2.48+/-0.92 degrees to 3.87+/-2.46 degrees (p<0.001). Errors obtained in the normal knees of the patients were also significantly greater compared to those seen in both knees of the controls, exceeding 2.7 degrees at some target angles (p<0.001).Our results show that patients with PFPS have impaired proprioception in the affected knee accompanied by significant losses in the proprioception of the contralateral normal knee. Based on these findings, proprioceptive rehabilitation techniques should be incorporated into the treatment of PFPS.",

    "abstract": "The effects of two different closed kinetic chain exercises were compared in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS).Forty female patients with unilateral PFPS were randomly divided into two groups to receive exercises with the hip internally rotated (n=20, mean age 39.1 + or - 8.0 years) or externally rotated (n=20, mean age 36.1 + or - 8.7 years) with the use of the Monitored Rehab Functional Squat (MRFS) System. The duration of exercises was four weeks with a total of 20 sessions. Both groups were evaluated before therapy, after four weeks of exercises, and after six weeks of home exercise program with the MRFS System for muscle strength and proprioception, with a visual analog scale for pain, and with the Kujala questionnaire for functional assessment.Among baseline features, the only significant difference between the two groups was in the mean height (p<0.05). Pain severity decreased significantly in both groups after treatment and home exercises (p<0.05). Concentric and eccentric peak forces, concentric proprioceptive deficit, and Kujala scores improved significantly in both groups after treatment (p<0.05), whereas improvements after home exercises were not significant in this respect (p>0.05). Eccentric proprioceptive deficit, however, did not change significantly both after treatment and home exercises (p>0.05). No significant differences were observed between the two groups during the study period with respect to the parameters assessed (p>0.05).Our results show that functional knee squat exercises with internally and externally rotated hip positions provide similar improvements in muscle strength and proprioception in patients with PFPS.",

Twenty-two patients (81.5%) had AO type C and five (18.5%) had type B fractures. Two patients (7.4%) had type I open fractures. Dorsal and volar angulation were present in 21 (77.8%) and six (22.2%) fractures, respectively. Four patients (14.8%) also had elbow dislocation and/or fracture and nine patients (33.3%) had disruption of the distal radioulnar joint. Autologous iliac crest graft was used in 10 patients (37%). Postoperative assessments included range of movement and grip strength measurements, and radiographic parameters using the Stewart criteria. Functional results were assessed using the Q-DASH (Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire and the Gartland-Werley scale. The mean follow-up was 18 months (range 12 to 34 months).All fractures united without a problem within a mean of 6.5 weeks (range 6 to 8 weeks). The following parameters became equal to the unaffected side: ulnar variance (n=21, 77.8%), radial inclination angle (n=13, 48.2%), radial tilt angle (n=8, 29.6%), and radial height (n=11, 40.7%). The mean radiographic Stewart score was 0.5 (range 0 to 3). The mean grip strength of the operated side was 72.4% (18 kg) of the normal side. The mean Q-DASH and Gartland-Werley scores were 8.3 (range 0 to 70.5) and 4.7 (range 0 to 16), respectively. According to the Gartland-Werley scale, the results were excellent in 12 patients (44.4%), good in 12 patients, and moderate in three patients (11.1%). Three complications (11.1%) occurred, including loss of alignment in two patients, and screw-related discomfort in one patient.Volar locking plate fixation is an effective treatment in the anatomical and functional restoration of unstable distal radius fractures.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, muscle weakness has been shown to be a major component of cerebral palsy (CP) pathology. Caused by multiple etiologies including variations in the muscle fiber type, pathologic motor unit function, co-contraction of agonists and antagonists, and muscle size and rigidity, weakness interferes with function and leads to limited function and participation. Muscle strength was found to be associated with walking ability and with functional scales. Children with CP were found to be weaker than typically developing children, and differences were found with respect to muscle groups in children with CP. Muscle weakness should be evaluated as objectively as possible to improve the quality of diagnosis and treatment. Manual muscle testing is not sufficient for evaluation, and instrumented muscle testing is validated in CP. Muscle strengthening is an important part of treatment of CP. Several methods of strengthening have been described. Muscle lengthening and other spasticity-modifying therapies have been shown to have a positive effect on muscle strength. Children who participated in muscle strengthening programs had a better quality of life and improved function.",

We compared phenol applications of different durations with respect to efficacy and safety.The study included 148 ingrowing nails (grade 2-3) of 110 patients (54 males, 56 females). The patients were randomized to three groups for 1-, 2-, and 3-minute applications of phenol cauterization of the germinal matrix following surgical removal of ingrowing nails. Postoperative evaluations were made on days 2, 10, 16, 24, and 30 for pain, drainage, and tissue damage. Recurrences were recorded during a follow-up of 24 months.Improvements in pain, drainage, and tissue damage in each group were significant (p<0.001). Time to complete healing and durations of drainage and tissue damage were significantly shorter in patients receiving 1-minute phenol application (p<0.001), and the remaining groups did not differ in this respect. The mean duration of pain was similar in three groups. While the frequencies of pain and tissue damage were similar in three phenol groups, the number of patients having drainage on day 16 was significantly lower with 1-minute phenol application (p<0.001). All recurrences appeared in the sixth month and there was no significant difference between the three groups with respect to the recurrence rate.Our findings suggest that 1-minute phenol cauterization of the germinal matrix has a better safety profile than prolonged applications in the treatment of ingrown nails.",

Thirty-two Wistar-Albino-type male rats included in the study were divided into four groups of equal number: 1) sham operation, 2) I/R, 3) I/R+HBO-PC, or 4) I/R+O3-PC. One session of 3-4 L/min 100% oxygenation for 60 min at 3 absolute atmosphere (ATA) was defined as one dose of HBO; in total, 7 doses of HBO-PC were administered before ischemia. One dose of O3 comprised 0.7 mg/kg ozone/oxygen mixture, administered intraperitoneally; a total of 4 doses of O3-PC were administered before ischemia. The I/R model was performed in anesthetized rats by clipping right femoral artery to induce 2 h ischemia followed by 22 h of reperfusion. The right gastrocnemius muscle and venous blood samples were harvested. Tissue was assayed for levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Serum was assayed to measure the level of nitrite-nitrate (NOx). Tissue MDA level, SOD activity, and serum NOx level were increased, whereas GSHPx was decreased in the I/R group. MDA and NOx levels were decreased, whereas GSH-Px activity was increased in both the I/R+HBO-PC and I/R+O3-PC groups. SOD activity was increased in the I/R+O3-PC group, but did not change significantly in the I/R+HBO-PC group. iNOS staining score and intensity were lower in the I/R+HBO-PC and I/R+O3-PC groups than I/R group. Both O3-PC and HBO-PC reduced tissue lipid peroxidation, NOx levels, and iNOS staining scores in the experimental I/R model. Our data suggest that HBO-PC and O3-PC protect against oxidative/nitrosative stress induced by I/R in rat skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and functional outcomes and proprioceptive function in patients who received a modified accelerated rehabilitation program after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with a patellar tendon (PT) graft. The study included 38 patients (33 men, 5 women; mean age 27.6 ± 6.4 years; range 18 to 45 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction with a PT graft and participated in a modified accelerated rehabilitation program. Only six patients were athletes. Isokinetic strengths of concentric knee extension and flexion were measured with the Cybex isokinetic dynamometer, and static balance was tested with the Sport-KAT device. For proprioceptive assessment, active repositioning was measured at knee flexions of 40°, 20°, and 5° with an isokinetic dynamometer. Activity levels and subjective functional results were evaluated with the Tegner activity scale and Lysholm knee score, respectively. For objective functional testing, single leg hop, triple leg hop, and one-legged crossover hop tests were used. Knee stability was assessed with the Lachman test and anterior drawer test and knee range of motion was measured. The mean follow-up period was 16.2 ± 9.8 months. There was no graft failure during the follow-up. Twenty patients (52.6%) had hypoesthesia at the donor site and 15 patients (39.5%) had anterior knee pain. Before surgery, all the patients had positive results in the Lachman and anterior drawer tests. After surgery, the Lachman test was negative in 32 patients (84.2%), while six patients (15.8%) had grade 1 laxity. The mean Lysholm knee score showed a significant increase postoperatively (p<0.001). The mean preoperative and postoperative Tegner activity scores were not significantly different (p>0.05). There were no significant differences in the range of motion between operated and uninjured extremities (p>0.05). The two extremities were similar in proprioception and balance (p>0.05). Isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength was significantly decreased in the operated extremity only in extension at 60°/sec angular velocity (p<0.05). Other muscle strength measurements were similar in both extremities. The ratios of flexion/extension muscle strength were significantly greater in the involved extremity at all angular velocities (p<0.05). The mean performance scores of three functional tests were more than 85% of the uninvolved extremity. All the patients returned to preinjury daily activities or sports activities in 6 to 12 months postoperatively. We had satisfactory clinical, proprioceptive, and functional results in achieving dynamic and static stability of the knee with the modified accelerated rehabilitation program after ACL reconstruction with a PT graft.",

Twenty patients (17 male, 3 female; mean age: 31 years [5-63 years]) with knee septic arthritis treated with arthroscopic debridement and irrigation in our clinic between 2004-2007 were included in the study. The decision for arthroscopic debridement was made based on the clinical findings, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level and the aspiration of the affected knee. During the arthroscopic debridement, the joint was staged according to Gachter criteria. Continuous irrigation system was set up for all cases following surgery. After the surgery, the Bussiere functional scale was used for clinical evaluation. The mean follow-up periodwas 29±11months (range 13-54 months). The McNemar test was used in comparing the results. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used in the correlation analysis. The level of significance was set at 0.05. The culture was positive in 3 cases, and negative in 8 cases who exhibited gram (+) cocci in gram stains. In nine cases, cultures were negative and no microorganisms were detected in gram stains. According to the arthroscopic Gachter classification, 4 cases (20%) were Stage 1, 10 cases (50%) were Stage 2, 5 cases (25%) Stage 3 and 1 case (5%) was Stage 4. There was a statistically significant difference between the mean functional score of the knees with differing Gachter stages (McNemar test, p=0.003). There was a statistically significant and strong correlation between Gachter score and functional results (correlation coefficient: 0.780; p<0.001). Advanced arthroscopic findings are associated with poor functional results in patients with septic arthritis of the knee joint. In addition, the time between the initial symptoms and the surgery directly affects the functional results.",

In Group A, no bleeding control was done and postoperatively, the drain was clamped for 2 hours.Then it was unclamped to begin aspiration after the 2nd hour.In Group B, the bleeding was controlled intraoperatively, and the drain was not clamped after the surgery.Drains were removed 48 hours after the surgery in both groups.Bilateral and unilateral arthroplasty patients were evaluated separately.The groups were compared for their preoperative and postoperative 3-day haemoglobin (Hb) levels, total drainage amount and total number of blood transfusions.Results: The haemoglobin levels were similar in both groups preoperatively and at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd postoperative days.In Group A, the wound drainage was 696.1±235.4ml in unilateral TKA patients and was 1010.8±535.5 ml in bilateral arthroplasty patients.In Group B, the wound drainage was 710.1±380.1 ml in unilateral TKA patients and was 878.3±489.6 ml in bilateral arthroplasty patients.The mean number of transfusions was 1.41 units with no significant differences between the groups. Conclusion:The two hour drain clamping method without intraoperative bleeding control does not seem to affect the amount of blood loss and the need for transfusion when compared to intraoperative bleeding control in total knee arthroplasty patients.Hovewer, it is a simple and feasible method and can be used to decrease the operation time.",

The 68 rats were divided into 4 groups with 17 rats in each group; PRP group (Week 2), control group (Week 2), PRP group (Week 4), and control group (Week 4). Platelet-rich plasma or saline was injected to the repair area intraoperatively. Rats were sacrificed 2 and 4 weeks after the surgery. Histological analysis using a semiquantitative scoring was performed on 7 rats per group. Tendon integrity and increases in vascularity and inflammatory cells and the degree of new bone formation were evaluated and compared between the groups. The remaining tendons (n=10) were mechanically tested.Degree of inflammation and vascularity were less in the study group at both time intervals (p<0.05). Tendon continuity was better in the study group at 2 weeks (p<0.05). Obvious new bone formation was detected in the control group at 4 weeks (p<0.05). Biomechanically, platelet-rich plasma-treated specimens were stronger at 2 weeks (p<0.05).Local autologous PRP injection may have beneficial effects on initial rotator cuff tendon-to-bone healing and enhance initial tendon-to-bone healing remodeling. This may represent a clinically important improvement in rotator cuff repair.",

However, the number of studies concerning the results of this method is limited. In this study, the clinical and radiographic results of conservatively treated simple elbow dislocations were retrospectively evaluated. The study included 21 patients (16 males, 5 females) who underwent closed reduction and immobilization for simple elbow dislocations. Simple dislocations were defined as non-fracture dislocations and dislocations accompanied by minor avulsion fractures that did not require additional surgery or immobilization. The mean age of the patients at the time of injury was 35 years (range 16 to 59 years). All the patients had posterior dislocations. Eleven patients (52.4%) had minor avulsion fractures. Following closed reduction, a plaster splint and hinged brace were used in four (19.1%) and 17 (81%) patients, respectively. Incremental active and passive motions were started at the end of the first week in patients in whom a brace was used. The mean duration of brace use was 27 ± 16 days. Patients using a plaster splint were immobilized for three weeks. The patients were assessed clinically with respect to range of motion, instability, and neurologic findings after a mean follow-up period of 34 months (range 12 to 99 months). Functional assessments included the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and the Broberg-Morrey Functional Rating Index (BMFRI). Standard elbow anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were examined for concentric reduction and signs of degeneration and heterotopic ossification. Compared to the normal side, the degrees of flexion, extension, flexion arc, and pronation were significantly decreased in dislocated elbows (p<0.05), while the degrees of supination and rotational arc were similar. There was no muscular atrophy. Four patients (19.1%) had residual instability and six patients (28.6%) had mild to moderate neurological complaints that were primarily related to the ulnar nerve. Three patients complained of mild pain, and one patient complained of moderate pain at rest. Radiographic assessment showed mild degeneration in three patients (14.3%), and mild to moderate heterotopic ossification in 14 patients (66.7%). Patients with and without heterotopic ossification did not differ significantly with respect to the values of joint range of motion. The mean MEPS and BMFRI scores were 96.9 and 97.7, respectively. The scores of both systems were excellent in 20 patients (95.2%) and moderate in one patient (4.8%). The majority of the patients (81%) reported complaints about their elbows including sensation of stiffness in the elbow, pain during strenuous work or sports activities, and limitation of movement. Only four patients (19.1%) reported a feeling of full recovery. Although closed reduction with short-term immobilization is a universally accepted method for simple elbow dislocations with excellent functional scores, it is associated with significant limitations in joint movements and a great majority of patients do not consider themselves fully recovered.",

Exclusion criteria included history of injury or disease related to the lower extremities. Changes with age in the arc of joint motion were studied. The influence of various functional positions of the lower limb on the range of motion of the hip and the effect of weight-bearing on the ankle joint range of motion were also analyzed. Hip range of motion differed in various positions. Hip rotations were significantly greater when measured with the knee in flexion in both the sitting and prone positions than in the supine position. The arc of hip rotation was highest in the prone position. A significant increase in the arc of ankle dorsiflexion was found in a weight-bearing (squatting) position. Age related reduction in movement was found mainly in the rotations of the hip and dorsiflexion of the ankle. The data compiled in this study on the range of motion in the hip and ankle joint of the Indian population will be useful in the evaluation of patients with disorders of these joints, especially in the Indian and Asian population.",

Twenty-eight were closed and seven were open fractures. After direct or indirect fracture reduction, the plate was advanced through a submuscular extraperiosteal tunnel through the distal incision without opening the fracture line. The plate was fixed with screws through the proximal and distal incisions. Clinical and radiological evaluations were made at four to six week intervals after surgery. Full weight-bearing was allowed after an average of 14.43 (range: 12 to 20) weeks and 15.39 (range: 8 to 32) weeks in open and closed fractures, respectively. Duration of the union and complications were analyzed.The mean duration of the union was 20.7 (range: 16 to 28) weeks and 17.96 (range: 10 to 36) weeks in open and closed fractures, respectively. All cases showed union except one who had an implant failure. Necrosis at the wound developed in one case and infection in another.MIPPO is an effective alternative treatment for tibial diaphysis and distal tibia fractures with low complication and high union rates.",

Average follow up was 34.5 months. In all cases, the radial head was first fixed or replaced and the anterior capsule/coronoid complex and lateral collateral ligament were repaired. The medial side of the elbow was addressed (medial collateral ligament repair and ulnar nerve release) in 8 cases and not addressed in the remaining 8 cases. Range of motion, pain, stability, ulnar nerve symptoms, functional Mayo Elbow Performance Index, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores were documented. Serial X-rays were used to confirm ulnohumeral arthritis and development of ectopic calcification. Ultrasonography or MRI was used to detect ulnar nerve entrapment.Range of motion was slightly more limited in cases where the medial side was not addressed. Ulnohumeral range of motion and flexion degrees were higher in the cases where the medial side was addressed (p<0.05). Serial X-rays demonstrated impending ectopic calcification located at the proximal insertion of medial collateral ligament in patients who did not undergo medial side repair. MRI or ultrasonography confirmed these findings, revealing swollen displaced nerves resembling findings similar to cubital tunnel syndrome.Ulnar neuropathy is a common complication after medial collateral ligament injury and prophylactic release will facilitate overall results and postoperative patient satisfaction.",

The relative arch deformity (RAD) was calculated with both 10% and 90% weight bearing (WB). Static balance was evaluated with Single Leg Stance Test and dynamic balance with TechnoBody PK 200WL computerized balance device. Subjects were evaluated for goniometric measurements of lower extremity joints, leg dominance and leg-length discrepancy.Bipedal dynamic balance was correlated with both feet length at 10% WB and 90% WB. There was a correlation between the dynamic balance on dominant foot and RAD value on the aspect of Medium Speed (r = -0.32, p = 0.02), Perimeter Length (r = -0.32, p = 0.02) and Anterior-Posterior Sway (r = 0.36, p = 0.01). Static balance was unaffected by RAD value when the visual system was eliminated.Our results suggest that decrease of arch mobility on the dominant foot is associated with posterior sway by causing knee or hip strategy and preventing ankle strategy even in small perturbations. The rate of deviation from the equilibrium point and the degree of total swaying increase when arch mobility decreases.",

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between ASPN gene D-repeat polymorphism and KOA risk.Eligible studies were identified by searching several electronic databases for relevant reports published before September 2016. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) for the association between ASPN polymorphism and KOA and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the random- or fixed-effect model.A total of eleven case-control studies in ten publications with 4610 KOA cases and 3621 controls were included for the ASPN D-repeat polymorphism. Overall, no significant association was detected for D14 allele carrier (D14 vs. D13: OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.90-1.36, p = 0.32). Meta-analysis of D14 vs. other alleles and D13 vs. other alleles showed the same pattern of KOA association as the D14 vs. D13 (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.00-1.70, p = 0.06; OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.82-1.06, p = 0.33, respectively). Also, in the stratified analysis by ethnicity, no significant association of this polymorphism with risk of KOA was found in the European and Asians populations (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.91-1.21, p = 0.49; OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.78-1.23, p = 0.88, respectively).The present meta-analysis suggests that the ASPN D-repeat polymorphism is not associated with an increased KOA risk. However, future large studies with gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are needed to validate these findings.Level III diagnostic study.",

Four patients had 2-part fractures, 14 patients had 3-part fractures, and 13 patients had 4-part fractures, according to Neer classification. Healing, complications, and head-shaft angle (HSA) were radiographically evaluated. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 1-year follow-up with Constant score.Average Constant scores for fractured and normal shoulders were 73.2 ± 10.9 and 84.8 ± 5.1, respectively. Varus progression, fracture type, and age had no significant effect on functional outcome. Average postoperative and follow-up HSA's were 130.80 ± 7.70 and 128.80 ± 10.00, respectively. Significant varus progression was observed during follow-up (p = 0.01). Varus progression was more prominent in patients with postoperative HSA < 130° (p < 0.001). Inferomedial calcar screw usage, fracture type, and age had no significant effect on varus progression. Complications included 2 implant failures, 1 case of avascular necrosis (AVN), 1 primary screw cut-out, 1 axillary nerve injury, and 1 radial nerve injury (22.6% overall).MIPO is a safe and effective option for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures, with good functional recovery and fewer complications, which are typically technique dependent. Reduction may be difficult, resulting in varus progression. Another disadvantage is risk of axillary nerve injury. Careful surgical technique and correct implant selection is important in the prevention of nerve injury.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

Collagen fibers proliferated more densely early after severance, and subsequent remodeling of the collagen fibers and approximation of normal tendinous tissue occurred earlier in the PRP group than in the control group. The fibroblast number was significantly higher in the PRP group than in the control group at 1 and 2 weeks. Similarly, the area ratio of CD31-positive cells was significantly higher in the PRP group than in the control group at 1 and 2 weeks. Positive staining for type I collagen was more intense in the PRP group than in the control group after 3 weeks, indicating tendon maturation.

Bone graft or bone cement was used to fill in the cavity. Mean follow-up period was 107.5 months. Groups were analyzed statistically in terms of local recurrence. Onset of cyst in ages under 10 and 20 years were considered a negative prognostic factor and analyzed statistically. Local recurrence occurred in 10 (11.8%) patients. Mean duration between the initial operation and recurrence was 10 months. There was no significant difference in terms of local recurrence among the surgical treatment groups, adjuvant therapy groups, age groups and bone graft and bone cement groups. Careful curettage of the entire cyst wall remains the most important step in the intralesional treatment of aneurysmal bone cyst.",

In addition to configuration of pin fixation, many factors have been attributed to loss of reduction (LOR). The aim of the present study was to review potential factors that contribute to loss of reduction in the closed management of type III pediatric supracondylar fractures.Treatment of 87 patients with type III supracondylar fractures was reviewed to determine factors associated with loss of reduction; 48 patients were treated with lateral pinning and 39 with crossed-pinning after closed reduction. Outcome parameters included radiographic maintenance of postoperative reduction.Lateral or crossed-pin configuration, pin spread at fracture site, pin-spread ratio (PSR), and direction of coronal displacement of the fracture were not associated with LOR. A significant difference (p = 0.01) was found between LOR rates of patients with medial wall communication and LOR.Medial wall communication is a contributing factor to LOR in the management of type III supracondylar fractures. Cross-pinning should be preferred when medial wall communication is present, to provide more stable fixation.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

All were treated between 2009 and 2014. The average age of the patients was 40.3 years. Thirty-seven patients were treated with IMN and 36 patients were treated with MIPO. Fibular plate osteosynthesis was applied in 5 cases (13.5%) in the IMN group and in 23 patients (63.9%) in the MIPO group.Functional results and complications of IMN and MIPO methods were assessed in 73 patients. The average union time was 16.4 ± 2.7 weeks in the IMN group and 15.2 ± 1.8 weeks in the MIPO group (p = 0.079). The average Olerud-Molander Ankle Score was 87.8 ± 8.1 in the IMN group and 81.5 ± 11.8 in the MIPO group (p = 0.013). Four patients in the IMN group experienced valgus malunion, while it was not observed in any patients in the MIPO group (p = 0.042). Recurvatum malunion was detected in 10 patients in the MIPO group and not seen in the IMN group (p = 0.001). Ankle dorsiflexion angle was 25.8 ± 4.5° in the IMN group and 33.3 ± 8.9° in the MIPO group (p = 0.000).Simple intra-articular distal tibial fractures are successfully treated with IMN and MIPO. Prevalence of valgus malunion was higher in the IMN group and recurvatum was more prevalent in the MIPO group. MIPO is the first preference according to the literature; however, successful results have been obtained with IMN in this fracture pattern.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether delphinidin is cytoprotective or cytotoxic in osteosarcoma cell lines, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.The present study investigated whether apoptosis or autophagy is induced by delphinidin in human osteosarcoma cell lines. Delphinidin was used as the antioxidant, along with two autophagy inhibitors: 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1. Cell viability and known autophagic markers, such as LC3-II expression, were evaluated. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and cell cycle analysis were also investigated.Delphinidin showed concentration-dependent cytotoxicity to osteosarcoma cell. Delphinidin is closely associated with apoptotic cell death mechanisms and pathways related to ROS accumulation. In addition, we observed delphinidin-induced autophagosome formation and increasing levels of LC3-II conversion. However, in spite of delphinidin induced autophagy, the cytotoxic effects induced in the osteosarcoma cells may not be operating via autophagic cell death mechanisms.Delphinidin compromises the cellular protective mechanisms by inhibiting autophagy, permitting ROS to accumulate and finally enhance apoptotic cell death. Our results indicate that delphinidin may play a critical role as a chemotherapeutic agent by preventing the development and progression of osteosarcoma cells.",

The mean follow-up time was 28.1 months (range 24-35). The records were reviewed for fracture patterns, time to surgery, operative time, blood loss, reduction quality, and perioperative complications. Reduction quality was graded as anatomic, imperfect, or poor. The Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Merle d'Aubigné score were used for functional evaluation.Among the 63 acetabulum fractures of the 57 patients, 27 were associated with both columns, 12 were T-type fractures, 10 were transverse, 7 were anterior column/posterior hemitransverse, 5 were anterior column, and 2 were anterior wall fracture. A single surgeon performed all operations. Pfannenstiel incision was used in the first 19 cases while vertical midline incision in the remaining 38 cases. Average time to operation was 5.5 days, and supplemental lateral windows were used in 17 (29.8%) patients. Average blood loss and operation times were 660 mL and 152 min, respectively. Radiological outcomes were anatomic, imperfect, and poor in 52 (82.5%), 9 (14.2%), and 2 (3.2%) of the acetabulum fractures, respectively.

All children were evaluated separately by two physiotherapists for interrater reliability and they re-evaluated for intra rater reliability. Gross Motor Function Measurement total score and B part were used for construct validity.The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value of the inter-rater reliability for the Turkish TCMS was 95% CI (0.823-886), and the intra-rater reliability was 95% CI (0.986-0.992). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the Turkish TCMS and the Gross Motor Function Measure total score r: 0.827; p < 0.05 Part B was r: 0.863; p < 0.05.The results of the study support that the Turkish TCMS has a high inter and intra rater reliability and validity similar to the original version. Thus, the Turkish TCMS appears to be a suitable evaluation tool to assess the qualitative performance of trunk control and sitting balance for children with CP and it gives opportunity to use clinically and research purposes.Level III, Diagnostic Study.",

During this latter period patients were preoperatively screened and, if positive, treated with mupirocin nasal ointment and chlorhexidine soap, for 5 days prior to surgery.In the control group, 17 of 400 patients (4.2%) had a SSI, 8 (2%) of them caused by S. aureus and 9 (2.2%) by other microorganisms. In the intervention group 20.6% of patients had a positive S. aureus nasal swab and were treated according to the protocol. 5 of 403 patients (1.2%) in this group had a SSI, 1 (0.2%) due to S. aureus and 4 (1%) to other microorganisms. When comparing surgical-site infection (SSI) rates between the two groups, we found a statistically significant reduction in both global SSI (p = 0.009) and specifically S. aureus SSI (p = 0.02), in the intervention group. No decolonized S. aureus nasal carrier presented a SSI.In patients undergoing TKA a preoperative screening and decolonization protocol for S. aureus nasal carriers, using mupirocin nasal ointment and chlorhexidine soap, is an effective measure to reduce the rate of SSI caused by this microorganism.Level III; Therapeutic Study.",

Ninety-one patients (mean age: 55.89±7.85 years) with knee osteoarthritis participated in the study. Patients completed the Turkish version of the Oxford Knee Score (OKS-TR), Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (WOMAC) questionnaires. Internal consistency was tested using Cronbach's α coefficient. Patients completed the OKS-TR questionnaire twice in 7 days to determine the reproducibility. Correlation between the total results of both tests was determined by Spearman's correlation coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Validity was assessed by calculating Spearman's correlation coefficient between the OKS, WOMAC, and SF-36 scores. Floor and ceiling effects were analyzed.Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's α: 0.90). The reproducibility tested by 2 different methods showed no significant difference (p>0.05). The construct validity analyses showed a significant correlation between the OKS and the other scores (p<0.05). There was no floor or ceiling effect in total OKS score.The OKS-TR is a reliable and valid measure for the self-assessment of pain and function in Turkish-speaking patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of clavicular hook plate fixation with and without coracoclavicular (CC) tape augmentation for the treatment of acute unstable AC dislocation.We treated 47 patients (31 men and 16 women; mean age: 47 years (range, 21-81)) with unstable acute AC dislocations (Rockwood III-V) and divided them into two groups according to the treatment modality, with hook plate fixation (hook plate group) or hook plate plus CC tape augmentation (combined group). We assessed radiologic findings, such as subacromial osteolysis and AC osteoarthritis. We also evaluated the clinical outcomes using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, as well as the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Rating Scale and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Score.We found that the combined group had less subacromial osteolysis upon radiography, although the CC distance was similar in both groups (119 ± 29.7% of contralateral side CC distance in hook plate group versus 119 ± 34.8% in the combined group, p = 0.77). Compared with the hook plate group, the combined group had a lower VAS score (4.5 ± 2.3 in hook plate group versus 2.3 ± 1.4 in the combined group, p < 0.001), better UCLA scores (19.9 ± 4.9 in hook plate group versus 27.2 ± 4.0 in the combined group, p < 0.001) as well as better ASES scores (51.9 ± 17.8 in hook plate group versus 73.8 ± 13.1 in the combined group, p < 0.001) at 3 and 6 months after surgery.Hook plate fixation plus CC tape augmentation may prevent subacromial osteolysis and yield better short-term functional outcomes.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of intravenous (IV) tranexamic acid (TRX) use on visual clarity during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted in patients scheduled for an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. In total, 60 patients were randomly distributed into two groups: control (28 patients: 11 male, 17 female; mean age=53 years, age range=19-65) and TRX (32 patients: 15 male, 17 female; mean age=50, age range=18-69). In the TRX group, the arthroscopy was performed through the bolus IV administration of 10 mg/kg TRX in 100 ml isotonic saline solution. In the control group, the arthroscopy was performed through the bolus IV administration of 100 ml isotonic saline solution. In both the groups, the IV administration was carried out after the induction of anesthesia. At the end of each procedure, the surgeon rated the visual clarity on a scale from 1 to 10. In addition, operation time (minutes), irrigation amount used in operation (lt), and the need of pressure increase because of bleeding were recorded.No adverse effects were seen during the study period. Visual clarity in TRX group was significantly better than the control group (the mean visual clarity scores=8.1/10 (range=7-10) vs 7/10 (range=5-9); p=0.018). The amount of solution was significantly less in the TRX group (10.2 lt (range=3.5-21)) than in the control group (15.8 lt (range=5.8-27); p=0.007, post-hoc power=95.7%), although the operation time was slightly longer in the TRX group (106 minutes (range=50-210)) than in the control group (99 minutes (range=45-165); p=0.24). Moreover, the need for the increase in pressure owing to bleeding was found significantly less in the TRX group (5.8 times (range=(0-9)) than in the control group (9.6 times (range=0-13); p=0.04, post-hoc power=94.5%).Preoperative IV TRX administration seems to be effective in improving visual clarity and reducing the need for high pressure and the amount of irrigation fluid during the arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.Level II, Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective randomized trial was to compare cemented (CHA) and uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty (UCH) in patients with femoral neck fractures (FNF).The study included 158 patients aged ≥76 years who underwent bipolar HA for displaced FNF. Patients were randomized in two groups: the cemented group (CHA, n=79) was treated with cement and the uncemented group (UCH, n=79) without cement. The groups were compared for operating time, blood loss and peroperative morbidity and mortality rates.Both the CHA and the UCH group did not differ significantly in terms of age (86±5 vs. 84±4 years), sex (58.3% male vs. 60.7% female), and comorbidities (p=0.49). The CHA group had a significantly longer operating time (p=0.038) and a greater intraoperative blood loss (p=0.024). In the CHA group there were 8 (10.1%) events of intraoperative drop in the oxygen saturation (SaO2), whereas no such events were noted in the UCH group (p=0.009). Despite no significant difference between these two groups, we found that the CHA group was associated with a higher early postoperative mortality (8.8% in the CHA group versus 3.8% in the UCH group, p=0.009). Intraoperative fracture occurred in two patients (2.5%) of the UCH group. Over a 2-year follow-up period there were no significant differences between the groups regarding the rate of dislocation (p=0.56) or rate of postoperative periprosthetic fracture (p=0.56). There was a trend towards a better postoperative functional recovery at 6 week for the CHA group (77.1±13.1 versus 71.3±16.3), although the mean Harris Hip Score (HHS) at the end of 2 years was comparable (p=0.55).Both CHA and UCH are acceptable methods for treating displaced femoral neck fractures. However, based on our results perioperative cardiovascular disturbances are less frequent and resulting in a potential lower early mortality with UCH. Therefore, UCH is particularly appropriate for elderly patients with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities.Level II, Randomized Controlled Trial.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the early postoperative results of open and arthroscopic Bankart repair for isolated traumatic anterior instability of the shoulder.The study included 64 male patients who underwent surgery for traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder instability. Of these, 30 patients (mean age 25.1 years) underwent open Bankart repair and 34 patients (mean age 25.8 years) underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair. All the patients had labral tears on preoperative magnetic resonance scans and had complaints of instability even during daily activities. Patients with at least six dislocations were included in the study; patients with multidirectional instability were excluded. The mean time from the first trauma to surgical intervention was 4.4 years (range 1 to 24 years) in the open surgery group, and 3.8 years (range 1 to 17 years) in the arthroscopy group. Decision for surgical treatment was made based on limitation of activities because of fear of having a dislocation and on positive results of instability tests. Repair was performed using metal anchors in both groups. The clinical results were evaluated using the Rowe scale. The severity of pain on the first postoperative day was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). The mean follow-up period was 26.1 months (range 12 to 52 months) in the open surgery group, and 26.6 months (range 12 to 51 months) in the arthroscopic repair group.The mean duration of operation was 2 hours for open surgery, and 2.5 hours for arthroscopic repair. The size of the incision was approximately 8 cm in the open surgery group, and 3 cm in the arthroscopic repair group. The mean Rowe scores were 90.2 and 91.6, being higher in the arthroscopic repair group. Clinical results of open surgery were excellent in 21 patients (70%), good in eight patients (26.7%), and poor in one patient (3.3%). In the arthroscopic repair group, the results were excellent in 27 patients (79.4%), good in five patients (14.7%), and poor in two patients (5.9%). All the patients with a poor result experienced redislocations due to traumatic falls 5 to 18 months after surgery. The mean VAS score was 5.0 ± 1.3 in the open surgery group, and 4.4 ± 1.3 in the arthroscopic repair group. Loss of external rotation was observed in 15 patients (20° in 8 patients, 10° in 4 patients, 5° in 3 patients) in the open surgery group, and in nine patients (20° in 3 patients, 10° in 6 patients) in the arthroscopic repair group. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to Rowe scores, VAS scores, range of motion, apprehension test results, and the incidence of recurrent instability.Although, in the past, the results of arthroscopic repair were less satisfactory compared to open surgery, this condition has changed remarkably. The results of arthroscopic repair in our study were similar to those of open repair. We believe that, with enhanced experience and advances in arthroscopic repair techniques, arthroscopic treatment may outweigh open surgery.",

Thirty-six rabbits were randomly allocated to three suture groups, equal in number. Each suture type was placed bilaterally in the quadriceps muscle, patellar tendon, knee joint capsule, and Achilles tendon. Six animals in each group were sacrificed in the third and sixth weeks. The inflammation induced by each suture was assessed using light microscopy and the width of the inflammation zone (WIZ) was measured.Ethibond was found to cause the most severe reaction in the muscle and tendon in the third week; in the sixth week, however, it showed the lowest inflammatory reaction in all tissue types. Reaction to Propylene was moderate in the third week, whereas it caused the largest WIZ in all tissue types in the sixth week, such that the eventual size of the WIZ induced by Propylene (6.6 + or - 2.1 mm) was significantly greater than that of Ethibond (1.6 + or - 0.9 mm) in muscle specimens (p<0.05). Except for the largest WIZ seen in joint capsule specimens in the third week, inflammatory reactions associated with FiberWire were low or moderate in all tissue specimens throughout the study. FiberWire was associated with some necrotic areas in two muscle and one tendon specimens.The extent of inflammatory reaction to nonabsorbable suture materials depends on the type of suture material, tissue type, and the duration of postoperative time.",

On these radiographs, the reference lines were drawn with the use of an angle measurement software with a sensitivity of 1/100 mm and the Böhler (BA) and Gissane (GA) angles were measured. The distribution characteristics of the angles with respect to age, gender, and side of the body were analyzed and compared with those of previous studies.The mean BA was 33.8 + or - 4.8 degrees (range 20 degrees to 46 degrees) and the mean GA was 115.0 + or - 6.5 degrees (range 100 degrees to 133 degrees). There were no significant differences for both angles with respect to measurements obtained from the right and left sides (for BA, p=0.198; for GA, p=0.601) and from both sexes (for BA, p=0.177; for GA, p=0.412). The highest (35.2 degrees) and lowest (32.3 degrees) means of BA were seen in the age brackets of 41-50 and 61-83 years, respectively. The corresponding age brackets for GA were 21-30 and 51-60 years with 115.7 degrees and 114.4 degrees , respectively. There were no significant differences between the age groups for both angles (for BA, p=0.086; for GA, p=0.955). Of note, the mean BA was significantly higher than those reported in previous studies.

Coracoclavicular fixation was performed using the modified Bosworth technique in 32 patients (24 males, 8 females; mean age 35 years; range 19 to 58 years) with acromioclavicular dislocations. According to the Rockwood classification, seven patients had type III, nine patients had type IV, 13 patients had type V, and three patients had type VI dislocations. Following repair of the coracoclavicular ligament, fixation was performed with a cancellous screw in all but two patients in whom a cortical screw was used. These two patients developed redislocation due to screw cut out and underwent reoperation with cancellous screw fixation and were not included in the final assessments. The screws were removed under local anesthesia after eight weeks postoperatively. The patients were evaluated for cosmetic appearance, functional status, pain, localized tenderness, articular range of motion, and with the functional Constant scoring system. The mean follow up was 3.1 years (range 1 to 8 years). The mean Constant score was 98 (range 92 to 100). The results were excellent in 26 patients (86.7%) and good in four patients (13.3%). There was subluxation of the acromioclavicular joint in one patient (3.3%). The alignment of the acromioclavicular joint was normal in the remaining patients. None of the patients showed joint degeneration. All patients were pain-free and achieved full range of motion. With ease of application, low complication rate, and low rate of acromioclavicular joint arthrosis, the modified Bosworth technique is an effective surgical method in providing satisfactory shoulder function in acromioclavicular dislocations.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to compare the results of palmar locking plate and K-wire augmented external fixation in the treatment of intra-articular comminuted distal radius fractures. The study included 30 patients with intra-articular comminuted distal radius fractures. Sixteen patients (11 men, 5 women; mean age 49 ± 16 years) underwent open reduction and palmar locking plate fixation, and 14 patients (11 men, 3 women; mean age 35 ± 10 years) underwent closed reduction and K-wire augmented external fixation. In both groups, eight patients had accompanying injuries. According to the AO/ASIF classification, there were four C1, 10 C2, and two C3 fractures in the locking plate group, and three C1, eight C2, and three C3 fractures in the external fixation group. For functional assessment, joint range of motion and grip strength were measured. The patients were assessed using the Gartland-Werley scale. Subjective functional assessment was made using the QuickDASH scale. On final radiographs, the presence of osteoarthrosis in the radiocarpal joint was assessed according to the Broberg-Morrey criteria. The follow-up period was at least 12 months (26.1 ± 6.1 months in the locking plate group, and 62.7 ± 16.8 months in the external fixation group). Wrist flexion (p=0.012) and supination (p=0.003) degrees at final follow-up were significantly greater in the locking plate group. Other range of motion parameters were similar in the two groups. On final radiographic measurements, there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to losses in palmar angulation, radial length, and radial inclination, and change in ulnar variance. The mean Gartland-Werley scores did not differ significantly (2.4 ± 2.4 with plate fixation, and 2.0 ± 2.8 with external fixation; p>0.05). The results were excellent in 11 patients (68.8%) and good in five patients (31.3%) with plate fixation. The results of external fixation were excellent in 11 patients (78.6%), good in two patients (14.3%), and moderate in one patient (7.1%). The mean QuickDASH scores and time to return to work were similar in patients treated with a locking plate and external fixator (QuickDASH score 2.4 ± 3.0 and 2.9 ± 5.4; 1.9 ± 0.5 months and 2.1 ± 0.7 months, respectively; p>0.05). The mean loss of strength compared to the healthy side at final follow-up was 3% in the locking plate group, and 5% in the external fixation group. Radiographic findings of stage 1 osteoarthrosis were observed in four patients (25%) in the plate group, and in 11 patients (78.6%) in the external fixation group. There were no complications in the locking plate group. In the external fixation group, two patients (14.3%) had regional pain syndrome, three patients (21.4%) had superficial pin and wire tract infections, and one patient complained of adherence at entry sites of the fixator. Overall, nine patients (64.3%) expressed dissatisfaction with the external fixator. Our results showed no superiority between the two treatment methods with respect to objective and subjective tools of evaluation. Palmar locking plate fixation was associated with full patient satisfaction. K-wire augmented external fixation can be used as a safe method in selected cases in which the severity of distal radius fracture would not allow palmar locking plate fixation.",

We treated seven cases of chronic osteomyelitis related squamous cell carcinoma between 1993 and 2005. The patients had an average age of 54.5 (range: 38-71) years, with a male predominance (6 men, 1 woman). We analyzed the time up to cancerization, the localization and histopathological type of the carcinoma, and the type and result of the treatment. The mean time between the occurrence of the skin lesions and the diagnosis of malignant degeneration was 24.5 (range: 9 to 40) years. The carcinoma resulted from tibia osteomyelitis in 4 cases, femur osteomyelitis in 2 cases and humerus osteomyelitis in one. The pathological examination showed five cases of a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with bone invasion, and two cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The treatment consisted of amputation in all but one patient, who refused the amputation. The six amputee patients did not show local recurrence or metastatic dissemination over a period of five years. Amputation appears to be an effective treatment method in squamous carcinoma secondary to chronic osteomyelitis.",

Initial diagnosis, previous treatment, and radiological and clinical follow-up findings were reviewed. The mean age at diagnosis was 44.2 years. Four patients had unilateral and 1 patient had bilateral involvement. The presenting symptoms were pain, swelling, and loss in range of motion. Active forward flexion and abduction ranged from 0° to 90°. Hypoesthesia and loss of temperature sense was evident in 3 patients. Radiographs showed massive osteolysis of humeral head and glenoid process, and magnetic resonance imaging showed periarticular fluid collection, and degeneration at the rotator cuff and shoulder joint, resembling chronic septic arthritis or sarcoma. Biopsy was performed in 4 patients before definitive diagnosis, and synovial hypertrophy and necrotic bone was found. Two patients had a history of operated cervical syringomyelia, and the remaining 3 patients were later diagnosed to have syringomyelia and referred to neurosurgery clinic, where 2 of those were operated. Four patients were followed-up with symptomatic therapy, and 1 patient underwent an unsuccessful shoulder arthroplasty in another clinic. As a conclusion, neuropathic arthropathy of the shoulder is rare, and correct diagnosis is possible by careful physical and neurological examination and pathologic evaluation when needed.",

Twelve months after surgery, quadriceps and hamstring torque values were recorded using an isokinetic dynamometer. Computerized coordination and proprioception tests (Functional Squat System; Monitored Rehab System) were performed to determine the deficits in joint position sense. The anterior translation test was performed using a Kneelax 3 arthrometer to determine knee laxity.Side-to-side differences between groups for hamstring and quadriceps muscle strength, concentric and eccentric motor coordination and anterior tibial laxity were not significantly different (p>0.05).No statistically significant differences in functional outcome were found 1 year after the ACL reconstruction using Endobutton post-fixation and femoral transfixation with hamstring tendon graft. Deficits in hamstring-quadriceps muscle strength, motor coordination and proprioception were still found in both groups. We therefore recommend that long-term follow-up and rehabilitation including neuromuscular exercises should be continued for longer than one year after ACL reconstruction.",

We reviewed the records of 96 patients with 115 NIF transfers performed for pulp defect reconstruction. The injury mechanism was crush type injury in 70 patients (72.9%). Ninety-three patients (97%) were emergency cases. Pulp reconstruction was performed by means of pedicled island flap transfer. The results were evaluated with proximal interphalangeal joint range of motion, the Semmes Weinstein monofilament test, static two-point discrimination and cold intolerance assessments. The relations between the injury mechanism, patient satisfaction, cold intolerance and scar problems were analyzed. Also, the association between skin grafting and hook nail deformity was investigated. The level of significance was set at p<0.05. All flaps survived. The mean follow-up time was 41±20.3 (range: 12-108) months. We observed proximal interphalangeal joint flexion contracture in 11 (9.5%) cases. In seven of these, the limitation was less than 10 degrees. Hook nail deformity was seen in 8 fingers (7%). Cold intolerance was found in 16 (17%) cases. Semmes Weinstein monofilament and static-two point discrimination tests of flaps revealed satisfactory results. There was no relation between the injury mechanism and cold intolerance, patient satisfaction and scar problems (p>0.05). Among patients, 91.7% were satisfied with their results. The transfer of direct-flow island flaps, from the same finger, causes minimal morbidity on the donor site and appears to be a safe method, providing satisfactory functional and aesthetic results in the reconstruction of pulp defects.",

    "abstract": "Multidisciplinary approach is a necessity for the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bone and soft tissue tumors. The Ege University Musculoskeletal Tumor Council offers consultation services to other hospitals in the Aegean region. Since 1988 the Council has met weekly and spent approximately 1,500 hours evaluating almost 6,000 patients with suspected skeletal system tumors. Our objective was to present the data obtained from this patient group. A total of 5,658 patients, suspected to have a musculoskeletal tumor, were evaluated retrospectively. Multiple records of the patients due to multiple attendance to the Council were excluded. The prevalance of the bone and soft tissue tumors in these patients were analysed. Malignant mesenchymal tumors accounted for 39.7% of the total patients, benign tumors for 17%, tumor-like lesions for 17.8% and metastatic carsinomas for 8.6%. Malignant bone tumors were 50.2% and malignant soft tissue tumors were 49.8% of all the sarcomas. Among the malignant bone tumors the most common was osteosarcomas at a rate of 33.6%, followed by Ewing-PNET at 25.5%, chondrosarcomas at 19.4% and haematopoietic tumors at 17.6%. Pleomorphic sarcomas (24.5%), liposarcoma (16.4%), synovial sarcoma (13%) and undifferential sarcomas (8.8%) were the most common types of malignant sof tissue tumors. Benign soft tissue tumors (48%), benign cartilage tumors (28%), giant cell tumor (15%) and osteogenic tumors (9%) were found among the benign tumors. Hemangioma, lipoma, agressive fibromatosis, enchondroma, solitary chondroma and osteoid osteoma were the most common tumors in their groups. Lung (27%), breast (24%), gastrointestinal system (10.5%) and kidney (8.2%) carcinomas were the most common primary sites of the bone metastasis. Turkey still lacks a comprehensive series indicating the incidence and diagnostic distribution of bone and soft tissue tumors. The presented data would add to our knowledge on the specific rates of the bone and soft tissue tumors in Aegean region.",

The etiologies of sciatic nerve injuries were penetrating trauma in five patients, firearm injuries in four patients, and motor vehicle accidents in four patients. Injuries involved the knee level in five patients, and above-the-knee level in eight patients. Peroneal nerve involvement was seen in all the patients, and the tibial nerve was involved in 11 patients. Primary repair was performed in six patients, neurolysis in three patients, and nerve grafting in three patients. One patient underwent neurolysis for the peroneal portion, and nerve grafting for the tibial portion. Muscle strength and reflex changes were recorded at every stage of the treatment. Muscle strength was assessed according to the British Medical Research Council scale. The Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test was used for sensory evaluation. The mean follow-up period was 4 years (range 1 to 6 years).In 11 patients with tibial nerve injuries, the soleus/gastrocnemius strength was measured as follows: M1 in one patient, M3 in four patients, M4 in four patients, and M5 in two patients. Plantar sensation was absent in four patients, while seven patients had at least adequate protective sensation. In 13 patients with a peroneal nerve injury, the strength of the anterior tibial muscle was measured as follows: M0 in three patients, M2 in three patients, M3 in one patient, M4 in three patients, and M5 in three patients. Of these, four patients had persistent insensitivity in the dorsum of the foot, while six patients had protective sensation, and three patients had normal sensation. Two patients with inadequate anterior tibial muscle strength following nerve repair underwent posterior tibial tendon transfer for restoration of foot dorsiflexion. The greatest functional improvement was obtained in cases in which neurolysis was performed; patients undergoing primary repair had better outcomes compared to those where nerve grafts were used. The results were better in thigh level injuries than those in the gluteal region.Low expectations after sciatic nerve repair in the past are now being rapidly replaced by a more optimistic approach. Advances in microsurgery and use of treatment algorithms based on scientific research account for this significant improvement in outcomes after sciatic nerve surgery. Tendon transfers can enhance the success rate and be combined with nerve repair in selected cases.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of open reduction and internal fixation augmented with calcium phosphate cement (CPC) in the treatment of depressed tibial plateau fractures. Twenty-eight knees of 28 patients [19 males and 9 females; mean age, 41.2 years (range 22-72 years)] who had open reduction and internal fixation combined with CPC augmentation were included in this study. Seventeen fractures were Schatzker type II, 5 were type III, 3 were type IV, 2 were type V, and 1 was type VI. CPC was used to fill the subchondral bone defects in all knees. Fixation of the fragments was done with screws in 3 knees (10%). Standard proximal tibial plates or buttress plates were used in 25 knees (90%) with an additional split fragment extending distally to achieve internal fixation. Full weight-bearing was allowed in 6.4 weeks (range 6-12 weeks) after surgery. Resorption of CPC granules was defined as the decrease in the size and density of grafting material on radiographs. Rasmussen's radiological and clinical scores were determined postoperatively. Functionality was assessed with Lysholm knee scoring system. Activity was graded with Tegner's activity scale. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean follow-up of 22.2 months (range 6-36 months). There were no intraoperative complications. At the latest follow-up radiographs, resorption of the graft was observed in 25 knees (89%). Rasmussen's radiologic score was excellent in 17 patients (61%), good in 9 patients (32%), and fair in 2 patients (7%). Rasmussen's clinical score was excellent in 9 patients (32%), good in 18 patients (64%), and fair in 1 patient (4%). According to the Lysholm knee score, functional results were excellent in 16 patients (57%), good in 8 patients (29%), and fair in 4 patients (14%). Twenty-two patients (78%) achieved the preoperative activity level after surgery, and there was no significant difference between the mean preoperative and postoperative Tegner scores (4.11±0.68 and 4.04±0.64, respectively, p=0.161). CPC is a safe biomaterial with many advantages in augmenting the open reduction and internal fixation of depressed tibial plateau fractures, including elimination of morbidity associated with bone graft harvesting, the unlimited supply of bone substitute, the optimum filling of irregular bone defects, and shortening of the postoperative full weight-bearing time.",

Open total synovectomy was performed for 19 patients (9 men, 10 women; mean age: 42.8 years) with PVNS. Of these patients, 15 had diffuse and 4 localized PVNS. The patients were followed for an average of 80.2 months and the average time between the onset of complaints and surgery was 23 months. In 4 patients, PVNS was identified during total knee replacement (TKR) performed due to gonarthrosis. Radiotherapy was performed as an adjuvant treatment in one patient with recurrence. Puncture was performed in 11 patients due to effusion and 8 to 70 cc of fluid was aspirated. Diagnosis was made during the exposure for TKR in 4 patients, by a biopsy in 2 and based on joint puncture and MRI findings in the rest. Recurrence occurred in 5 patients. A second total synovectomy was performed in 4 patients. Radiotherapy was used for the remaining one patient. Two patients were operated three times. During the follow-up, TKR was performed in 7 of the 19 patients. None of the patients developed infection and hemarthrosis requiring puncture nor required amputation or arthrodesis. Three patients had a postoperative knee joint stiffness of 10 to 25 degrees. The patients were evaluated according to the Knee Society Score and 8 (42.2%) had perfect, 9 (47.3%) good and 2 (10.5%) bad results. PVNS is a disease with a high risk of recurrence. No individual or combined treatment method can offer a definitive solution. Open or arthroscopic radical synovectomy is still considered as the gold standard. If necessary, adjuvant intraarticular or extraarticular radiotherapy can be added to the treatment.",

Range of motion, strength, DASH questionnaire and MAYO wrist score were assessed. Shortening, inclination and palmar tilt were recorded on standard radiographs and tenosynovitis and tendon ruptures were assessed using ultrasound. The uninjured wrists were examined as controls.

The mean postoperative DASH score was 15.9 (range: 0 to 72). Active wrist motion averaged 52.3 degrees of flexion, 57.7 degrees of extension, 79.2 degrees of supination and 79.3 degrees of pronation. Mean grip strength was 82% of the uninjured side and mean loss of radial inclination was 0.6 degrees and palmar tilt was 6.6 degrees as compared to normal side. Carpal tunnel syndrome was observed in one patient, flexor tenosynovitis in one patient, extensor tendon rupture in one patient and extensor tenosynovitis in eleven patients. Functional and clinical limitations were most evident in the patients with tendon tear or tenosynovitis.Fixation of unstable distal radius fractures with volar locking plates provides sufficient stability, and satisfactory clinical outcomes.

Patients were evaluated radiographically for union and functionally using the Constant-Murley score.None of the patients had nonunion, avascular necrosis, axillary or radial nerve paralysis or implant failure. Mean Constant-Murley score was 86.8 ± 2.2 (range: 70 to 100). Mean union time was 3.2 (range: 2.5 to 5) months.MIPO of humerus diaphysis and proximal fractures allows for preservation of blood supply in fracture fragments, owing to less soft tissue and periosteal injury. When the procedure is performed with the lateral double incision, exposure and preservation of the axillary and radial nerves are necessary. Early return of function in the shoulder and elbow joints and favorable healing time are the major advantages of this method in this rare subset of humerus fractures.",

American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores were calculated for all patients, and based on final results, all families were asked whether or not they would elect to have the surgery again in same circumstances.All procedures were performed by the same surgeon: lateral column calcaneal lengthening osteotomy on 21 feet; percutaneous lengthening or gastrocnemius recession for Achilles tendon on 21 feet; medializing calcaneal osteotomy on 15 feet; flexor digitorum longus tendon transfer on 15 feet; medial cuneiform opening wedge osteotomy on 5 feet, spring ligament plication on 3 feet, and accessory navicular bone excision on 2 feet. Preoperative mean AOFAS score increased significantly from 56.76 to 95.29. All parents stated that they were satisfied with surgery results and would choose to have the same surgery performed again.Soft tissue and bony procedures used for reconstruction of AAPP can be used safely for IFPP in adolescents and young adults.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

Inclusion criteria were histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis with both the initial biopsy and the resection specimen, and having undergone neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Demographic, clinical and histopathological data were evaluated.Over a mean follow-up time of 55.2 (8-139) months, 5 patients (21.7%) died secondary to disease progression, leaving 18 patients (78.3%) still alive at the time of last follow-up. Only one patient (4%) experienced local recurrence and six (26%) patients developed distant metastases.

Correlation between AOFAS scores, fascia thickness, duration of symptoms, age and calcaneal spur length were assessed.Degree of fascial thickening (mean 4.6 mm for all patients) did not influence baseline AOFAS scores (r = -0.054). Plantar fascia thickness significantly decreased in both groups after treatment (1.2 mm for steroid, 1.2 mm for ESWT) (p < 0.01 for both groups). Percentage of change in AOFAS scores (68% for steroid and 79% for ESWT, p = 0.069) and fascial thickness (24% for steroid and 26% for ESWT, p = 0.344) were similar between two groups.

Both ESWT and betamethasone injection are effective in alleviating symptoms and reducing plantar fascia thickness in chronic plantar fasciitis. However, the only predictive factor for functional recovery in terms of AOFAS scores is patients' functional status prior to treatment.

Each participant completed the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), the Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire (MHQ), the quick form of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, and the Duruoz Hand Index (DHI). The BCTQ, pain and paresthesia results were assumed as gold standards. Correlations between the MHQ, QuickDASH, and the DHI were analyzed. A correlation analysis between the variables was tested using Spearman's rho test or Pearson's test for variables. The QuickDASH was well correlated with pain, paresthesia and the BCTQ (p<0.001). The questionnaires complied with each other. In addition to its complicated scoring, the MHQ contained detailed subparameters with similar questions and takes a long time to complete.

The OMAS-Tr was administered to one hundred patients (49 females, 51 males; average age: 42.3 ± 17.7; range 16-81 years) with malleolar fractures. The OMAS-Tr was completed twice by each participant at 7- to 10-days intervals to assess test-retest reliability based on the interrater correlation coefficient, whereas Cronbach's alpha evaluated internal consistency. The external validity was evaluated with correlations between the Turkish version of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) and the Turkish version of the SF-12 questionnaire. The distribution of floor and ceiling effects was also analyzed.The internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.84) and the test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.98) were excellent. The mean interval between the two tests was 8.6 ± 1.4 days. The mean and standard deviation of the first and second assessments of the OMAS-Tr were 74.1 ± 23.7 and 75.7 ± 23.9, respectively. There was a strong correlation between the OMAS-Tr and the FAAM subscales on activities of daily living and sports (r = 0.86, r = 0.83; p < 0.001, respectively). The OMAS-Tr displayed very good to good correlation with the SF-12 physical component score and the SF-12 mental component score (r = 0.72, r = 0.60, p < 0.001, respectively).OMAS-Tr was a valid and reliable tool to assess ankle fracture-related problems.

Five rats were used as donors for ACS preparation. Animals were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. In both groups, the Achilles tendon was cut transversally and then sutured. In the placebo control and ACS-treated groups, saline or ACS, respectively, was injected into the repair zone three times after surgery. Ten rats from each group (ACS group, n = 20; control group, n = 20) were euthanized at days 15 and 30 after surgery for histopathological (n = 5) and biomechanical (n = 5) testing. The histopathological findings were interpreted using the Bonar and Movin scales. Tendon remodelling was evaluated via the immunohistochemical staining of collagen type 3. Biomechanical effects were assessed by tensile testing.The Bonar and Movin scale scores were significantly better in the ACS-treated group on both day 15 (p = 0.003 and p = 0.003, respectively) and day 30 (p = 0.005 and p = 0.004, respectively). The immunohistochemical density of collagen type 3 was significantly lower in the ACS-treated group on day 30 (p = 0.018). The type 1/3 collagen ratios of the groups were similar on days 15 and 30, as determined by Sirius Red staining (p = 0.910 and p = 0.133, respectively). In the biomechanical assessment results, the ACS-treated group's maximum load to failure values were significantly higher on day 15 (p = 0.049).Injection of ACS had a positive effect on the histopathological healing of rat Achilles tendons on days 15 and 30 and on biomechanical healing on day 15. ACS treatment contributed to lowering the collagen type 3 density by day 30. According to our study, ACS may be favourable for the treatment of human Achilles tendon injuries and tendinopathies.",

Sixty patients who underwent unilateral TKA were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups: Group A received CFNB and Group B received PIA. Each patient received 0.25% levobupivacaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine as infiltration to the posterior capsule. A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device was used for all patients, and 24-h tramadol usage by patients was recorded. We measured maximum range of motion (ROM), pain using a visual analog scale (VAS), 2-min walk test (2MWT), and the scores of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Knee Society Score (KSS). Compared with Group B, Group A had lower postoperative opioid usage (p<0.05), less pain at rest (p<0.05), less pain with passive motion (p<0.05), less pain with movement and after active movement (p<0.05), and superior passive and active ROM (p<0.05). Group A also had better 2MWT results at 24 and 48 h after surgery (p<0.05), and superior WOMAC and KSS results at 6 weeks after surgery. As long as it is applied with infiltration analgesia to the posterior capsule, CFNB is an effective and safe analgesia method resulting in better postoperative patient comfort and greater ROM. Furthermore, it produces better results in the early postoperative period with a favorable side effect profile.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the success of sensory nerve recovery after digital nerve repair and to investigate the prognostic factors in sensorial healing. Ninety-six digital nerve repairs of 63 patients were retrospectively evaluated. All nerves were repaired with end-to-end neurorraphy. The static two-point discrimination (s2PD) and Semmes Weinstein monofilament (SWM) tests were performed to evaluate sensory recovery. The association between prognostic factors such as gender, age, involved digit, time from injury to repair, length of follow-up, smoking, concomitant injuries, type of injury, and sensory recovery results were assessed. The s2PD test demonstrated excellent results in 26 nerves (27%), good results in 61 nerves (64%), and poor results in 9 nerves (9%). The results of the SWM test according to Imai classification showed that 31 nerves (32%) were normal, light touch was diminished in 38 nerves (40%), protective sensation was diminished in 17 nerves (18%), loss of protective sensation occurred in 5 nerves (5%), and 5 nerves (5%) were anesthetic. There was a negative relationship between age, smoking, concomitant injuries, and sensory recovery. Our results demonstrate that concomitant tendon, bone and vascular injuries, older age, and smoking were associated with worse sensory nerve recovery results. However, all digital nerve injuries should be repaired, regardless of these prognostic factors.",

Pneumatic tourniquet inflation pressures were adjusted based either on LOP determination or AOP estimation in Group 1 (46 patients, 38 female and 8 male; mean age: 67.71 ± 9.17) and Group 2 (47 patients, 40 female and 7 male; mean age: 70.31 ± 8.27), respectively. Initial and maximal systolic blood pressures, LOP/AOP levels, required time to estimate AOP/determinate LOP and set the cuff pressure, initial and maximal tourniquet pressures and tourniquet time were recorded. The effectiveness of the tourniquet was assessed by the orthopedic surgeons using a Likert scale.Initial and maximal systolic blood pressures, determined LOP, estimated AOP, duration of tourniquet and the performance of the tourniquet were not different between groups. However, the initial (182.44 ± 14.59 mm Hg vs. 200.69 ± 15.55 mm Hg) and maximal tourniquet pressures (186.91 ± 12.91 mm Hg vs. 200.69 ± 15.55 mm Hg) were significantly lower, the time required to estimate AOP and set the tourniquet cuff pressure was significantly less (23.91 ± 4.77 s vs. 178.81 ± 25.46 s) in Group II (p = 0.000). No complications that could be related to the tourniquet were observed during or after surgery.Tourniquet inflation pressure setting based on AOP estimation method provides a bloodless surgical field that is comparable to that of LOP determination method with lower pneumatic inflation pressure and less required time for cuff pressure adjustment in adult patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty under combined spinal epidural anesthesia.",

We investigated its anatomic and morphometric characteristics.We identified the LPFL insertion point on the condyle in vertical and sagittal planes in 32 adult cadaveric knees. We measured its length and width at the insertion point. We located the midpoint of this point and measured from it to the distal and posterior condylar ends. We measured anterior-posterior and proximal-distal lateral condylar lengths. We evaluated the insertion point shape on the lateral femoral condyle. Degree of relationship between variables was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The LPFL mean length was 23.2 mm, and mean width at the insertion point was 15.6 mm. Regarding its insertion into the lateral condyle, central insertions were more frequent (vertical plane: 53.1% central and sagittal plane: 75% central). A significant positive correlation was evident between the LPFL length and width at the insertion point (p = 0.05). Thus, the LPFL length was proportional to its width at the insertion point. A significant positive correlation was found between the anterior-posterior condylar length and width of the LPFL at the insertion point (p = 0.017). Therefore, greater anterior-posterior condylar length equates to a larger area of insertion on the condyle.Greater width of the LPFL at the insertion point corresponds to greater LPFL and anterior-posterior lateral condylar lengths.",

The hemoglobin level of the patients was monitored perioperatively.Analysis found a statistically and clinically significant mean drop in hemoglobin of 31.1 g/L over time from pre-operatively (D0) to day-5 post-operatively (p < 0.001), with significant reductions from D0 to day-1 and day-1 to day-2 (p < 0.001). At each post-operative time point, DHS patients had lower hemoglobin values over hemiarthroplasty patients (p = 0.046).The decrease in hemoglobin in the first 24-h post-operative period (D0 to day-1) is an underestimation of the ultimate lowest value in hemoglobin found at day-2. Relying on the day-1 hemoglobin could be detrimental to patient care.

The mean follow-up time after surgery was 42.7±4.6 months. Union time, coronal plan deformity, complication rates and AOFAS and Olerud-Molander functional outcome scores were evaluated.According to the AO/OTA classification, there were thirty four (54.8%) type 43-A fracture, eight (12.9%) type 43-B fractures, twenty (32.3%) type 43-C fractures. The average time for fracture union was 16.1 weeks. The mean AOFAS score was 86.6±9.1. The mean Olerud-Molander score was 85.6±9.8. There were four patients (6.5%) with a varus of less than 5°, two patients (3.2%) with a valgus of less than 5°, 39 patients (62.9%) with recurvatum (34 of them less than 5°; five of them less than 10°), and 14 patients (22.6%) with procurvatum (12 of them less than 5°; two of them less than 10°). The AOFAS and Olerud-Molander scores in the smoker and diabetic patients were significantly lower than the non-smoker (p=0.002; p=0.005) and non-diabetic patients (p=0.022, p=0.002). The duration of union was significantly higher in both diabetic (p=0.025) and smoker patients (p=0.041). There was no association between the fracture type and the presence of varus, valgus, recurvatum and rotation deformity. The AOFAS score, Olerud-Molander score and plantar-flexion were significantly higher in type A fractures than in type C fractures (p=0.021; p=0.030, and p=0.033, respectively). AOFAS score, Olerud-Molander score, plantar-flexion value did not differ between type B and type C fractures. There was no significant difference among the dorsi-flexion (p=0.211), the follow-up time (p=0.531) and duration of union (p=0.908) of type A, type B and type C fractures. Three patients with open fracture had delayed wound healing. One patient developed skin necrosis. They were treated by local wound care.Minimally invasive medial plate osteosynthesis is a reliable method of treatment for tibial pilon fractures. This technique provides a high fracture healing rate and satisfying functional outcome with minimal wound healing complications. Sagittal plan deformity remains a common complication with minimally invasive medial plate osteosynthesis.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

According to the Neer classification, 13 patients had comminuted fractures, four patients had valgus impact injuries, two patients had fracture-dislocations, and three patients had fractures involving the proximal 1/3 of the humerus. The fractures were reduced by the transdeltoid lateral approach (n=8) using minimally invasive surgery, and by the anterior deltopectoral approach (n=14) using open surgery. Passive and active exercises were initiated on the second postoperative day and after 4 to 6 weeks, respectively. The results were assessed using the Constant-Murley shoulder scoring system. The mean follow up was 14 months (range 12 to 19 months).Radiographically, union was observed in 20 patients at the end of 10 weeks. In one patient, time to union was 16 weeks. One patient underwent autogenous bone grafting because of nonunion after 16 weeks. The mean Constant-Murley score was 75.5 (range 51 to 93). There was no significant difference between Constant-Murley scores of patients undergoing the transdeltoid lateral and anterior deltopectoral approaches (p>0.05).

This study was designed to evaluate the short-term effects of mud-pack therapy on pain relief and functional improvement in knee osteoarthritis in comparison with intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections.The study included 23 patients who were diagnosed as having knee osteoarthritis according to the ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria, and had complaints lasting for more than three months. All the patients had stage 2 or 3 osteoarthritis radiographically according to the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria. Twelve patients (3 males, 9 females; mean age 54+/-6 years; range 46 to 67 years) received mud therapy bilaterally. Mud packs were heated to 45 degrees C and applied on both knees for 30 minutes daily for a total of 12 weekdays. Eleven patients (2 males, 9 females; mean age 53+/-9 years; range 40 to 66 years) received a total of three bilateral intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections, each interspersed by weekly intervals. The patients were evaluated before and after treatment in terms of pain and functionality using the pain subscale of the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) osteoarthritis index, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, and Knee Society clinical rating system (knee and function scores). The patients were followed-up for a mean of 5.9+/-6.3 months (range 4 to 8 months) after mud-pack therapy, and 5.8+/-0.8 months (range 5 to 7 months) after intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections.No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to pre-and posttreatment WOMAC, HSS, and knee and function scores (p>0.05). The scores of all instruments showed significant improvements following treatment in both groups (p<0.001). Posttreatment changes in relation to baseline scores did not differ significantly between the two groups (p>0.05).Treatment of knee osteoarthritis with intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections or mud-pack therapy yielded similar results in the short-term in terms of functional improvement and pain relief.

Patients who were treated with bisphosphonate, calcitonin, and estrogen were not included.The incidence of the second hip fracture was higher (78.6%) beyond 12 months of the first fracture. The risk for sustaining a second hip fracture was 3.96-fold greater in patients over 85 years of age (p<0.05). Among comorbid medical conditions, eye diseases (p=0.02) and neurological diseases (p=0.048) were significantly more frequent in group 2. There was an obvious relationship between the second hip fracture and lower Singh index grades of = or < 3 (p<0.001). Patients over 85 years of age and having a lower Singh index grade were found to have a 6.57-fold increased risk for developing a second hip fracture (95% CI: 2.13-20.3; p=0.001). In univariate analysis, neurological diseases represented a significantly increased risk. Eye diseases were highly associated with an increased risk for second hip fractures in univariate (OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.2-9.2, p=0.020) and multivariate (OR: 7.6, 95% CI: 1.9-30.7, p=0.004) analyses.

According to the criteria of Price et al., the results were excellent in 19 patients (79.2%) and 18 patients (85.7%), and good in five patients (20.8%) and three patients (14.3%) in group 1 and 2, respectively. There was no significant difference between the functional results of the two groups (p>0.05). Complications showed a similar profile in the two groups, being one major (4.2%) and seven minor (29.2%) in group 1, one major (4.8%) and eight minor (38.1%) in group 2. None of the patients had complications such as limb-length discrepancy, epiphyseal damage, angular or rotational deformity, synostosis, or limited elbow or forearm range of motion.Closed reduction or open reduction with a mini incision before intramedullary nailing yield similar functional results, with a similar complication profile in the treatment of pediatric unstable diaphyseal forearm fractures.",

    "abstract": "The location of the fingertip entitles it to have significant cosmetic and functional values, but also places it at high risk for injury. During repair, finger length and function should be maintained, and stiffness and neuroma should be avoided. Various flaps have been described for reconstruction of distal finger defects with bone, tendon, or joint exposures, including reverse flow homodigital island flap. In this study, we present our experience of reverse flow homodigital island flap in terms of sensory recovery. Sixty-six patients (70 fingers) with fingertip amputations were included in the study. Patients were treated with homodigital island flaps. All patients underwent sensitivity assessment by 2-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament tests at 6, 12, and 18 months during follow-up, and complications were recorded. Monofilament testing results were normal in 64 fingers (91.4%), and diminished light touch was found in six fingers. Two-point discrimination results were normal (<6 mm) in 40 fingers and fair (6-10 mm) in 30 fingers (mean 5.7 mm, range 4-9 mm). Complications included one partial flap necrosis, three flexion contractures, and two neuromas. In repair of injuries to areas in which sensory feedback is critical, such as the index finger, the homodigital flap may be the treatment of choice.",

Indications for the TSF were congenital disorders (n=12), rickets (n=6), physeal injuries (n=4), stiff nonunions (n=3), malunions (n=3), and sequela from septic arthritis of the knee (n=1). Applications involved the tibia (n=15), femur (n=9), foot (n=4), and knee (n=1) with (n=24) or without (n=5) osteotomies. Following acute correction with the use of the TSF and internal osteosynthesis by plating or nailing, the fixator was removed in six cases. The chronic mode was used in six cases who underwent acute correction. The remaining deformities were gradually corrected using the \"total residual mode\". The follow-up period ranged from eight months to 42 months (mean 29 months).The mean duration of external fixator was 24.5 weeks (range 18 to 37 weeks) in 13 tibial and five femoral segments. In all cases, correction was applied until the mechanical axis reached normal limits. Complete consolidation was achieved in all osteotomized segments, including three cases of nonunion. A plantigrade foot was obtained in all foot deformities. Recurrence was seen in one case in which knee contracture and subluxation were treated with soft tissue distraction without osteotomy.The Taylor spatial frame is a safe and practical method with excellent results in the treatment of nonunions and deformities complicated especially by translation and rotation providing correct clinical data are derived and used.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the functional results of open reduction and internal fixation with a locking plate in patients with three- or four-part fractures of the proximal humerus.We reviewed 32 consecutive patients (22 women, 10 men; mean age 63 years; range 29 to 82 years) who were treated with open reduction and internal fixation using the PHILOS locking plate for comminuted proximal humeral fractures. According to the Neer classification, 12 patients (mean age 56 years) had three-part fractures, 19 patients (mean age 67 years) had four-part fractures, and one patient had a four-part fracture dislocation. Ten patients were in the age group of <60 years, 22 patients were in the age group of 60=or>years. All the patients were evaluated with plain radiographs preoperatively; in addition, computed tomography was used in 14 patients in whom articular surface and tuberculum displacement could not be assessed adequately. The operation was performed through a standard deltopectoral approach, and minimal soft tissue dissection was used aiming not to impair vascularization of the fracture fragments. A cerclage wire was used to help reduction in 12 patients. An oblique screw was inserted to stabilize the medial colon in cases in which medial cortical contact was insufficient. Bone grafting was not used in any of the patients. Active-assisted and passive exercises of the shoulder were initiated on the second postoperative day. Active abduction to 90 degrees was allowed two weeks after surgery. During follow-up, implant failure, loss of reduction, malunion, and bone healing were assessed on plain radiographs. Bone scintigraphy was performed after 12 postoperative months for the detection of avascular necrosis. The results were assessed using the Constant shoulder score. The mean follow-up period was 25 months (range 18 to 36 months).An anatomic or near-anatomic reduction was obtained in 29 patients (90.6%). In two patients, the fractures were fixed in a varus position, and in one patient, the greater tubercle was displaced proximally. All fractures united in a mean of three months (range 2 to 5 months). The mean Constant score of the patients was 79.5 (range 50 to 100). The results were excellent in 13 patients (40.6%), good in nine patients (28.1%), fair in eight patients (25%), and poor in two patients (6.3%). The mean Constant scores were 88.3 (range 69 to 100) and 74.2 (range 50 to 100) in three-part and four-part fractures, and 88.3 (range 71 to 100) and 75.5 (range 50 to 100) in the age groups of <60 years and =or>60 years, respectively. Constant scores showed significant differences with respect to the number of comminution and age groups (p=0.03). Avascular necrosis was observed in two patients. None of the patients had reduction loss, implant failure, deep infection, or neurovascular injury, and none required implant removal.Preservation of humeral head vascularity through minimal soft tissue dissection, fixation with a locking plate, and early postoperative motion were effective in decreasing potential complications following surgical treatment of three- and four-part proximal humeral fractures. The degree of fracture comminution and age of the patients affect functional results significantly.",

One patient had bilateral fractures. According to the AO classification, the fractures were A1 (n=8), A2 (n=4), A3 (n=4), and C1 (n=1). There were 13 closed (76.5%), and four open (23.5%) fractures. The mean time to surgery was 10 days (range 2 to 20 days). Open technique was used for nine fractures, and percutaneous technique for eight fractures. Preoperatively, three patients with a floating knee were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging and were found to have a ruptured cruciate ligament. All patients underwent intraoperative knee examination, which showed a ruptured cruciate ligament in five patients. Functional results were assessed using the modified HSS (Hospital for Special Surgery) knee rating scale at the end of a mean follow-up period of 32.6 months (range (12 to 68 months).The mean time to union was 25 weeks (range 14 to 42 weeks). One patient had delayed union (42 weeks).

Thirty seven patients operated upon between June 2000 and May 2005 for fractures of the femoral neck with three screws were identified as the study population. The final results of 26 patients (11 male, 15 female, with an average age of 39.8, range 16-69) that had a minimum of two year follow-up (average 37 months, range 24-64 months) were evaluated. Those patients that had additional fractures were not included in the evaluation. Preoperatively based on Garden classification four patients (15%) were Type I, eight patients (31%) were type 2, six patients (23%) were type three and eight patients (31%) were type 4. Functional results were evaluated according to the UCLA hip score. The average time to union was 5.5 months (range 3-12 months). One patient did not achieve union and a total hip replacement was done in the 15th postoperative month. Four patients had avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. The incidence of AVN in patients who had an operation within 24 hours of fracture was 9.5% while 40% in patients operated later than that. In patients with AVN one required a total hip replacement, another required treatment with bipolar hemiarthroplasty, the other two patients did not require further operations. One patient underwent bipolar hemiarthroplasty after screw pullout occurred on the 35th postoperative day. Fifteen patients (58%) had excellent results, five (19%) had good, 5 (19%) had moderate results and one (4%) had a poor result. Operative treatment with internal fixation using three screws in femoral neck fractures in the first 24 hours after a fracture gives favourable results in young patients that are too young to be considered for arthroplasty.",

Mean age was 10.3 (range: 6 to 18) months at the time of surgery. Full-thickness 1x1 cm anterior capsule and LCF portions were taken as biopsy specimens. An immunohistochemical study using monoclonal antibody against estrogen receptors was performed to identify the rate of target estrogen cells in the hip joint capsule and LCF.Estrogen receptor (ER) staining rates were 1.6±0.2% for the LCF and 1.3±0.2% for the hip joint capsule in the control groups, and 2.5±0.3% for the LCF and 2.0±0.3% for the hip joint capsule in the DDH groups. Estrogen receptor staining rates in the LCF and hip joint capsule control groups were significantly lower than that in the DDH groups (p<0.001). In both groups, ER rates were significantly lower in the hip joint capsule than in the LCF (p<0.01).The high rate of ERs in the LCF and hip joint capsule appears to support the effect of estrogen in the etiology of the DDH.",

Quality of life was evaluated using the Short Form 36 (SF-36).Mean bony union times for the proximal and distal fibula were 19 (range: 16 to 24) weeks and 20 (range: 16 to 28) weeks, respectively. Proximal nonunion was detected in three patients. Mean external fixation removal time was 6.3 (range: 3 to 14) months. Stress fractures occurred in 15 patients following fixator removal. Malalignment of over 5 degrees was detected in 7 patients and shortness over 2 cm was detected in 4 patients. SF-36 scores were significantly lower in the domains of physical functioning, role limitation due to physical problems, bodily pain, general perception of health, social function, and role limitation due to emotional problems. Mental health, energy and vitality were similar to the healthy reference group.Free vascularized fibular grafting appears to be a reliable and effective method for reconstructing bone defects and soft tissue defects in a single session in open tibia fractures.",

The study included 40 Wistar albino rats. Mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from the femurs and tibias of 6 rats. Achilles tendons of the remaining 34 rats were cut and repaired with open surgical procedures. Rats were divided into 2 groups. Percutaneous MSCs were applied to the study group (n=17) and physiological serum only was applied to the control group (n=17) at the 4th week. Rats were sacrificed using the cervical dislocation method under ether anesthesia at the 12th week and samples were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical methods. For biomechanical analysis, a traction force was applied at 10 mm/min and load to failure was recorded for each specimen in Newtons. Histologically, there was no significant difference between groups (p>0.05). In the immunohistochemical studies, MSCs were located more intensively at the repair zone. Apoptosis was minimally present in the study group and was clearly increased in the control group. Increase in tendon strength was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group at the 12th week (p<0.05). The application of MSCs to decrease re-ruptures has a positive effect on tendon strength, probably due to their anti-apoptotic effects. Mesenchymal stem cell application can be used percutaneously and is effective in clinical practice in the late stages of tendon healing.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (BTKA) and unilateral total knee arthroplasty (UTKA) in terms of morbidity, clinical and radiological findings and quality of life. The study included 48 simultaneous BTKAs (46 females, 2 males; mean age: 64.00 ± 8.31 years) and 53 UTKAs (46 females, 7 males; mean age: 64.40 ± 7.45 years) performed between November 2007 and June 2012. Groups were compared with respect to comorbidity, complications, blood transfusion, hospital stay, clinical and radiological (American Knee Society Score) findings and quality of life (SF-36). Three patients in the BTKA group and 1 in the UTKA group required intensive care admission due to pulmonary embolism; 2 cases occurred within the first postoperative 30 days. One BTKA patient died in the early postoperative period and 1 patient from the BTKA and 1 from the UTKA group died within 1 year. Hospital stay, perioperative blood transfusion parameters and mortality rates were significantly different in favor of UTKA and revision operation rates in favor of BTKA (p<0.05). All patients had improved knee and function scores and SF-36 scores. However, there was no significant difference between the groups (p>0.05). Simultaneous BTKA should be considered in selected patients under 70 years of age with good compliance and no comorbid disease.",

Of these cases, 20 (4 women and 16 men; mean age: 66 years; range: 52-90 years) were treated with standard wet dressings and 16 feet in 15 patients (10 men, 5 women; mean age: 58.9 years; range: 42-83 years) with VAC therapy. The success of treatment was evaluated in terms of hospitalization length and rate of limb salvation.The average hospitalization period with VAC treatment was 32 days compared to 59 days with standard dressing treatment. All patients treated with standard dressings eventually had to undergo amputation. However, the amputation rate was 37% in the VAC treated group and 88% of patients had a functional extremity at the end of treatment.VAC therapy, together with debridement and appropriate antibiotic therapy, enables a higher rate of limb salvage, especially in Wagner Grade 3 and Grade 4 ulcers.",

Patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups. Group 1 received a single injection of 1 ml betamethasone and 1 ml prilocaine on the lateral epicondyle at the point of maximum tenderness. Group 2 patients received an injection of the same drug mixture. Following the initial injection, the needle tip was redirected and reinserted down the bone approximately 30 to 40 times without emerging from the skin, creating a hematoma. Patients were evaluated with the Turkish version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire before injection and at the final follow-up. The unpaired t-test and chi-square tests were used to compare results.Sixteen patients in Group 1 and 15 patients in Group 2 were lost during follow-up. The average follow-up period of the remaining 49 patients was 21.6 months. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to gender, age, follow-up period, symptom duration, involvement side and number of dominant limbs. The Turkish DASH scores of Group 2 were significantly lower than those of Group 1 (p=0.017).Long-term clinical success in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis depends on the injection method.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have documented the main characteristics of arthroplasty publications from different countries. This study aimed to evaluate the worldwide research productivity and status of Turkey in the field of arthroplasty using bibliometric methods and to provide an insight into the arthroplasty research for surgeons and researchers.The Web of Science database was searched to identify arthroplasty articles published between 2006 and 2016. The contributions of countries were evaluated based on publication count, citation average, h-index and publication rate in the top 10 ranked journals. Each countries publication output was adjusted according to population size.A total of 26.167 articles were identified. World arthroplasty publications were increased significantly over time (p < .005). The United States was the most productive country with 9007 articles (34,4% of total) followed by England with 2939 articles (11,4 of total) and Germany with 1881 articles (7,1% of total). According to average citations per item, Scotland was in the first place followed by Denmark and Sweden, whereas in the first place according to publication output adjusted by population size was Switzerland followed by Denmark and Scotland. The United States was also in the first place according to h-index and publication rate in the top 10 ranked journals. Founding average was 28,8% (7539 of 26164) for the arthroplasty articles that were analyzed in the study.There is a rapid increase in the number of articles in arthroplasty research from 2006 to 2016. The United States was the most productive country as measured by total publications in the arthroplasty field. However, some small European countries with high in-come have higher quality of articles and better productivity when adjusted for population. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and research foundation had positive affect on arthroplasty publications, both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

Electrical databases (PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane library) were retrieved to find RCTs and CSs met the eligibility criteria. Two reviewers screened the studies, extracted the data and evaluated the methodological quality, and performed data analysis with RevMan 5.1. The publication bias was test by Stata 14.0. The Begg's and Egger's test were performed by Stata 14.0. The quality of evidence was graded according to the criteria of GRADE. We ultimately included ten RCTs and eleven CSs.A total of 1590 subjects were reported. Publication bias was detected by funnel plot in RCTs. VLP could provide better results such as DASH scores (RCT: MD = -6.12, 95%CI = -12.07-0.17; CS: MD = -6.43, 95%CI = -12.53-0.3), ulnar variance (RCT: MD = -0.81, 95%CI = -1.25-0.37) and infection rate (RCT: RR = 0.25, 95%CI = 0.10-0.65; CS: RR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.06-0.40). There were no significant differences for G-W scores, VAS and grip strength between the VLP group and EF group. There was significantly greater loss of volar tilt (P = 0.01) and radial inclination (P = 0.02) in patients receiving EF, basing on the CSs.VLP could provide better results, such as DASH scores, ulnar variance, volar tilt, radial inclination and infection rate. The use of VLP appear to be associated with better results of ROM (flexion, pronation, supination and radial deviation), radiographic parameters (volar tilt and radial inclination) and lower total complication rate and CRPS rate in CSs.Level 1, Therapeutic study.",

The study included 152 feet of 87 patients with hallux valgus and a control group of 391 feet of 241 individuals without hallux valgus deformity. The severity of hallux valgus was determined using the Manchester scale grading system. Plantar loading patterns in 10 foot areas were determined for all participants. According to the Manchester scale, 72% of the participants had no, 12.9% mild, 10.7% moderate and 4.4% severe deformity. The Manchester scale grade was highly correlated with both hallux valgus angle and first intermetatarsal angle (p=0.00). Significant differences between the four grades were present for mean pressure under the hallux and the first and second metatarsal heads only (p=0.00). The load distribution under these areas was higher as the hallux valgus progressed from mild to more severe. In all groups, the highest pressure was observed under the second metatarsal head. The Manchester scale was strongly associated with both the hallux valgus angle and the first intermetatarsal angle. The progression from mild to moderate and severe deformation is associated with peak pressure raise at the hallux, first and second metatarsal heads. The Manchester scale appears to be a useful tool to provide information for the degree of deformity and the pressure under painful foot areas.",

Average age of the patients (23 male, 11 female) at surgery was 11.7 years (range: 6-21 years). The lesions were localized in the humerus (19), femur (12), tibia (2), and ulna (1). Pathological micro- or displaced fractures occurred in 31 patients. Surgical procedure included extended curettage by using cauterization and high-speed burring, bone grafting, and intramedullary decompression with elastic nails. Six patients had been treated conservatively or surgically in other institutions previously. Radiographic and functional results were evaluated by Capanna criteria and MSTS scores respectively. Early and late complications and additional surgical procedures were recorded.The average follow-up was 37 months (range: 18-89 months). The average time to heal for pathological fractures was 8 weeks (range: 6-12 weeks). Radiographic evaluation revealed Grade 1 healing in 28 patients (82%) and Grade 2 healing in 6 patients (18%). The average MSTS score based on final follow-up was 28.5 (range: 17-30); excellent (32 patients; 94%) and good (2 patients; 6%) functional results were obtained. There was no early or late infection, refracture or implant failure. Malunion developed following treatment of 2 humeral and 2 femoral lesions. With the exception of 2 implant removals, no patients required additional surgical intervention.Complete cyst healing and satisfactory functional results can be obtained by curettage grafting and intramedullary decompression.

Between 2003 and 2010, 255 knees of 235 patients underwent operations for medial knee OA. Three types of surgery were performed. Group 1 consisted of 109 knees of 94 patients who underwent Oxford UKA. Group 2 was made up of 36 knees of 36 patients who underwent HTO using circular external fixation, and Group 3 comprised 57 knees of 52 patients on whom opening wedge type HTO using locking plate fixation was performed. SF-36 and HSS knee scores were used to compare the functional outcomes among groups. Statistically significant differences were found between the preoperative and postoperative measures in all 3 of the treatment groups for physical function, physical role, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role, and mental health according to SF-36 and HSS scores. In the 2nd group, the average correction of the mechanical axis deviation (MAD) was 38 mm with 11.7º along the femorotibial axis and 6.2º along the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA). In the 3rd group, the average correction in the MAD was 28 mm with 9.7º along the femorotibial axis and 5.6º along the MPTA. All 3 of the treatment alternatives were observed to be sufficient. Satisfactory postoperative results were achieved in the UKA group in terms of social function and mental health, and the patients were able to achieve early rehabilitation and return to their previous life activities. UKA is the ideal option for patients who wish for the earliest possible return to social and recreational activities.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the long-term clinical and radiological results of Acromioclavicular (AC) fixation with K-wires (the modified Phemister procedure) and Coracoclavicular (CC) fixation with the Bosworth screw in the surgical treatment of Type 3 AC joint dislocations.Thirty-two patients with complete set of medical records and who received surgical treatment between September 2005 and January 2009 due to acute Rockwood Type 3 AC joint dislocation and properly attended their follow-ups were retrospectively evaluated. Sixteen patients (13 males, 3 females; mean age: 38, range: 24-52 years) were treated with CC fixation with Bosworth screw (Group 1), and the other 16 (12 males, 4 females; mean age: 53.3, range: 38-64 years) with AC fixation using K-wires (Group 2).The mean follow-up time was 96 months for Group 1 and 93 months for Group 2 patients (p > 0.05). The mean Constant-Murley score at the final follow-up was 84.7 in Group 1 and 87.3 in Group 2 (p = 0.069). Radiological evaluation of the patients revealed AC arthrosis in 2 and 3 patients in Group 1 and 2, respectively. In Group 2, one patient had a recurrent dislocation, three patients had AC arthrosis and two patients had ossification in the CC ligament (Fig. 2). There was no superficial or deep wound infection in Group 1, while two patients from Group 2 had a superficial wound infection.Our results suggest that both techniques are reliable and provide adequate reduction and similar outcomes in terms of functionality and pain levels, following the reduction of Type 3 AC joint dislocations. With lower rates of wound site infection in the early and AC arthrosis in the late postoperative period, CC fixation method with the Bosworth screw may be a better surgical option than AC fixation method with K-wires.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Su Type III fractures based on total knee arthroplasty (TKA) constitute a patient group with problematic treatment and management. Although it has difficulties, open reduction and internal fixation is one of the treatment options.A retrospective evaluation was made of 22 patients surgically treated in our clinic with double locking, low contact titanium plate and screw for a Su Type III periprosthetic fracture based on TKA. The patients were evaluated with bone mineral densitometry, postoperative Knee Society Score (KSS), WOMAC and radiological evaluations.The mean follow-up period of the patients was 68.6 ± 15.5 months, with pain-free weight-bearing determined at 4.9 ± 1.1 months and mean radiological union at 18.5 ± 4.3 weeks. Revision was required because of non-union in 2 (9.09%) cases. The postoperative KSS value was 81.8 ± 7.8, the WOMAC value was 78.1 ± 5.3 and the T-score was -3.3 ± 0.3. At the final follow-up examination, a correction loss (4.9° ± 1.5°) was determined in the mean knee valgus angle according to the mechanical axis, which was statistically significant but remained within the physiological limits (p = 0.21).In addition to providing the advantages of rigid fixation together with early and effective rehabilitation, satisfactory clinical and radiological results were obtained with the application of double locking plate and screw in the treatment of periprosthetic femoral fractures based on TKA, with osteoporosis.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "This survey was designed to evaluate the prevalence estimations of HV, bunionette, hammertoe as well as their relations to shoe wearing and also familial tendency, in Turkey.Two thousand six hundred sixty two volunteers (1615 females and 1047 males) with a mean age of 34.15 ± 14.23 (range; 18 to 96) years were asked to answer the predetermined questionnaire between January and June, 2016. Hallux valgus, hammertoe and bunionette images were provided as references and every adult participant without any known forefoot problems or past forefoot surgery history was asked to rate his/her foot and to respond the questions about family history and shoe wearing habits. Responses were statistically analyzed.The prevalence estimations of hallux valgus, bunionette and hammertoe were calculated as 54.3%, 13.8% and 8.9% and positive family history rates were 53.2%, 61.2% and 56.1%, respectively. All three deformities were more common in females than in males (p < 0.001). Nonetheless the older age group reported significantly higher prevalence rates for only HV (p < 0.001). Likewise, among the three deformities, females reported a higher rate of positive family history only in HV compared to men (p < 0.001). Constricting shoe wear was found to affect HV incidence in women (p < 0.001) and bunionette incidence in both sexes (p < 0.01).This study concludes that forefoot deformities are common with high familial tendency. Hence it is worthwhile to work on molecular genetics and this may enable the anticipation of forthcoming deformities in order to take early action in prevention, in nearly the half of the population.",

AbH, PF, FHB, and FDB thickness, cross-sectional area and stiffness were measured with an ultrasonography device. For stiffness measurements, Shear Wave Velocity (SWV) of the assessed soft tissues was calculated using a customized software program.Mean and standard deviation of SWV of PF, AbH, FHB, FDB, and thickness of PF, AbH, FHB, FDB, and cross-sectional area of AbH, FHB, FDB in individuals with HV were 7.6 ± 1.0 m/sec, 2.8 ± 0.3 m/sec, 2.6 ± 0.4 m/sec, and 3.4 ± 0.2 m/sec, 3.3 ± 0.5 mm, 11.4 ± 2.2 mm, 16.5 ± 1.9 mm, 8.9 ± 1.8 mm, 2.4 ± 0.5 cm2, 2.7 ± 0.5 cm2, 1.9 ± 0.6 cm2, respectively.

Six electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Clinical, Ovid, Biosos, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Eligible RCTs published between 1960-2012 comparing operative vs. nonoperative treatment of comminuted proximal humeral fractures were included. Trial quality was assessed using the modified Jadad scale. Data from included studies were pooled with the use of fixed-effects and random-effects models with mean difference and risk ratios for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Sensitivity analysis was performed to account for bias in patient selection. Six studies matched the selection criteria, reporting on 287 patients. One hundred fourty-four patients (50.17%) were managed nonoperatively, 20 patients (6.97%) underwent tension band fixation, 55 patients (19.16%) were treated with locked plate, and 68 patients (23.69%) underwent hemiarthroplasty. Mean follow-up ranged from 12-50 months. Results showed no significant difference in post-treatment Constant scores and DASH scores, but conservative treatment showed superior results compared to operative treatment using EQ-5D™. Compared with operative treatment, nonoperative treatment led to significantly fewer complications and additional surgeries. Findings from subgroup analyses remained consistent with these outcomes when compared to nonoperative treatment with tension band fixation, locked plate fixation, and hemiarthroplasty. Compared with operative treatment for closed comminuted proximal humeral fractures in elderly patients, conservative treatment can effectively reduce the risk of additional surgeries and complications. However, there is no statistical difference between operative and nonoperative treatment in terms of clinical outcomes.",

The medical records of patients who underwent percutaneous surgery for acute unilateral Achilles tendon rupture between 2000 and 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 11 male patients met the inclusion criteria and were followed for a mean of 12.6 years (range: 10-13 years). The average age at the time of surgery was 39.3 years (range: 29-53 years). Patients returned to work at an average of 2.7 months (range: 1-4 months) after surgery and to normal daily activities (NDA) at an average of 4.1 months (range: 3-6 months) postoperatively. The mean strength ratio between the injured and normal sides was 90%. Compared with the contralateral normal side, the thickness of the operated tendon increased by a mean of 0.7 cm, while the circumference of the affected calf diminished by a mean of 1.1 cm. No difference in active and passive range of motion (ROM) was recorded between the affected and the contralateral normal ankle joints. Isometric plantar flexion was 87% of normal. Sensory impairment in the territory of the sural nerve was identified in 1 patient immediately after surgery. The sensory defect had completely resolved by 6 months postoperatively. Long-term outcomes of our series support the effectiveness of percutaneous tenorrhaphy in Achilles function rehabilitation of patients with acute ruptures.",

The blood perfusion function in the femoral head was measured by perfusion MRI and ink artery infusion. Bilateral femora heads were examined histopathologically for the presence of osteonecrosis; VEGF of tissue was examined by Western blot analysis; cGMP level and PKG activity were also measured.The incidence of ANFH in SI group was significantly lower than that observed in NS and SD groups (p < 0.05). VEGF in SI group was increased compared to NS group. cGMP level and PKG activity were also significantly different between NS and SI group (p < 0.05).

Forty-three patients with complete follow-up data were included in the study group. The patients were evaluated for radiological outcomes in terms of local kyphosis angle, wedging index, compression ratio, visual analog pain scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).In the study group, kyphoplasty was performed on 24 vertebrae of 22 patients (17 females, 5 males; mean age: 73 years) whereas vertebroplasty was applied on 24 vertebrae of 21 (16 females, 5 males; mean age: 74.7 years) patients. The mean follow-up time was 26 months. When the VAS and ODI values of the groups were analyzed, both groups showed statistically significant progress after the operation. Radiological data showed that the kyphoplasty group showed statistically significant improvement in the sagittal index values whereas the vertebroplasty group did not. The overall complication ratio was 4%.Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are effective treatment methods for functional recovery and pain relief in osteoporotic fractures of the vertebra. Although radiological outcomes of the kyphoplasty seem to be better, this does not have any clinical relevance. We suggest vertebroplasty over kyphoplasty since it is an easier method to manage.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

The mean age of the patients at the time of study was 37 ± 9.9 and the mean age at amputation was 12.6 ± 9.4 years. Patients's body image perception and compliance with the prosthesis paramaters were evaluated with Amputee Body Image Scale (ABIS) and Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales (TAPES). MoCA (The Montreal Cognitive Assessment) has been used to determine the cognitive ability of the participant. All tests has been administered by dual task method during ambulation. Patients who had neurologic or cognitive deficit were excluded from the study.There was a statistically significant relationship between an individual's body image perception and cognitive performance. Body image perception was significantly and negatively correlated with the MoCA score (r = -0.514, p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between psychosocial adjustment, prosthesis satisfaction and MoCA scores (r = 0.550, p < 0.001).Body image satisfaction, psychosocial adjustment, lack of activity restriction, and satisfaction with prosthesis are positively associated with cognitive performance of transfemoral amputees. Before beginning the amputee rehabilitation programs, we recommend to include not only physical functions, but also consider body image and cognitive functions as assessment parameters.Level IV, Diagnostic Study.",

Patients were then divided into three groups according to the Wagner DFU classification system: group 1: 18 patients with grade 2 DFU (11 men, 7 women; mean age = 57.5±7 years); group 2: 44 patients with grade 3 DFU (18 men, 26 women; mean age = 59.7±8.7 years); and group 3: 16 patients with grade 4 DFU (10 men, 6 women; mean age = 59.9±11.6 years). Laboratory findings were retrospectively obtained from hospital records; the PLR and NLR were calculated in all groups. Length and cost of hospital stay were recorded. Hospital costs were estimated in Turkish Lira (TL) based on the evaluation of glucose regulation, wound care, and antibiotic treatment.The mean NLR was significantly lower in group 1 (2.8±0.9) than in group 2 (6.0±5.2; p=0.017) and group 3 (6.9±5.3; p=0.011). The mean PLR was significantly lower in group 1 (140.8±42.6) than in group 3 (222.1±95.5; p=0.006). The mean length of stay was 7.9±2.7 days in group 1, 15.0±8.9 days in group 2, and 12.5±8.9 days in group 3. The mean cost was 1,310.8±500 TL in group 1, 2,966.9±2105 TL in group 2, and 3,488.1±3603.1 TL in group 3. Length and cost of stay were both significantly lower in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3 (p=0.011 and p=0.002, respectively). Comparative results showed that the length and cost of hospital stay increased with increasing severity of DFUs. Furthermore, correlation analyses demonstrated no correlation of length of stay with PLR and NLR but an obvious correlation between cost of stay and PLR (r=0.412; p<0.001). Additionally, there was no correlation between cost of stay and NLR (r=0.158, p>0.05).The PLR is inflammatory marker that can be measured by an inexpensive and easily accessible test and can aid in the prediction of length and cost of hospital stay in patients with DFUs.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

DFUs were categorized based on the Meggit-Wagner, PEDIS, S(AD)SAD, and University of Texas (UT) classification systems. To identify amputation risk-related factors, results of patients with DFUs who underwent amputations (minor or major) were compared to those who received other adjunctive treatments using Chi-Square, oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Spearman correlation analysis.The mean C-reactive protein (CRP) and White Blood Cell (WBC) values were significantly higher in patients with major or minor amputation than in those without amputation. The mean Neutrophil (PNL), Platelets (PLT), wound width, creatinine and sedimentation (ESR) values were significantly higher in patients with major amputation compared to other groups of patients. Elevated levels of Highdensity lipoprotein (HDL), Hemoglobin (HGB) and albumin were determined to be protective factors against the risk of amputation. Spearman correlation analysis revealed a positive-sided, strong-levelled, significant relation between Wagner grades and amputation status of patients.This study has identified specific factors for major and minor amputation risk of patients with DFUs. Especially infection markers such as CRP, WBC, ESR and PNL were higher in the amputation group. Most importantly, Meggit Wagner, one of the four different classification systems used in the DFUs, was determined to be highly associated with patients' amputation risk.Level IV, Prognostic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed by preserving remnant tissue on proprioception and to assess the effects it has on isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, as well as on range of motion and functional scores.A prospective study was conducted with 44 patients who underwent either anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with remnant preservation (study group, n=22) or with remnant excision (control group, n=22) with the use of a 4-strand hamstring allograft. The mean follow-up time was 20.2 ± 1.4 months after surgery. Using an isokinetic dynamometer, proprioception was evaluated with passive joint position perception at 150, 450, and 600, and quadriceps femoris, and hamstring muscle strength were evaluated at speeds of 900, 1800, and 2400 per second. Range of motion was measured using a goniometer. Functional outcomes were assessed using International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee evaluation score and Lysholm knee scoring questionnaires.It was only at 15° of knee flexion that there was a statistically significant difference in proprioception; the median of the difference in the amount of deviation from the target angle between the healthy knee and the operated side was 1.7 (range, 0.7-20.7) in those with remnant preserved, and 2.7 (range, 1-26) in those with remnant excised (P=.016). At 2400/s speed, the mean quadriceps femoris strength was 77.2 ± 24.3 Nm in those with remnant preserved and 67.6 ± 24.2 Nm in those with remnant excised. (P=.048) There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of range of motion, International Knee Documentation Committee, and Lysholm knee scoring. (P > .05) Conclusion: The present study has demonstrated that better proprioception and higher quadriceps femoris muscle strength can be obtained by remnant-preserving anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a hamstring autograft.Level II, Therapeutic study.",

The patients were randomly allocated to injection and control groups equal in number. The former group received a single subacromial injection of 9 ml bupivacaine and 1 ml betamethasone at the beginning of the treatment. The same physical therapy and rehabilitation program was administered to both groups, consisting of 15 sessions (3 weeks). Evaluations were made before, and three and six weeks after treatment. Functional results were assessed using the Constant score, pain was assessed using a visual analog scale, and range of motion was measured with a goniometer.Compared to pretreatment values, both groups exhibited significant improvements in pain score, Constant score, and range of motion measurements at three and six weeks (p<0.05). Pain score decreased by 37.7% in the injection group after 24 hours of injection. Pretreatment Constant scores which were 39.9 + or - 13.9 and 40.3 + or - 13.4 in the injection and control groups increased to 68.4 + or - 7.6 and 64.7 + or - 7.7 at six weeks, respectively. No significant differences were seen in pain scores between the two groups at three and six weeks (p>0.05). Patients receiving subacromial injection had significantly higher Constant scores at six weeks (p=0.044) and significantly greater external and internal rotation at three weeks (p=0.03). Range of motion measurements did not differ between the two groups at six weeks (p>0.05).Subacromial injection contributes to the success of the conservative treatment through decreasing pain and enabling more effective range of motion and strengthening exercises, both of which are associated with increased functional improvement.",

The mean age was 76 years (range 65 to 96 years) for women, and 74 years (range 65 to 92 years) for men. The fractures were intertrochanteric in 54 patients (58.7%), and in the femur neck in 38 patients (41.3%). The patients were divided into three risk groups, namely, low (n=23, 25%), moderate (n=45, 48.9%), and high (n=24, 26.1%), according to our institutional Sişli Etfal risk factor assessment scale. Relationships were analyzed between mortality and sex, preinjury ambulation level, cognitive functions, and time to surgery in each risk group.One-year mortality rates were 6.9%, 31.4%, and 80% in low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. The risk scores were significantly correlated with mortality rates (r=0.664; p<0.05). Thirty-four female patients (60.7%) and 18 male patients (50%) were dead at the end of 36 months. No significant relationship was found between mortality rates and sex, cognitive functions, and time to surgery (p>0.05). Mortality within the first three postoperative months among patients who could only ambulate with a walker preoperatively was significantly higher than those who could walk independently or with an aid (p=0.037).A risk assessment system covering all risk factors to estimate postoperative mortality following surgery for hip fractures would be helpful in planning treatment.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the results of conservative and surgical treatment of pediatric Monteggia equivalent lesions.The study included 13 children (3 females, 10 males; mean age 8 years; range 4 to 13 years) who underwent treatment for Monteggia equivalent lesions. Seven patients (53.9%) had Bado type 1 and six patients (46.2%) had type 3 equivalent lesions. Two patients with type 3 equivalent lesions also had a lateral humeral condyle fracture. On presentation, one patient (7.7%) had radial nerve palsy. Primarily, closed reduction was attempted in all the patients except for one patient who underwent urgent debridement and irrigation for an open fracture-dislocation. Reduction was successful in eight patients (61.5%). Upon failure of closed reduction, four patients (30.8%) underwent surgery within the first 24 hours of injury. Functional assessment was made according to the Reckling's criteria. The mean follow-up period was 4.1 years (range 2 to 7 years).None of the patients had nonunion. Conservative treatment did not result in loss of reduction of the radius head or limitation in the range of motion of the elbow joint. Except for the patient with an open fracture-dislocation leading to a poor functional result, the results were good in all the patients receiving conservative or surgical treatment. One patient (7.7%) treated conservatively developed cubitus varus (5 degrees ) and posterior angulation (20 degrees ) of the ulnar fracture line. One patient treated surgically had limitation of supination (10 degrees ) without limitation of flexion or extension of the elbow joint. Accompanying radial nerve palsy in this patient disappeared in the postoperative third month.Closed reduction is the first choice of treatment in pediatric Monteggia equivalent lesions. Surgical treatment becomes necessary if closed reduction fails.",

There has been an increased use of intrathecal baclofen in the management of refractory tone. Dorsal rhizotomy has been advocated for a selective population of children with spasticity. There is no standardized approach to spasticity management and this paper will discuss the importance of evidence-based treatment of spasticity that is adapted for the individual child.",

Thirty patients (18 boys, 12 girls; mean age 9 years; range 4 to 15 years) with internal rotation contracture and loss of external rotation and abduction of the shoulder secondary to obstetrical brachial plexus palsy underwent transfer of the latissimus dorsi/teres major tendons to the rotator cuff. In addition, musculotendinous lengthening of the subscapularis and pectoralis major (n=15), pectoralis major (n=9), and subscapularis (n=6) were performed. Nine patients had upper plexus involvement (C5-6), 14 had C5-7 involvement, and seven had complete plexus involvement (C5-T1). According to the Waters and Peljovich classification, all the patients had a congruent glenohumeral joint, which was classified as type 1 in one patient, type 2 in 15 patients, and type 3 in 14 patients. Pre- and postoperative range of motion values of the patients were measured and their motor functions were evaluated with the Mallet scoring system. The mean follow-up period was 47.8 months (range 9 to 84 months). Preoperatively, the mean active abduction was 75.8°, and the mean active external rotation was 25.2°. Postoperatively, the mean abduction and external rotation increased to 138.3° (by 62.5°, 82.5%) and 76.4 degrees (by 51.2°, 203.2%), respectively. Improvements in the degrees of abduction and external rotation were significant (p=0.000). According to the Mallet scoring system, the mean preoperative global abduction and global external rotation scores were 2.97 and 2.43, respectively; the mean Mallet scores for the ability to move the hand to the mouth, neck, and back were 2.50, 2.17, and 2.67, respectively. Postoperatively, the mean global abduction score increased to 3.97 (by 33.7%, p=0.000), and the mean global external rotation score increased to 3.77 (by 55.1%, p=0.000). The mean scores for the ability to move the hand to the mouth, neck, and back were 3.30 (increased by 32%, p=0.000), 3.73 (increased by 71.9%, p=0.000), and 2.30 (decreased by 13.9%, p=0.003), respectively. Postoperative changes in the Mallet scores were all significant. Improvements in abduction and external rotation were not significant between patients ≤ 9 years and > 9 years of age (p > 0.05). Transfer of the latissimus dorsi and teres major tendons to the rotator cuff combined with musculotendinous lengthening of the subscapularis and/or pectoralis major provides satisfactory increases in shoulder abduction and external rotation, regardless of the age, in patients with no or minimal glenohumeral joint incongruency.",

There were 97 incompletely displaced (86.6%), and 15 completely displaced (13.4%) fractures. All the fractures were managed with manipulation under general anesthesia and plaster immobilization. Additionally, K-wire fixation was performed following manipulation in seven (46.7%) of the completely displaced fractures. The mean follow-up period was 1.1 years (range 10 weeks to 2 years).The mean angulation of fractures prior to manipulation was 21.5+/-10.1 degrees, it decreased to 2.4+/-4.8 degrees following manipulation. Remanipulation was required in 11 fractures (9.8%) based on clinical and radiographic findings of redisplacement. Of these, eight fractures (8.3%) were incompletely displaced, and three fractures (20%) were completely displaced. All completely displaced fractures that required remanipulation had been additionally treated with K-wire fixation. Fractures requiring further treatment had a mean angulation of 17.1+/-5.8 degrees prior to remanipulation, and a mean residual angulation of 4.7+/-6.0 degrees at final radiographic assessment. A perfect fracture reduction was achieved in all the patients with a Salter-Harris II injury (n=22), and none of these patients required remanipulation. However, the quality of initial reduction was not associated with the development of redisplacement. There was no significant difference between isolated distal radius fractures (n=58) and combined radius and ulna fractures (n=32) with respect to remanipulation rate and final angulation (p>0.05). Final radiographs showed a significantly greater angulation in fractures which were initially completely displaced in comparison with those that were incompletely displaced (8.2+/-7.1 degrees vs. 4.2+/-5.7 degrees; p=0.024), but this was not of clinical significance. None of the patients had radial shortening and no K-wire related complications were encountered.Our data suggest that there should be other factors involved in the development of redisplacement and the need for remanipulation other than the degree of fracture displacement and the quality of initial reduction. Selective K-wire fixation in displaced fractures does not seem to decrease redisplacement and remanipulation rates.",

Arthroscopic biceps tenotomy, arthroscopy assisted or arthroscopic biceps tenodesis were done in 20 patients who had diagnosis of chronic tenosynovitis and in whom conservative treatment was not helpful. Rotator cuff repair and acromioplasty was performed in 18 patients and acromioplasty alone in two patients in addition to biceps surgery. Arthroscopic biceps tenotomy was done in 10 patients (5 female, 5 male; mean age 63, range 53-75), 10 patients underwent tenodesis out of which arthroscopy assisted biceps tenodesis was done in 8 patients and all arthroscopic biceps tenodesis was done in 2 patients (4 female, 6 male; mean age 57, range 49-66). All patients were evaluated with Constant and UCLA scores preoperatively and postoperatively. The average follow-up of the patients 3,1 years (between 1-8 years). Isokinetically elbow flexion and forearm supination were compared using the Cybex (Biodex 3, Cybex Biomedical System, NY, USA) machine. Pre-operative results of each group were compared with the postoperative results, using Mann-Whitney U test. Preoperative average constant scores of tenotomy group were 64.40, whereas postoperative scores were 89.50 (p=0.002), and preoperative average constant scores of tenodesis group were 62.80, whereas postoperative scores were 86.70 (p=0.003).

In both groups statistically significant improvement of UCLA and Constant scores was detected. Comparison between Constant, UCLA scores and isokinetic measurements of both groups showed no statistically significant difference (p>0.05). No complication was noted. In the treatment of chronic tenosynovitis, biceps tenodesis and tenotomy of long head of biceps showed similar clinical, functional, isokinetic and cosmetic results. No Popeye deformity was seen in the tenotomy group.",

The study group consisted of 20 cases with chronic instability who had at least two episodes of ankle sprains (mean 20.6 years, range 16-32 years); control group consisted of 20 patients with same demographic characteristics but without instability. Isokinetic muscle strength measurements and proprioceptive evaluations were made using the Cybex device before and 1.5-month after rehabilitation period. Additionally, the inversion simulation device, which was developed together with the mechanical engineering department of our university, was correlated with the EMG device, and response periods of muscles to stimulation were measured. The proprioceptive loss present in all cases with ankle instability before treatment significantly improved after effective rehabilitation (p=0.001). It was detected that lengthened peroneal latent periods shortened with effective rehabilitation (p=0.001). Cross-interaction of rehabilitation was shown with the preservation of the difference between the pathologic and normal sides regarding proprioception and peroneal latent periods before and after treatment, without any difference between the control group and the pathologic sides. After ankle sprains, especially in patients with chronic instability, strengthening of the muscles around the ankle with well-planned proprioceptive exercises helps the patients return to normal living and sports activities, and prevents unnecessary surgery, especially in cases with functional instability.",

CellTiter 96(®) Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation (MTS) assay was used to determine the cell density on the samples.Statistically significant higher OARSI grades and OA stage and scores were detected when comparing the group injected with levobupivacaine and executed after 10 days with the levobupivacaine injected group killed after 48 hours (p<0.01 [p=0.008]). Although, statistical analysis could not be done due to insufficient number of samples in the in vitro part of the experiment, it can be concluded that tramadol is cytotoxic to rat chondrocyte in vitro after 30 min of exposure. Additionally, cell numbers in both the bupivacaine and levobupivacaine treated wells showed decrease throughout 15, 30 and 60 minute exposures.Although chondrotoxicity of bupivacaine was less harmful than levobupivacaine and tramadol, these findings suggest that local anesthetics may negatively affect articular cartilage and chondrocytes.",

Twenty one patients underwent reconstruction using No. 5 Ethibond suture (Group A) and 18 patients using semitendinosus tendon autograft (Group B). The patients' database records were queried for the information regarding the evaluations during follow-up period (mean: 25.7 months) such as radiographic evaluations, Constant score, VAS score and infection.The mean Constant score was 91±1 and 92±2.1 in Groups A and B, respectively. There was a reduction of ACJ based on Zanca view in 15 patients in Group A and 12 patients in Group B. There was subluxation of ACJ by less than 25% in six patients in Group A and five in Group B, in that, the difference was not significant. Patients expressed acceptable satisfaction and equal pain severity in rest and daily activity in both groups. No deep infection has been observed.Since both surgical techniques led to satisfactory results, reduction of ACJ, excellent functional score and acceptable patient satisfaction, No. 5 Ethibond suture technique could be recommended as the treatment of choice due to the absence of morbidity in removing semitendinosus autograft tendon.",

Subjects were randomly assigned into a home-based rehabilitation (21 cases; mean age: 33.56 ± 17.59) group or center-based rehabilitation (28 cases; mean age: 28.57 ± 14.74 years). The patients in the home-based rehabilitation group followed a home program of cold application, strengthening exercises for the posterior tibial and intrinsic muscles, and stretching in the subtalar neutral position. The patients in the center-based rehabilitation group followed a selective, supervised treatment consisting of the home protocol plus re-education of the non-functional tibialis posterior, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation methods, electrical stimulation, joint mobilization and taping techniques. Both groups received appropriate orthotics. All subjects were assessed before and after treatment for pain, muscle strength, foot function index (FFI) scores and specific tests for PTTD.Statistical analysis showed significant differences between pre- and post-treatment results for pain, first metatarsophalangeal angle, forefoot abduction angle, FFI scores and foot and ankle muscle strengths in the center-based group and for the tibialis posterior muscle strength in the home-based group (p<0.05). Intergroup comparison, however, showed no differences between the groups at the end of the treatment program with the exception of posterior tibial muscle strength (p<0.05).Home- and center-based forms of rehabilitation seem to be equally effective in relieving pain and improving functional outcome in patients with Grade 1 to 3 PTTD. A patient-selective, supervised program may provide a better improvement in tibialis posterior strength than home-based rehabilitation.",

Application of bone cement containing antineoplastic drug to fill the defect after resection of metastatic lesions and to support implants has been suggested to prevent local tumor growth and implant failures. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the effects of the addition of cisplatin which is a widely used antineoplastic drug for osteosarcoma, on the mechanical properties of bone cement, and to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of eluted cisplatin on Saos-2 cell culture.Two cement samples were prepared by mixing 100 mg and 300 mg of cisplatin powder with 40 g cement powder. The bone cement of the control group did not contain cisplatin. Mechanical analyses included 4-point bending, compression and shear testing. For cytotoxicity analysis, samples were incubated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium for 15 days. Mediums were applied to Saos-2 cell culture and cell viability was measured. Surface analyses were performed by scanning electron microscope (SEM).The addition of cisplatin did not alter the mechanical properties of bone cement. It was observed that the eluted cisplatin had cytotoxic effects on Saos-2 cells. SEM analyses demonstrated cisplatin granules on the surface of cement samples.Cisplatin maintains its cytotoxic property when released from bone cement without compromising the mechanical stability. Application of cisplatin loaded bone cement may help local control of tumor growth. We believe that our study will shed light on to these new practices for the treatment of bone cancers and will encourage future studies.",

The retrospective study included 14 patients (mean age: 41.7 years; range: 19 to 66 years) with humerus mid-shaft fractures treated with the MIPPO technique between 2009 and 2011. 4.5-mm locking plates were applied via an anterior approach and advanced antegradely (proximal to distal) to protect the integrity of the deltoid insertion. Fracture healing was evaluated using plain radiographs. OBJECTIVE outcomes were assessed in terms of range of motion and subjective outcomes using the American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES), University of California, Los Angles (UCLA), Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI) and The Disability of The Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores. Satisfactory outcomes with successful union were obtained within a mean of 17.8 (range: 13 to 30) months. While the average active forward flexion of shoulder was 163.9°±5.6°, the mean abduction was 87.8°±3.77°. Mean elbow flexion and extension loss was 134.6°±41.16° and 3.9°±6.25°, respectively.

Minimal invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis appears to be a successful technique for the treatment of humerus shaft fractures. The procedure may be simplified and outcomes improved by engaging the plate with the anterior surface of the humerus during advancement, antegrade advancement of the plate to protect deltoid insertion and using of a minimum of 6 cortices for each side of the fracture to provide stable fixation.",

Mean follow-up period was 66.6 (range: 47 to 96) months. Five cases had traumatic brachial plexus palsy, 2 polio sequela and 1 sequela of an operated proximal humerus fracture due to a falling injury. One of the traumatic palsy cases was accompanied with a humerus shaft fracture. Arthrodesis was performed in all cases according to AO principles with plate fixation and primary autogenous grafting. Five of the paralytic patients also underwent Steindler flexorplasty. Follow-up assessments included monthly radiologic control for union, the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Oxford shoulder score (OSS) for functional status.Radiological fusion was seen in all cases in an average of 16 (range: 12 to 18) weeks, and arthrodesis was stable at physical examination. The accompanying humerus shaft fracture was also fixed with plate. One patient with traumatic palsy experienced a humerus fracture distal to the arthrodesis plate at the 8th postoperative month. An additional traumatic palsy case had flexion deformity at the wrist in the second year of follow-up and a wrist arthrodesis with dorsal plate was performed. One patient (12.5%) had a donor site infection on the tenth day after surgery. The target positions of 30° of abduction, 30° of forward flexion, and 30° of internal rotation were achieved with an average deviation of 7°. Mean active abduction was 68.1° (range: 55° to 90°), flexion was 67.5° (range: 60° to 85°), and internal rotation was at the level of trochanter major. The mean OSS was 35.9 (range: 32 to 40), and the mean VAS score was 2.9 (range: 1 to 7).Our findings show that AO reconstruction plate and primary autogenous bone grafting is a safe and effective arthrodesis method that can also be used as a salvage procedure.",

The scale includes pain (PRWE-P) and function (PRWE-F) subscales, the latter consisting of specific function (PRWE-SF) and usual (PRWE-UF) function. This study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish versionof the PRWE scale. Permission was sought and received from the original author of the PRWE for a Turkish translation for use in the study. The study included 110 patients (85 female and 25 male; mean age: 50.8±1.53 years; range: 18 to 85) with distal radius fracture, carpal tunnel syndrome, wrist ganglion cyst, De Quervain syndrome, Kienböck disease, and connective lesions affecting the wrist, all of whom completed the Turkish version of both the PRWE (PRWE-T) and the Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand scale (DASH). Reliability and validity of the PRWE-T scale were evaluated via an internal consistency analysis and a factor analysis respectively. The level of correlation between PRWE-T and DASH scores was also examined. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated as 0.86, 0.82 and 0.88 for PRWE-P, PRWE-F and PRWE-T respectively for the scale and all subscales. The PRWE-T scale was found to be highly reliable. A statistically significant correlation was found between PRWE-T and DASH in the criterion-related validity analysis (Spearman's rho=0.9). The PRWE-T was found to be valid and reliable. It is therefore suggested for use in evaluating patient-based pain and disability levels in routine clinical practice.",

The study included 269 pedicle screws inserted by two right-handed surgeons who stood on different sides of patients and used the free-hand technique. A parallel line was drawn to the endplate of the vertebrae on lateral radiograph. Measurement was made to observe the angle between the screw and the line parallel to the endplate. Angles were classified as cranial '+' when the tip of the screw stood above the endplate line and as caudal '-' when it stood below the endplate line. Angles of screws placed from the right side were compared to those placed from the left. On the left side, 80 screws (58.4%) were classified as cranial and 82 screws (62.1%) on the right side were classified as caudal. The difference in orientation was statistically significant (p<0.0001). Surgeon handedness appears to have an influence over the orientation of pedicle screws. This may create problems for right-handed surgeons in the insertion of upper level screws from the left side and lower level screws from the right side. Based on this finding, it may be necessary to include ambiguity in handedness as a part of pedicle screw insertion training for spinal surgeons.",

Between January, 1998 and December, 2008, 51 patients (mean age 26 years; 16 female and 35 male) presenting with a lower extremity defect underwent a reconstructive surgery with flaps based on the subscapular vascular system. Thirty-seven percent of the defects were located in the crus, 19% in the sole, 16% in the heel, and 14% in the dorsum of the foot. Eighty and a half percent of the patients had traffic-accident-related and 13.5% had burn-related tissue defects. Fifty-three percent of the patients presenting with lower extremity defects underwent reconstruction with latissimus dorsi muscle flaps, 21% with free serratus muscle and/or fascia flaps, 14% with free parascapular fasciocutaneous flaps, and 12% with free combined latissimus muscle and serratus muscle and/or fascia flaps. Anastomoses of 80% of the patients were performed on their posterior tibial artery and accompanying veins and/or foot dorsal veins. End-to-end anastomosis was performed on 14 patients, while 35 patients received end-to-side anastomosis. Six patients were treated with cross free flaps, of which 4 received cross latissimus, 1 cross serratus, and 1 cross combined serratus and latissimus flaps. End-to-side anastomoses were performed on these patients on the cross-leg tibialis posterior artery. The cross-leg anastomosis was freed 4 weeks later. In the early period, venous occlusion was observed in 4 patients and arterial and venous occlusion was present in 1 patient. New anastomoses were performed in these patients. Partial necrosis was observed in 2 patients. The average follow-up period was 61 months. Pressure-related late ulcerative lesions developed in 4 patients. The lesions of these patients were repaired by debridement and primary suturing or partial thickness skin grafts. The subscapular vascular system based flaps have an optimal vascularity once they are prepared with adequate pedicles, causing minimal donor site morbidity. These flaps are a safe and effective alternative in lower extremity reconstruction. On the other hand, in the absence of appropriate recipient vessels, single or combined cross-leg free flaps may provide successful repair.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the clinical presentation, causes or risk factors, treatment and outcomes of symptomatic acute postoperative cervical spinal epidural hematoma (APCSEH). The study retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent open cervical spinal surgery between January 1, 2004 and October 31, 2008. Perioperative coagulation parameters, past medical history, age, gender, time to decompression, pre- and postoperative (decompression operation) neurological status, as well as the interval of hematoma formation and level of segments were reviewed. Potential risk factors for extradural hematomas were examined. Patients who were diagnosed with APCSEH underwent immediate surgical drainage of the hematoma. Over 2,338 cervical spinal surgeries were performed by the Orthopedic Spinal Disorder Group in our hospital between 2004 and 2008. Twelve (0.5%) cases of APCSEH were identified. Two-thirds of the patients had history of hypertensive disease or transitory hypertensive status after surgery. No patients had abnormal preoperative coagulation parameters, bleeding diathesis or developed intraoperative coagulopathy. All patients were treated with hematoma evacuation within 2 hours of the ultimately definitive diagnosis of hematoma. Acute postoperative cervical spinal epidural hematoma is a rare cause of postoperative neurological deterioration. Hypertensive disease and the method of multilevel cervical surgery appear to increase bleeding and predict formation of hematoma. Early diagnosis and evacuation of the hematoma can result in resolution of the neurological deficit.",

Patients were divided into three groups according to the amputation level: i) from hip disarticulation to knee disarticulation (including knee disarticulation) (25 patients, mean age: 55.9, 19 males, 6 females) ii) transtibial amputation (below knee to ankle including ankle disarticulation) (41 patients, mean age: 58.6, 33 males, 8 females) iii) below ankle to toe amputation (35 patients, mean age: 58.7, 26 males, 9 females). The patients were evaluated on both early postoperative period (EPP) and sixth months after the surgery (ASM). The data related amputation including amputation date, level, cause, stump pain (SP), phantom limb pain (PLP), components of PLP, phantom sensation (PS) were recorded based on the information obtained from patients' and hospital files.Statistically significant differences were found for pain intensity (VAS) between groups for SP and PLP at EPP (p < 0.001, p = 0.036; respectively). The mean VAS score in Group I for SP and PLP was higher than other groups. This differences for SP and PLP did not continue at ASM assessment (p = 0.242, p = 0.580; respectively).VAS scores for SP in above knee amputations and VAS scores for PLP in above knee amputations and below ankle amputations were higher at EPP. But these high scores had disappeared over time. Management strategies have to be considered particularly in the early postoperative period in patients who had undergone above knee amputation.Level III Prognostic study.",

The fractures were evaluated according to Judet classification system modified by Métaizeau. Reduction and fixation was performed within the first 24 h after injury in all patients. All fractures were treated by closed reduction using distal elastic intramedullary nail. Clinical evaluation was performed by measuring elbow range of motion (ROM) with goniometer, radiological evaluation by assessing fracture healing and functional evaluation by using Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS).The mean MEPS score increased from 15 points preoperatively to 88 points postoperatively (range, 12-95 points). Radiological evaluation revealed that all fractures healed with excellent or good alignment. The mean flexion was 150° (range, 145-154°), extension 1° (range, 0-2°), supination 82° (range, 80-86°), and pronation 83° (range, 80-85°).Reduction and osteosynthesis of radial neck fractures by intramedullary nailing with the help of percutaneous K-wire manipulation appears to be a simple, safe and effective treatment method in children.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

The active range of motion of joints, grip and pinch strength, cutaneous sensibility, upper-extremity functioning, and subjective satisfaction were determined using the Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and the Michigan Hand Outcomes questionnaire (MHQ). Psychological sequelae, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), were assessed. A correlation analysis among variables was also performed.The mean score for the DASH questionnaire was 6.6 (range: 0-39.2). The symptom of cold intolerance occurred in 53% of the patients. Two patients were diagnosed with depression, and only one patient exhibited PTSD. The DASH score had a good statistical correlation with total grip strength, pinch grip strength, and static two-point discrimination (S-2PD) (P < 0.05). Several aspects of the MHQ were also statistically relevant to some or all of the three objective results. Furthermore, the grip strength showed significant correlation with DASH and most aspects of the MHQ in multivariate logistic regression analysis (P < 0.05).Total grip strength is the most important factor positively related to subjective outcomes.

The study included the 143 hips of 139 patients (119 females, 20 males). Mean follow-up period was 3.8 (range: 2.2 to 9.0) years. The displaced lesser trochanteric fragment was reduced anatomically and fixed with 16-gauge stainless steel cerclage wire. Clinical outcomes included Harris Hip Score (HHS), thigh pain, groin pain and walking ability. Radiographic outcomes included stem fixation and stability, osteolysis, heterotopic ossification and subsidence. The stable reduction group was determined when anatomic reduction of posteromedial fragments was achieved with ≤1 mm gap of fragment. Mean HHS was 82 (range: 78 to 99) at the final follow-up. Thirty-one hips (21.7%) experienced thigh pain and 19 (13.3%) groin pain. One hundred and twelve patients (80.6%) regained their pre-injury level of ambulation. All femoral stems showed osseointegration without aseptic loosening and osteolysis. The mean stem subsidence was 3.1±2.4 (range: 0 to 18) mm. The extent of subsidence was significantly higher in patients with unstable reduction. The survival rate was 94.2%. Cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty appears to be a suitable method for the treatment of intertrochanteric fracture in octogenarians. However, stable fixation of the posteromedial fragment is necessary to avoid stem subsidence.",

There were 195 (93.4%) anterior dislocations. The mechanism of injury was falls in 155 (74.5%) cases. Reduction was achieved in 165 patients (79.3%) in the emergency department. General anesthesia was used for 43 patients (20.7%).The 5.3 per 100,000 person-years incidence of traumatic shoulder dislocations in Turkey was much lower than previous studies. Demographic characteristics also showed various differences closely related to the population pyramid.",

    "abstract": "The Ponseti method is an effective protocol for treatment of congenital idiopathic clubfoot. Foot abduction orthosis (FAO) is sometimes necessary to preserve the correction achieved with the serial casting and tenotomy. Patient and family adherence to brace use is a common problem, as nonadherence is directly related to relapse. The aim of this study was to investigate patient and parent characteristics related to relapse. One hundred and fifty-three children who were treated with Ponseti method (mean age: 44.62 months; range: 16-104 months) and their parents were included in the study. Thirty-one patients experienced relapse at an average follow-up of 32 months (range: 6-84 months) since beginning orthosis use. At the time of follow-up visits, parents were questioned about brace use adherence. Satisfaction with Symptoms Scale in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) was used. Difficulties with brace use were encountered in 122 children. Children of parents who were satisfied with the treatment had relapse at an average of 69.13±2.64 months, and those of parents who were not satisfied at 32.83±7.51 months. The most important variable was the child's adaptation to the orthosis treatment without an adverse reaction. Additionally, better compliance was found in children with higher-educated parents. Non-compliance with periods of intolerance is very common for children during orthosis treatment. Parents' coping strategies are very important to avoid relapses. It is important to develop strategies to guide parents.",

For 33 min (135 s × 13 repetitions × 5 s rest), a passive stretch (PS) was applied with the load in place until hip flexor muscle strength dropped from 5/5 to 3+/5 according to manual muscle test. All participants underwent gait analysis before and after PS to compare sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle kinematics and kinetics and temporo-spatial parameters. Paired t-test was used to compare pre- and post-stretch findings and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated to determine strength of correlation between SKG parameters and gait parameters of interest (p < 0.05).Reduced hip flexion velocity (mean: 21.5%; p = 0.005) was a contributor to SKG, decreasing peak knee flexion (PKF) (-20%; p = 0.0008), total knee range (-18.9%; p = 0.003), and range of knee flexion between toe-off and PKF (-26.7%; p = 0.001), and shortening duration between toe-off to PKF (-16.3%; p = 0.0005).These findings verify that any treatment protocol that slows hip flexion during gait by weakening iliopsoas muscle may have great potential to produce SKG pattern combined with reduced gait velocity.",

Patients were divided into two groups according to surgical technique: PLIF and TLIF. The level and the severity of listhesis according to Meyerding classification were assessed and spinopelvic parameters including sacral slope, pelvic tilt, pelvic incidence (PI), lumbar lordosis, and segmental lumbar lordosis were measured on digital X-rays. All preoperative and postoperative parameters and the results were compared between two groups.The age distribution was similar in both groups (p = 0.825) and there was no difference between the mean PI of the groups (p = 0.616). In 15 patients, spondylolisthesis level were at the L5-S1 level (PLIF: 8, TLIF: 7), in 16 patients at the L4-L5 level (PLIF: 6, TLIF: 10) and in 4 patients at the L3-L4 level (PLIF: 2, TLIF: 2). According to Meyerding classification, before the operation, the sliding grades were 0 in 4 patients, 1 in 21 patients, 2 in 7 patients, and 3 in 3 patients. The grades changed into 0 in 28 patients, 1 in 5 patients, and 2 in 2 patients after surgery. There were no differences in the grade of listhesis between PLIF and TLIF groups preoperatively (p = 0.190) and postoperatively (p = 0.208). In both groups, the spondylolisthesis-related deformities of patients were significantly corrected after surgery (p < 0.001).PLIF and TLIF techniques have similar radiological results in restoring the sagittal spinopelvic balance in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis. Both techniques are good options to achieve reduction and fusion in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, but have no advantage over each other for restoring spinopelvic balance.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

This study also aimed to determine the etiology of ingrown nails, whether due to involvement of the nail or soft tissue. Seventy-five patients with a total of 90 ingrown nails (stages 2 and 3) who presented at our clinic between 2012-2014 were included in this study. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those treated with the knot technique and those treated with the Winograd technique. Patients in both groups were evaluated for the amount of local anesthetic required, intraoperative pain, effectiveness of preventing/stopping hemorrhage, surgery time, complications, postoperative nail size, recurrence, nail deformities, and secondary surgery rates. The mean surgical time, relapse rate, number of additional surgeries required, and amount of local anesthetic were significantly greater in the Winograd group than in the knot group. The mean nail diameter was significantly decreased, with a mean of 3 mm in the Winograd group. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in the incidence of infection, intraoperative pain, hematoma, or nail deformity. This study demonstrated that the knot technique, consisting of wedge excision of soft tissue without affecting the nail itself, is a simple technique to treat ingrown nails with a lower complication rate and shorter surgical time. We believe that successful treatment of ingrown nails depends only on excision of soft tissue, with no need to operate on the nail bed.",

The study included the 44 femora and 44 tibiae of 22 achondroplastic patients (16 females, 6 males; mean age: 6.36 years, range: 3 to 11 years) that underwent simultaneous lengthening. Orthofix LRS monolateral fixators were used for femoral lengthening and either Ilizarov-type or hexapod-type circular external fixators for tibial lengthening. Tenotomies of the hip flexors and the Achilles tendon were performed to prevent injury to the growth plates and to prevent joint contractures. Results and complications were evaluated according to Paley's scoring and complication systems. Average follow-up time was 35 (range: 26 to 76) months. The femora were lengthened by an average of 7.07 cm (46.1%), and the tibiae by an average of 6.64 cm (52.9%). Patients gained an average of 16.9 cm in height, including physiological growth. The mean bone-healing index (BHI) was 31.2 days/cm for the femora (range: 17.4 to 43.3 days/cm) and 34.3 days/cm for the tibiae (range: 19.5 to 60.0 days/cm). Complications included 3 delayed maturations, 3 pin track infections, 5 transient fibular paralyses, 5 regenerate fractures, 1 late varus deformity, 1 knee contracture and 1 knee contracture secondary to knee dislocation. Functional scores were excellent in 78 segments, good in 8, fair in 1 and poor in one. There was no growth inhibition related to the lengthening. Bilateral simultaneous lengthening of the femora and tibiae in achondroplastic patients provided a reduction in total treatment and external fixation time, with a low rate of complications.",

A multicenter retrospective study was performed for 178 patients (180 cases) of aseptic femoral shaft nonunion secondary to first treatment of IMN. All cases were fixed with either ERN (n=87) or ACP (n=93). In the ERN group, 42 cases (48.3%) were nonisthmal nonunions and 45 (51.7%) were isthmal nonunions. In the ACP group, 46 cases (49.5%) were nonisthmal nonunions, and 47 (50.5%) were isthmal nonunions. Operation time, blood loss, time to union, union rate, volume of drainage, time to renonunion, and complication rate were compared between the 2 groups. All patients were followed up, with a mean period of 4.1 years (range: 1-7.1 years). Bone union occurred in 93/93 cases (100%) in the ACP group versus 75/87 cases (86.2%) in the ERN group (odds ratio [OR]=3.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-14). Of the 12 cases involved with renonunion in the ERN group, 10 were nonisthmal nonunions, and 2 were isthmal nonunions with cortical bone defect >3 cm. The union time, blood loss, and complication rate of the ERN group were significantly higher than those of the ACP group (p=0.028, p=0.035, and p=0.021, respectively). No significant difference was found in the average operation time of the 2 groups (p=0.151). However, for the nonisthmal nonunions, a significant difference was found between the ERN and ACP groups (p=0.018). ACP with autogenous BG can obtain a higher bone union rate and shorter time to union than ERN in the treatment of aseptic femoral shaft nonunion after failed IMN. Especially for nonisthmal femoral shaft nonunions or isthmal nonunions with larger bone defects, ACP with autogenous BG can be more advantageous than ERN for patients.

When used to treat comminuted distal radius fractures, these plates can damage the flexor tendons. In this study, we sought to determine the radiological and functional results and rate of complications of these plates.We retrospectively reviewed the records of 36 patients (28 males, 8 females; mean age: 46.4 years) with AO/OTA Type C2-C3 distal radius fractures treated with anatomic volar rim distal radius plates between January 2011 and December 2014. Radial length, radial inclination and palmar tilt were compared with the intact wrist. Results were evaluated with the Mayo wrist and Lidstrom scores. Complications were documented throughout the follow-up period of 23.8 (range: 12 to 48) months.Postoperative measurements of the radial length, inclination and palmar tilt did not differ significantly. Mayo wrist and Lidstrom scores were good and excellent in 27 and 32 patients, respectively. Flexor tenosynovitis was symptomatic in 15 patients and asymptomatic (localized swelling only) in 21. Plates were removed from 15 patients due to symptomatic tenosynovitis and from six patients due to partial rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon. The flexor digitorum profundus tendon of the second finger was also partially ruptured in three patients.Anatomic volar rim locking plates provide satisfying radiological and functional results in treating AO/OTA Type C2-C3 comminuted distal radius fractures. However, if these plates interfere with the union of the fracture, they should be removed to avoid potential tendon problems caused by their placement in the rim region.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

Methods The study included 173 patients (126 men and 47 women; median age: 11 years (range: 3-17 years) treated with ESIN for forearm fracture between May 2002 and May 2018. Immobilization was not performed after the surgery. The median follow-up was 68 months (range: 3-161 months). The etiology, healing time, and complications were recorded. Results All patients achieved complete radiographic healing at a median of 6.8 weeks (range: 4-11 weeks). The most common injuries were sport related (n=65) and by falling from standing height (n=57), followed by injuries from bicycle riding, motorbike accidents, road traffic accidents, and fights. Fifteen (8.76%) postoperative complications were recorded: eight entry-site skin irritations, two cases of skin infection, two refractures, and one case each of nail migration, injury of ulnar nerve, and pseudoarthrosis. All complications, except cases of refractures and pseudoarthrosis, were treated conservatively, with no long-term consequences for the patients. Patients with refractures and pseudoarthrosis were reoperated, and complete function of the extremities was fully restored. Conclusion ESIN for treatment of forearm fractures in children shows good functional and cosmetic results. This is a minimally invasive, cast-free, simple, and reproducible technique, with a low complication rate. Owing to these excellent objective and subjective results, surgical stabilization of the forearm fracture using ESIN is recommended in children and adolescents.

We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the accuracy of the SLT in diagnosing penetrating joint injuries in the elbow, wrist, shoulder, knee, or ankle. The SLT values to determine knee arthrotomies vary from 73.8 mL to 194 mL with sensitivities ranging between 91% and 99% depending on the size of the laceration. A SLT of 30 mL in the ankle yields sensitivities ranging from 95% to 99% in assessing joint penetration. A SLT of 45 mL in the elbow yields a sensitivity of 95% in assessing joint penetration. The addition of methylene blue does not change the sensitivity of the SLT. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of the SLT as a diagnostic modality for penetrating joint injuries. However, the literature analyzed in this study was inconclusive and more studies are required to make definitive recommendations. In addition, more studies will be needed on joints other than the knee, pediatric patients, and the use of methylene blue dye in conjunction with SLT. Level II, Diagnostic study.",

However in double bundle group a single anterior horn width injury (2.82 mm) was recorded. Using a greater size reamer in single bundle reconstruction, causes a relatively higher risk of lateral meniscal anterior root injury. Lateral meniscus stability should be examined arthroscopically after reaming with large reamers.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of topical and systemic tranexamic acid (TXA) on fracture healing in a rat surgical model.We created standard, right-sided, open, diaphyseal femoral fractures with intramedullary Kirschner wire fixation in 48 male rats and divided them into three groups: a topical TXA (10 mg/kg) group, a systemic TXA (10 mg/kg) group, and a control group. Fracture healing was evaluated radiographically and histologically after early (week 2) and late (week 4) postoperative sacrifice.The radiological scores differed significantly among the all groups (p=0.001), as did the week 2 and 4 scores (p=0.003 and p=0.010, respectively). Radiologically, the topical TXA group exhibited better bone healing at both 2 (p=0.001) and 4 (p=0.007) weeks than the control group, and the systemic group showed better healing at both 2 (p=0.027) and 4 (p=0.023) weeks than the control TXA group. Moreover, bone healing was better in the group treated with topical rather than systemic TXA on radiological examinations performed at 2 (p=0.001) and 4 (p=0.007) weeks postoperatively (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively). Histologically, the groups differed significantly (p=0.001). The histological scores differed significantly among the all groups (p=0.001). At 2 weeks, the topical TXA group exhibited significantly better bone healing than the control group (p=0.001).Our results suggested that topical application of TXA in fracture patients may accelerate healing, whereas systemic administration may adversely affect healing.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the effects of different demographic and perioperative modalities on mortality rates and (2) to compare mortality rates between different implants in elderly patients operated on for hip fractures. In this retrospective study, a total of 314 patients who were operated on for hip fractures were included study. Patients were then divided into four groups based in their implant types: long-stem cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty (n = 124; 102 female, 22 male; mean age = 84.2 ± 6.4 years), standard-stem cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty (n = 74; 48 female, 26 male; mean age = 83.5 ± 6.9 years), antegrade intertrochanteric nail (n = 61; 35 female, 26 male; mean age = 78.5 ± 6.8 years), and total hip arthroplasty (n = 55; 34 female, 21 male; mean age = 72.5 ± 4.3 years). Data including gender, age, duration from injury to surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, comorbidities, use of antiplatelet agents, Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living, type of anesthesia, operation time, preoperative hemoglobin values, blood transfusions given, duration of hospital stay, complications, and type of fracture were recorded. Overall, the mean follow-up was 36.5 (range = 0 - 107) months. The overall mortality rate was 53.2%. The median survival duration was 44.2 ± 5 months (range = 34.3 - 54). Survival rates were found significantly different among the groups (P = 0.001). In the first three years postoperatively, the mortality rate was higher in the standard-stem bipolar hemiarthroplasty group, but in the long-term follow-up, the long-stem bipolar hemiarthroplasty group exhibited the higher mortality rates. It was observed that some parameters had statistically significant effects on the mortality rates. Male gender, higher age, lower hemoglobin values, increased number of blood transfusions, ASA scores ≥3, the existence of ≥ 3 comorbidities were found as main predictors of increased mortality rates. The results of this study have shown that age, gender, preoperative hemoglobin levels, ASA scores, and comorbidities are significant factors affecting mortality in elderly patients operated on for hip fractures. Long-stem cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty appears to show similar rates of mortality with standard-stem cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

Although the pedigree showed autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance, the prevalence of DDH was considerably high, almost accounting for one-third of the family members, and skipping only one generation. Of 16 cases, three patients were diagnosed at our center. The remaining 13 patients were diagnosed at other centers.

All arthroplasties were performed through an anterolateral approach by the same senior surgeon. The mean body surface of the patients was 1.5 m2 (range 1.1 to 1.7 m2) and the mean symptom duration to surgery was 12 years (range 7 to 16 years). Twenty-three hips received cemented, 14 hips received hybrid prostheses. In seven hips with an extremely narrow femoral medulla and shallow acetabulum, a CDH prosthesis was used. The hips were evaluated using the Harris hip score. Prosthetic loosening and displacement and heterotopic bone formation were assessed on follow-up radiographs. The mean follow-up period was 135 months (range 58 to 212 months).The mean Harris hip score increased from 27.2 (range 11 to 69) to 79.5 (range 37 to 87) postoperatively. At final follow-ups, all the patients were satisfied with the outcome and were able to walk without support. Three hips (8.1%; 3 patients) required revision. The overall Kaplan-Meier implant survival rate was 86.5%. There were no significant correlations between the Harris hip score and radiographic loosening and the presence of calcification around the prosthesis. Heterotopic bone formation of grade I was observed in 17 hips (46%).Even though it is performed at young ages, THA considerably improves quality of life of patients with JRA having hip joint involvement and has a comparable implant survival.",

    "abstract": "Proximal and diaphyseal humeral fractures are common especially in the elderly, presenting as a challenging problem due to their high complication rates following surgical treatment. In this prospective study, we evaluated the results of patients treated with the PHILOS (Proximal Humeral Internal Locking System) locking plate, a new technique recently developed by the AO/ASIF.Forty-one patients who were treated with the PHILOS plate for proximal humeral fractures were evaluated in two age groups. Group A included 24 patients (12 males, 12 females; mean age 47 years; range 24 to 64 years) younger than 65 years, and group B involved 17 patients (4 males, 13 females; mean age 78 years; range 67 to 90 years) at or above 65 years. Radiographically, all fractures were classified according to the AO/ASIF system. Surgery was performed with the deltopectoral approach in 10 and two patients, and with a deltoid split in 14 and 15 patients in group A and B, respectively. Functional and radiographic results were evaluated after a mean follow-up of 15 months (range 6 to 28 months).The mean Constant scores were 95.0 (range 74 to 100) and 92.8 (range 72 to 100) in group A and B, respectively (p>0.05). After six months of surgery, Constant scores and functional outcomes were similar in patients operated on with the deltopectoral approach or deltoid split. There was neither nonunion nor implant failure. Complications included intra-articular screw penetration (n=1), displacement of the greater tuberculum (n=1) with oblique placement of the plate (n=1), insufficient reduction (n=4), and varus displacement of the humeral head (n=3). No avascular necrosis was seen.Locking plate system is superior over other means of fixation methods, particularly in osteoporotic fractures, because it allows early rehabilitation and does not result in implant failure.",

According to the grading system of Coughlin and Shurnas, 18 feet were grade 3, one foot was grade 4. One-third of the base of the proximal phalanx was resected at surgery. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic assessments included the measurements of the joint space width of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, hallux valgus angle, and intermetatarsal angle. Clinical evaluations were made using the AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) hallux metatarsophalangeal-interphalangeal scale. Postoperative satisfaction levels of the patients were questioned. The mean follow-up period was 21 months (range 9 to 32 months).According to the AOFAS scale, the results were excellent in seven feet (36.8%), good in nine feet (47.4%), and fair in three feet (15.8%), with excellent and good results accounting for 84.2%. The mean total AOFAS score increased by 24.6 points postoperatively (p<0.05). The mean range of motion of the first MTP joint improved significantly from preoperative 24.2+/-5.4 degrees (range 10 degrees to 30 degrees) to postoperative 54.3+/-9.4 degrees (p<0.05). The mean joint space width of the first MTP joint was 1.0+/-0.3 mm (range 1 to 2 mm) preoperatively, it increased to 3.0+/-1.1 mm (range 1 to 5 mm) on final radiographs (p<0.05). The mean hallux valgus angle decreased from preoperative 13.8 degrees (range 9 degrees to 17 degrees) to postoperative 10.2 degrees (range 4 degrees to 13 degrees), and the mean intermetatarsal angle increased from preoperative 10.5 degrees (range 8 degrees to 14 degrees) to postoperative 11.2 degrees (range 8 degrees to 15 degrees). Patient satisfaction levels were very good in nine feet (47.4%), good in seven feet (36.8%), moderate in one foot (5.3%), and poor in two feet (10.5%). Complications included metatarsalgia aggravated by long walks (n=11, 57.9%), hypoesthesia of the big toe (n=3, 15.8%), and loss of ground contact of the big toe (n=15, 79%). The push-off power of the big toes was measured as 3/5 in five cases, 4/5 in 11 cases, and 5/5 in three cases. None of the patients developed infection or osteonecrosis postoperatively.Interposition arthroplasty is an appropriate surgical treatment method for hallux rigidus for elderly patients with low functional capacity.",

Intracompartmental pressures were monitored with the use of slit catheters connected to a pressure transducer in 28 anterior and 14 deep posterior compartments before and after exercise during the following positions of the ankle joint: relaxed-resting, passive plantar flexion, neutral, and passive dorsiflexion. Alterations in ICP were assessed with reference to that measured in the relaxed-resting position of the ankle.Significant increases in ICP were observed in both anterior and deep posterior compartments during dorsiflexion of the ankle, being 9.1+/-10.6 mmHg (p=0.0001) and 8+/-10.3 mmHg (p=0.001) in the anterior compartment, and 6.4+/-4.4 mmHg (p=0.0001) and 7.2+/-4.3 mmHg (p=0.001) in the deep posterior compartment before and after exercise, respectively. No significant increases were found in other positions of the ankle (p>0.05). While the lowest values of ICP were noted in the relaxed-resting position, plantar flexion of the ankle was associated with decreased ICP pressures.Dorsiflexion of the ankle increases ICP significantly in both anterior and deep posterior compartments. The results of this study may have clinical implications for the conservative management of both CECS and tibial fractures.",

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound treatment in SIS.Thirty-six patients (29 females, 7 males; mean age 51 years; range 40 to 69 years) with type II SIS were randomized to two groups to receive intermittent ultrasound (group 1, n=20) and placebo ultrasound (group 2, n=16) for three weeks (15 sessions). All the patients received the same standard physical therapy and rehabilitation modalities besides ultrasound treatment. Evaluations were made before and three and six weeks after treatment. Functional results were assessed by the Constant score, pain was assessed by a visual analog scale, and range of motion was measured.Within-group comparisons showed significant improvements in both groups three and six weeks after treatment (p<0.05). Comparison between pretreatment and 6-week values were as follows: the mean flexion increased from 148.8+/-20.4 degrees to 175.6+/-6.0 degrees in group 1, and from 165.9+/-14.1 degrees to 177.4+/-4.4 degrees in group 2; internal and external rotation increased from 66.8+/-20.7 degrees and 61.9+/-22.9 degrees to 83.2+/-10.9 degrees and 84.4+/-9.6 degrees in group 1, and from 75.0+/-17.3 degrees and 70.0+/-19.8 degrees to 87.1+/-6.8 degrees and 84.6+/-8.4 degrees in group 2, respectively.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of three reduction methods used during intramedullary nailing of the subtrochanteric femur fractures.This study included 45 patients with subtrochanteric femur fractures who were treated with intramedullary nailing. Twenty-two patients underwent clamp-assisted reduction, 11 reduction with cable cerclage, and 12 with blocking screws. Reduction techniques were compared with respect to the early postoperative alignment, one year postoperative alignment, time to full weight-bearing, time to union, Harris hip score at one year, operation and fluoroscopy times, blood transfusion amount, complications, and additional interventions.The clamp-assisted reduction group had a statistically high mean time to full weight-bearing (p=0.038) and a low mean Harris hip score at one year (p=0.002). The blocking screw group's operation times and fluoroscopy times were statistically long. There was no statistically significant difference between the clamp-assisted reduction and cable cerclage groups in terms of operation times and fluoroscopy times. On the other hand, there were statistically significant differences between the clamp-assisted reduction and blocking screw groups (p=0.0001 and p=0.0001, respectively) and between the cable cerclage and blocking screw groups (p=0.037 p=0.0001, respectively) in terms of operation times and fluoroscopy times. There was no statistically significant difference between the clamp-assisted reduction, cable cerclage and the blocking screw groups in terms of early postoperative alignment, one year postoperative alignment, time to union, complications or additional interventions.Clamp-assisted reduction leads to a longer time to weight-bearing and a poorer functional status at one year. Operation time and fluoroscopy time were longest in the blocking screw group.",

    "abstract": "Studies on the anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) have shown that the normal ACL consists of two functional bundles named as anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles. In this study, we evaluated the AM and PL bundles of the ACL using 1.5 tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is routinely used in clinical practice.The study included 150 patients (96 females, 54 males; mean age 33.4+/-11.6 years; range 18 to 59 years) who did not have any signs of ACL insufficiency and whose knees were examined by MRI for other reasons. Standard magnetic resonance images (77 right, 73 left) were evaluated independently by an orthopedist and a radiologist in terms of distinguishable ACL bundles. The angle between the ACL (and each bundle) and the tibial plateau was measured on sagittal and coronal sections. Arthroscopic surgery was performed in 64 patients (42.7%) for primary diagnoses and arthroscopic and MRI findings were compared.Magnetic resonance imaging showed an intact ACL in all the patients. The ACL was assessed as a single bundle in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes in 93 patients (62%). A double-bundle appearance was noted in 57 patients (38%), involving all three planes in 14 patients (9.3%), axial and coronal planes in 41 patients (27.3%), coronal and sagittal planes in one patient (0.7%), and only coronal plane in one patient (0.7%). On MRI sections showing a single bundle ACL, the mean angle between the ACL and the tibial plateau was found as 55.3 degrees in the sagittal plane, and 70.3 degrees in the coronal plane. On sections with a double-bundle appearance, the mean angles between the AM bundle and the tibial plateau were 70.1 degrees and 55.1 degrees in the coronal and sagittal planes, respectively. The corresponding angles for the PL bundle were 81 degrees and 53.5 degrees . The incidence of double bundle ACL appearance in coronal, sagittal, and axial MRI sections was not influenced by sex and side (p>0.05). The number of bundles identified in each plane did not show a significant difference between the two observers (p>0.05). During arthroscopic surgery, both bundles were identified with normal integrity and function of the ACL in all the patients. Of these, MRI could depict a double-bundle appearance in one or more planes in only 42.2% of the patients.Even though standard 1.5 tesla MRI, routinely used in clinical practice, has a very high success rate in demonstrating the ACL, it can visualize the two-bundle structure only in about one-third of the patients.",

    "abstract": "Ribbing disease (RD) is a rare bone dysplasia characterized by benign endosteal and periosteal new bone formation confined to the diaphysis of the long bones of the lower extremities in young adults. The etiology and optimal treatment for the disease are unknown. It is often initially diagnosed as a low-grade osteomyelitis or a bone-forming neoplasia. It may also be confused with other causes of increased bone density. The onset is usually after puberty and the most common presenting symptom is pain that does not resolve with medical treatment and sometimes is intolerable. We report the case of a 22-year old woman with clinical and radiological manifestations of RD. In spite of different medical treatment modalities, pain did not resolve and the patient consulted multiple physicians. Intramedullary reaming of the tibia was performed to relieve the severe pain. To the authors' knowledge, in this report we present a case of RD for the third time in the orthopaedic literature and also she is the second case in the English literature to undergo a definite surgical treatment modality as intramedullary reaming for the solution of her pain. Owing to the rarity of the disease we aimed to report the complete findings of our encounter with the disease and to emphasize the role of an orthopaedic surgeon in consultation and intervention for the treatment of intolerable pain which is the most important symptom of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Isolated distal radioulnar instability may remain unrecognized during the acute period of trauma as it is difficult to diagnose, and does not become obvious until later when it has become chronic. We present early results in patients who underwent stabilization with extraarticular ligament reconstruction (Fulkerson-Watson reconstruction). Four women and 1 man underwent surgery for chronic isolated distal radioulnar joint instability demonstrated in X-rays and magnetic resonance images. Arthroscopy revealed avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex from the point of insertion in 3 patients, and peripheral tears in 2 patients. The peripheral tears were debrided arthroscopically. All patients had an adequate sigmoid notch and therefore underwent ligament reconstruction using the Fulkerson-Watson method. Postoperative evaluations were done with MRI. Mean follow-up was 15.5 months (range 6-26 months). Stability was achieved in all patients. The mean Quick-DASH symptom score decreased from 18.63 (15.90-22.72) to 6.81 (2.27-9.09) after surgery. A mean visual analogue score to assess pain decreased from 7.32 (6.30-8.40) to 1.88 (1.50-2.30) after surgery. Preoperative and postoperative measurements were 26° (passive 44°) and 47° (passive 65°) for active supination, 18° (passive 45°) and 49°(passive 68°) for active pronation, 20° (passive 43°) and 42° (passive 60°) for active wrist flexion,and 38° (passive 52°) and 45° (passive 59°) for active wrist extension. Surgical revision of distal radioulnar joint instability using Fulkerson-Watson reconstruction is easier than intraarticular techniques and satisfactorily re-establishes stability, provided that the sigmoid notch is adequate.",

After a preliminary study and power analysis, 2152 hips of the 1076 previously asymptomatic patients were evaluated radiologically with pelvis antero-posterior and frog-leg radiographs. On radiographs of these patients; alpha angle, lateral central edge angle (LCEA), Tönnis angle (TA) and collodiaphyseal angle were measured. Alpha angle values higher than 55° were noted as cam type FAI. TA values lower than 0° or LCEA values higher than 39° were noted as pincer type FAI. LCEA values lower than 25° or TA values higher than 10° were noted as acetabular dysplasia.Mean age of 1076 patients (602 female, 474 male) was 42.1 ± 15.6 years. The assessment showed that 15.9% of the patients had cam type, 10.6% had pincer type, 3.1% had combined type FAI and 9.3% had findings of acetabular dysplasia. The prevalence of asymptomatic FAI is significantly more in males (46%) in comparison to females (17%) in Turkey.Even though FAI is considered to be a pathology associated with hip osteoarthritis; it is very common in asymptomatic population.

The patients were divided into early (before 12 months) and late (after 12 months) excision groups. In the early excision group (17 patients), the average time from the initial injury to HO excision was 7.4 (3-11) months, and in the late excision group (25 patients), the average time was 33.5 (12-240) months. Every patient was evaluated by range of motion (ROM), the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), postoperative complications and HO recurrence.The preoperative mean ROM in the late excision group was greater than that of the early excision group, suggesting that the ROM is expected to increase even without surgery. Both early and late surgery increased ROM and MEPS, but early surgery improved ROM and MEPS more than late surgery did (p < .05).Early excision of HO can provide better elbow function, as indicated by ROM and MEPS. Considering that there were no notable differences in postoperative ROM and MEPS, HO recurrence, or postoperative complications, we concluded that early excision is safe and that the time from an elbow injury to surgery may be shortened.Level III, therapeutic study.",

Group 1 was fixed using posterior tension band plating with a 3.5 mm locked plate combined with fixed-angle locked 3.5 mm screw fixation of bilateral S1 vertebra pedicles through suitable holes of the plate. Group 2 underwent posterior tension band plating with a 3.5 mm locked plate combined with bilateral spongious iliosacral screw fixation and Group 3 bilateral iliosacral spongious screw fixation alone. The ultimate load to failure and load for 10 mm of displacement for all three groups were compared.The average loads to failure for Groups 1, 2 and 3 were 1775, 2084 and 2230 N, respectively, and average loads for 10 mm of displacement were 1033, 1884 and 2013 N, respectively. Group 2 and 3 had the strongest fixation constructs although there was no statistically significant difference between these two groups (p=0.452). Group 2 and 3 were superior to Group 1 in terms of loads for 10 mm of displacement. There was no significant difference between Group 2 and 3 in this regard (p=0.397).Iliosacral screws are superior to bilateral S1 pedicle fixation through posterior tension band plating. However, the combination of tension band plating with iliosacral screw fixation does not improve the stability of the posterior pelvic ring.",

This retrospective study included 17 extremities of 15 patients (8 male, 7 female; mean age: 21.9 years, range: 10 to 55 years) who underwent TSF after deformity and fracture. Application parameters measured by fluoroscopy at the end of surgery after mounting the fixator were compared with parameters obtained from anteroposterior and lateral digital radiographs taken 1 day after surgery. Fixator was applied to the femur in 8 patients, tibia in 6 and radius in 3. Mean time to removal of the frame was 3.5 (range: 3 to 7) months. Mean perioperative anteroposterior, lateral and axial frame offsets of patients were 9.1 (range: 3 to 20) mm, 18.1 (range: 5 to 37) mm and 95.3 (range: 25 to 155) mm, respectively. Mean postoperative anteroposterior, lateral and axial frame offset radiographs were 11.8 (range: 2 to 30) mm, 18 (range: 6 to 47) mm and 109.5 (range: 28 to 195) mm, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups (p>0.05). While measurements taken during operation may lengthen the duration in the operation room, fluoroscopy may provide better images and is easier to perform than digital radiography. On the other hand, there is no difference between measurements taken during perioperative fluoroscopy and postoperative digital radiography.",

According to the distal fusion level, patients were divided into 3 groups. Group S; lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) was the sagittal stable vertebra (SSV), Group F; LIV was the first lordotic vertebra (FLV) and, Group L; LIV was the lower end vertebra (LEV).

In 11 patients, FLV and SSV was the same vertebra. In remaining 28 patients, 10 patients were in Group S, 15 patients were in Group F and 3 patients were in Group L. In Group S, none of them developed DJK, however, DJK was observed 9 of 15 patients in Group F. DJK was developed in all cases in Group L. There is a statistically higher risk for developing DJK when FLV or LEV was selected as LIV (p < 0.05).Selecting SSV for the distal fusion level has been found to be effective for preventing DJK. Selecting distal fusion level proximal to SSV will increase the risk of DJK which may become symptomatic and require revision surgery.Level IV, therapeutic study.",

Then, the same database for surgically treated patients with a minimum of 1-year follow-up was analysed to see the effect of baseline SF-36 MCS on treatment results. A clinically useful SF-36 MCS was determined by ROC Curve analysis.A total of 229 patients with the baseline parameters were analysed. A strong correlation between SF-36 MCS and SRS-22, ODI, gender, and diagnosis were found (p < 0.05). For the second part of the study, a total of 186 surgically treated patients were analysed. Only for SF-36 PCS, the un-improved cohort based on minimum clinically important differences had significantly lower mean baseline SF-36 MCS (p < 0.001). SF-36 MCS was found to have an odds ratio of 0.914 in improving SF-36 PCS score (unit by unit) (p < 0.001). A cut-off point of 43.97 for SF-36 MCS was found to be predictive of SF-36 PCS (AUC = 0.631; p < 0.001).The factors effective on the baseline SF-36 MCS in an ASD population are other HRQOL parameters such as SRS-22 and ODI as well as the baseline thoracic kyphosis and gender.

Radiographic signs of loosening were investigated by X-rays looking for radiolucent lines. We used the Harris hip score for the clinical and functional evaluation.To now none of the 12 patients in the series needed any revision surgery for aseptic loosening. In the revision group one patient have been revised for septic loosening, two patients have been treated by conservative procedure for hip dislocation. Post-operative Harris hip score improved from an average of 46 points to 85.3 points. At last follow-up we found only in one case radiographic signs of progressive lucent line, without clinical sign of failure.In a clinical setting, tantalum cup seems to provide a good stability due to the integration of the trabecular metal to the underline cancellous bone.

Pre and post anterior vertebral body height, the highest compression force and pressure changes in the intervertebral disc during 40 N loading were measured.A significantly different degree of resistance to compression force was determined in each posterior ligamentous complex structure in the thoracic and lumbar spine samples. The combination of interspinous ligament and ligamentum flavum was found to be the most effective structure to resist compression forces (p = 0.001 in both groups). The effect of the supraspinous ligament in thoracic and lumbar segments was found to be similar to that of the interspinous ligament and ligamentum flavum combination (p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively). The least effective structure was observed to be the facet joint capsule. Compression forces were significantly increased in the intervertebral disc as a result of the disruption of supraspinous ligament (p = 0.0032 and p = 0.0029, respectively in thoracic and lumbar segments) and combination of interspinous ligament/ligamentum flavum (p = 0.0019 and p = 0.0021, respectively in thoracic and lumbar segments).The interspinous ligament/ligamentum flavum combination and supraspinous ligament are the largest contributor to resisting applied compression moments in the sheep thoracic and lumbar spine. As a result of the loss of resistance to compression forces, there will be a shift of a great proportion of this force onto the intervertebral disc.Level V.",

There were 70 males (82 hips) and 55 females (60 hips). Patients were assessed using the Harris hip score (HHS) and visual analog scale (VAS). Radiographs were evaluated according to the Gruen zones and DeLee and Charnley zones to assess the prosthesis position, loosening and ectopic ossification.Follow-up was obtained over 4.72 ± 2.16 (range: 1 to 8.4) years and no patients were lost to follow-up. Mean HHS improved from 51.43 ± 4.14 points preoperatively to 90.27 ± 6.60 points postoperatively, while VAS scores decreased from 8.3 ± 3.12 to 2.1 ± 1.54 by the final review. The HHS revealed excellent and good results in 87.4% of patients. Mild ectopic ossification occurred in 4 cases (2.8%), which were all Grade 1 according to the Brooker classification and without clinical symptoms. In 5 cases (3.5%), bone loss was found in the proximal femur. Radiolucent lines surrounding the stem were not observed in any case. There was no prosthesis loosening or femoral prosthesis subsidence. The survival rate was 100% for the femoral and acetabular components. Ten fractures (7%) of the lateral femoral diaphysis at the tip of the stem occurred during surgery and none of these required additional treatment. No infection, dislocation or deep vein thrombosis was observed.Total hip arthroplasty with CFP prosthesis appears to be a good option for young patients for a variety of etiologies but close attention should be paid to the prevention of complications.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to present our findings for the use of the digital artery perforator (DAP) flap in the covering of digital pulp defects. The study included 15 patients who underwent reconstruction of the fingertip using a DAP flap between July 2007 and February 2012. The blood supply of the perforator island flap was based on the distal and either radial or ulnar sides of the digit. Donor sites were closed using skin grafting in all cases. Static two-point discrimination (s2PD) and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) testing was performed at the final follow-up to determine extension loss and sensorial improvement. Mean follow-up was 22 (range: 7 to 62) months. Flaps size was between 2 x 1 cm and 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Temporary venous congestion was observed in 12 of the 15 patients and was without complication. All patients returned to their normal daily activities and work within an average of 39 (range: 30 to 45) days. Mean two-point discrimination was 5.3 mm and SWM test results were between 3.61 and 4.56 at the final follow-up. The DAP flap appears to be a reliable procedure with several advantages as a single-stage operating procedure, easy to harvest, good sensory recovery and preservation of digital arteries.",

The aim of this study was to review recent trends in the evaluation and treatment of SLAP lesions, with particular emphasis on comparing the results of biceps tenodesis and SLAP repair. All English language publications from the PubMed, Cochrane, and SCOPUS databases between 1928 and 2012 on biceps tendon, SLAP lesions, and biceps surgery were reviewed. Literature was reviewed in table form because of the lack of Level 1 studies. Surgical repair can have complications and may not return overhead athletes to their previous level of activity. Biceps tenodesis has become the preferred primary procedure in non-athletic individuals because of the high failure rate of SLAP repair. In patients with continuing symptoms after SLAP lesion repair, biceps tenodesis offers a more predictable operation than a second repair attempt. Biceps tenodesis may present a viable treatment option for SLAP repair or for failed SLAP repair in some patients.",

Patients were analyzed for age, gender, tumor incidence and localization. Three hundred and forty-nine patients found to have non-tumor causes. The 94 patients discharged at their own request or deceased during follow-up were not included in the tumor group.Of the 1,482 (76.9%) patients diagnosed with tumor, 687 (46.4%) were bone tumors, 586 (39.5%) soft tissue tumors and 209 (14.1%) metastatic tumors. The most common benign bone tumor was osteochondroma (118; 25%), followed by enchondroma (68; 14.4%) and giant cell tumor (59; 12.5%), and the most common malignant bone tumor was osteosarcoma (58; 27%), followed by chondrosarcoma (36; 16.7%) and Ewing's sarcoma (33; 15.3%). The most common benign soft tissue tumor was cystic hygroma (96; 22%), followed by lipoma (75; 17.2%) and hemangioma (52; 11.9%), and the most common malignant soft tissue tumors were pleomorphic cell tumor (29; 19.3%) and liposarcoma (29; 19.3%), followed by pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma (21; 14%). Seventy (33.5%) of the metastatic tumors were of pulmonary origin, 36 (17.2%) were of breast origin and the primary site of the tumor was not clearly determined in 58 (27.8%) patients.The distribution of bone and soft tissue tumors appear to have certain characteristics but can show regional differences. We believe that the establishment of a larger series through the collection of these types of studies from centers in which bone and soft tissue tumor surgery is performed will provide important information on the epidemiological features of bone and soft tissue tumors.",

The Turkish version of the MOXFO was applied twice, 1-3 days apart, to the study subjects. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were assessed using Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. Construct validity was assessed with the use of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, using a priori hypothesized correlations with SF-36 domains.Subjects achieved similar scores at the first and second administration of the questionnaire (<0.001). The internal consistency reliability was acceptable for all MOXFQ domains (pain, walking/standing, social interaction), with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.775 to 0.779. The assessment of test-retest reliability revealed satisfactory values, with ICCs ranging from 0.91 to 0.96. Construct validity was supported by the presence of all the hypothesized correlations, with SF-36 within its physical parameters.The Turkish version of the MOXFQ is a valid and reliable tool for evaluating foot pain and functional status in patients affected by hallux valgus.",

Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) was used to measure the state of pain. Pain-related functional capacity was evaluated through Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Patients were classified into three groups based on their serum vitamin D levels: normal (≥30 ng/ml), vitamin D insufficiency (21-29 ng/ml), and vitamin D deficiency (≤20 ng/ml).We found that 22,8% of patients (n:33) had vitamin D deficiency, 42,8% (n:62) had vitamin D insufficiency, and 34,5% (n:50) had normal levels of vitamin D. VAS scores were 4,75 ± 0,93; 4,66 ± 0,97 and 4,52 ± 0,90 for patients with vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D insufficiency, and normal levels of vitamin D, respectively.

DA was structured in two main steps; 1) Baseline analysis (Assessing the probabilities of outcomes, Assessing the values of preference -utilities-, Combining information on probability and utility and assigning the quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for each treatment) and 2) Sensitivity analysis. Complications were analyzed as life threatening (LT) and nonlife threatening (NLT) and their probabilities were calculated from the database as well as a thorough literature review. Outcomes were analyzed as improvement, no change and deterioration. Death/complete paralysis was considered as a separate category.All 535 patients were analyzed in regard to complications. Overall, there were 78 NLT and 12 LT complications and 3 death/paralysis. Surgical treatment offered significantly higher chances of clinical improvement but also was significantly more prone to complications (31.7% vs. 11.1%, p < 0.001).Surgical treatment of ASD is more likely to cause complications compared to NS treatment. On the other hand, surgery has been shown to provide a higher likelihood of improvement in HRQoL scores. So, the decision on the type of treatment in ASD needs to take both chances of improvement and burden associated with S or NS treatments and better be arrived by the active participation of patients and physicians equipped with the present information.Level II, Decision analysis.",

Surgical techniques, rehabilitation, assessment of subjective knee function, one-leg hop test, assessment of joint position sense, muscle strength, and the health profile of the patient were evaluated.Overall, 43 patients were included in Group A (mean age, 32.56 ± 4.89; Tegner activity scale, 5) and 39 patients in Group B (31.67 ± 7.27; 5).

The construct validity, reference validity, sensitivity, specificity, and test-retest reliability of TV_IdFAI were evaluated. For the test-retest reliability, the scale was applied to all participants again in 10-14 days. A correlation between the scale scores and test-retest results was examined with intraclass correlation coefficient. To evaluate the construct validity, a factor analysis method was used. For reference validity, a sports physician evaluated all participants and the clinical diagnoses were compared with total score of the scale. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate the classification success of the scale with specified cutoff.TV_IdFAI scale was grouped under two separate factors. It was determined that the variance for factor 1, factor 2 and for scale was 46.68%, 15.70%, and 62.38%, respectively. There was a statistically significant relationship 0.74 (95% CI 0.64-0.84; p<0.001) between the physician's diagnosis and TV_IdFAI in terms of reference validity. The sensitivity and specificity of TV_IdFAI was 0.61 and 0.80, respectively.

[1]Accordingly, pain and decreased joint function are common presentations.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)Objective: Lyophilized drug manufacturing and intra-articular (IA) applications have increased to address gastrointestinal side effects resulting from chronic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for degenerative joint disease.Accordingly, we histologically examined joint and stomach tissues from rats to determine and compare the effects of long-term treatment with an IA corticosteroid (methylprednisolone acetate), lyophilized NSAID (tenoxicam), and non-lyophilized NSAID (diclofenac) following application to the knee joint.Methods: One hundred Wistar albino rats were divided into 4 groups of 25 rats: control, methylprednisolone, tenoxicam, and diclofenac.Ten IA injections were administered at 1-week intervals.Rats were sacrificed at 48 h and 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the tenth injection.Histomorphologically, knee joint samples were examined for osteoarthritic changes and stomach tissue samples for gastric changes.Results: Unlike methylprednisolone, diclofenac and tenoxicam caused increased fibrosis and fibroblast production; furthermore, chronic methylprednisolone use had no negative effects on the synovium or cartilage. Conclusion:Chronic tenoxicam and diclofenac use affects joints more negatively than chronic steroid treatment.",

Risk factors for DDH and accompanying deformities were also recorded. Graf classification type IIa(-), IIb, IIc, D, and III hips were treated with Pavlik harnesses.Abnormal US findings (type IIa, IIc, or D hips) were detected in 475 newborns (9.9%). Risk factors and concomitant orthopedic deformities were similar in newborns with and without US abnormality and type I hips (p>0.05 for all). However, abnormal US findings were significantly more common in firstborn and female newborns. A total of 39 hips (5 bilateral, 20 left, 9 right) of 34 newborns (31 females) were placed in Pavlik harnesses. Twelve newborns had type IIc or D hips at initial evaluation, and 22 had type IIb or IIa(-) at follow-up. Mean recovery time was 12.5 (8-16) weeks for newborns with type IIc and D hips, 8.6 (8-12) weeks for those with type IIa(-) hips, and 11.2 (8-12) weeks for those with type IIb hips.DDH is still common among newborns in Turkey. Hip US is recommended for detection and follow-up of DDH in newborns.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of the arterial occlusion pressure (AOP) estimation method to set tourniquet inflation pressures was assessed in patients undergoing lower limb surgery.One hundred ninety-eight operations were performed in 224 lower extremities of 193 patients. Tourniquet inflation pressures were set using the AOP estimation formula and adding 20 mmHg of safety margin to AOP value. Primary outcome measures were the amount of tourniquet pressure and its effectiveness. The quality of the surgical field and complications were assessed by the surgical team in a blinded fashion. Secondary measures included the time required to set the tourniquet pressure and complications.The initial and maximal tourniquet pressures used were 168.4±14.5 and 173.3±15.6 mmHg, respectively. The performance of the tourniquets was assessed as \"excellent\" and \"good\" in all stages of the procedure in 97.76% of cases. The time required to measure AOP and set the tourniquet cuff pressure was 19.0±2.6 sec. No complications occurred during or after surgery until discharge.Clinical utilization of the AOP estimation formula is a practical and effective way of setting tourniquet pressures for lower limb surgery. Its usage allows achievement of a bloodless field with inflation pressures lower than those previously recommended in the literature for lower limb tourniquets.",

Rabbits were randomly assigned to six groups: control (C) group, meniscal repair (MR) group, PRP group, PRFM group, MR+PRP group, and MR+PRFM group, with 12 rabbits in each group. A 5-mm full-thickness vertical tear was created in the avascular zone of the medial meniscus corpus in the right knee of all rabbits. The respective treatment for each group was given to the meniscal tear in each rabbit. Histological evaluation of healing was performed 6 and 12 weeks after surgery.Defect filling and collagen formation remained low in the C group. However, in all other groups, there was no significant difference in the 6th week. In the 12th week, similar results as those obtained in the 6th week were obtained. In the C group, there was a difference in defect filling and cell type. This difference was that the defect filling and collagen formation remained low in the 12th week. No significant difference was observed between MR, MR + PRP and MR + PRFM groups. The MR group significantly differed from the other groups in the defect-filling rate and cell type; however, the use of PRP and PRFM did not provide an obvious benefit.The contradictory results obtained in previous studies emphasize the need for further research on the use of PRP in meniscal recovery and repair. We believe that if surgery is indicated, repair is absolutely necessary to improve the healing of the tissue in meniscal tears. Studies using human meniscal tissue for meniscal injury and those that evaluate clinical applications of PRP are warranted.",

The selection of either internal fixation or arthroplasty for nondisplaced femoral neck fracture is debatable.We performed a systematic review of the literature regarding complications in the internal fixation of nondisplaced femoral neck fractures in elderly (>60 years old) patients. We searched in multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) for articles in this area; there was no limitation over the publication year.A total of 1971 patients were identified from 16 published studies. All these patients were over 60 years old. The minimum follow-up after the surgical procedure was 11 months (range: 11-183 months). A total of 329 fractures (16.7%) with radiographic and clinical failures after fixation were identified with regard to stable femoral neck fractures. The single most common complication after surgery was nonunion (129/329), with a pooled percentage of 39.2%. Osteonecrosis was found to be the second most common cause of revision surgery (31.9%). The overall reoperation rate attributable to surgical complications was 15.2% (300/1971 patients). Conversion to hip arthroplasty was performed in 244 patients (12.4%) after primary fixation.Our study elucidated further the complication rate of nondisplaced femoral neck fractures treated with internal screw fixation. Since the failure rate of screw fixation for stable femoral neck fractures in elderly patients is not low, we believe that hemiarthroplasty is a reasonable treatment option in select patients.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

Two reviewers extracted the data, including operation time, intraoperative blood loss, fluoroscopy time, length of stay, union time, nonunion rate, infection rate, implant failure rate, reoperation rate, Harris hip score, and mortality rate. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale were used to evaluate the methodological quality of RCTs and RCSs, respectively. Statistical heterogeneity was quantitatively evaluated with the I2 statistic.There were no significant differences in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, average length of stay in hospital, infection rate, implant failure rate, Harris hip scores, and mortality rate. Intramedullary nail could achieve shorter union time (MD=-1.77, 95% CI -3.40~-0.14, p=0.03), lower nonunion rate (RR=0.36, 95%CI 0.14~0.97, p=0.04), and reoperation rate (RR=0.46, 95% CI 0.24~0.89, p=0.02) than extramedullary fixations. The subgroup analysis indicated that intramedullary nail was superior than extramedullary fixations in operation time, reoperation rate, and Harris hip scores in the ≥60-year subgroup.

Methods Data obtained from 209 patients who underwent posterior spinal instrumentation at a single institution from 2014 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were then divided into two groups: control group, including 107 patients (61 females, 46 males; mean age=54 years; age range=16-85 years), and treatment group, including 102 patients (63 females, 39 males; mean age=53 years; age range=14-90 years). All patients received the same standard prophylactic antibiotic regimen. In addition to the prophylactic antibiotic, vancomycin powder was applied locally to the surgical site in the treatment group. All patients were followed up for at least 90 days postoperatively. Infections were categorized as superficial and deep infections. Subgroup analysis of high-risk patients (Syrian refugees) was also performed. Results The infection rates were 1.96% (two patients) in the treatment group and 6.54% (seven patients) in the control group. A significant decrease in the infection rates was observed with local vancomycin powder application. Advanced age (>46 years) and prolonged surgical duration (>140 min) were found to be the main risk factors for surgical site infections (p=0.004 and p=0.028, respectively). The infection rates were 3.22% and 8.11% in the treatment and control groups of refugees, respectively. There were three superficial and four deep infections in the control group and one superficial and one deep infection in the treatment group. A dominance of staphylococcus infections was observed in the control group, whereas no significant dominance was observed in the treatment group. Three patients in the control group and one patient in the treatment group received implant removal. Conclusion Evidence from this study has revealed that local application of vancomycin powder reduces the rate of surgical site infections after instrumented spinal surgery. The benefit of vancomycin application may be most appreciated in higher risk populations or in clinics with high baseline rates of infection. Level of evidence Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

Complications included transient sciatic nerve palsy in seven knees (11.9%), and wound dehiscence in two knees (3.4%). Revision was required in two knees (3.4%), and posterolateral corner reconstruction in one knee (1.7%).Posterior knee capsulotomy is another option for the treatment of knee contracture in CP, resulting in a significant decrease in knee contracture with acceptable complications. However, failure rate is higher in boys, patients who are marginal ambulators, and in younger age group.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the relationships between upper extremity (UE) kinetics and the energy expenditure index during anterior and posterior walker-assisted gait in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (CP).Ten children (3 boys, 7 girls; mean age 12.1 years; range 8 to 18 years) with spastic diplegic CP, who ambulated with a walker underwent gait analyses that included UE kinematics and kinetics. Upper extremity kinetics were obtained using instrumented walker handles. Energy expenditure index was obtained using the heart rate method (EEIHR) by subtracting resting heart rate from walking heart rate, and dividing by the walking speed. Correlations were sought between the kinetic variables and the EEIHR and temporal and stride parameters.In general, anterior walker use was associated with a higher EEIHR. Several kinetic variables correlated well with temporal and stride parameters, as well as the EEIHR. All of the significant correlations (r>0.80; p<0.005) occurred during anterior walker use and involved joint reaction forces (JRF) rather than moments. Some variables showed multiple strong correlations during anterior walker use, including the medial JRF in the wrist, the posterior JRF in the elbow, and the inferior and superior JRFs in the shoulder.The observed correlations may indicate a relationship between the force used to advance the body forward within the walker frame and an increased EEIHR. More work is needed to refine the correlations, and to explore relationships with other variables, including the joint kinematics.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate anatomical and functional results of non-surgical treatment for unstable distal radius fractures in the elderly.Twenty-nine patients (7 males, 22 females; mean age 72+/-2 years) aged = or > 65 years were treated with closed reduction and short-arm circular casting for unstable distal radius fractures. According to the AO classification, all patients had type C fractures. Anatomical and functional results were assessed using the Stewart criteria and Q-DASH (Quick-Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire, respectively. Bone mineral density measurements were performed. Grip strength and wrist range of motion were measured in comparison to the unaffected side. The mean follow-up was eight months (range 6 to 12 months).Union was achieved in all fractures within a mean of 4+/-1 weeks. Bone mineral density measurements showed osteoporosis in 22 patients (75.9%), and 26 patients (89.7%) had regional osteoporosis in cortical width measurements. After treatment, radiographic measurements showed the following: radius tilt angle +5.6+/-5.4 degrees , inclination angle 17+/-4.6 degrees , radial height 9+/-2.3 mm, and positive ulnar variance 2.8+/-2 mm. Five patients (17.2%) exhibited an articular step-off of less than 1 mm on the radial surface. According to the Stewart criteria, the results were good in 15 patients (51.7%), moderate in 12 patients (41.4%), and poor in two patients (6.9%). The mean Q-DASH score was 38+/-19.2 at three months, and 23+/-2.4 at final follow-up. Grip strength, extension/flexion, and pronation/supination were measured as 57.3+/-12.5%, 52+/-14%, and 75+/-16% of the unaffected side, respectively. Complications were seen in 11 patients (37.9%). Three patients (10.3%) developed malunion which required corrective osteotomy.Unstable distal radius fractures can be treated with closed reduction and cast application in low-demand elderly patients to avoid risks and complications of surgery.",

Active growing enchondromas/low grade chondrosarcomas are diagnosed by clinical symptoms and possibly an aggressive appearance on the radiographs. This study aimed to answer the following questions: Who requests a referral? The radiologist reporting a possibility of sarcoma or the referring physician? What is the outcome of these patients? We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 115 patients with final diagnosis of enchondroma over three consecutive years and recorded the radiological diagnosis on report, patients' symptoms, our initial diagnosis, follow-up, and any decision for a biopsy/surgical management, as well as the histological final diagnosis. Nearly 80% of patients were referred from an orthopedic surgeon. About half of the imaging reports mentioned a malignancy in the differential diagnosis of enchondroma. Very few had the classic signs of an aggressive/growing cartilage tumor. In radiological evaluation, we found scalloping/cortical erosion, lytic areas, cortical breaks, soft tissue extension in only 12 cases of which 8 underwent a biopsy. Of the study patients, 65% were diagnosed with adjacent joint problems. Enchondromas are mostly diagnosed incidentally. They are frequently associated with adjacent joint or soft tissue pathologies, which are main source of the symptoms. Even small, well-defined lesions are often confused with a sarcoma or other malignancies, which may be due to the lack of education on bone tumors for both the radiologists and general orthopedists.",

    "abstract": "Although metatarsal shaft osteotomies have become popular in the surgical treatment of moderate or advanced hallux valgus owing to better reduction and stability, they present fixation problems as the angular correction increases. The purpose of this biomechanical study was to evaluate the effects of widely used metatarsal shaft osteotomies and a newly defined osteotomy modification on the stability of screw fixation at greater angular corrections.Upon evaluation of known problems of shaft osteotomies, a new osteotomy type was designed that might provide an adequate contact area while allowing a greater angular correction, increased stability, and safer osteosynthesis. In our new modification of the Mau osteotomy, the proximal plantar notch that was defined for the Sammarco's modification to increase the contact area was created more proximally making an angle of about 50 degrees with the osteotomy, and the osteotomy was extended until 5 mm to the distal joint surface, aiming to increase the contact area and intrinsic stability. For biomechanical analysis, 30 standard metatarsal bone models (Sawbones) were divided into five groups equal in number for the following osteotomy methods: Myerson's modification of the Ludloff osteotomy, Mau osteotomy, scarf osteotomy, offset V osteotomy, and the new modification of the Mau osteotomy. Osteotomies were performed with a standard correction of 10 degrees in the intermetatarsal angle, followed by appropriate osteosynthesis with fixation by two Acutrak compression screws. The relationship between osteotomies and osteosynthesis in terms of stability was assessed by the three-point bending test.The mean stiffness of the Ludloff osteotomy was significantly lower than all the other osteotomy groups (p<0.05). Stiffness of the Mau group was significantly greater than three groups (p<0.05), but the difference from the offset V group did not reach significance. Stiffness of the new Mau modification was significantly greater than the scarf group (p=0.016), but did not differ significantly from the offset V group. Osteotomy groups with and without notching had similar stiffness values (p=0.582), whereas single notching was associated with a significantly greater stiffness compared to double notching (p=0.031).Our findings suggest that the new modification to the proximal shaft osteotomies moves the center of rotation of angulation more proximally and provides sufficient stability of screw fixation.",

The aim of this study was to report the advantages and disadvantages of early correction of distal radius malunion.Eleven patients (10 male, 1 female; average age 36 years, range: 20 to 54 years) with nascent malunion of distal radius fractures were included in this study. The malunions occurred after initial conservative treatment of unstable distal radius fractures. Mean interval between injury and corrective surgery was 12 (range: 8 to 15) weeks. Two patients had intra- and extra-articular malunion and 9 had an extra-articular malunion. Volar correction was made in seven patients and dorsal correction in four. Results were evaluated radiologically and functionally using the Mayo wrist score.Bony healing was established after correctional osteotomies at an average of 8 (range: 5 to 16) weeks. The average preoperative dorsal deformity was 28° and was corrected to 4° of volar tilt postoperatively. Patients had a positive ulnar variance with an average of 5 mm initially and less than 1 mm postoperatively. Radial inclination was corrected from an average of 9° preoperatively to an average of 20° and the average postoperative Mayo wrist score was 82.5. Tenotomy of brachioradialis was useful for the correction of radial inclination, especially in old cases. Structural (corticocancellous) grafting was used in one patient. All patients returned to their previous functional level.Advantages of early corrective osteotomy include anatomic restoration at the original fracture line, a shortened healing period and a decreased need for structural bone grafting. Disadvantages are that the recreation of the original fracture line is technically demanding and patients must be cooperative to achieve a successful outcome.",

Patient demographics, physical examination findings, adequacy of reduction, functional and cosmetic outcomes were assessed.During the antecubital approach, vascular pathology was noted in all patients with signs of vascular compromise at physical examination. Half of these patients underwent vascular intervention. Closed reduction failed in 93% of patients with concomitant edema, ecchymosis and dimple sign. Of these, the median nerve was trapped between the bone fragments in 4 patients with normal neurological examinations. Functional and cosmetic results of open reduction were similar to closed reduction (p>0.05).Closed reduction should not be forced in cases with marked edema, ecchymosis, dimple sign, and absence of radial pulse. The anterior approach is the surgical approach of choice due to direct visualization of neurovascular bundle and availability of neurovascular intervention by extending the same approach.",

Using the RehabRoby, they were asked to flex their elbow joints in pronation actively and then against a comfortable resistance to the target angles (20°, 45° and 90°), with eyes open and closed. Angle of movement and applied torque for each target angle and error of movement with respect to the target angle (error of matching) were recorded as absolute values. Participants' socio-demographic and physical features were also evaluated.Physiotherapy students had less matching error at 45° with eyes opened than EEE students. A negative correlation was found between resistive elbow flexion and applied torque while eyes closed at 20° (p<0.05). Biceps brachii strength and being female were significant predictive factors for the least matching error in active elbow flexion at 20° with eyes closed. Error of matching at 45° without vision was lower in the PT group (-0.31) than in the EEE group (0.77). In addition, it was noticed that biceps brachii muscle strength played an important role in the proprioceptive sense of the motion at 20°.The RehabRoby can be considered a usable system for the evaluation of joint proprioception sense. With future validity studies, the RehabRoby may be used to assess, diagnose and improve the proprioceptive sense of patients.",

In addition, ventilator-associated pneumonia played an important role in the respiratory complications, however, no pulmonary thromboembolism was found. Death rate in respiratory complication group (RCG, 31.3%) was significantly higher than that in non-respiratory complication group (NCG, 1.3%). In RCG, severe C-SCI (American Spinal Cord Injury Association Grades A and B, OR=34.401; 95% CI, 2.609-5.525) and hypoalbuminemia (OR=24.616; 95% CI, 1.492-6.182) were identified by logistic regression analysis as main risk factors for respiratory complications; whereas levels of neurological injury, quadriplegia, atlanto-axial fractures, smoking history, and electrolyte disturbances were not identified as risk factors (although statistically relevant to respiratory complications).Severe C-SCI and hypoalbuminemia played important roles in predicting respiratory complications among the patients with upper CSI and neurological impairment. In addition, levels of neurological injury, quadriplegia, atlanto-axial fractures, smoking history, and electrolyte disturbances are also valuable indicators for these complications.

Forty-four (77.2%) procedures were primary THA and 13 (22.8%) were revision THA. Gloves were changed when perforated, become dirty with blood or blood products, and before bone cementing. All gloves were filled with water at the end of the operation and controlled for perforation. Two hundred and one surgical gloves used during scrubbing and removed after draping the patient were examined as the control group. The location (which finger), number and time of the perforation, surgery type and duration, and distribution of the perforation location according to the surgical team were assessed.Patients' mean age was 62.9 ± 14.6 (range: 33 to 97) years and the mean surgery duration was 162.9 ± 32.0 minutes. Thirty-two glove perforations were noted in 19 of the operations. Of these perforations, 28 belonged to the surgeons and first assistants. There was no significant difference between the dominant or non-dominant hand according to the location of perforations. Perforations in the first and second fingers of the gloves accounted for 81.3% of all perforations. There was no significant difference in terms of number of gloves used, perforation numbers and operation duration between the primary and revision THA procedures. Two perforated gloves (0.99%) were found in the control group and the difference between the number of perforations in the control and study groups was significant (p=0.048).We recommend the use of two pairs of gloves to avoid the risk of contamination and protect the surgical team from infectious disease in major surgeries like THA. Surgical gloves should be changed when they are excessively contaminated with surgical fluids and the surgeon and first assistant should also change their outer gloves at an average of every 90 minutes.",

The dorsal approach group contained 13 wrists and the volar approach group 14 wrists. Splint was removed and wrist exercises initiated on the 10th postoperative day. Pinch power, grip power and range of motion were evaluated using the contralateral wrist as controls. Functional evaluation was performed using the patient-rated wrist evaluation score (PRWE) and Mayo wrist scoring system.According to the Herbert and Fisher's classification system there were 9 B2, 3 B3 and 1 B1 fractures in the dorsal approach group, and 12 B2 and 2 B1 fractures in the volar approach group. Fracture union was achieved in all patients. There was no significant difference between the two groups according to functional and clinical results (p>0.05). All patients returned to their jobs in an average of 4.2 weeks and there was no significant difference between the groups (p=0.437). Wrist flexion was significantly better in the control wrists in both groups (p=0.009). In one patient, the screw was removed due to ongoing pain and asymptomatic screw head displacement in the scaphotrapezoid joint was detected in another.The surgical approach does not affect the clinical and functional outcomes in percutaneous screw fixation of Type B scaphoid fractures. Percutaneous fixation is a valuable treatment method for Type B scaphoid fractures as it enables early wrist motion and high patient satisfaction.",

The aim of this study was to present the early results of patelloplasty with patellar decompression to relieve anterior knee pain in patients who undergo TKA.We prospectively reviewed 49 knees from 46 patients (35 females, 11 males; mean age: 69.2 years; range: 54 to 82 years) who underwent TKA between January 2004 and December 2008. Decompression and patelloplasty were performed in patients in whom Grade 3 and 4 chondropathy was detected during operation according to the Outerbridge classification. All knees were rated according to the Knee Society Knee and Function Scores, before surgery and during the final follow-up. The patella score was evaluated according to a specific patellofemoral pain questionnaire used by Feller, and the mean knee range of motion was measured preoperatively and postoperatively. Additionally, a patient satisfaction questionnaire used by Levitsky was performed during the final follow-up exam. The mean follow-up period was 41.1 (range: 24 to 68) months.The mean preoperative and final follow-up knee scores were 48.6 ± 8.8 and 87.70 ± 9.3, and function scores were 48.4 ± 10.4 and 81.4 ± 12.6, respectively. The mean preoperative patellar score was 18.1 ± 3.5, and the final follow-up patellar score was 25.7 ± 2.8. The mean patellar scores were significantly greater in knees with Grade 3 chondropathy compared to Grade 4 chondropathy (26.47 ± 2.38 and 24.29 ± 3.19, respectively).

Forty patients suffering from BP with Lenke Type 1 AIS were randomly separated into two groups, Group 1 (20 patients) and Group 2 (20 patients). Group 1 was given KT with tension and home exercises and Group 2 was given KT without tension and home exercises. KT and home exercises was applied to the thoracic area of the patients in both groups for four weeks. Pain intensity was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) and SRS-22 (subtotal SRS-20) before and after treatment.Mean age of both groups was 16.1 years. Mean Cobb angle of the thoracic scoliosis was 31.8° (range: 17°-44°) in Group 1 and 32.8° (range: 19°-43°) in Group 2 before the treatment. The decrease in VAS score of Group 1 after taping was higher than that of Group 2. The difference between the pre- and post-treatment VAS scores of both groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The increase in mean SRS-20 score of Group 1 following taping application was significantly higher than the increase in the control group (p < 0.05).Results demonstrated that KT application with tension effectively leads to back pain relief shortly after application. In addition, KT has a positive impact on quality of life. Thus, KT may be a suitable intervention in treating back pain of patients with AIS.Level 1, Therapeutic study.",

Methods This study was conducted on 66 knees of 43 pre-op patients who were scheduled for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and 50 knees of 26 knee arthroplasty patients at least 6 months postoperatively. KSS was translated and culturally adapted according to the guidelines of Guillemin and Beaton. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded. Patients completed WOMAC, KOOS and SF-36 surveys along with the Turkish version of the new KSS. After the initial evaluation, patients were asked to refill the new KSS 1 week later. Internal consistency and reliability were tested using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Validity was assessed by calculating the Spearman's correlation coefficient between the new KSS and WOMAC, KOOS and SF-36 scores. Results The mean ages of the pre and post-operative groups were 67.16 ± 7.85 years and 71.65 ± 6.95 years respectively. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients of the new KSS calculated for symptoms (0.814), patient satisfaction (0.947), patient expectations (pre-op = 1.000, post-op = 0.997) and functional activities (0.864) were high.

Twenty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 9 patients (7 females and 2 males; mean age: 79.11 years) treated with RSA due to a fracture sequelae following conservative treatment and 18 patients (15 females and 3 males; mean age: 76.83 years) treated with a RSA owing to a fracture sequelae after ORIF.

All the patients included underwent an imaging study that included plain X-Rays and a CT scan prior to surgery and plain X-Rays after surgery. All complications and reoperations during follow-up were also recorded.Both groups had significantly increased Constant Scores after surgery (p < 0.0001), but the patients in the conservative group had significantly better outcomes for the total Constant Score (p = 0.024), for forward elevation (p = 0.026) and for external rotation (p = 0.004).

In the conservative group, 1 patient developed an infection and there were 2 dislocations and 1 infection in the ORIF group.The use of RSA in the treatment of PHFS results in a limited outcome improvement but with an acceptable complication rate. Patients developing PHFS after conservative treatment may expect better outcomes and fewer complications than those developing PHFS after ORIF.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

From July 2012 to July 2014, 50 patients [28 men and 22 women; mean age, 56.4 (range: 45-56) years] underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for a medium-to large-size tear with double-row suture-bridge technique. The bioabsorbable anchors used in the medial row comprised hydroxyapatite-polylactic acid enantiomer, and the nonabsorbable anchors in the lateral row were polyetheretherketone (PEEK)-type anchors. All patients underwent MRI evaluation at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively to determine osteolysis and identify any retear. The incidences of osteolysis at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively were 1%, 4%, and 6% with nonabsorbable anchors and 13%, 29%, and 39% with bioabsorbable anchors, respectively. The incidences of osteolysis were significantly higher with the bioabsorbable anchors than with the nonabsorbable anchors (P < 0.005 for all three follow-ups). There was no significant difference between osteolysis and non-osteolysis groups regarding the retear rate or retear size (P = 0.189 and 0.069, respectively). Osteolysis was common around bioabsorbable anchors used for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, and it also occurred around the PEEK-type nonabsorbable anchors. The incidence of osteolysis of nonabsorbable anchors was significantly lower than that of bioabsorbable anchors. Osteolysis did not significantly affect rotator cuff retear after arthroscopic repair with either bioabsorbable or nonabsorbable anchors. Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "Two drilling techniques of the femoral tunnel are commonly used in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction: through the transtibial (TT) portal or through the anteromedial (AM) portal. The aim of the present study is to investigate the radiological and clinical outcomes of arthroscopic single-bundle ACL reconstruction using AM and TT portal techniques for drilling the femoral tunnel in nonprofessional athletes. A retrospective review was made of 44 nonprofessional athletes undergoing ACL reconstruction using AM and TT techniques between 2011-2013. The femoral tunnel clock position on axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the anterior-posterior position of the tibial tunnel on sagittal-cut MRI scan were measured. Radiological femoral tunnel and tibial tunnel anterior-posterior inclination angles were assessed. At final follow-up, the Lachman test and pivot-shift test were used in the evaluation of the anterior-posterior stability of the knee and the rotational stability of the knee. For clinical and functional evaluation, the modified Cincinnati knee grading system, Lysholm knee scoring scale, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form were used. No statistically significant difference was determined between the groups in terms of patient age, follow-up period, gender, and affected side distribution. There were 6 outliers in the TT group due to the clock face position. The mean femoral tunnel inclination angle was 31.07°±8.44° in the AM group and 19.02°±8.93° in the TT group. The tibial tunnel inclination angle was 21.08°±5.42° in the TT group and 16.58°±7.02° in the AM group. A statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 groups. No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of Lachman test, pivot-shift test, Lysholm score, IKDC score, and modified Cincinnati score results. The AM technique has no clinical superiority compared to the TT technique in ACL reconstruction in nonprofessional athletes.",

The study included 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats (weight: 300±20 g) divided into 4 groups. A critical-sized segmental defect was created in the radius diaphysis in all rats. In Group 1, morcellized iliac crest autografts were used to fill the segmental bone defect. In Group 2, segmental bone defects were filled using morcellized iliac crest autografts, and 25 mg/kg/day PTX was applied intraperitoneally. In Group 3, the segmental bone defects were not filled, and in Group 4 the segmental bone defects were left unfilled, and an intraperitoneal (IP) dose of 25 mg/kg/day PTX was applied. Rats were sacrificed at postoperative Week 8, and defects were evaluated using radiographic, histological and immunohistochemical methods. There were significant differences between Group 1 and 2 according to radiological evaluation (p=0.003) and quality of union at the defect site (p=0.01). Union quality was higher in Group 4 than Group 3 (p=0.01). Cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were higher in Group 2 than in Groups 3 and 4.

The results of zone 2 flexor tendon lacerations repaired primarily by 4 strand Modified Kessler core suture and epitendinous interlocking suture technique followed by Modified Kleinert protocol were investigated.128 fingers of 89 patients who had flexor tendon laceration in zone 2 built the working group. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Strickland formula. A statistical analysis was made between Strickland scores and some parameters such as age, gender, follow-up time, co-existing injury existence, repair time, single or multiple finger injury, tendon rupture and the effect of FDS injury and repair.Excellent, good, fair, poor results were obtained from 71 (55.5%), 46 (35.9%), 8 (6.3%), 3 (2.3%) fingers, respectively. Time of the repair has a significant effect on the strickland scores. Surgery performed within the first 24 hours following the injury gave better results. 3 fingers (2.3%) had tendon ruptures. Existence of ruptures affected the results significantly. Co-existing injuries were found that they did not have any effect on the results. In the fingers in which both FDP and FDS tendons were lacerated, no significant relationship was found between only FDP repair, both FDP and FDS repair and single FDS slip repair. Additionally no significant relationships between follow-up time, gender, single or multiple finger injury and Strickland scores were observed. 13 fingers (10.1%) had PIP joint contracture above 20°.The low rupture rate (2.3%) and 91.4% 'good' and 'excellent' scoring rates in our series support the idea that modified Kessler 4-strand core suture and epitendinous interlocking suture repair combined with modified Kleinert protocol gives satisfactory results.

Patients' Harris Hip Scores (HHS) and survivorship estimates were calculated. Radiographs were analyzed for acetabular implant status, canal fill index (CFI), stem alignment, osteolysis, and stress shielding.Mean follow-up time was 18 years (13-3), and mean HHS was 88.7 (58-100). Patients with femoral neck fracture had a more favorable functional outcome (p = 0.027), while those with stems in varus had lower scores (p = 0.017). 31 stems (49%) were undersized and 30 hips (47%) had perifemoral osteolysis. Acetabular impairment was strongly associated with osteolysis in Gruen zones 1 and 7 (p < 0.01). Seventeen of the osteolytic lesions occurred in Gruen zone 1, 4 lesions in zone 2, 9 in zone 6 and 22 in zone 7. Forty nine stems were well aligned, 10 were in varus and 5 in valgus. Six patients presented with grade 1 stress shielding, 42 with grade 2, 9 with grade 3 and 7 with grade 4. Pedestal formation was evident in 13 cases.

Methods In this study, 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 12 months and weighing 350 to 400 g were used. The rats were divided into three groups (n=10 in each group): a control group and two treatment groups (PRP vs ACS). A standardized procedure was applied for the complete rupture and repair of the Achilles tendon in each group. The PRP group received one dose of PRP on the operative area, and ACS group received ACS at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the surgery. The control group received no injection. Animals were sacrificed 30 days after the operation, and tendon healing in each group was assessed histopathologically based on Bonar's semi-quantitative score and Movin's semi-quantitative grading scale. For the biomechanical analyses, unoperated Achilles tendons of all rats in the control and ACS groups were also harvested, and pulling tests were applied to the specimen to measure the longitudinal axis strength. The highest force value among the data obtained was defined as the maximum strength value (Fmax). Results The mean Bonar's score was significantly lower in the PRP group (3.8±0.8) than in the ACS (4.8±0.45) and control groups (5.2±0.837) (p=0.0028). The mean Movin's score was significantly lower in the PRP group (7.80±1.49) than in the ACS (9.8±1) and control groups (11.2±2.4) (p=0.029). The ratio of type I collagen was significantly higher in the PRP group (60±6) than in the ACS (52±4.5) and control groups (42±9) (p=0.005). Biomechanical results obtained from operated sites were comparable in terms of Fmax among groups (PRP, 33.93±2.61; ACS, 35.24±3.26; control, 35.69±3.62) (p=0.674). Similarly, the results obtained from unoperated sites were comparable among groups (PRP, 47.71±1.21; ACS, 48.14±2; control, 49.14.69±1.88) (p=0.395). Conclusion In terms of histopathological results, PRP seems to be more effective than ACS for Achilles tendon healing in rats.",

Methods:The study included 20 Sprague-Dawley rats injected once with 20 mg/kg of methylprednisolone acetate into the right gluteus medius muscle to induce osteonecrosis.Animals were divided into two equal groups; Group 1 received no prophylaxis (control group) and the Group 2 received CoQ 10 .Hematological examinations were performed before steroid injection (0 weeks) and at 4 weeks after steroid injection.Femoral heads were examined histologically to evaluate osteonecrosis.Results: Changes in blood glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were less significant in the CoQ 10 group.The incidence of histologic changes consistent with early osteonecrosis was lower in the CoQ 10 group (2 of 10; 20%) than the control group (7 of 10; 70%).Conclusion: Coenzyme Q 10 may be useful as a preventing agent in steroid-induced ONFH.Inhibited oxidative stress is a possible mechanism for this effect.",

The study included 20 patients (21 feet) who underwent subtalar arthrodesis due to symptomatic subtalar arthrosis following conservative treatment for intra-articular calcaneal fracture between 2005 and 2011. Autograft or allograft was used in 11 patients. Patients were evaluated clinically using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle hindfoot score. Hindfoot alignment, quality of subtalar fusion and arthritis occurring in other joints were used for the radiological evaluations. Mean duration of follow-up was 43 (range: 21 to 83) months. Mean preoperative AOFAS score was 61.7 (range: 40 to 67) and mean postoperative AOFAS score was 84.2 (range: 65 to 94). The difference between scores was statistically significant (p=0.001). Six patients had excellent, 8 good and 6 fair results. Complete fusion was achieved in 19 patients (20 feet). In 2 patients, arthritic changes were radiologically observed in the midtarsal joints. These changes were not symptomatic. There were no statistically significant differences between pre- and postoperative radiological measurements. No patients experienced malunion. While subtalar arthrodesis appears to provide radiological and clinical benefits, it may cause moderate and asymptomatic osteoarthritis in the midtarsal joints.",

    "abstract": "The labrum and transverse acetabular ligament (TAL) are classically described as distinct anatomical structures with abundant mechanoreceptors and free nerve fibers. They deepen the joint and act as natural barriers against dislocation, thus providing additional stability. We hypothesized that severe coxarthrosis leads to elimination of labrum and TAL mechanoreceptors. This study evaluated the microscopic anatomy of the labrum and TAL and specifically investigated the neurological status of these structures. Labral and TAL specimens from 35 consecutive patients with coxarthrosis undergoing total hip arthroplasty were dissected into a total of 4 specimens per hip. Formaldehyde-fixed specimens were evaluated for the presence of mechanoreceptors and free nerve endings by neurofilament protein and S-100 protein immunohistochemistry and microscopy. Mechanoreceptors were identified in the labral (2.3/high power field) but not TAL specimens, with a sharp delineation between the tissues. In contrast, both labrum and TAL showed good vascularity with abundant free nerve fibers within fibrous connective tissue (mean, 2.6 sensory fibers/ high power field vs 3.1/high power field, respectively). This study demonstrated that the TAL lacks mechanoreceptors. However, TAL and labrum free nerve fibers suggest potential roles as hip pain generators.",

Specimens were loaded to failure. Four biomechanical parameters - ultimate strength (US), strength to 2 mm gap (S2G), strength to 5 mm gap (S5G) and Young's modulus (YM) - were recorded for statistical analysis.The Tsuge-Polyester group demonstrated the highest results regarding S2G (21.24±4.75 N) (p=.002) and S5G (38.91±7.45 N) (p=.002). According to YM, the Bunnell-Polyester group was the most superior (1929.9±512.28 kilopascal) (p=.009). In the repairs with the polydioxanone suture, Bunnell technique achieved the best purchase with regard to S2G (18.14±6.86 N) (p=.006) and S5G (35.69±13.49 N) (p=.015). The difference between the three repair techniques with the polydioxanone suture was statistically insignificant regarding US (p=.252) and YM (p=.338). Concerning the repairs with the polyester suture, the repair techniques demonstrated no statistically significant difference in terms of US (p=.195), S2G (p=.667), S5G (p=.689) and YM (p=.195). Regarding the mean S2G and S5G values, the polyester suture was significantly superior to the polydioxanone suture in modified Kessler repairs (S2G: p<.001, S5G: p=.001) and Tsuge repairs (S2G: p<.001, S5G: p=.009). The polyester suture was also significantly superior to the polydioxanone suture in the modified Kessler repairs with respect to YM (p=.003).This study supports the opinion that Tsuge technique is a promising procedure in Achilles tendon repair (ATR). For Tsuge and modified Kessler repairs, braided polyester suture use appears more advantageous compared to monofilament polydioxanone suture use in biomechanical terms.",

Methods:Overall, 60 patients [36 women and 24 men; mean age: 48.6±12.2years (range 33-67 years)] who underwent arthroscopic repair of Ellman stage 3 partial rotator cuff tear were evaluated retrospectively.These patients were grouped into the following three groups: articular-sided tears, bursal-sided tears, and intratendinous tears, with 20 patients included in each group.Subacromial decompression, acromioplasty, and tear repair without transforming to full-thickness tear were applied to the bursal-sided tears.The same technique was performed for intratendinous ruptures, with the only technical difference was that the capsular tissue was preserved during debridement of intratendinous tears.The articular-sided tears were transformed to complete tears and repaired arthroscopically.The preoperative and postoperative ASES scores and range of motion improvements were evaluated in all patients.The mean follow-up time was 44±6.5 months (range: 36-62 months).Results: No significant intergroup differences were observed concerning the age and the mean follow-up duration (p=0.524,p=0.665).A similar increase in ASES scores was observed for all three types of tears (bursal-sided tears: 31.09-82.65;articular-sided tears: 35.50--84.00;intratendinous tears: 34.01-83.49).Statistically, no significant intergroup difference was observed concerning ASES score improvement (p=0.585).An increase in mean forward flexion, abduction, and external rotation were observed, especially, a statistically significant increase in flexion (p=0.001) and abduction (p=0.001) in all three types of tears.No patient experienced any intraoperative or postoperative complications. Conclusion:The results of arthroscopic treatment of intratendinous tears were similar to the other types of partial tears, and the results of arthroscopic treatment of grade 3 partial rotator cuff tears revealed satisfactory outcomes, regardless of the type of the tear.",

The patients were divided into two groups (9 in each): conventional and 3D printed model-assisted. The groups were then compared in terms of the duration of surgery, time of instrumentation, time of intraoperative fluoroscopy, and volume of blood loss. The quality of the fracture reduction was also evaluated postoperatively by radiography and computed tomography in both the groups. The quality of the fracture reduction was defined as good (<2 mm) or fair (>2 mm) based on the amount of displacement in the acetabulum.The conventional group included 9 patients (9 males; mean age=41.7 years; age range=16-70) with a mean follow-up of 11.9 months (range=8-15); the 3D printed model-assisted group consisted of 9 patients (9 males; mean age=46.2 years; age range=30-66) with a mean follow-up of 10.33 months (range=7-17). The average duration of surgery, mean time of instrumentation, time of intraoperative fluoroscopy, and mean volume of blood loss were 180.5±9 minutes, 36.2±3.6 minutes, 6±1 times, and 403.3±52.7 mL in the 3D printed model-assisted group, and 220±15.6 minutes, 57.4±10.65 minutes, 10.4±2.2 times, and 606.6±52.7 mL in the conventional group, respectively. Procedurally, the average duration of surgery, mean time of instrumentation, and mean time of fluoroscopy were significantly shorter, and the mean volume of blood loss was significantly lower in the 3D printed model-assisted group (p<0.05). The quality of the fracture reduction was good in 7 patients (78%) in the conventional group and 8 patients (89%) in the 3D printed model-assisted group.As compared with the conventional surgery, the 3D printing model-assisted pre-contoured plate fixation technique can improve the clinical and radiological outcomes of the acetabular fractures, with shorter surgery, instrumentation, intraoperative fluoroscopy times, and blood loss.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

No significant differences in age, gender, side, or complication status were found between the groups (P > .05). There were also no significant differences between the groups regarding the Flynn cosmetic and functional criteria (P > .05).Superior functional and cosmetic results can be achieved with fewer complications with surgical techniques applied by experienced surgeons in the open reduction of supracondylar humeral fractures in children.

    "abstract": "Frozen shoulder, a condition characterized by the limitation of active and passive shoulder movements, is predominantly managed conservatively. Corticosteroid injection stands as a widely utilized and effective method for treatment. Nevertheless, the optimal approach for administering the injection remains a subject of controversy. We hypothesized that the injection of corticosteroid through anterior into the extra-articular area would yield superior results than the posterior intra-articular injection. This prospective, randomized, single-blind, and single-center clinical study aimed to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of ultrasound (USG)-guided injection techniques in patients with primary frozen shoulder. We continued the study with 54 patients who met the inclusion criteria. We evaluated patients pre-injection and at the first, third, and sixth weeks after injection. Two distinct approaches were employed: (1) Injection through the anterior extra-articular area around the coracohumeral ligament (CHL), and (2) injection through the posterior route into the glenohumeral joint. Evaluation parameters, including Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, active range of motion (ROM), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) scores, were assessed pre-injection and at the first, third, and sixth weeks post injection. No significant differences in the demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory, or radiological findings were observed between the groups. It was observed that both groups exhibited similar and significant improvement in all measured parameters within their respective groups. Regarding pain scores, a notable decrease in VAS scores was observed in both groups (P = .000). There was no difference between the groups in terms of pre-injection VAS, QuickDASH, and ASES scores and active ROM measurements. The study concluded that there was no significant difference between ultrasound-guided injection of posterior intra-articular injection and anterior extra-articular injection concerning pain, ROM, and functional scores. Both techniques can be considered as viable options in the early stage of the disease. Level I, Therapeutic study.",

A 23-year-old man was admitted with refracture of the right femoral shaft and a 32-degree bending of an inflatable intramedullary nail due to a fall, two months after the initial surgical treatment. The nail was first straightened by exerting an external force, which decreased the angulation to 10 degrees. Then, the fracture site was opened, the lateral wall of the nail was drilled, and one of the four metal bars of the nail was cut. This allowed complete straightening of the nail by the same maneuver and its removal. A new inflatable intramedullary nail was placed and union was achieved after four months. Tools that may be necessary to cut the nail partially or totally should be made available for removal of bent nails.",

Indications for arthrodesis were infected total knee prosthesis (n=6), septic arthritis sequelae (n=4), and infected distal femoral tumor prosthesis (n=1). Eight patients had active infection; of these, seven patients initially underwent complete clinical and laboratory eradication of infection with debridement, application of antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer (n=6), and parenteral antibiotics. Resection guides of total knee arthroplasty were used to create wide bleeding femoral and tibial bone surfaces. Biplanar or uniplanar monolateral external fixation was applied for a mean of eight months (range 5 to 12 months). The mean follow-up was 28 months (range 7 to 69 months). Complications were evaluated according to the Paley's classification.Fusion was achieved in all the patients. There were no recurrent infections. No remarkable shortening developed following the procedure. All the patients could walk without walking aids, except for one patient who further required lengthening for marked shortening due to previous wide tumor resection. Shortening was 3 cm in one patient with infected total knee prosthesis, while it ranged from 1 cm to 2 cm (mean 1.4 cm) in the remaining patients. Pin tract infections were seen in five patients, all of which were successfully treated with oral antibiotics and local wound care.Knee arthrodesis using a monolateral external fixator is associated with a high fusion rate and a low complication rate, and provides a more comfortable treatment option compared to a circular external fixator.",

The study included 17 patients (5 women, 12 men; mean age 33 + or - 10 years; range 17 to 48 years) with closed, nonarticular phalangeal fractures. One patient had two phalangeal fractures. There were 14 proximal and four mid phalangeal fractures, including seven oblique, four spiral, one transverse, and six comminuted fractures. The mean duration from injury to surgery was 2.6 + or - 2.9 days (range 0 to 11 days). Following open reduction, seven fractures were treated with a mini plate and screws, and 11 fractures with mini screws.

    "abstract": "Repair of massive rotator cuff tears is a challenging and complex procedure. The tissue at the end of the torn tendons is often friable and weak, because ruptures are old and degenerated, and thus the ends must be sutured effectively and strongly to achieve a satisfactory outcome. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of free total or partial coracoacromial ligament (CAL) graft to protect and augment the repair of massive rotator cuff tears. Forty six patients ((32 females, mean age 54.3 years (range 39-66 years)) operated for massive rotator cuff tears between January 2003 and June 2009 were included in the study. Twenty nine of these patients had right-sided tears, and 17 had left-sided tears. Fifteen of the tears were 3-4 cm wide (mean 3.5 cm); 27 were >4 cm wide (mean 4.5 cm), and 4 were >5 cm wide. The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range 16-52 months). Patients were operated with a mini-open technique, and reconstructed after primary repair with 18 total and 28 partial free transfer of the CAL. Patients were evaluated by Constant-Murley score, and the degree of active flexion and abduction. Tendon thickness was measured with ultrasonography during follow-up. Mean preoperative shoulder flexion was 27.5° (range 5-40°), and mean abduction was 22.5° (range 10-30°). Shoulder flexion was significantly greater postoperatively (mean 102.6°, range 70-150°), as was shoulder abduction (mean 96.5°, range 60-150°). Mean preoperative and postoperative Constant-Murley score was 45 and 80, respectively. Surgical complications, particularly recurrence, did not occur in any patient during the follow-up period. The integrity and tendon thickness of the repairs were similar to those of normal tendons at the end of follow-up. Augmentation with a free transfer of the coracoacromial ligament provides excellent and promising functional results in the operative treatment of massive rotator cuff tears with a mini-open technique.",

This study was designed to evaluate the interobserver reliability of the Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) which was administered to the mothers and the physiotherapist for children with CP.The study included 52 spastic diparetic children with CP (22 girls, 30 boys; mean age 7.8+/-4.4 years; range 4 to 12 years) and their mothers. According to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), all the children were in level 1 to 3. The Gillette FAQ was administered to the mother and physiotherapist to determine the functional walking level of the child and the interobserver reliability of the FAQ was calculated. In addition, gross motor performance was evaluated by the standing and walking-running-jumping dimensions of the Gross Motor Performance Measure (GMPM), and functional independence level was evaluated by the transfer and locomotion dimensions of the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM). Correlations were sought between the FAQ results of the physiotherapist and mothers and the GMFCS, GMPM, and WeeFIM.The intraclass correlation coefficient for interobserver reliability of the Gillette FAQ was 0.94 (95% CI 0.898-0.966). A highly significant correlation was found between the responses of the mother and physiotherapist to the Gillette FAQ (r=0.882, p<0.01). The responses of the mother and physiotherapist to the Gillette FAQ showed a negative correlation with the GMFCS level, and positive correlations with the dimensions of the GMPM and WeeFIM studied (p<0.01).The Gillette FAQ can be used by the physiotherapists to determine the functional changes in spastic diparetic children with CP and can help clinicians derive important information from the families about functional walking of their children.",

At the time of surgery, 28 patients were in the age group of 56-64 years, and 10 patients were in the age group of 65-75 years. All the patients had Ahlbäck grade 2 primary medial compartment arthritis that had been unresponsive to conservative treatment. None of the patients had symptoms of patellofemoral arthrosis. Patients underwent UKA with the Oxford phase 3 cemented meniscal-bearing unicondylar prosthesis using minimally invasive surgery. The results were assessed preoperatively and at final controls according to the Knee Society clinical and functional rating system. Postoperative radiographic evaluations were made according to the Oxford criteria. The mean follow-up period was 24 months (range 18 to 32 months).The mean preoperative active knee flexion increased from 121.8 degrees (range 110 degrees to 130 degrees ) to 130.9 degrees (range 120 degrees to 140 degrees) postoperatively (p<0.05). There was no limitation in knee extension both pre- and postoperatively. The mean preoperative and postoperative knee scores were 64.6 (range 47 to 80) and 97.5 (range 89 to 100), and the mean functional scores were 59.6 (range 45 to 80) and 92.1 (range 70 to 100), respectively (p<0.05). All the patients had an excellent knee score, while functional scores were excellent in 27 patients (71.1%) and good in 11 patients (28.9%). Postoperative radiographic measurements showed that the position of the femoral components was within acceptable ranges in all the patients with a mean of 3 degrees valgus (range 5 degrees valgus to 8 degrees varus) and 0.5 degrees extension (range 3 degrees extension to 2 degrees flexion). The positioning of the femoral components in relation to the mechanical axis was central in 30 patients and 2-mm lateral (range 2 mm medial to 4 mm lateral) in eight patients. The position of the tibial components was also within acceptable ranges in all the patients with a mean of 1.5 degrees varus (range 2 degrees varus to 2 degrees valgus) and a mean posterior inclination of 6.2 degrees (range 5 degrees to 7 degrees). All the tibial components showed full congruency with the medial, lateral, anterior, and posterior planes, except for one which had a 4-mm undersizing in the anterior plane. The polyethylene insert was central and parallel to the tibial component in all the patients. No osteophytes or cement debris that might lead to impingement were observed. All the components remained in position until the final controls. Complications such as insert dislocation, infection, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, or neurovascular injury were not observed. None of the patients required revision surgery.Our findings show that, with proper patient selection and strict adherence to the surgical technique, short-term results of the Oxford phase 3 unicompartmental knee prosthesis are excellent or good in the treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis.",

There were 28 AO/ASIF type A, 29 type B, and 16 type C fractures. The fractures involved the proximal 1/3 (n=12), middle 1/3 (n=50), and distal 1/3 (n=11) of the tibial diaphysis. Twenty-eight fractures (38.4%) were closed. According to the Gustilo-Anderson classification, 30 patients (41.1%) had grade I, 10 patients (13.7%) had grade II, and five patients (6.9%) had grade IIIA open fractures. Intramedullary nailing was performed following open reduction in 17 patients (23.3%), and closed reduction in 56 patients (76.7%). The mean time to surgery was 3.4 days (range 2 to 11 days) and the mean follow-up was 48 months (range 24 to 60 months). The patients were evaluated with respect to range of motion, time to union, and complications. Functional results were assessed using the Johner-Wrush criteria.Union was achieved in all the patients within a mean of 18.2 weeks (range 8 to 52 weeks). Four patients required dynamization because of delayed union and grafting was performed in one patient. Transient sensorial deficit occurred in one patient after dynamization. One patient underwent revision surgery because of migration of the distal locking screws. The only limitation of range of motion was seen in flexion of two patients (2.7%) who developed anterior knee pain.

The mean duration of symptoms was 11 months and the mean lesion size was 17 x 9 mm. The lesions were of medial localization in five patients, and lateral localization in three patients. According to the Bristol classification, the stages of the lesions were as follows: stage IIa (n=2), IIb (n=1), III (n=2), IV (n=1), and V (n=2). Mosaicplasty was performed via a mini arthrotomy with osteotomy. Functional assessments were made using the AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society) scoring system pre- and postoperatively. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale. Regeneration of new cartilage tissue at the lesion site was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. The mean follow-up was 17 months (range 8 to 34 months).The osteotomy site healed in a mean of six weeks in all the patients. The mean pre- and postoperative AOFAS scores were 58 (range 40-68) and 89 (range 80-97), respectively (p<0.005). Pain scores decreased from a mean of 8 (range 5 to 10) to 2 (range 1 to 4; p<0.005). Surgery-related complication was seen in one patient. All the patients returned to preoperative levels of activity and occupation. Magnetic resonance imaging showed graft incorporation in all the patients.Open mosaicplasty is a simple, safe, and effective alternative in the treatment of cartilage losses of the talar dome, in particular those of cystic type and exceeding 10 mm in size.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of postoperative autotransfusion method on prevention of the need of allogeneic blood transfusion in hip and knee arthroplasty.Seventy-four patients who underwent 77 hip and knee arthroplasty operations were randomized into control and study groups, and evaluated prospectively. In the knee group (39 patients; 30 females, 9 males; mean age 66.6 years), cemented, cruciate retaining, and bicompartmental arthroplasty was performed under tourniquet control; whereas in the hip group (35 patients; 24 females, 11 males; mean age 59.3 years) cementless arthroplasty with posterolateral approach was performed. None of the patients received preoperative and intraoperative allogeneic blood transfusion. The collected blood in the surgical area was transfused with autotransfusion system to the patients in the study groups at the end of the fourth hour postoperatively. The mean amounts of autotransfused blood in hip and knee groups were 413 mL and 480 mL, respectively. Allogeneic blood transfusion was applied to the patients with hemoglobin level below 8 g/dL, hematocrit level below 25%, and clinical symptoms of anemia.Preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin-hematocrit levels did not differ significantly between study and control groups. Allogeneic blood transfusion was applied to one patient (5%) in study and 8 patients (38%) in control groups during knee arthroplasty (p=0.01); whereas 9 patients (53%) in study and 15 patients (79%) in control groups received allogeneic blood transfusion during hip arthroplasty (p=0.044). The amount of allogeneic blood transfusion in study groups was significantly lower than that in control groups (p=0.008 for knee arthroplasty, p=0.048 for hip arthroplasty).The need and amount of allogeneic transfusion were reduced with postoperative autotransfusion in both knee and hip arthroplasty groups with greater extent in knee arthroplasty.",

Such scenarios are rare in developed countries, but common in developing countries. We retrospectively reviewed the records and radiographs of 42 patients (28 males and 14 females) with ununited intracapsular femoral neck fracture who presented late to our unit. These subjects were managed by open reduction and internal fixation that was supplemented with cortico-cancellous bone graft from posterior iliac crest as well as quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone graft. The mean delay in presentation was 9 months (range 3-18 months) after the fracture. The mean age of the patients at index procedure was 34 years (range 24-51 years). Radiological union occurred on average at 6 months (range 3-13 months). Thirty-six hip fractures (86%) proceeded to union. Six patients (14%) had non-union and needed revision surgery. Complications included varus union in 9 patients and leg length discrepancy with a mean of 1.5 cm (range 1 to 2.5 cm) in 10 patients. For the ununited intracapsular femoral neck fracture, favorable results can be achieved by anatomical reduction of the fracture, cortico-cancellous bone grafting to reconstruct the femoral neck, internal fixation with cancellous screws, and augmentation with quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone graft.",

A statistically significant difference was detected between the Constant shoulder scores of Groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05). In the last follow-up, the mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score of Group 1 was 96.9, Group 2 was 95.7 and Group 3 was 89.2. Statistically significant differences were not detected between the Group 2 and 3 (p>0.05). In the statistical evaluation of the Constant shoulder scores, a statistically significant difference was detected between the Constant scores of patients with a varus angulation greater than 20° and those with neutral alignment.Functional results of humeral shaft fractures treated with functional brace appear to be satisfactory. Varus and antecurvatum may affect shoulder and elbow function. In the presence of surgical indications, plate and screw fixation technique is the most effective method in terms of shoulder and elbow functions.",

A total of 157 patients with trochanteric fractures were included in the study, and 82 patients underwent dynamic hip screw insertion, and 75 underwent AO angled blade plate insertion. The mean follow-up period was 8 years (range 2.3-11.7 years) in the DHS group, and 8.5 years (2.4-12.5 years) in the AP group.

According to Clawson's functional classification, 64% of patients in the AP group and 81% in the DHS group had good or excellent function (p<0.05). Similarly, according to Foster's classification, 68% of patients in the AP group, and 85% in the DHS group had good to excellent results (p<0.05). DHS yields better long-term results in trochanteric fractures than do AO angled blade plates by providing earlier mobilization of the patient, better stability, and earlier union.",

Preoperative laboratory and clinical data were collected from hospital files. Follow-up was conducted over the phone. The number of the patients who died in the first postoperative 12 months was compared with the official Turkish Statistical Institute mortality data. Preoperative clinical and laboratory findings and ASA scores were compared between surviving and deceased patients.Twenty-eight patients died in the postoperative first year. The first year mortality rate was significantly higher than the normal population (p<0.05). Of these 28 patients, 16 died within the first 3 months; the majority due to respiratory insufficiency. The death ratio was significantly higher in patients with abnormal creatinine values (p=0.001) in the preoperative laboratory results and classified as ASA 4 (p<0.0001). Postoperative mobilization was slower and mortality was higher in patients with cognitive dysfunction, such as senile dementia.The mortality rate in patients operated for hip fractures is higher when compared to the mortality rate in patients of the same age group. Because most deaths caused by pulmonary insufficiency occurred in the first 3 months in which patients were not adequately mobilized, the main cause of death might be pulmonary embolism. Abnormal creatinine values might indicate insufficient kidney function as another reason of death. ASA classification is useful for determination of preoperative risk in the elderly patients with hip fractures.",

Hip instability was caused by a neglected congenital dislocation of the hip in 12 of the patients (13 hips), by septic arthritis in 7 and by an unsuccessful total hip arthroplasty due to infection in the last patient. The mean age of the patients was 22.6 (range: 12 to 34) years. Osteotomy sites were fixed using monolateral external fixators in 11 patients, Ilizarov circular fixators in 8, and locking plates for both hips of the remaining patient. The mean follow-up period was 33.45 (range: 16 to 45) months.The mean Harris score increased from 48.3 preoperatively to 80.1 postoperatively. Preoperative mean limb length discrepancy was 53.3 mm and mean proximal migration was 42.9 mm. Residual limb length discrepancy was reduced to 16 mm after an average lengthening of 63.3. The preoperative Trendelenburg gait disappeared completely in 13 of 21 hips and was improved in 8 hips. Sixteen of the 20 patients (17 hips) expressed satisfaction with the operation.Pelvic support osteotomy is a good treatment option to overcome hip instability as it improves pain and equalizes limb length.",

All patients experienced pain, tenderness, discomfort and/or triggering with flexion/extension of the thumb and palpable nodules at the level of the A1 pulley. Ultrasonographically guided corticosteroid injection was performed on all affected thumbs. Thumb improvement was evaluated using the Quinnell grading system and patients were followed up for one year.All 112 thumbs received one ultrasonographically guided corticosteroid injection. Fifteen thumbs (13.4%) needed re-injection and/or surgery during their one year follow-up. Eight (53.3%) of these 15 cases, had a pre-treatment Quinnell Grade of 4, six (40%) thumbs were Grade 3 and one (6.7%) was Grade 2. Twelve were re-injected, two underwent surgery without re-injection and one underwent surgery after showing no improvement following re-injection. There was a significant reduction in the post-injection Quinnell grade (p<0.0001). One year after the initial injection, 108 thumbs (96.4%) were completely symptom-free.Sonographically guided intra-flexoral sheath corticosteroid injection is an effective method in the treatment of trigger thumb and reduces the need for surgery.",

Patients with a diagnosis of postmenopausal osteoporosis, bisphosphonate usage of at least 5 years and prodromal pain prior to fracture were included the study.Five women met the inclusion criteria. All patients had bilateral low-energy sequential femoral shaft fractures. Fracture patterns were similar and atypical (transverse-short oblique fractures with lateral cortical thickening).

The remaining two fractures were revised for delayed union or nonunion.Long-term (over 5 years) use of bisphosphonates may cause insufficiency fractures due to increased fragility and brittleness which have a close relationship with depressed bone remodeling. While there is still no causal relationship between bisphosphonates and atypical, low-energy femoral shaft fractures, we have some concerns about the optimal usage time and long-term safety of bisphosphonate drugs.",

A spinal fusion was performed between L4-L6 representing two levels. Simvastatin (120 mg/kg/day) was administered orally in the SFS group. The rats were killed at the end of the 12 week study period.Manual palpation revealed two moderate fusions in the SF group. The SFS group did not reveal any signs of pseudoarthrosis. An average three-point bending force causing failure of fusion revealed results of 148.80±39.403 Newtons and 123.80±28.479 Newtons in SFS and SF groups, respectively (p>0.05). Histological examination revealed better fusion grades in the SFS group (mean: 9.30±0.949) than in the SF group (mean: 6.80±2.044) (p=0.003). Radiographic examination revealed Grade C fusion in two levels and Grade A fusion in 18 levels in the SF group. In the SFS group, Grade C fusion was detected in one level and Grade A fusions in 19.Our results suggest that simvastatin can promote spinal fusion and can be used as an adjunct to spinal fusion procedures in an elderly population with high cholesterol levels.",

Two experimental groups (untrained and trained groups) participated in a hamstring eccentric isotonic strengthening program (five days/week) for a six-week period and one control group that was not involved in the training program. The passive knee extension range of motion and hamstring eccentric and concentric isokinetic peak torque were measured at angular velocities 60° and 120°/s for all groups before and after the training period.Two-way analysis of variance showed that there was a significant increase in the hamstring flexibility of the untrained and trained groups (25.65 ± 6.32°, 26.55 ± 5.99°, respectively), (p < 0.05) without a significant increase in the control group (31.55 ± 5.84°), (p > 0.05). Moreover, there was a significant increase in eccentric isokinetic peak torque of both the untrained and trained groups (127.25 ± 22.60Nm, 139.65 ± 19.15Nm, 125.40 ± 21.61Nm, 130.90 ± 18.71Nm, respectively), (p < 0.05) without a significant increase in the control group (109.15 ± 20.89Nm, 105.70 ± 21.31Nm, respectively), (p > 0.05) at both angular velocities. On the other hand, there was no significant increase in the concentric isokinetic peak torque of the three groups (92.50 ± 20.50Nm, 79.05 ± 18.95Nm, 92.20 ± 21.96Nm, 79.85 ± 18.97Nm, 100.45 ± 25.78Nm, 83.40 ± 23.73Nm, respectively), (p > 0.05) at both angular velocities. The change scores in the hamstring flexibility (06.25 ± 1.86°) and eccentric peak torque of the untrained group (16.60 ± 4.81Nm, 17.45 ± 5.40Nm, respectively) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of the trained group (03.40 ± 1.14°, 9.90 ± 5.14Nm, 9.80 ± 7.57Nm, respectively), and the control group (00.90 ± 2.10°, 0.60 ± 2.93Nm, 1.40 ± 3.53Nm, respectively), at both angular velocities. Meanwhile, the change scores of the concentric peak torques of the three groups (1.15 ± 1.50Nm, -0.15 ± 2.16Nm, 1.35 ± 1.63Nm, 0.20 ± 2.95Nm, 0.60 ± 2.28Nm, -0.30 ± 2.25Nm) were statistically insignificant (p > 0.05).After a six-week period of eccentric isotonic training, the hamstring eccentric peak torque and flexibility of trained and untrained groups improved without changes in the concentric peak torque. Moreover, the improvement of untrained subjects was higher than trained subjects. These findings may be helpful in designing the hamstring rehabilitation program.",

Achilles tendons were excised at the end of week 6. The tendon samples were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin under a light microscope. Quantitative evaluation was performed via Movin and Bonar scoring. A computer-monitored tensile testing machine was utilised for biomechanical testing. Biomechanical characteristics of the tendon samples (elastic modulus, yield force, ultimate tensile force) were measured.Histopathological evaluation revealed a significantly higher Movin and Bonar scores in histopathological evaluation. Movin score in isotretinoin group was 4.1 ± 2.5 and it was 2.3 ± 1.0 in control group (p = 0.032). Bonar score in isotretinoin group was 2.9 ± 1.4 and it was 1.6 ± 0.7 in control group (p = 0.022). In line with histopathological evaluation, biomechanical measurements in isotretinoin group (elastic modulus, yield force, ultimate tensile force) were significantly lower than the control group. Elastic modulus in isotretinoin group was 227 ± 27.7 N/mm2 and in control group it was 281.7 ± 38.7 N/mm2 (p = 0.006).

Both Achilles tendons of all rats were transected 5 mm above the insertion and repaired using a Kessler suture. After the surgical repair, the study group received the daily recommended amount of the supplement by gastric gavage, while the control group received a placebo. At the end of the third week, the animals were sacrificed. The biomechanical properties of the groups were compared with ultimate tensile strength and stiffness tests. The biological properties of the 2 groups were assessed with a histomorphometric comparison to determine the amount of collagen type I (COL1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) expression in 3 different tissue subgroups (collagen matrix, tenocytes, and endotenon fibroblasts).Analysis of histomorphometric results revealed that the rats receiving dietary supplements demonstrated a significant increase in PCNA (mean value of 86 in the control group and 168.85 in the trial group; p < 0.05) and TGF-β1 (mean value of 87.57 in the control group and 161.85 in the trial group; p < 0.05) in the endotenon fibroblasts of the repair site. However, there was no difference between the groups in PCNA or TGF-β1 when the collagen matrix and the tenocytes of the repair site were examined. Furthermore, no significant difference could be found between groups in COL1 in any of the 3 tissue subgroups (collagen matrix, tenocytes, and endotenon fibroblasts). The statistical analysis also indicated that the rats receiving supplements did not demonstrate a significant increase in the ultimate tendon tensile strength or stiffness.The results of this study revealed no advantage to the oral administration of the trial supplement in collagen synthesis or biomechanical properties in rats after 3 weeks using the presented study design. However, the increased expression of PCNA and TGFβ1 seen in the endotenon fibroblasts of the repair site might play a role in the continuum of tendon healing.",

In this biomechanical study, it is aimed to evaluate effects of interspinosus ligament complex distruption and facet joint degeneration on PJK development.Posterior instrumentation applied between T2 - T7 vertebrae using pedicle screws to randomly selected 21 sheeps, divided into 3 groups. First group selected as control group (CG), of which posterior soft tissue and facet joints are protected. In second group (spinosus group, SG) interspinosus ligament complex which 1 segment cranial to UIV has been transected, and third group (faset group-FG) was applied facet joint excision. 25 N, 50 N, 100 N, 150 N and 200 N forces applied at frequency of 5 Hertz as 100 cycles axial to the samples. Then, 250 N, 275 N and 300 N forces applied static axially. Interspinosus distance, kyphosis angle and discus heights was measured in radiological evaluation. Abnormal PJK was defined by a proximal junctional angle greater than 100 and at least 100 greater than the corresponding preoperative measurement.In CG group, average interspinosus distance was 6,6 ± 1.54 mm and kyphosis angle was 2,2 ± 0.46° before biomechanical testing, and they were measured as 9,4 ± 1.21 mm and 3,3 ±0.44° respectively after forces applied to samples. In SG group, average interspinosus distance was 6,2 ± 1.72 mm and kyphosis angle was 2,7 ± 1.01° before experiment, and they were measured as 20,8 ± 5.66 mm and 15,1 ± 2.34° respectively after forces applied to samples. In FG group, average interspinosus distance was 4,8 ± 1.15 mm and kyphosis angle was -1 ± 4.14° before experiment, and they were measured as 11,1 ±1.96mm and 11 ± 2.87° respectively after forces applied to samples. In comparison to group CG, statistically significant junctional kyphosis was seen on both FG and SG group after statistical analysis. (p < 0.05). PJK was seen statistically significant more on SG group than FG group. (p < 0.05). Not any statistically significant difference was seen on measurement of disk distances among three groups.

Conclusion:The new CT classification evaluated more accurately the response to Denosumab.Our experience suggests that the requirement for radical bone resection remains high despite the use of Denosumab.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate Turkish trends in zone 2 flexor repair with regards to surgical technique, suture materials, anesthesia and post-operative rehabilitation and compare this with international surgeons by modifying Gibson's survey.A printed and online survey consisting of 19 questions modified from Gibson's survey was sent to 590 Turkish and international surgeons. The surgeon's years in practice, province of practice, residency type, number of zone 2 flexor tendon repairs done in a year, preferred surgical technique, suture material, complications and postoperative protocols were asked to the respondents.A total of 194 surgeons completed the survey (a 25% response rate). Of those who completed the survey, 91 were international (mostly from far eastern countries) and 103 were Turkish surgeons. Years in practice and educational background had influence on the decision-making. There were differences between the Turkish and international surgeons in the core and epitendinous suture thickness preference and flexor tendon sheath repair. There was a statistically significant relationship between the province of practice and the use of WALANT (Wide awake local anesthesia no tourniquet) (p < 0.05). While the majority of respondents who preferred postoperative early passive motion protocol were from Turkey (61.5%), the majority of respondents who preferred early active motion protocol were practicing abroad (73.9%).Despite some variations the surgeons involved in this study follow to a large extent the current literature.",

All the patients had pre-procedural CT examinations. The clinical and technical success and the safety of the treatment were evaluated by assessing the clinical pain symptoms, complication rates and recovery of posture and gait.All the patients had a favorable immediate relief of the known pain caused by osteoid osteoma in 24 h after the procedure. Only in two patients (15-years-old boy with OO in right femoral neck and a 12 years old boy with OO in femur diaphysis) pain relapse was occurred in 3 months and 12 months after RFA and a second RFA was performed. During follow-up they had no pain. The technical success and efficacy-rates of the procedure were recorded as 100% and 98% respectively in this study. No significant complication was observed during treatment or recovery period. Seven minor complications were noted which were successfully treated.The rapid relief of pain symptoms, low relapse rate and low complication rates demonstrate the efficacy and safety of RFA therapy. RFA is an out-patient procedure that patients can be mobilized immediately after the procedure. RFA can be safely used as a first choice of treatment method in OO therapy.Level IV, therapeutic study.",

The origin of bacteria causing PPI is not completely understood. The aims of the present study were to identify bacterial contamination of light handles with up-to-date culture methods and to determine the safety in using these handles in hip arthroplasty surgery.A total of 36 surgical handles randomly selected from primary hip arthroplasty procedures were screened for bacterial contamination using 2 different culture methods, including 1 with high sensitivity. Two types of controls were used. Cultures were kept for up to 10 days, and retrieved bacteria were identified.Fifty percent of the light handles yielded positive cultures, demonstrating a bacterial presence on surgical light handles during hip arthroplasty. The most frequently identified bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus.A large number of positive bacterial cultures were found in manipulated light handles during hip replacement surgery, representing a potential contamination source that could eventually lead to infection in hip arthroplasty.",

Radiological evaluation was made with standing orthoroentgenographs both pre- and postoperatively. Mean follow-up time was 29.4±8.2 months in the ST and 17.7±11.1 months in the MMV group.In the early postoperative period (10th day), the MMV group was significantly better than the ST group in terms of ROM. Time to SLR and blood loss values were also significantly better in the MMV group. However, there was no significant difference between the groups after the sixth month, for ROM, KSS and HSS values (p>0.05). Surgery time was significantly longer (with a mean difference of 22 minutes) in the MMV group. Radiological examination revealed ideal alignment in both groups. No deep or superficial infection was detected. Two patients in the MMV group had skin problems which healed after clinical follow-up.Our results suggested that functional results of TKAs performed via the MMV approach are better in the first six months when compared to those of the ST.",

We made measurements of seven different dimensions of the medial tibial plateau at the virtual resection level for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) on MRIs of 260 patients and the most commonly used four UKA implants in Turkey. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square test and Pearson's correlation coefficient by using SPSS software. The anteroposterior and widest mediolateral dimensions of the tibial plateau of Turkish knees were found relatively more approximate to the dimensions of Oxford and Zuk prostheses compared to that of Accuris and Mitus (p<0.001). The distance between the central mediolateral dimension and the widest mediolateral dimension was 2.4 (range: 0-6.3) mm in males and 2.6 (range: 0-6.2) mm in females. The maximum mediolateral dimension was found posterior to the central mediolateral dimension in the majority (202 out of 260) of cases. These findings point towards the asymmetry in the AP halves of the resected medial tibial condyle. Tibial components designed according to anthropometric measurements based on both Western and Asian populations do not perfectly meet the requirements of Turkish population. Designing different UKA prostheses for different populations are required for best fit.",

Human cartilage-derived cells (hCDCs) were isolated from the cartilage tissue of a 57-year-old woman diagnosed with gonarthrosis. Tissue samples were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and RPMI-1640. The cells' chondrogenic activities were observed. After serial passagings, cells were divided into 4 groups at the end of the 6th week. On the 14th day, proliferated cells were examined using an inverted microscope with x4, x10, x20 and x40 magnification and microphotographs were taken. Living cell quantity was determined on the first and 14th days using MTS-ELISA cell proliferation assay. DMEM (without adding ITS premix solution) and RPMI-1640 containing ITS premix solution provide proliferation of the chondrogenic cells. The proliferation and viability of chondrocytes were revealed in this study in the 3rd group (DMEM solution without additives). It is suggested that the culture medium ingredients play crucial roles on chondrogenic proliferation in osteochondral tissue cultures.",

We present a case of the unique complication of patellar ligament rupture during total knee replacement (TKR) of an ochronotic joint. A 51-year-old male presented with bilateral severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis with varus deformities and restriction of motion. Bilateral TKR was performed. At the 28-month follow-up, the patient was walking pain free with acceptable position of implants in radiographs. To our knowledge this is the first report of rupture of the patellar ligament during TKR of an ochronotic joint.

The physical therapists were separated into two groups according to their professional experience: those with 10 or more years, and those with fewer than 10 years. Video recordings were made of the subjects undergoing three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA). These recordings were then observationally assessed twice by the participating physical therapists with at least a 6-week interval between observations. OGA was done via a form comprising 11 kinematic and 5 temporo-spatial parameters. Lowest levels of agreement in both validity (r=0.06, p>0.05), and inter- (ICC:-0.12-0.06) and intra-observer (ICC:0.30-0.45) reliability were found in the parameters of ankle dorsiflexion in initial contact phase and pelvic rotation in midstance phase. Highest inter- and intra-observer agreement was found in the temporo-spatial parameters of step width, double step length, cadence and velocity (ICC:0.61-0.80). Highest validity was found in pelvic tilt in stance phase (r=0.74-0.78, p<0.001). With the exception of stance phase, moderate or good agreement (r=0.52-0.69, p<0.05) was found in the temporo-spatial parameters.

We searched multiple databases for articles in the area published from 1950 to 2016.A total of 18 patients (12 male and 6 female; mean age 59 years) from 14 published studies were identified. The minimum follow-up time was 6 months (range, 6-120 months). Seven patients were treated with debridement or antibrucella treatment only. Eleven patients (61%) underwent removal of the prosthesis and were treated with one or two-stage exchange arthroplasty. The mean duration of antibiotic therapy was 5.8 months. There was no relapse of infection.In the absence of loosening of the components of the prosthesis, an attempt to treat Brucella infection medically might be a reasonable choice. One or two-stage exchange arthroplasty could provide successful results without relapse of infection when combined with appropriate antibiotherapy.Level III, therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "Total knee replacement (TKR) is a surgical treatment for final stage gonarthrosis. The lifespan of the prosthetic implants used in TKR surgery is a major interest for the orthopaedic research community.Previously, proper implant alignment of the implants has been advocated for longevity of the TKR surgery. Recently, patient-specific (PSI) instruments have been proposed to improve the mechanical alignment of the TKR by permitting better implant positioning over conventional TKR surgery. The aim of this study is to compare the mechanical alignment results of patients operated with PSIs and conventional instruments.Two groups of 20 patients chosen in a quasi-random manner have been compared in this study. In the first group femoral distal and tibial osteotomies were made by a PSI which was produced by the patients' computed tomography scans. All osteotomies in the control group were made with the TKR set's routine instruments by conventional means. Patients' preoperative and postoperative mechanical femorotibal angles (mFTA), femoral coronal angles (FCA), tibial coronal angles (TCA) were measured and the number of outliers which showed more than 3° of malalignment were counted in both groups for comparison.The average postoperative mFTA was found to be 2.09° for the PSI group and in was found to be 2.84° for the control which was not statistically significant. The comparison of postoperative FCA and TCA also did not show significant difference between the groups. The number of outliers showing more than 3° of malalignment per group were found to be 1 out of 20 (5%) for the PSI group and 7 out of 20 (35%) for the control which was statistically significant.In this study patient-specific instrumentation provided significantly better mechanical alignment compared to conventional TKR for the frequency of outlier cases with malalignment beyond 3°. PSI proved no significant difference when the groups were compared for mFTA, FCA and TCA. Our findings support that PSI may improve TKR alignment by improving the ratio of the outlier patients with marked malalignment.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

The aim of this study was to present the mid-term results of total evolutive shoulder system (TESS; Biomet®), a stemless shoulder prosthesis.The study included 38 consecutive patients (18 men and 20 women; mean age: 66 years; range: 55-81 years) treated with shoulder arthroplasty between 2009 and 2011 with TESS for primary glenohumeral arthritis. Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) was performed in 28 cases (74%), hemi-shoulder arthroplasty (HSA) in 10 (26%). Constant score, active range of motion, patient satisfaction rate, and radiological assessment were analyzed. Mean time of follow-up was 37 months.Constant score improved from 21.8 points (28.6 adjusted for age) preoperatively to 74.1 points (86.6 adjusted for age) postoperatively. Active range of motion increased significantly from the pre- to postoperative status. Eighty-nine percent were very satisfied or satisfied with shoulder replacement surgery. One cemented glenoid was revised due to aseptic loosening. None of the components were found to be loose at the final follow-up. No signs of stress shielding were seen.This study shows promising results of this implant concept in the short- to mid-term. These results are comparable with the results achieved with long-established arthroplasty designs.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to identify the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with osteoporotic hip fractures, investigate the anthropometric differences between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients, and evaluate and compare the surgical outcomes between the two groups.The study included 135 patients (35 men and 100 women; mean age: 74.1 years (range; 25-96)) who received surgical treatment for hip fracture between March 2014 and October 2016 and underwent whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) for diagnosis of sarcopenia was measured using whole-body DEXA. The following data were collected to compare the preoperative details of the sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic groups: SMI, age, sex, type of fracture, type of operation, BMI, obesity, American society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, pre-injury mobility score, BMD, and follow-up period. We compared clinical outcomes, including Harris Hip Score (HSS) and the walking ability at the last follow-up visit and radiologic outcomes, including non-union and the time to union.The average HHS and Parker's mobility score at the last follow-up were 81.7 and 6.9 in the sarcopenic group, and 77.6 and 6.3 in the non-sarcopenic group, respectively (p=0.149 and 0.122). Non-union was identified 0 (0%) in sarcopenic group and 4 (10%) in non-sarcopenic group (p=0.288). The mean union timer of the patients in the sarcopenia group was 4.0 months and that of patients in the non-sarcopenic group was 4.4 months (p=0.210). Multiple regression analysis did not show any significant association between sarcopenia and postoperative surgical outcomes, including HHS, mobility score at the last follow up, non-union, and time to union.Although the present study showed that the prevalence of sarcopenia in hip fracture patients was 45.9% (62/135), there was no clinical association between sarcopenia and postoperative. Based on these results, the clinical impact of sarcopenia may be confined to increased risk of hip fracture occurrence and surgical outcomes of hip fracture may not be affected by sarcopenia.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the effects of kinesio taping (KT) on pain, paresthesia, functional status, and overall health status in patients with symptomatic thoracic outlet syndrome (sTOS).A single-blind placebo-controlled design was employed in this study. The study duration was defined as 12 months. Analyses were performed on 60 patients with sTOS randomly assigned to KT (4 men and 26 women; mean age=33.5 years, range=20-46 years) and control groups (5 men and 25 women; mean age=26 years, range=20-43 years). KT was applied to the KT group three times. The control group received placebo taping. Pain and paresthesia were evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain (10 cm) and VAS paresthesia (10 cm). The upper limb function was assessed using the disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) questionnaire. The overall health status was evaluated based on the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Each assessment was carried out at baseline (t0), posttreatment (t1), and 8 weeks after baseline (t2).In the KT group, except the social isolation domain of the NHP, all outcome measures showed improvement from t0 to t1. At the second follow-up visit (t2), improvements remained visible compared with baseline. However, none of the variables improved from t1 to t2. Otherwise, all measures deteriorated slightly, and the deteriorations in VAS for pain, NHP pain, NHP sleep, and NHP physical abilities were statistically significant (p=0.041, p=0.048, p=0.013, and p=0.016, respectively). In the control group, only VAS for paresthesia and NHP emotional reaction showed improvement over time (p=0.002 and p=0.044, respectively). When changes in outcome measures between the two groups were compared, except NHP emotional reaction and NHP social isolation, median changes (from t0 to t1) were higher in the KT group than in the control group (p<0.05 for all variables). Regarding VAS pain, VAS paresthesia, DASH, and three NHP domains (energy level, pain, and physical abilities), changes from t0 to t2 were also higher in the KT group (p<0.05 for all variables).KT can provide benefits in terms of relieving pain and paresthesia, as well as improving the upper limb function and quality of life in patients with sTOS.Level II, Therapeutic study.",

The study included 448 patients with postmenopausal OP. Patients were randomly assigned into six treatment groups each with a permutation of the treatment sequence (ABC, BCA, etc.) in the crossover phase (3 x 1 week) and randomized to 23 weeks of either the daily flexible (either regimen A, B or C) or fixed timing (only regimen A, B, or C) in the patient's preference phase. Urinary NTX-1 was tested. A total of 433 patients participated in the patient's preference phase (49.7% preferred flexible and 50.3% fixed timing). There was no significant difference between the proportion of responders who were both compliant and persistent in the flexible (54.4%) and fixed regimens (53.7%) (p=0.8803). A significant difference between the flexible and fixed regimens was seen in persistence in favor of the flexible regimen (p=0.0306). There was no significant difference between the flexible and fixed regimens in terms of compliance (p=0.4611). Change in urinary NTX-1 did not show any difference between the two regimens. At the final visit, 51% of patients in the flexible and 55% in the fixed regimen group considered the used risedronate regimen as excellent or very good (p=0.1440). A flexible dosing with daily risedronate appears be a valuable option in terms of compliance and persistence for patients with postmenopausal OP.",

A significant decrease was observed in the values determined at a distance from the radiation source. The rate of radiation determined in the dosimeters decreased when distance from the radiation source increased. During the use of fluoroscopy in orthopedic surgery, the wearing of lead aprons, neck protectors, and glasses, in addition to maintaining a distance from the tube, will reduce the radiation exposure of individuals.",

Femoral width and the distance from the apex of the fibular head to the joint line as well as the distance from the adductor tubercle to the joint line were measured on anteroposterior radiographs. Mean femoral width was 87.2 mm. The average distance from the adductor tubercle to the joint line was 47.9 mm and from the fibular head to the joint line was 20.5 mm. A linear correlation was found between the distance from the adductor tubercle to the joint line and femoral width, with a ratio of 0.55. There was no significant correlation between the distance from the fibular head to the joint line and femoral width. There was a linear correlation between the femoral width and the adductor tubercle-joint line distance irrespective of any factors such as age, gender and height. Therefore, the adductor tubercle can be used as a reliable landmark to determine the joint line level for easy evaluation and measurement during surgery.",

Five rats were used as donors, while 20 rats were separated as PRP group (n=10) and control group (n=10). The Achilles tendons of the rats were cut transversely, and PRP was administered to the PRP group, while the control group received serum physiologically to create the same surgical effect. In previous studies, it was shown that this serum does not affect tendon recovery. Fifteen and 30 days post-treatment, the rats were sacrificed, and their Achilles tendons were extracted and examined histopathologically and biomechanically.Based on the obtained findings, it was observed that the histopathologic Movin and Bonar scores of PRP group on the 15th and 30th day post-treatment were significantly lower than those of the control group (p=0.019, p=0.017, respectively), while no significant difference was found in maximum force (Fmax) values in biomechanical measures on the 15th and 30th day post-treatment.It is thought that PRP use in Achilles tendon ruptures positively affects histopathological recovery in the early period, but that it does not produce the same biomechanical effect. We believe that PRP use for qualified tendon recovery is histopathologically beneficial.",

We compared 2 switch-therapy modalities-enoxaparin to rivaroxaban and enoxaparin to dabigatran-and enoxaparin monotherapy for preventing DVT after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). This was a prospective, non-blinded, randomized controlled study. We selected 180 eligible patients out of 247 patients undergoing TKA or THA. During the preoperative checkup, patients were randomized to receive either enoxaparin (enoxaparin group) or switch-therapy regimens, comprising enoxaparin during hospitalization and rivaroxaban (rivaroxaban group) or dabigatran (dabigatran group) during the outpatient period. All patients were evaluated for DVT using Doppler ultrasonography (USG) 6 weeks postoperatively. The primary efficacy outcome was the prevention of symptomatic or Doppler ultrasonography (USG)-proven DVT, whereas the primary safety outcome was the incidence of bleeding during the DVT-prophylaxis period. Doppler USG at 6 weeks after surgery revealed no signs of DVT in any patient. During the hospitalization period, only 2 major bleeding events were reported (1 [1.6%] in the enoxaparin group and 1 [1.6%] in the dabigatran group). No major bleeding events were reported during the outpatient follow-up period in any group. Differences among the 3 groups regarding bleeding events were not statistically significant (p>0.05).

The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was sacrificed in 24 knees in the PS group and preserved in 14 in the CR group. Mean follow-up was 30.6 months. Patients were submitted to fluoroscopic lateral evaluation for ROM and femoral rollback assessment.Average ROM of the CR group was 106.43±9º and 105.43±11.7º for the PS group (p=0.78). Average femoral rollback was 10.5±9.7 mm and was significantly lower in the CR group (5.8±6.5 mm) than the PS group (13.2±10.5 mm) (p=0.026615). While there was no correlation between the femoral rollback and ROM for CR prostheses (p=0.78 and r=0.8), there was a significant correlation for PR prostheses (p=0.01 and r=0.49) with regression pointing to an increase of 0.545 degrees ROM for each unit of femoral rollback.Despite increase in femoral rollback and its relation with ROM in PS TKA, there were no differences in ROM between CR and PS TKA.",

Clinical and radiological results of patients with ankylosing spondylitis who underwent pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) were evaluated. Twelve (3 female, 9 male) patients who were treated for rigid spinal deformities due to ankylosing spondylitis were evaluated. All patients were treated with the same surgical technique, which included PSO and pedicle screw-rod combination. For radiological results, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, pelvic parameters (pelvic incidence, sacral inclination, pelvic tilt), and the distance between the central sagittal line (CSVL) and the sacrum were measured from pre- and postoperative radiograms. For functional results, SF-36 and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used. Mean age of the patients was 39.8±8.4 years, and mean follow-up was 85.6±39.1 months. Mean angle of lordosis was improved from 6.6°±13.7° preoperatively to 43.8°±8.4° postoperatively (p<0.0001).

Gene Ontology function enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed based on Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery data, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database. Regulatory network was screened based on Encyclopedia of DNA Elements. Molecular Complex Detection was used for sub-network screening. Two sub-networks with highest node degree were integrated with transcriptional regulatory network and KEGG functional enrichment analysis was processed for 2 modules.In total, 401 up- and 196 down-regulated DEGs were obtained. Up-regulated DEGs were involved in inflammatory response, while down-regulated DEGs were involved in cell cycle. PPI network with 2392 protein interactions was constructed. Moreover, 10 genes including Interleukin 6 (IL6) and Aurora B kinase (AURKB) were found to be outstanding in PPI network. There are 214 up- and 8 down-regulated transcription factor (TF)-target pairs in the TF regulatory network. Module 1 had TFs including SPI1, PRDM1, and FOS, while module 2 contained FOSL1. The nodes in module 1 were enriched in chemokine signaling pathway, while the nodes in module 2 were mainly enriched in cell cycle.The screened DEGs including IL6, AGT, and AURKB might be potential biomarkers for gene therapy for OA by being regulated by TFs such as FOS and SPI1, and participating in the cell cycle and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway.",

Each group was also divided into 3 subgroups according to the age of patients (≤ 20 years, 21-64 years, and ≥ 65 years). Data including anatomical region subjected to trauma, place of admission, mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, mode of treatment, type of surgery (if performed), duration of hospitalization (if hospitalized), time elapsed until surgery, and duration of postoperative hospitalization were collected and compared between groups.A total of 361 patients were admitted to the hospital with new trauma during the pandemic, and 708 patients had been admitted during the same period in 2019. The number of admissions decreased significantly by 50.9% (P < 0.001). The mechanism of trauma that occurred with low energy was significantly increased in the pandemic group (73.9%) compared with the control group (47.6%) (P < 0.001). Similarly, the distribution of trauma throughout the skeletal system, especially in the upper extremity, was significantly increased in the pandemic group (49.9% vs. 30.5%, P < 0.001). However, there was no significant decrease in individuals aged above 65 years (P = 0.115). Similar to the general outlook, the 3 groups differed in terms of the mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, and distribution of the anatomical region subjected to trauma (P < 0.001). Majority of the patients received inpatient treatment in all 3 groups (P < 0.001).The results of this study showed that the pandemic dramatically reduced the number of hospital admissions related to orthopedic trauma. The rate of low energy, upper extremity traumas that occurred indoors increased during the pandemic period compared with that of the previous year. However, the rate of hospital admissions did not differ in the ≥65-year-old subgroup during the pandemic period compared with that of the previous year.",

Fifty patients who were scheduled for a first elective THA procedure were recruited and were equally allocated into one of two groups: intervention and control groups. While all patients received the routine preparation for the procedure, the intervention group underwent an additional structured physical therapy education session. Functional status was evaluated using The Oxford Hip Score (OHS) preoperatively and 6 weeks after the operation. Length of Hospital Stay (LOS) was recorded. State anxiety was measured by the state-anxiety portion of the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire preoperatively and on the second postoperative day. Gait and balance abilities were assessed using Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) test on the second postoperative day. Pain at rest and during weight-bearing was measured by a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) on the postoperative second day. Satisfaction rates were evaluated by the NRS 6 weeks after the operation.Forty-seven patients completed the study. The intervention group consisted of 24 patients (10 males, 14 females; mean age = 64.29 ± 6.7 years), and the control group consisted of 23 patients (7 males, 16 females; mean age = 65.91 ± 10.19 years). The mean postoperative OHS was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (39.04 ± 3.99 vs 28.04 ± 7.23, P < 0.001). Both groups increased their functional abilities 6 weeks postoperatively; however, the intervention group showed a greater increase than the control group (P = 0.001). No significant difference was found in the LOS between the control (2.83 ± 0.71) and intervention groups (2.71 ± 0.62) (P = 0.551). Patients in the intervention group exhibited lower rates of anxiety two days after the operation compared with the controls (17.75 ± 6.50 vs 27.70 ± 10.32, P < 0.001). The intervention group showed higher postoperative POMA scores compared to the control group (19.67 ± 3.89 vs 15.39 ± 5.85, P = 0.005). Although no significant difference was observed in resting pain between groups (P = 0.105), the intervention group reported a lower pain intensity while walking compared to the control group (5.04 ± 1.68 vs 6.39 ± 2.62, P = 0.041). While both groups reported high satisfaction rates 6 weeks postoperatively, patients in the intervention group were more satisfied than those in the control group (9.67 ± 0.91 vs 8.35 ± 1.82, P = 0.003).A structured interactive preoperative physical therapy education program for patients undergoing a THA may reduce anxiety, generate a faster recovery, reduce pain, and promote higher satisfaction. We recommend this program for routine use.Level II, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the functional outcomes and complications of external fixation (EF) versus open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in the treatment of complex tibial plateau fractures.Based on a comprehensive search of major databases through PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 19 studies comparing EF versus ORIF in treatment of complex tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker V-VI/ OTA C1, C2, and C3) were included in the studies. There was one randomized controlled trial, two prospective comparative studies, 14 retrospective comparative studies, and two conference papers. From these studies, the data regarding functional and surgical outcomes as well as complications were obtained and pooled to conduct a comparison between the two methods of treatment.1191 tibial plateau fractures were determined by the systematic review. Of those fractures, 543 were treated using EF, and 648 were treated using ORIF with plate and screws. All the studies included the young patients with traumatic tibial plateau fractures with mean ages from 40 to 60 years. The analysis of pooled data revealed significantly better functional outcome in patients operated with EF (standard mean difference [SMD] = 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04-0.55, P = 0.02, I2= 0%). However, according to categorical functional outcomes, no significant differences were found (OR 0.80, 95%CI: 0.47, 1.34, P=0.39, I2= 31%). The range of movement at the knee joint was significantly better in patients treated by EF (mean difference [MD] = 7.86, 95%CI = 3.56 -12.17, P = 0.0003). The surgical time in the EF group was significantly shorter compared to the ORIF group (MD = -52.11, 95%CI = -99.62-(-4.60), P = 0.03). Similarly, the intraoperative blood loss was significantly lesser in the EF group (MD = -341.53, 95%CI = -528.18- (-154.88), P = 0.0003). Although the superficial infection was more frequent in the EF group (odds ratio [OR] = 3.22, P = 0.0002), there were no differences in the deep infection and overall infection rates. Also, there were no differences in reoperation rate, knee stiffness, compartment syndrome, and venous thromboembolism. The radiographic osteoarthritis was more common in the EF group (OR = 1.56, P = 0.04); however, there was no difference in the need for total knee arthroplasty between the two treatment modalities.EF provides better functional outcomes and range of motion compared to ORIF in the treatment of complex tibial plateau fractures. With shorter surgical time and lesser intraoperative blood loss, EF can be considered as a definite treatment method in open injuries, polytrauma patients, and chronically morbid patients who cannot withstand prolonged surgery.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of dorsal plating versus volar plating with limited dorsal open reduction in the management of AO type C3 distal radius fractures with impacted articular fragments.Thirty patients who underwent dorsal plating (Group A) (14 females, 16 males; mean age = 56.8 ± 10.1 years) and 28 who underwent volar plating with limited dorsal open reduction (Group B) (12 females, 16 males; mean age = 55.6 ± 17.7 years) for type C3 distal radius fractures with impacted articular fragments between 2006 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The mean follow-up was 14.5 ± 3.2 months in group A and 13.2 ± 2.4 months in group B. The articular step-off, articular gap and joint penetration by screws on the computed tomography scans were used for radiologic evaluation. The functional outcomes were evaluated with range of motion, grip power, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, and Mayo wrist score.No significant difference was found in the step-off distance at 1 year after surgery between the two groups (P < 0.05). The ranges of extension, rotation, and radial and ulnar deviations did not differ between the groups. However, group B had a significantly higher range of flexion in the wrist joint than Group A (P = 0.010). The grip power, DASH score, and Mayo wrist score did not also differ between the groups. Implant removal owing to any discomfort at the operative site was performed in 15 patients (63%) in Group A and 7 patients (28%) in Group B.Similar clinical results can be obtained by both dorsal plating and volar plating with limited dorsal open reduction in treating type C3 distal radius fractures with impacted articular fragments. However, volar plating with limited dorsal open reduction can provide better wrist flexion with a low incidence of complications associated with implantation.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to assess the contributions and global impact of Turkish orthopedics and traumatology research published in high-impact international journals over the past decade (2014-2023). By examining article types, citation metrics, journal impact factors, and author a!liations, the aim was to highlight publication trends, strengths, and areas needing improvement within Turkish orthopedic research. Methods: Using the Web of Science database, keywords were searched under journal categories including \"Orthopedics,\" \"Orthopedics, Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine,\" and \"Sports Sciences.\" Articles from the top 40 orthopedic journals indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded were identified and selected based on their 2022 impact factors. Articles published between January 2014 and December 2023 with first authors a!liated with a Turkish institution were included. Citation density was calculated by dividing the total number of citations by the number of years since publication. Data extracted included publication type, citation count, citation density, research methodology, author a!liations, and institutional contributions. Results: Out of 70 279 articles published globally, 425 orthopedic articles with Turkish first authorship were identified in the selected journals. Most articles were clinical (88.7%), with the most frequent article types being case presentations (31.3%), retrospective cohort studies (17.9%), and laboratory research (11.3%). The least common types were expert opinions, epidemiological studies, and meta-analyses. The majority of articles appeared in Spine Journal (34.6%) and Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (27.3%), with no articles published in the highest-ranked journal (British Journal of Sports Medicine). Spine surgery was the leading subfield (29.9%), followed by sports, shoulder, and elbow surgery (22.6%) and reconstructive surgery (16%). Orthopedic specialists comprised 56% of first authors, with multicenter studies representing 65.4% of the articles. Public institutions accounted for 80.1% of published articles, while private institutions contributed 19.9%. A total of 356 articles were cited 8349 times, with a median citation number of 9 per article. Mean citation density was highest in meta-analysis (8.5 citation/year), epidemiological studies (8.3 citation/year), and randomized controlled trials (7.8 citation/ year), while lowest in case presentations (0.3 citation/year), expert opinions (0.4 citation/year), and laboratory research (2.2 citation/year). Conclusion: Turkish orthopedic research has maintained a significant presence in top orthopedic journals, mostly through clinical studies, especially in spinal and sports injury subfields. Despite high publication volume, citation impact remains relatively lower. Future e\"orts should encourage higher-impact study designs, international collaborations, and standardized research evaluations to enhance the global influence of Turkish orthopedic literature.

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to undertake a comprehensive review of malpractice litigation cases involving limb amputation surgery, with a subsequent evaluation of the cases accepted as malpractice. Methods: The retrospective, descriptive study evaluated cases of alleged medical malpractice involving extremity amputations sent to the Medical Council. When medical error decisions were made by the board, the full range of allegations was subjected to evaluation, including issues related to consent, diagnosis, and treatment errors. A review was conducted of all closed legal cases pertaining to medical malpractice in the field of extremity amputation. A comprehensive dataset was collated, encompassing detailed information on each case. This included age, sex, and the anatomical location of the amputation (lower or upper extremity). Additionally, the amputation mechanism, the duration of hospitalization, and the time interval between surgery and the initiation of legal proceedings were investigated. Results: The study encompassed 290 medical litigations with a mean age of 39.6 ± 20 years. Of the participants, 213 (73.4%) were male, and 77 (26.6%) were female. Amputation surgery was conducted on the lower extremity in 191 patients (65.9%), the upper extremity in 97 patients (33.4%), and both upper and lower extremities in 2 patients (0.7%). The reasons for amputation surgery were classified as secondary to disease in 143 patients (49.3%) and traumatic injury in 147 patients (50.7%). Fifty-nine cases were accepted as medical malpractice. No significant di!erences were found between cases with and without medical malpractice, or among age groups, genders, extremities, lengths of hospital stays, levels of amputation, whether cases were secondary to trauma or disease. Conclusion: It is evident that there is a higher prevalence of malpractice in cases of traumatic injury; therefore, clinicians should exercise greater caution and diligence in the management of these cases.

A common orthopedic consequence in CP is hip dislocation, with an incidence ranging from 15% to 30%. This study aimed to assess physiotherapists' (PTs) awareness and knowledge of hip dislocation in CP and identify knowledge gaps in this field. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered to PT working in healthcare institutions across Türkiye. The online anonymous survey, hosted on Google Forms, received responses from 128 PTs. It included questions related to the diagnosis, treatment approaches, and clinical experience concerning hip dislocation/subluxation. The survey consisted of 3 types of questions: demographic questions, yes/no knowledge questions, and opinion-suggestion questions. Results: The majority of PTs participating in this study work with pediatric patients. Physiotherapists had basic knowledge about hip dislocation although we observed significant gaps in areas related to routine screening programs and advanced treatment modalities. PTs incorrectly answered 3 out of 8 knowledge-based questions. The majority emphasized the importance of early diagnosis and treatment and expressed a need for more education and awareness programs. Conclusion: Physiotherapist provided important opinion-suggestion insights. The findings indicate a need for improved education and training for PT concerning hip dislocation in children with CP. We believe that the most appropriate screening method for Türkiye is to establish a screening program with a multidisciplinary structure formed between pediatric orthopedists, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists (PM&R), PT, and family physicians (FPs).

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients treated between 2014 and 2023 who underwent arthroscopic global capsular release combined with rotator cu! repair. Preoperative and postoperative outcomes, including range of motion (ROM), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores, and Constant scores, were assessed with a minimum follow-up of six months. Results: Among 69 patients undergoing capsular release, 29 patients (20 females, 9 males; mean age: 56 years) received concurrent rotator cu! repair. The mean follow-up period was 14 months. Most tears involved the supraspinatus (25 full-thickness, 4 partial bursal-side). Complications were minimal, with only two diabetic patients displaying persistent ROM limitations and there were no re-tear in followup period. Statistically significant di!erences seen in ROM, VAS and Constant scores, VAS decreased from 7.1 to 1.2, Constant score improved from 37.5 to 72.3 (P < .05). Conclusion: Simultaneous arthroscopic management of adhesive capsulitis and rotator cu! tears provides favorable clinical and functional outcomes with lower complication rates compared to current literature, supporting its value as an e!ective treatment option.

Methods: This study included 572 patients with low-energy proximal femur fractures who required surgical treatment. Patients were categorized into two groups based on anticoagulation therapy use. The following data was collected and compered between the groups: time from hospitalization to surgery, hospital length of stay, percent changes in hemoglobin and other post-operative complications: death, cardiac complications, sepsis, deep venous thrombosis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, surgical site infection, pressure ulcers, acute kidney injury and delirium. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to analyze possible confounders. Results: The median age of study participants was 83 years. 78.2% being female. Anticoagulation therapy was used by 19.9% of patients, predominantly non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants. Patients receiving anticoagulants experienced significantly longer hospital stays (median 9 vs. 7 days; P < .05) and surgical delays (median 3 vs. 2 days; P < .0001) compared to those without anticoagulation. Complication rates and hemoglobin level changes did not di!er significantly among the groups (P > .05). Multivariate analysis identified age, time to surgery, and hospital length of stay as independent predictors of 30-day postoperative complications, with age and hospital stay also significantly associated with 30-day mortality. Conclusion: Anticoagulation therapy did not directly increase 30-day postoperative complications or mortality but was associated with surgical delays and prolonged hospital stays, which negatively impacted outcomes. Delayed surgery and extended hospitalization emerged as key risk factors. These findings underscore the clinical importance of minimizing surgical delays in anticoagulated patients to improve postoperative outcomes. Level of Evidence: Level II, Prognostic study.",

It further examined the influence of mentorship and faculty involvement on surgical training, academic career interest, and subspecialty decisions. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among orthopedic residents across Türkiye between February 6-18, 2025. A total of 849 residents participated, covering all provinces with orthopedic training centers. Data on institutional characteristics, educational methods, surgical exposure, mentorship, and residents' self-assessed competencies were collected using an online questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 29.1 years (range: 23-35), and 95.2% were male. The mean residency year was 2.7. The primary outcomes included surgical exposure, self-assessed competence, academic interest, and mentorship impact. Results: Among participants, 8.13% reported no theoretical education, with peer-based learning (52.1%) being the dominant method. Faculty-led instruction was limited (24.6%). A mentor figure was present in 68.8% and was significantly associated with higher selfassessed competence in theoretical knowledge, surgical skills, and complication management (P < .0001). Mentored residents had greater academic interest (41.1% vs. 33.2%, P=.011) and clearer subspecialty goals (27.9% vs. 18.9%, P=.017). Only 45.7% of the fifth-year residents rated themselves as highly competent. Higher monthly operating room days and case volumes were significantly correlated with greater self-perceived competence (P=.0001). Conclusion: This study reveals substantial disparities in surgical training, faculty engagement, and mentorship across orthopedic residency programs in Türkiye. Structured mentorship initiatives, improved surgical exposure, and faculty-driven education are essential to enhance residents' professional development and preparedness for independent practice.",

Fifteen tubes forming the test group were subjected to low-intensity sound waves by the Exogen device for 20 minutes. The remaining 15 tubes were untreated as controls. The two groups were then compared with respect to colony number, antibiotic susceptibility, and genotypic properties. The tubes were examined histologically by electron microscopy.The test tubes treated with sound waves showed a significantly lower number of bacteria colonies compared to the control tubes (p<0.001). The two groups were similar with respect to antibiotic susceptibility and genotypic properties. Bacterial cell wall structure in the control group was of normal appearance, whereas partial destruction and break-up were observed in test samples. Bacterial cell wall thickness was significantly higher in the test group compared to the control group (41.54 nm and 24.27 nm, respectively; p<0.001).Low-intensity sound waves may be beneficial as a prophylactic measure to prevent infections in primary orthopedic operations and as an adjuvant therapy for infected nonunions.",

The mean follow-up was 27.2 months (range 24 to 38 months).Pre- and postoperative (24th month) evaluations showed that the mean VAS score and the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index decreased from 3.4+/-0.4 to 1.2+/-0.6, and from 33+/-3 to 11+/-6, respectively, with an increase in the Harris hip score (from 54 to 92). Preoperatively, two patients were Steinberg I-B, four were I-C, and three were II-A. Finally, all the patients were stage 0 except for one patient who regressed to I-A. None of the patients exhibited femoral head collapse or narrowing of the coxofemoral joint space.Autologous mononuclear bone marrow cell implantation relieves articular pain, prevents the progression of osteonecrosis, and hence subchondral fractures. Therefore, it may be treatment of choice particularly in stage I-II avascular necrosis of the femoral head.",

Intra-articular levels of collagenase, TNF-alpha, and TIMP-1 were measured using appropriate activity assay and immunoassay kits in synovial fluid samples obtained intraoperatively and during arthrocentesis. The mean time from ACL injury to surgical repair was 21+/-10 months (range 1 to 72 months). Arthrocentesis was performed in a mean of 18 hours (range 12 to 36 hours) following ACL repair.Measurements in synovial fluid samples obtained intra- and postoperatively yielded 1.49+/-0.06 ng/ml and 1.45+/-0.05 ng/ml for collagenase, 12+/-5 ng/ml and 22+/-9.5 ng/ml for TIMP-1, and 10.4+/-7.1 pr/ml and 14.11+/-6.1 pr/ml for TNF-alpha, respectively. Postoperative changes in the levels of collagenase (p=0.098) and TNF-alpha (p=0.069) were not significant, whereas increase in the TIMP-1 level was significant (p=0.026).This study showed elevated levels of TNF-alpha, collagenase, and TIMP-1 due to the presence of ruptured ACL. Our findings showed how these levels changed in the acute postoperative period.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the radiologic and clinical outcomes of conservative treatment for thoracolumbar compression fractures.Forty-three patients (28 males, 15 females; mean age 39 years; range 24 to 54 years) were treated conservatively for 47 thoracolumbar compression fractures. All the patients were assessed by plain radiograms and computed tomography. According to the Denis classification, there were eight type A, 20 type B, 12 type C, and seven type D fractures. Involvement was at L1 in 30, L2 in five, and T12 in 12 fractures. There were no neurological deficits. Treatment involved use of a body cast for two months, followed by a thoracolumbosacral orthosis for four months. Radiographically, local kyphosis angle and sagittal index were measured before treatment, after casting, and at the final follow-ups. Pain and functional scales proposed by Denis et al. were also utilized. The mean follow-up was 7.5 years (range 6 to 11 years).The mean local kyphosis angle and sagittal index were measured as 12.6 and 13.7 degrees before treatment, and 5.9 and 7.0 degrees after casting, respectively (p<0.05). However, both did not differ significantly from the baseline at the final measurements (12.7 and 13.9, respectively; p>0.05). The mean pain and functional scores were 1.4 and 1.6, respectively. Four patients had moderate to severe back pain despite mean kyphosis angles of 12 (baseline), 13.5 (after casting), and 14.8 (final). Two patients required substitution of the body cast for orthosis due to excessive sweating, and three patients received local treatment for skin problems secondary to the use of orthosis.If the kyphosis angle is less than 30 degrees, compression fractures are supposed to be stable to be treated conservatively with satisfactory clinical results. Functional results seem to be unaffected from the fact that casting does not improve radiographic parameters in the long-term.",

We evaluated the effect of certain prognosis-related proteins on survival of patients with osteosarcoma.Data from 45 patients (24 males, 21 females) who were treated and followed-up for osteosarcoma were reviewed. Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 41 patients underwent extremity saving surgery, and four patients underwent amputation. The most frequent localization was the lower end of the femur (n=23, 51.1%), followed by the upper end of the tibia (n=10, 22.2%). Three patients had metastasis on admission. Surgical resection samples were retrieved from the pathology archive and analyzed immunohistochemically for the expression of p-glycoprotein p170, p53, heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27), HSP90, and nm23. The effect of these proteins on prognosis and survival was assessed with survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method. The mean follow-up was 49.7 months (range 6 to 185 months).Three patients with metastasis on admission died within five years due to pulmonary metastasis. New metastases developed in 29 patients. Total 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 60% and 43%, respectively. The corresponding disease-free survival rates were 41% and 24%. Five-year survival was 29% in patients who developed metastasis. Among clinical factors, survival was influenced only by the presence of metastasis on admission (p=0.044). Five-year and 10-year survival rates were significantly different between patients with and without p53 positivity (p=0.04), while the other proteins were not significantly associated with survival.Our data suggest that p53 may be used as a prognostic marker in osteosarcoma due to its significant association with survival.",

This biomechanical study was designed to compare the pullout strengths of two different revision techniques.Fourteen lumbar vertebrae obtained from four calves (mean age 15 months) were divided into two groups equal in number. Monoaxial 6.0-mm pedicle screws were inserted into the right pedicles, and axial pullout testing was performed at a rate of 10 mm/min and failure strengths were recorded. Revision was performed with the same-sized pedicle screws reinforced with polymethylmethacrylate in group 1, and with 7.0-mm expansive pedicle screws in group 2, and pullout testing was repeated to record maximum revision pullout strengths.The mean pullout strengths recorded before and after revision were significantly different in both groups, being 2,162.9+/-718.5 N and 2,794.3+/-979.2 N in group 1 (p=0.041) and 2,605.0+/-487.6 N and 3,327.1+/-640.8 N in group 2 (p=0.012), respectively. However, the mean pullout strengths recorded before and after revision did not differ significantly between the two groups (p>0.05).Our results showed that expansive pedicle screws 1 mm larger in diameter provide similar pullout strengths to those of same-sized, polymethylmethacrylate-reinforced screws in revision of pedicle screw fixation, suggesting that they can be preferred with the additional advantages of ease of application and avoiding risks for pedicle fracture and cement leakage.",

    "abstract": "Heterotopic ossification which may develop following elbow injuries or elbow surgery may result in complete loss of elbow functions. We evaluated the results of surgical treatment for ankylosis of the elbow due to posttraumatic heterotopic ossification. The study included seven patients (6 males, 1 female; mean age 36 years; range 23 to 55 years) who developed heterotopic ossification and ankylosis of the elbow joint following surgical treatment of high-energy fractures in the circumference of the elbow. Two patients had comminuted olecranon fractures and elbow luxation, and five patients had comminuted intra-articular distal humeral fractures. Three patients had open fractures. Involvement was in the right elbow in two patients, and in the left elbow in five patients. One patient was monitored and treated in the intensive care unit for head trauma for 22 days. Initially, six patients were treated with plate osteosynthesis and one patient with tension band wiring. Foci of heterotopic ossification were detected on the radiographs taken after a mean of 24 days (range 20 to 32 days) following surgical treatment of fractures. The patients were followed-up with conventional radiography and scintigraphy for a mean of 11 months (range 7 to 15 months) before surgical treatment, during which functional loss in elbow joint movements deteriorated and ankylosis developed. All the patients had Hastings type IIIC ankylosis and poor Mayo elbow performance scores (mean score 50.7). A posterior incision was used in three patients, and a double-column incision was used in four patients. At surgery, the ulnar nerve and the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were preserved, and a posterolateral capsular release, removal of heterotopic ossification, purging of the olecranon fossa, and resection of the tip of the olecranon were performed. After completion of capsular release, cartilage pathologies were evaluated. Four patients were found to have no definite cartilage damage, whereas in three patients the joint cartilage was seriously damaged. At final controls, the patients were assessed with the Mayo elbow performance score. The mean follow-up period was 23.4 months (range 10 to 36 months). In all cases, the range of motion and stability of the elbow joint were controlled and were found to be complete and stable at the end of the operation. At final controls, the Mayo elbow performance scores were good in three patients, moderate in one patient, and poor in three patients. All the patients with a poor elbow score had severe joint cartilage damage intraoperatively. Patients who develop heterotopic ossification and ankylosis of the elbow following trauma or elbow surgery may benefit from removal of heterotopic ossification foci and elbow relaxation procedures provided that there is not severe damage to the articular cartilage.",

Eight patients (4 females, 4 males) who were initially treated with a diagnosis of ankle distortion due to trauma between 2004 and 2008 were included in the study. Since there were no fractures in the initial radiographs reported by radiologists, conservative treatment was applied. However, the pain and swelling around the ankle were sustained and advanced imaging studies revealed talus fracture. All patients were evaluated with the scoring system of American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS). Mean age of the patients was 22.37 years (range 20-40 years) at the initial fracture diagnosis. The talar neck fracture was diagnosed with computed tomography (CT) in 1 patient and with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the remaining 7 patients. Mean follow-up time was 6 months (range 3-8 months), and mean AOFAS score at last follow-up was 93.7 (range 80-100). Talus fractures can lead to serious complications because of its anatomical localization. Areas with edema, tenderness or pain should be defined on physical examination, and deep palpation should be applied on the lateral aspect of the talar neck. If there is pain in this area at late examination and no fracture was reported with conventional radiographs, the possibility of missed talar fracture should be considered and the patient should be evaluated with CT or MRI.",

    "abstract": "First MTP joint fusion is a reliable procedure for advanced arthritis for the first MTP joint. There are many techniques described. The purpose of our study is to report clinical, radiological, functional outcomes and complications of first metatarsophalangeal joint fusion with hand preparation of the joint and fixation with two orthogonal locking plates without a compression screw.32 feet in 26 consecutive patients under went first metatarsophalangeal joint fusion with above technique. There were 23 women and 3 men. Mean age was 64 years and mean follow-up was 49 months. 21 patients had osteoarthritis, 10 had rheumatoid arthritis and one had psoriatic arthritis. Clinical, radiological, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Score and Foot and Ankle Disability Index clinical rating scales were used for evaluation.Fusion was achieved in 27 feet. The incidence of radiological non-union was 15.7%. Mean AOFAS score improved from 37.1 to 80.7 (p < 0.0001) and mean FADI score improved from 40.3 to 86.9 postoperatively (p < 0.0001). Two patients with osteoarthritis and three with Rheumatoid arthritis did not unite. Four of these patients were managing hence revision surgery was not carried out but had low AOFAS and FADI scores. One patient with symptomatic non-union declined further surgery. One patient needed plate removal for a low grade infection and reoperation rate was 3.1%.In our experience, first metatarsophalangeal joint arthrodesis using two orthogonal two hole plates without a compression screw is associated with a higher non-union rate in our cohort hence we do not recommend this technique.Level IV, therapeutic study.",

Data from patients were recorded and analyzed.All dislocated shoulders were successfully reduced using the chair method without any complication or difficulty. Thirty patients had first time dislocation and 44 patients had previous dislocation. Mean duration between dislocation and reduction was 3 (range: 1 to 6) hours. Mean duration of reduction was 13.9 (range: 3 to 45) seconds.The chair method is an effective and successful reduction method for shoulder dislocation.

The experimental group rabbits (n=10) underwent daily 2.5 ATA HBO therapy for 2 hours for 20 days and the control group rabbits (n=10) did not receive any corresponding treatment. Osteoblastic activity was evaluated with bone scintigraphy on days 30 and 90. Fracture healing was evaluated by plain radiographs on days 30 and 90.On Day 30, radiological scores were statistically similar in both groups (p=0.167). However, on Day 90, the experimental group displayed significantly higher radiological scores (p<0.001). Osteoblastic activity was also higher in the experimental group on both scintigraphic assessments (p=0.005 and p=0.001).The results of this study suggest that HBO can be used as a supplementary therapy in the management of atrophic tibial nonunion.",

The study retrospectively reviewed 4 patients (4 males; average age: 16 years; range: 14 to 19 years) who underwent osteotomy and distraction osteogenesis to treat radial shortening and severe wrist deformity due to neglected distal radius physeal arrest. Mean interval between trauma and surgical intervention was 8 (range: 4 to 12) years and mean follow-up time was 83 (range: 40 to 126) months. Patients were evaluated with radiographic measurements (shortening and lengthening ratio, radioulnar joint leveling, distal radioulnar joint congruency), objective functional measurements (grip and pinch strength, range of motion measurements [ROM]) and subjective functional measurements (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] questionnaire and Mayo wrist score). Statistical analysis was made using the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test. Radiographic measurements were obtained preoperatively and at the final follow-up. The mean shortening ratio of the radius was 14.6% (range: 9.3% to 18.7%) and mean lengthening ratio was 15.9% (range: 13.2% to 18.3%). Normal distal radioulnar joint leveling and distal radioulnar congruency resembling a joint was established in all but one patient with four millimeters of ulna plus deformity. According to the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test, there was no statistical difference in grip and pinch power, ROM on flexion/extension, and ulnar/radial deviation axis between the operated and non-operated sides. There was statistically significant pronation/supination restriction between the operated and non-operated sides (p<0.04). Mean DASH score was 2.07 (range: 0.0 to 8.3) and the mean Mayo wrist score was 89 (range: 75 to 100) points. According to the Mayo wrist score, results were excellent in one patient, good in two patients, and satisfactory in one patient. The use of distal metaphyseal osteotomy and Ilizarov distraction osteogenesis is a viable treatment method for neglected physeal fractures of the distal radius as it establishes acceptable deformity correction and a functional wrist joint.",

Information regarding age, gender, fracture site and history of post-fracture BMD testing and osteoporosis treatment, including data reporting experiences of attending orthopedists (young: <10, senior: >10 years of experience) were recorded.Of the 265 patients (175 female, 90 male), 259 (97.7%) patients had low-energy fractures and 6 (2.3%) suffered high-energy fractures. Of 259 low-energy fractures, 99 (38.2%) underwent BMD testing and had mean total T-scores of -2.04±1.01 (proximal-femur) and -2.12±1.27 (lumbar-spine). Only one high-energy fracture patient (16.7%) underwent BMD testing, with a T-score of -1.1 (proximal-femur) and -2.7 (lumbar-spine). Eighty-six (32.5%) patients (85 low-energy fractures; 1 high-energy fracture) with diagnosis of osteopenia/osteoporosis from BMD testing were treated with calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates. Bone mineral density testing was significantly higher in low-energy fracture patients who were treated by a young orthopedist, a common fracture site (proximal-femur, distal-radius, vertebrae) or were female (p<0.05).Bone mineral density investigation and treatment rates are currently suboptimal. The current gap in adequate care necessitates multidisciplinary intervention in order to lessen the incidence of future fractures, particularly in patients over the age of 45.",

All patients presented with a progressive, slow-growing mass that was associated with thumb extension weakness in 1 case, and brachialgia-like symptoms in 1 case. Plain radiographs showed a juxtacortical mass in all cases and irregular ossification in 3 cases. In all cases, marginal excision was performed and no clinical recurrence was observed after a mean follow-up of 16 months.Parosteal lipomas are uncommon tumors that can be diagnosed with their characteristic radiological features. Parosteal lipomas occurring in the proximal radius may easily cause paralysis of the posterior interosseous nerve or muscle weakness.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

All surgeries were performed via a ventral approach. Based on the type of surgery the patients received, they were divided into 3 groups: group 1 consisted of 49 patients who received multilevel corpectomies and fusion with strut iliac bone graft and plates; group 2 consisted of 26 patients who received multilevel corpectomies and fusion with titanium expanding cage and plating; group 3 consisted of 39 patients who received multilevel corpectomies and fusion using titanium mesh with autologous bone graft and anterior plating.Decompression of the cervical spinal cord and grafting with plate fixation via a ventral approach demonstrated a high rate of improvement in neurological function with minimal complications. Fusion was documented radiologically in all cases. Eighty-three patients experienced a partial improvement and 41 had a complete recovery according to Nurick's myelopathy grading. Sixty-two patients were ranked as excellent, 48 as good, 4 as fair; unsatisfactory outcome was related to donor site complications.Spinal decompression and fusion with titanium cages and plates appears to be a safe and effective alternative in patients with cervical spinal myelopathy.Level IV, therapeutic study.",

The reduction was achieved through intraosseous window to minimize soft tissue stripping in all patients and structural allograft at metaphyseal diaphyseal junction was used aggressively to resist varus force. Group 1 consisted of 32 patients aged 70 or older (14 males and 18 females; mean age: 77.8 ± 5.1), while Group 2 consisted of 38 patients younger than 70 (16 males and 22 females; mean age: 58.2 ± 9.3). The groups were compared for their clinical and radiological outcomes.There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes by Oxford score (54.8 ± 2.7 vs 56.6 ± 3.4, p = 0.13) and ASES score (89.7 ± 5.7 vs 90.8 ± 8.2, p = 0.68). Two groups had similar radiological outcomes regarding neck shaft angle, greater tip height and offset. However, group 2 had better final shoulder forward elevation (162.6 ± 8.7 vs 135.4 ± 14.7ß, p < 0.05) and shorter duration to achieve maximal range of motion (4.37 ± 2.37 vs 8.14 ± 3.25 months, p < 0.05) than group 1. Two groups had similar complication rates (9.4% vs 7.9%). All the complications were related to greater tuberosity including mal-reduction and avulsion.With the prerequisite of good alignment with robust medial cortical support and untouched soft tissue over medial metaphysis area via intra-osseous reduction, comminution of proximal humeral fracture can achieve satisfactory result and low complication rate by osteosynthesis with locking plate system, regardless of age. In addition, we suggested to use structural bone graft for comminuted medial cortex fracture with multiple fragments or bony defect more than 2 cm.Level III Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to compare the isometric strength and endurance of shoulder abduction and internal and external rotation between operated shoulders and nonoperated, contralateral shoulders of patients who underwent reverse shoulder replacement due to unilateral rotator cuff tear arthropathy.With a diagnosis of cuff tear arthropathy, 41 consecutive patients (mean age of 70.8 years; age range, 57 to 84; 36 females, 5 males) who underwent unilateral reverse shoulder arthroplasty were reviewed based on functional and radiological data. In all cases, cuff tear arthropathy was unilateral and contralateral shoulder was asymptomatic, with normal shoulder function. The average length of follow-up was 34 months (range of 12-67). To assess patients' functional level, the Constant score and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (the Quick-DASH) outcome measure were used preoperatively and at the final examination. The primary outcomes of the present study were measurement of isokinetic strength and endurance of shoulder abduction and internal and external rotation using an isokinetic evaluator.Patients exhibited marked improvement in functional level as reflected by a significant increase in the mean Constant score from 38 preoperatively to 65 at the final follow-up (p = 0.03). The functional improvement was supported by a decrease in the mean Quick-DASH from 64 preoperatively to 26 at the final follow-up (p = 0.018). In the comparison of the isokinetic strength and endurance of shoulder abduction, no statistical difference was observed between operated shoulders and contralateral shoulders (p > 0.05). However; the strength and endurance of internal and external rotation were lower in operated shoulders than in contralateral shoulders (p < 0.05). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in comparisons of the durability of abduction (p > 0.05); however, the durability of internal and external rotation were significantly lower in operated shoulders (p < 0.05).In terms of durability and strength of abduction, similar results with the unaffected shoulder may be accomplished; nonetheless, the surgeon should be aware that durability and strength of rotation would be weak.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate our treatment algorithm and results in revision surgery of malunited tibial plateau fracture after failure of initial treatment.Our revision strategy was as follows: First, we determined the presence of any infection. Second, we determined whether the patient required total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Third, based on the characteristics of the tibial plateau fracture malunion, patients underwent one of the following surgical methods to achieve reduction: original fracture line osteotomy, tibial tubercle + original fracture line osteotomy, fibula head + original fracture line osteotomy, and metaphyseal open window reduction rod technique. The results was assessed with healing time, Rasmussen score, knee range of motion and complication rates.A total of 25 patients 16 men and 9 women; Mean age: 47.4 years (range: 35-63 years) underwent tibial plateau fracture revision operation. The time interval between the two surgeries was 2-24 months. The follow-up time was 12-30 months, and the operation time was 120-300 min. All patients received bone union at the last follow-up. The healing time was 3-6 months. The postoperative Rasmussen score was 19-29 (mean 23.8) compared with 14.4 points before the operation (p < 0.05). The postoperative knee joint activity was 60-110° (mean 95.0°), compared with 57.8° before the operation (p < 0.05). Six patients still had a 2-mm collapse on the articular surface, and 4 patients still had slight valgus (<5°). Except for 2 TKA cases, fracture reduction was excellent in 15 cases and good in 8 cases, with a good rate of 100%. Superficial wound infections occurred in 3 patients.Because revision of tibial plateau fracture malunion caused by failure of initial treatment is difficult, it is necessary to create a detailed surgical plan before the operation. Satisfactory clinical effects can be obtained if the correct revision strategy is used. The key to success is adopting a proper revision strategy according to the unique characteristics of the patient's tibial plateau fracture malunion.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

All patients were treated by intralesional extended curettage using high-speed burr, electrocauterization of the cavity, and filling the defect with PMMA. No additional local adjuvants were used. The mean follow-up period was 47 months (range=24-96). The tumors were graded according to the radiological classification system described by Campanacci. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score (MSTS) preoperatively, one year postoperatively, and at the final follow-up. Postoperative complications and recurrence rates were recorded.Twenty-nine tumors were located in the distal femur, 23 in the proximal tibia, nine in the distal radius, five in the proximal humerus, five in the pelvis, three in the proximal fibula, two in the distal ulna, two in the distal tibia, and one in the second metatarsal. According to Campanacci classification, 37 tumors were grade III, 32 grade II, and 10 grade I. The mean MSTS score was 46.1% (range 40.2 to 71.4%) preoperatively, 91.7% (range 73.3% to 100%) one year postoperatively, and 86.3 % (range 66.2% to 96,1%) at the final follow-up. The overall complication rate was 7.6%; which included local tumor recurrence in four patients, superficial wound infection in one, and deep wound infection in another. The recurrence rate was 5.1% (4 patients). Recurrent tumors were located at the distal femur in three patients and proximal tibia in one.With satisfactory functional results and low recurrence rates at the mid-term follow-up, GCTB can be treated effectively with intralesional extended curettage, electrocauterization, and PMMA cementation.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

This article describes 2 cases of spinal epidural cavernous angioma. The lesions were hypo- to isointense on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Both were enhanced homogenously with intravenous contrast. Total resection was achieved in both cases, and the lesions were histopathologically diagnosed as cavernous angiomas. The patients' symptoms regressed postsurgery. Although the MRI features of cavernous angiomas are well known, spinal epidural occurrence is rare and many differential diagnoses have similar clinical and imaging findings. It is important to definitively diagnose these lesions prior to surgery in order to prevent possible intraoperative complications such as massive bleeding and to maximize chances for complete resection. In addition to case descriptions, this article includes a thorough literature review to raise clinical awareness about this well-known but rare spinal entity.",

    "abstract": "Tibial hemimelia is a rare disorder characterized by the absence or hypoplasia of the tibia with associated rigidity. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the affectivity of reconstructive surgeries including centralization of the knee-ankle joints and lengthening with Ilizarov principles, as well as physical and functional results of amputation and reconstruction.This is an IRB-approved retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with tibial hemimelia who required surgery at a single institution between 1998 and 2011. Charts were analyzed for clinical and radiographical findings. At final follow-up, patients underwent physical and radiographic examination. Patients and their parents were asked to complete the SF-10™ health survey (QualityMetric Inc., Lincoln, RI, USA).Twenty-one patients (12 male, 9 female) with 30 affected extremities were included. Mean age was 4.8±3.1 years at initial surgery. Knee level disarticulation was performed in 6 extremities of 4 patients. One patient with type III underwent transtibial amputation. Mean number of surgeries for each patient was 6.4±3.3, and mean duration of external fixator and casting was 17±6 months. Mean lengthening was 4.9±1.3 cm, and mean limb length discrepancy was 3.1±1.7 cm at 5.8±3.7 years at follow-up. SF-10™ scores were similar in disarticulated and reconstructed patients (p=0.63). All scores were significantly higher when disarticulation was performed in cases of knee instability (p<0.01).When stability of the knee joint is present, treatment modality should be chosen according to the existence of the proximal tibia. Amputation should be preferred in cases of knee joint instability.",

Thumb length, thumb girth, range of motion of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and interphalangeal (IP) joints and angular deformities at MCP and IP joints were evaluated. The mean ALURRA score was 21 (range; 16-24) and Tada Score 5.25 (range; 2-7). The length of the operated thumb was approximately 95%, the girth 89% and nail width 80% of the non-operated side. The mean range of motion was 75.1% of the unaffected thumb in interphalangeal joint and 80.1% in metacarpophalangeal joint. Metacarpophalangeal joint malalignment had shown statistically significant negative correlation with the scores of Tada, ALURRA and VAS. Surgical reconstruction may provide a functional and stable thumb in Wassel type IV thumb duplications. The satisfaction of patients is affected by angular deformity of thumbs and cosmetic outlook.",

A 5 cm incision was made from the anterolateral border of the acromion to the arm and a 5-hole 3.5-mm proximal humeral plate was inserted. The axillary nerve was then dissected. Plate holes which crossed the axillary nerve were noted. The distance between the axillary nerve and the lateral edge of the acromion and the length of the arm were measured and their relations evaluated with a correlation test.The average arm length was 319 mm. The average distance between the axillary nerve and the lateral edge of the acromion was 60 mm. There was a significant correlation between the arm length and acromion-axillary nerve distance (p<0.05). The plate was inserted under the deltoid fascia in all shoulders except one. There were no axillary nerve lesions. In 1 case, the distal end of the plate was inserted in the deltoid muscle. No constant relationship between the plate holes and the axillary nerve was detected.There is a risk of axillary nerve injury during percutaneous plate insertion. It must be ensured that the plate is inserted under the deltoid fascia during the surgery. The axillary nerve must be visible during application of the screws due to the impossibility of knowing which holes cross the axillary nerve.",

One maximum repetition test for the tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior and peroneal muscles; fingertip rise test, single- and double-feet vertical jump tests and 10-step/sec test for the gastrosoleus were performed. All tests were performed three times; without brace application, wrapped in elastic bandage and fitted with the Aircast® orthosis.There was no statistically significant difference between the test results of single-foot vertical jump, 10-step/sec and fingertip rise tests (p>0.05). Double-feet vertical jump test results with both exterior supports were better than the ankle without any support (p<0.05). Vertical jump test results were significantly higher with the Aircast® orthosis than elastic bandage (p<0.05). Inversion and eversion movements were restricted significantly more in the Aircast® orthosis than in the elastic bandage (p<0.05).Although external supports restrict the foot-ankle range of motion in specific ratios, these restrictions did not adversely affect the athlete's physical fitness. The Aircast® orthosis was more effective than the elastic bandage in reducing injury risk, preventing repetitive injuries and providing an early return to sports.",

A web-based survey of 21 questions consisting of surgical indications, techniques and time to return to sports was developed to investigate the preferences of members of the TOTBID and the TUSYAD. A total of 147 surgeons answered the questionnaire.70% of the respondents were TUSYAD members. 82% of respondents had at least five years experience in arthroscopy. Half of the surgeons indicated that patient age of 50 was the upper limit for cartilage repair. Irrespective of activity level, microfracture (60-67%) was the most frequently used technique for lesions smaller 2.5 cm2. In lesions larger than 4 cm2, MACI was the most commonly advocated procedure (67%). In patients with high activity levels, mosaicplasty was the first choice (69%) for lesions between 2.5 and 4 cm2 in size, followed by MACI (27%). Patient age, activity level, BMI and lesion size were important determinants for the choice of treatment of isolated chondral lesions in the knee. These results reflect the choices of experienced knee surgeons in the country. Although not widely performed in Turkey and has limited reimbursement by the health care system, the first choice for defects over 4 cm2 was second generation ACI. Third party payers & health reimbursement authorities should take into account that large defects require methods which are relatively expensive and need high technology.

    "abstract": "Bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (BPOP, also known as Nora's lesion) is a rare, benign, locally aggressive condition defined as osteochondromatous exostosis arising from the bony cortex. BPOP presents predominantly in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life, and commonly arises from the periosteum of metacarpals and metatarses, though rare locations have been reported, including the long bones, the maxillae, the bones of calvaria, and the sesamoids. The case of an osteochondromatous lesion in an infant with an intra-abdominal mass arising from the iliac wing, an atypical location of benign solitary lesions, is reported. Benign solitary lesions are exceptional in this age group. The parents of the patient, who was born in term at 3600 grams, discovered a mass in the left groin and observed decreased movement in the lower left extremity. No history of trauma was reported. When the patient was 5 months of age, AP pelvic X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a bony mass displacing intra-abdominal organs anteromedially. Biopsy reported an osteocartilaginous lesion with calcified mature cartilaginous fragments surrounded by plasmacytoid, monotone, fibrinoid cells in myxoid background. Differential diagnosis included osteochondroma, osteochondromyxoma, BPOP, fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma, chondromyxoid fibroma, periosteal chondroma, soft tissue chondroma, myositis ossificans, and juxtacortical chondroma. Biopsy of the resected specimen determined a diagnosis of BPOP. At 6-month postoperative follow-up, neither symptoms nor complaints related to the mass were present.",

A randomized controlled study was conducted to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of MB and FB prostheses in 93 consecutive patients who underwent primary TKA for knee osteoarthritis. Mean follow-up of the patients was 100.9 months in the MB group (range: 78-121 months) and 93.7 months (range: 78-120 months) in the FB group. The clinical results were graded according to the Knee Society Knee Score (KSKS) and the Knee Society Functional Score (KSFS). Secondary outcomes included pain, patellofemoral joint function, quality of life (QOL), and radiologic outcomes (Knee Society's roentgenographic evaluation system). Although there was significant improvement in both groups, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to mean KSFS and radiologic outcomes. However, mean pain score of the MB group was significantly higher than that of the FB group (48.83±0.62 vs 47.39±0.86, respectively, p=0.011), and mean KSKS was significantly higher than that of the FB group (93.5±6.2 vs 89.7±6.9, respectively, p=0.007). TKA clinical results were satisfactory in both the MB and FB groups. KSKS and pain scores were significantly better in the MB than in the FB group. However, no differences were found in other assessments. Thus, we conclude that the best design is the one with which the surgeon is most comfortable and most able to implant reproducibly.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes after cervical TDR with ProDisc-C (Synthes, West Chester, PA, USA), as well as investigate the location change of COR at instrumented level and its clinical significance. A total of 23 patients who underwent single-level cervical TDR with ProDisc-C were included. Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and Neck Disability Index (NDI) were used to assess clinical outcomes. Radiographic parameters such as cervical ROM, instrumented segmental ROM, adjacent segmental ROM, and intervertebral height were analyzed. Additionally, the location change of COR at instrumented level and its clinical significance were further analyzed by the alteration of its coordinates (COR-X, COR-Y). JOA scores increased significantly, while NDI scores decreased at final follow-up. No differences were found in cervical global ROM, instrumented segmental ROM, adjacent segmental ROM, and COR-Y at instrumented level between preoperative and final follow-up measurements (p>0.05); however, intervertebral height and COR-X increased significantly (p<0.05). Cervical global ROM, instrumented segmental ROM, and adjacent segmental ROM could be effectively maintained, and intervertebral height was increased after TDR with ProDisc-C. The location of COR at instrumented level shifted forward after cervical TDR.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this case-control study was to compare the discriminatory ability of bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters for fractures and to determine fracture thresholds for each variable in men with hip or distal forearm fractures. A total of 20 men with hip and 18 men with distal forearm fractures and 38 age-matched controls were included in this study. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) BMD (spine and hip) and calcaneal QUS measurements were made. Area under the curves (AUCs) were calculated to assess fracture discriminatory power of DXA and QUS variables. Quantitative Ultrasound Index (QUI) T-score and Speed of Sound (SOS) were found to be the best parameters for the identification of hip and distal forearm fractures, respectively, with AUCs greater than those of DXA BMD and other QUS parameters. While a QUI T-score of ≤-1.18 could identify and rule out hip fracture cases with approximately 80% sensitivity and specificity, a SOS value of ≤1529.75 reached to almost 90% for ruling in and out distal forearm fractures. The discriminatory performance of calcaneal QUS variables between fractured and non-fractured men was as good as those of the DXA BMD and even better. Since men appear to sustain fractures at closer QUS variable levels than those of the DXA BMD regardless of the fracture type, it may be speculated that calcaneal QUS may be more helpful in predicting the risk of fractures when BMD alone does not demonstrate impaired bones.

All of the osteotomies were performed under fluoroscopic control and direct visualizing the osteotomy site from the same incision. After the osteotomy, the acetabulum was medialized and redirected anterolaterally, and fixed with 2 screws. The neurovascular structures and the joints were examined by dissecting the soft tissues after fixation of the osteotomies. Outcome parameters were center-edge (CE) angle, the distances between the osteotomy and anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), and between the osteotomy and the sciatic notch, neurovascular and joint penetrations.After the osteotomy, the mean CE angle was improved from 19.8° to 25.2°, mean distance between the osteotomy and ASIS was 3.1 cm, and the mean distance between the osteotomy and the sciatic notch was 10.2 mm. The neurovascular structures and the joints were examined by dissecting the soft tissues after fixation of the osteotomies. No damage to the joint, surrounding arteries, veins or nerves was detected in any of the cadavers.Bilateral dysplastic hips can be treated with a 10 cm, cosmetically more acceptable incision in the same session using this approach. Quadrilateral surface of the acetabulum can be directly seen using this approach and the osteotomy can be safely performed.",

The animals were divided into 5 equal groups. The frozen shoulder model was created by immobilizing animals' shoulders with internal fixation with sutures for 8 weeks. At the 8th week, sham (n: 16) and control (n: 16) groups were sacrificed to collect data for healthy and affected shoulders. Also, at the 8th week, 50 mg/ kg methylprednisolone was started for the oral treatment group, and a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg triamcinolone acetonide was injected for the intraarticular treatment group. The effect of additional steroid treatment was expected for 2 weeks, then all remaining treatment and natural course groups were sacrificed on the 10th week.After sacrification, specimens taken as \"en bloc\" scapulothoracic disarticulation were randomly divided into two groups for a range of motion measurement and histopathological examination. The control (frozen shoulder model) group's shoulder range of motion in all directions was lower than the sham (healthy) group (P < 0.01). Natural course and intraarticular steroid groups, compared to the frozen shoulder model showed a significant increase in the direction of abduction (P < 0.05). Also, it was found for treatment groups that in all directions the range of motion was not as good as the healthy values (P < 0.01). The intraarticular treatment group showed higher degrees of abduction compared to the natural course and oral steroid treatment groups (P < 0.01). Oral steroid treatment group's range of motion was not significantly better than the disease model and had no superiority to the natural course group (P > 0.05). Histopathologically, no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for signs of frozen shoulder which was found in the immobilized group (P > 0.05). Histopathologically, immobilization was found to cause thickening of the capsule that cannot be resolved by treatment. (P < 0.05).In frozen shoulder disease, intraarticular steroid injection seems to be superior in increasing the range of motion than oral steroid treatment.",

The mean postoperative follow-up period was 15.95 ± 4.75 months in group F (20 patients) and 20.48 ± 7.57 months in group P (21 patients). Lower extremity mechanical and anatomical axes were measured on x-rays preoperatively and at the end of treatment. Consolidation and distraction indexes were also calculated to assess bone healing. Lower Extremity Functional Scale test was used to evaluate functional outcomes and quality of life.Neither of the treatment methods caused deviations in the mechanical axes and femoral distal angles (P > .05). No statistically significant difference in consolidation and distraction indexes was found between the groups (P > .05). Postoperative complications were seen in 3 of the patients in group F and 4 of the patients from group P. There was no significant difference in Lower Extremity Functional Scale scores between groups (P = .425).This study has demonstrated that treatment with both the FITBONE and PRECICE nails resulted in improved physical and emotional functional outcomes.

Age (years), gender, height (m), weight (kg), body mass index (kg/m2), duration of symptoms, smoking status, smoking index, general health status, and physical activity scores were recorded. Whole blood and platelet-rich plasma cell counts were performed with a hematology analyzer. White blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts were recorded. According to the dose of injected platelets, efficiency of the procedure, purity of platelet-rich plasma, and activation classification, dose of platelets, efficiency of the procedure (platelet recovery rate, %), and purity of the obtained platelet-rich plasma product (relative composition in platelets, %) were calculated. Correlation analysis between the features of platelet-rich plasma and the patient-related variables, including age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, smoking index, presence of other health conditions, physical activity scores, duration of symptoms, and pain levels, was performed.Dose of injected platelets, efficiency of the procedure, purity of platelet-rich plasma, and activation analysis showed that the dose of injected platelets was 3.25 billion, the efficiency of the process was 77%, and the purity rate of the platelet-rich plasma was 98.4%. Platelet-rich plasma platelet count was correlated with whole blood platelet count (r = 0.81, P < .001), whole blood white blood cell count (r = 0.39, P = .002), smoking status (r = 0.56, P = .03), smoking index (r = -0.63, P = .002), and the presence of hypertension (r = -0.31, P=.04).

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine all the potential risk factors defined in the literature for cut-out after proximal femoral nail anti-rotation in managing intertrochanteric fractures and (2) make a reliable prediction about the likelihood of cut-out by developing a quantitative scoring system.Four hundred eighty patients who were operated on for an intertrochanteric femur fracture were included in the study. The patients were evaluated retrospectively. Radiological parameters known to affect cut-out, including tip apex distance (TAD), calcarreferenced TAD (CalTAD), and reduction quality, were also used to evaluate the patients. Additionally, the classification of the fracture according to the cortical thickness index for osteoporosis, the Charlson comorbidity index for additional comorbidities, and the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Für Osteosynthesefragen classification were evaluated.The cut-out rate among all patients was 7.2%. Cut-out risk could be predicted by gender, TAD, CalTAD, and reduction quality. Female gender, TAD > 29.45, CalTAD > 31.75, and acceptable or poor reduction quality significantly increased the cut-out risk. Based on the chi-square analysis, it was determined that there was a significant relationship between the cut-out risk and the variables of TAD, CalTAD, reduction quality, gender, and fracture type (P=.000, P=.000, P=.000, P=.008, P=.016, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed a strong correlation between the newly developed scoring system and the risk of cut-out. The risk of cut-out increased 8.1 times in individuals with a score of more than 2 (P < .001).Female gender, TAD > 29.45, CalTAD > 31.75, and acceptable or poor reduction quality are the parameters found to be significant in determining the cut-out risk. With the newly developed scoring system, risks can be calculated for all situations that may occur according to the scores obtained by the patients. The cut-out risk increases significantly in patients with a score above 2 points.Level III, Diagnostic Study.",

There was no relationship between tunnel widening and ligament laxity (p>0.05; r=0.175 and r=-0.01 for group 1 and group 2, respectively).Our results suggest that differences in the localization of the tunnel fixation have no effect on tunnel enlargement and that joint laxity may be affected by biomechanical properties of fixation materials.",

Its development on the basis of any previous lesion such as chondroblastoma is called secondary aneurysmal bone cyst. A 26-year-old male patient presented with right knee pain of three-year history. Physical examination showed a firm, immobile swelling at the anterior aspect of the right knee, without increase in temperature or redness of the skin. There was no pain on palpation and joint range of motion was normal. Radiological studies were suggestive of an aneurysmal bone cyst. At surgery, the cystic lesion was removed via curettage and the residual cavity was filled with an autogenous bone graft taken from the iliac wing. The histopathologic diagnosis was secondary aneurysmal bone cyst in association with chondroblastoma. During a 1.5-year follow-up, the patient had no complaint and no recurrence was observed.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the results of indirect reduction of the radial head via a circular external fixator in pediatric patients with unilateral chronic radial head dislocation.Three male patients (mean age 6.3 years; range 5 to 8 years) with chronic radial head dislocation underwent ulnar lengthening using a circular external fixator for indirect reduction of the radial head. None of the patients had radiographic evidence for deformity of the radial head, dysplasia of the capitellum, or osteoarthritic changes. The etiologic factors were ulnar hemimelia, brachial plexus injury, and congenital radial head dislocation, respectively. Pre- and postoperative assessment of the patients included measurements of the carrying angle, flexion-extension of the elbow, and pronation-supination of the forearm, and anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, on which the congruency of the radiocapitellar joint, the orientation and length of the ulna and radius were assessed. The mean relative shortening of the ulna was 3.2 cm (range 2.5 to 4 cm) preoperatively. Distraction was begun on the seventh postoperative day at a rate of 3x0.25 mm per day and was continued until the achievement of reduction. Upon completion of the consolidation of the distraction callus, the fixator was removed and a brace was applied for three months to prevent fracture of the regenerated bone. The patients were followed-up for a mean of 62 months (range 42 to 98 months).Complete reduction of the radial head was achieved in all the patients within a mean of six weeks, without any loss in position and recurrence of dislocation during the follow-up period. None of the patients exhibited dysplastic or arthritic signs in the radial head at final examinations. All three patients showed improvement in the carrying angle and were satisfied with the cosmetic appearance of the elbow and the length of the upper extremity. The mean flexion-extension improved by 28.3 degrees and the mean supination-pronation improved by 31.7 degrees. The external fixators were removed within a mean of 110 days (range 90 to 135 days). The mean bone healing index was 36 days/cm (range 30 to 42 days/cm). The mean ulnar lengthening was 3.2 cm (range 2.5 to 4.5 cm). Before reconstruction, the patient with congenital radial head dislocation also had a bowing deformity of the ulna and, during lengthening, this deformity was corrected gradually through additional hinges to the Ilizarov frame. The patient with ulnar hemimelia had a history of shish-kabab osteotomy at another center for ulnar bowing. Considering his young age (5 years), after achievement of radial head reduction, the proximal radius was fixed to the frame and the lengthening of the ulna was continued for an additional 7 mm to prevent future redislocation of the radial head due to asymmetric growth. There were no serious complications. Two patients had minor pin track infections that resolved completely by local wound care and oral antibiotics.Albeit technically demanding, chronic radial head dislocations in children can be treated by indirect reduction of the radial head through ulnar lengthening with the use of a circular external fixator. This technique has a very low complication rate.",

Mean follow-up was 97.5 (range: 58 to 130) months after revision. The Harris hip score was used to evaluate clinical results. Radiographic evaluations were done using standard anteroposterior views obtained at the final follow-up.Two patients underwent re-revision. The mean Harris hip score of the remaining 13 patients was 88.3±11.9 (range: 68 to 100) at the final follow-up. Early postoperative radiographs showed mean angle of inclination of 45° (range: 30° to 55°). There was a mean migration of 6.2±7.8 (range: 0 to 29) mm and the migration amount did not differ according to rim contact (p=0.054). There was no correlation between migration and amount of graft used (p>0.05). There was a significant correlation between migration and follow-up time (p<0.01).Our results imply that 50% host bone contact is not absolutely necessary to form a stable construct while restoring the centre of hip rotation.",

Patients' average age was 30 (range: 16 to 43) years. The average time lapse between injury and repair was 25.1 days (range: 1 day to 13 months). Pinch and grip strength measurements were graded according to the modified Verga classification. The Highet classification was used for the evaluation of sensorial recovery. Functional outcome were assessed with the DASH-T score. Average follow-up time was 62.5 (range: 24 to 156) months.Motor function according to the Verga classification was excellent in 16 patients and poor in two. Pinch and grip power measurement comparison of the two sides in the 16 patients with excellent results showed a respective 24.1% and 14.3% decrease on the affected side. According to Highet's classification, sensorial evaluation was S4 in seven patients, S3+ in four, S3 in three, S2+ in one, S2 in one, and S1 in two patients. The average DASH-T score of patients with excellent results was 7.3.Radial nerve repairs, if done end-to-end using an appropriate technique, may lead to nearly full recovery in younger patients.",

Patellofemoral axial radiographs were analyzed to compare the reliability of the PSI to the classical measures of patellofemoral congruence, the lateral patellar tilt (LPT) and patellar displacement (PD). Intra-rater reliability of the PSI, LPT and PD was estimated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the inter-rater reliability using Krippendorff's alpha (Kα). Agreement proportion of was calculated for the PD. Face validity of the PSI was also tested.The PSI had excellent intra (mean ICC=0.91) and inter-rater (Kα=0.92) reliability, as did LPT (mean ICC=0.96; Kα=0.89). The calculation of PD caused a low level of agreement (47.1%) between evaluators in terms of which images could be measured. The exclusion of these radiographs resulted in a high PD intra (ICC=0.96) and inter-rater (Kα=0.97) reliability.The PSI appears to be a reliable and valid measure for patellofemoral congruence in a replaced knee joint with an unresurfaced patella. The superiority of the PSI is the result of its consideration of the geometry and size of the replaced knee joint and independence from radiographic magnification.",

One possible cause of FBS is peridural fibrosis (PF). PF is the overproduction of scar tissue adjacent to the dura mater. Bleeding can cause PF after laminectomy. Ostene is an alkylene oxide copolymer material used to stop bleeding from bony surfaces. Floseal is a gelatin thrombin matrix sealant used to assist fibrin formation and to promote coagulation.Total of 32 female Sprague-Dawley rats were evenly allotted to 4 experimental groups: laminectomy only, laminectomy + Ostene (Baxter International, Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA), laminectomy + Floseal (Baxter International, Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA), and laminectomy + Adcon-L (aap Implantate AG, Berlin, Germany). After performing total laminectomy, agents were placed over dura mater. Spinal column of test subjects was harvested 6 weeks after laminectomy. Histopathological examination of samples was based on Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin and eosin staining. PF observed in the groups was graded using system previously described by He et al. Statistically significant p value was defined as p < 0.005.Present study revealed that Adcon-L, Ostene, and Floseal groups had reduced PF compared with laminectomy only group (p = 0.001). Comparison of Ostene and Floseal groups with Adcon-L group yielded no significant difference.Reoperation as result of FBS has greater risk and often has poor outcome; surgeons must take precautions to avoid FBS, such as careful selection of appropriate patient and operation technique. Ostene and Floseal may be applied and left in the operation field safely during laminectomy to reduce occurrence of PF after procedure.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of subscapularis tear on superior humeral excursion (SHE) and acromiohumeral distance (AHD). The hypothesis was that subscapularis tears do not result in superior humeral excursion.Patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy between August of 2011 and 2015 were reevaluated. Those with isolated Bankart lesion were used as control group and included in the Group 1, isolated full-thickness supraspinatus tear in the Group 2, isolated subscapularis tear in the Group 3, and combined subscapularis and supraspinatus tear in the Group 4. The mean SHE and AHD measurements on magnetic resonance imaging of these groups were compared to reveal any difference in superior humeral migration (SHM).There were 30 patients in each group. The mean age of Group 1 (26.44 ± 8.34) was younger than the other 3 groups. The mean AHD and SHE were higher in Group 1 and 3 (Mean AHD: 12.89 ± 2.24 and 12.28 ± 1.9, respectively. Mean SHE: -3.2 ± 0.99 and -2.78 ± 0.64, respectively) than Group 2 and 4 (Mean AHD: 6.2 ± 1.78 and 6.16 ± 1.52, respectively. Mean SHE: 0.72 ± 0.65 and 1.24 ± 0.63, respectively). The AHD and SHE were strongly correlated with each other (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.184). The inter-observer and intra-observer correlation of the measurements of SHE on MRI were excellent with intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively.Subscapularis tears do not lead to SHM and subacromial impingement. However, superior rotator cuff tears can still lead to SHM and subacromial impingement even when subscapularis tendon is intact.Level III, diagnostic study.",

    "abstract": "Radial meniscus tears are seen in young patients, especially with anterior cruciate ligament ruptures. Repair of complete radial meniscus tear is necessary for the meniscus functions. The most important factor for success of the meniscus repair is primary stability, but it is still unknown which technique is ideal repair technique.We developed a new suture technique named Horizontal Butterfly (HB). In this novel technique the contact between meniscal tissue and suture is more than Horizontal Loop (HL) that routinely used today. So, we think that this technique will provide better fixation than HL. We aimed to compare 2 repair techniques (HB vs. HL) using human lateral menisci biomechanically with cyclic loading and load to failure tests.We used 22 intact lateral meniscus obtained from patients that operated (total knee replacement) for varus gonarthrosis in our clinic. All menisci were cut radially. In the first group (n:11) menisci were repaired with standard horizontal loop technique, and in the second group (n:11) horizontal butterfly technique were used for repair. All specimens were tested with load to failure test after cyclic loading test (500 cycle X 5-30 N).Both groups have similar failure load (71,4 ± 17,52 N vs. 77,9 ± 28,49 N; p:0,559) and stiffness (24,46 ± 19,19 N vs. 24,48 ± 15,87 N; p:0,818). HB group has less peak displacement (6,26 ± 1,24 mm vs. 8,4 ± 1,92 mm; p:0,010).This novel repair technique decreases the amount of displacement according to standard technique while as strong as standard technique routinely used. In this way; we believe that it will increase the rate of healing in clinical use.",

However, new bone formation was higher in the PRF group. Epidural fibrosis and chronic inflammatory cell density were significantly lower in the PRF group (p < 0.05).We concluded that PRF contributed to hemostasis and prevented epidural fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Redirecting of a laterally misplaced pedicle screw into the accurate position decreases the pull-out strength due to the reinsertion, lateral wall cortical perforation and widening of the pedicle hole.Thus, this biomechanical study was performed to quantitatively analyze the pullout strength of a redirected laterally misplaced pedicle screw into the accurate position.Methods: Thirty pedicules of 15 bovine vertebrae were separated to 3 groups, according to the screw placement method: 1) standard flawless trajectory; 2) trajectory with lateral pedicle wall perforation; 3) trajectory with lateral wall perforation redirected to the standard trajectory.Samples were placed on a universal testing machine and pullout loads were measured.Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized within 95% confidence interval and p value <0.05 to test for the statistical significance.Results: The mean pullout strength was 2891±654,2 N(1383-3814,5) in Group 1; 817, 8±227,6 N(308,6-1144,9) in Group 2 and 2081,1±487,7 N (1583,5-2962,5) in Group 3. The results found out to be statistically significant (p<0.05).Inter-group comparisons revealed that lateral pedicle wall perforation significantly decreases the pullout strength (p<0.05) and redirection of the screw increases the strength (p<0.05),however it was still weaker than the screws with flawless standard trajectory but this was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Conclusion:The results of this study confirm that pullout strength of pedicle screw decreases by approximately 71% when the lateral wall is perforated and decreases 28% after redirection to the accurate position.",

Patients who were skeletally mature with a minimum follow-up of 24 months and who had no previous surgery from the affected knee were included; patients who had multiple ligament injuries or chondral lesions over Outerbridge grade 2 were excluded from the study. Patients were grouped according to the graft type used in ACL reconstruction. Tegner activity scale and Lysholm knee scoring scale were used to assess patients' activity levels and functional status preoperatively and at the final follow-up. KT-2000 arthrometer measurements were done at the final follow-up to evaluate anterior laxity.There were 27 patients (mean age 27 ± 8.9 years) in the FSH group and 36 patients (mean age 27.1 ± 6.7 years) in the FDT group. The mean follow-up time was 38.2 ± 3.5 months for the FSH group and 41 ± 6.1 months for the FDT group. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups when preoperative and postoperative Tegner-Lysholm scores were compared (Tegner P = 0.583, 0.742; Lysholm P = 0.592, 0.249).

The mean age was 37.8 ± 14.5, with a female/male ratio of 8/9. Thirteen (76.4%) patients had Stage IIb disease, and 2 (11,7%) patients had Stage III disease. In 2 (11,7%) patients have locally aggressive tumor that had Stage 3. Fifteen (88.2%) of the cases involved lower extremity, whilst 2 (11.8%) of them involved upper extremity. An arterial reconstruction was carried out in all patients. Wide tumor resection and endoprosthetic reconstruction were performed in 6 (35.2%) patients. Other 11 (65.8%) patients were treated with wide resection and soft tissue reconstruction. Postoperative data included; perioperative morbidities such as bleeding, infection, graft thrombosis, rupture, metastatic local recurrence and mortality. Ankle brachial index (ABI) and color-flow-duplex-scan (CFDS) were done at the final follow-up of the study, in order to prove the efficacy of reconstruction. Functional outcome was evaluated with International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS) criteria.The mean follow-up was of 39 months (range 3-120). Perioperative complications were arterial graft thrombosis occurred in 3 (17.6%) patients treated acutely with thrombectomy, uncontrolled deep wound infection occurred in 2 patients whom extremities were amputated. The most frequent complication after surgery was limb edema according to possibly venous and lymphatic obstruction, staged as C1, C2 and C3 disease was established in 6 patients (two patients in each group), and 1 patient was classified as C6 disease. Three (17.6%) patients had local recurrence (1/3 patient died and 2/3 (11.7%) patients underwent transfemoral amputation). At the last follow-up, 9 (52.9%) patients were alive without evidence of disease, 8 (47.1%) patients were died due to primary disease. There were 8 (47.1%) patients alive with an intact limb. Although functional outcome scores were satisfactory, emotional acceptance scores were low. The limb salvage probability was 74.0%.Limb-sparing oncological surgery in musculoskeletal tumors with vascular invasion provides a satisfactory limb function, which may lead to an improved life quality. Arterial reconstruction has a high rate of patency in the long term. The surgeon should be aware of early perioperative complication related to vascular reconstruction and infection that effect on the rate of extremity survival.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

Preferred walking speeds (PWS) were determined on the over ground. Individuals walked on a treadmill for 7 min at their PWS and 30% above PWS and oxygen consumption was recorded via a metabolic analyzer. Net oxygen consumption was calculated for each walking trial. Borg scale was applied to assess perceived exertion during walking trial. Plantar pressure distributions were measured by a pedobarography device. Plantar area was subdivided into six zones to evaluate the dynamic plantar pressure data.The mean PWS of PFPS and control groups were 4.69 ± 0.51 and 4.52 ± 0.60 km/h, respectively (p > .09). No significant difference was observed in energy expenditure during walking at PWS between 2 groups while oxygen consumption during 30% above PWS was higher in patient group (18.72 ± 3.75 and 16.64 ± 3.27) (p = .007). Net oxygen consumption was also found to be higher in PFPS group (15.12 ± 3.62 and 13.04 ± 3.24) (p = .005). The mean Borg scores were significantly higher in PFPS group at each walking trials (p < .001). No statistically significant difference was found between weight distribution (%) of symptomatic and nonsymptomatic extremity (50.45 ± 3.92% and 49.56 ± 3.93%, respectively) (p = .509). Dynamic pedobarography parameters were not different between 2 groups, and also between symptomatic and nonsymptomatic extremities (p > .05).Although, rate of perceived exertion and energy expenditure during walking at 30% above PWS are affected negatively in young adults with PFPS, we may speculate that energy consumption and plantar pressure distribution can be compensated by a physiologic adaptation mechanism during walking at PWS.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "The deformed and enlarged femoral head secondary to hip diseases such as Legg Calve Perthes and Developmental Dysplasia usually causes impingement between the aspherical head and the acetabulum. To restore and reduce the size of enlarged femoral head, a femoral head reduction technique has been described previously. The goal is to obtain a spherical femoral head and to cover the gliding surface with best available cartilage. Planning of osteotomy to achieve spherical head is the crucial point of surgery. It is usually done intra-operatively and dependent on experience of surgeon. Preoperative 3- Dimension (D) modeling of femoral head is commonly preferred to minimize this risk. In this technical note, preoperative planning with 3-D printing was demonstrated in two separate patients with Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease and developmental hip dysplasia. Surgical time was approximately 150 and 120 min, respectively. Blood loss was 230 and 300 cc, respectively. Patients were followed up 9 months and 12 months, respectively. None of the patients in this study developed avascular necrosis; however, the follow-up period is very limited. Moreover, none of the patients developed post-operative complications or required additional surgery. With a more detailed preoperative planning done on computer model and printed in 3-D, one can mimic the surgical procedure before the procedure. Finally, this technique is advantageous both for the patient and surgeon.",

Patients were divided into two groups: Group OA (273 knees of 206 patients; 83 males, 123 females; mean age: 64.4 (47-87) years) and Group RA (304 knees of 182 patients; 92 males, 90 females; mean age: 50.7 (21-72) years). In the clinical evaluation, the knee range of motion (ROM) and several outcome measures such as The Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were used preoperatively and at the final follow-up visit. The quality of life was measured using Short Form (SF)-36 MCS and PCS scores. The primary outcome was the frequency and severity of patient-reported AKP. The AKP Scale was used to determine the severity of AKP.The IKDC raised from 21.62 (range, 13-29.9) preoperatively to 85.1 (range, 80-88) for group OA and from 21.8 (range, 13-29.9) to 85.2 (range, 81-88) for group RA (p < 0.001).

The frequency of AKP was 8% in Group OA and 7% in Group RA (p = 0.27). For patients with AKP, the mean AKP Scale was 92.74 (range, 84-98) in Group OA and 93.39 (range, 82-98) in Group RA (p = 0.3).After TKA without resurfacing the patella, patients with RA were determined to have a similar risk for AKP as those with OA.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

However, refractory symptoms following surgical release are not uncommon. We aimed to assess the usefulness of ultrasonography for determining the potential causes of ongoing symptoms following surgical release. This retrospective study included 34 patients (32 women; mean age, 54.7±16.65 years; range: 30 to 81 years) with carpal tunnel syndrome who underwent surgical carpal tunnel release. A pathology related to the cause of the ongoing symptoms was detected by ultrasonography in 25 (74.5%) patients. The most common pathological findings were median nerve swelling (70.6%), incomplete transection of the transverse carpal ligament (23.5%) and perineural fibrosis (17.6%). In the majority of the patients the pathology related to the ongoing symptoms was detected by ultrasonography, suggesting that ultrasonography could be used as a complementary imaging method for identifying the causes of failure following surgical carpal tunnel release. Detection of an ongoing pathology might help clinicians in managing persistent disease cases and aid in planning an exploration.",

    "abstract": "Bone fragment and graft stabilization are important during reconstructive surgery of cases with comminuted fractures and bone defects. We examined the effect of Hyalonect surgical mesh on the healing dynamics of metaphyseal bone defects created in rabbit tibiae. Approximately 5-mm defects were created on the anterior aspect of the proximal tibial metaphysis of 80 male rabbits. The rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups: Group I, bone defects left alone (control group); Group II, bone defect covered with Hyalonect; Group III, bone defect filled with allograft; and Group IV, bone defect filled with allograft and covered with Hyalonect. No significant histological differences were noted between Groups II and III or Groups III and IV at 3 and 6 weeks. At 3 weeks, Groups II, III, and IV had significantly better healing than Group I (p<0.05). In addition, Group IV showed significantly better healing than Group II at 3 and 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, only Group IV showed better healing than Group I (p<0.05). Radiologically, Groups II, III, and IV showed better healing than Group I at 3 and 6 weeks (p<0.05). Hyalonect application and bone grafting significantly accelerated the healing process when used alone or together. Hyalonect application along with bone grafting resulted in better early radiological healing than bone grafting alone.",

Etiology were a fall from various heights in 12 patients (46.2%), motor vehicle accidents as an occupant in 7 (26.9%) and as a pedestrian in 4 (15.4%), and simple fall in 3 (11.5%). None of the patients had neurologic deficit and no damage was found in the posterior ligamentous complex in MRI evaluations. Denis pain and functional scales were used in the clinical evaluation. Local kyphosis angle, sagittal index and height loss percentage were measured in the radiologic evaluation. Post-fracture and follow-up values were compared. Mean follow-up period was 41.30 (range: 14 to 80) months.Mean pain and functional scores were 1.65 and 1.15 points, respectively, at the final follow-up. Twenty patients returned to their pre-trauma work and activities completely and six patients with small limitations. Mean period for returning to work was 3.64 (range: 2 to 6) months. Local kyphosis angle, sagittal index and height loss percentage values increased significantly at follow-up (p<0.05).The conservative treatment of stable thoracolumbar burst fractures is widely accepted. Early mobilization with customized TLSO brace appears to produce effective functional results despite loss of vertebral body height.",

These 72 patients comprised Group 1. Following a cadaveric study on the vascularization of the radial nerve, a modified surgical approach was undertaken starting in 2002. Sixty-one patients who underwent this new surgical approach were included in Group 2. The rates of radial nerve deficit of the groups were compared using the Pearson chi-square test.In Group 1, 19 iatrogenic nerve deficits occurred. After defining the blood circulation of the nerve, the lateral approach was modified. The anterolateral side of the nerve was released and the nerve was left attached to the triceps muscle. In Group 2, one patient developed postoperative transient nerve deficit.The radial nerve is supplied by the branches of the deep brachial artery in close relation with the triceps muscle. Anterior dissection and posterior retraction of the radial nerve during lateral approach may preserve its blood supply and reduces the risk of iatrogenic injury.",

Cruciate-retaining cementless total knee prostheses were implanted in all patients diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis. Clinical, functional and radiological evaluations were performed according to the Knee Society's Knee Scoring System (KSS). Prosthesis survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Mean follow-up time was 9.2 (range: 8 to 12) years.Preoperative mean knee and function scores were 42.3 (range: 32 to 61) and 39.1 (range: 35 to 66), respectively, while they were 88.6 (range: 54 to 96) and 82.8 (range: 50 to 100), respectively at the final follow-up (p<0.05). Mean preoperative knee flexion was 98° (range: 80° to 110°) and 112° (range: 85° to 130°) at the final follow-up (p<0.05). Preoperative and postoperative mean alignments were 9.2° varus and 5.4° valgus, respectively. Revisions were performed due to aseptic loosening of the tibial component in one patient, periprosthetic fracture in one and dislocation of the patella in one. Two superficial infections (3%) were observed. There was no osteolysis around the screws during the follow-up period. The overall rate of implant survival was 95.6% (range: 91.56% to 99.60%; 95% CI) at 12 years.Long-term outcomes of porous-coated, cementless total knee arthroplasty with screw fixation were successful in terms of clinical and radiological evaluation and yielded a high survival rate.",

Turkish orthopedic physicians actively practicing operative orthopedics were questioned in a 12 question face-to-face survey. Personal information of physicians, preferred cuff pressure (CP) and tourniquet inflation time (TIT) and the source of the information for these preferences were questioned. Answers gathered were analyzed statistically. The survey was completed by 211 orthopedic physicians. Mean preferred CP and TIT was 247.1 mmHg and 108.6 minutes, respectively, in the upper limb (UL) and 345.02 mmHg and 122.4 minutes, respectively, in the lower limb (LL). A statistically significant correlation was found between the amount of pressure preferred in the LL and the years of practice; longer the years in practice, higher the amount of pressure preferred (r=0.144, p=0.04). Tourniquets were used for a maximum period of 120 minutes for the UL by 95.7% of participants and for the LL by 84.8%. The amount of CP used by the orthopedic physicians surveyed is inconsistent with the literature with frequent use of CP higher than those scientifically recommended. The outcomes of the survey should be cautionary for orthopedic physicians to review the current utilization and replace personal teachings and experience-based methods with evidence-based best practices for tourniquet application.",

The atypical symptoms of foot involvement may delay the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis most commonly includes ankle sprain, monoarticular arthritis, anterior impingement syndrome, tarsal spur, osteomyelitis, stress fracture, eosinophilic granuloma. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of osteoid osteoma in the foot may be a cause of chronic foot pain. In this study, we present a 17-year-old boy with osteoid osteoma in his right cuboid bone. The patient was undiagnosed during the first year of his symptoms. After surgical removal of the tumor, his complaints were resolved. The pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma. Osteoid osteoma is an unusual bone tumor of the foot. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients exhibiting foot pain. In speculative cases with no obvious radiographic findings, further imaging studies, such as CT, should be considered.",

Although finger reconstruction methods using distraction lengthening are known to restore finger length and function, we found no reports in the literature regarding phalangeal lengthening in thumb amputations. We aimed to evaluate proximal phalangeal lengthening in thumb amputations at or near the interphalangeal (IP) joint.We retrospectively evaluated patients who had undergone distraction lengthening of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. All patients underwent osteotomy, either during the initial procedure or as a second-stage procedure. Distraction began 10 days after osteotomy with the use of an external fixator that remained in place until ossification of the gap occurred without bone grafting. Patients were evaluated using the QuickDASH score.Fourteen patients with a mean age of 27 years and a mean follow-up period of 7 years were enrolled. The mean phalangeal lengthening achieved was 20 mm. Ossification occurred at all distraction sites, and the fixators were maintained for a mean of 85 days. The mean healing index was 42.5 days/cm. All 14 patients achieved the desired amount of phalangeal lengthening without major complications such as nonunion, premature union, or gross infection.For reconstruction in cases of distal thumb amputations, distraction lengthening of the proximal phalanx can be used to improve absolute length, web space, and grip distance. The technique is safe and effective, improves functionality/cosmesis, and offers a low complication risk.",

Nonetheless, to our knowledge, only a few cases associated with spinal arthrodesis have been reported in the literature. The aim of this case report was to describe the clinical features of a rare case of delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to nickel that occurred after an extraordinarily long period of time (approximately 15 years) after spinal arthrodesis. Here, we present a 38-year-old patient who was referred to us with a diagnosis of delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to nickel that was established by a skin patch test. The chief sign and symptoms of the patient were allergic contact dermatitis along with intractable, generalized itching that started several months ago. The medical history revealed that the patient had undergone spinal arthrodesis using rods and pedicle screws approximately 15 years ago, followed by revision surgery to remove the implants. Radiological examination showed a remnant pedicle screw fragment at the third lumbar vertebra that had broken off during the removal of implants nine years ago. However, the signs and symptoms of metal hypersensitivity started shortly before the patient was referred to our hospital. We decided to remove the screw fragment as allergic contact dermatitis was refractory to medical treatment. On postoperative day one, the itching was completely resolved, although the skin patch test remained positive.",

Methodological quality of the studies meeting the inclusion criteria was assessed using the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies (QAREL) checklist by two reviewers. The overall level of evidence of this systematic review was determined by the Modified Cochrane Back Pain Criteria based on previous research which was modified for reliability studies of the shoulder complex.The literature search generated 388 results, and only 14 articles met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, reliabilities of two qualitative and five quantitative methods for the assessment of SD were analyzed. The QAREL checklist revealed that 12 studies had moderate risk of bias and 2 had high risk of bias. Additionally, none of the studies were of high quality. On the basis of the Modified Cochrane Back Pain Criteria, the overall level of evidence was moderate. Most of the studies including quantitative measurement methods found good to excellent inter- and intra-rater reliability values. Most of the studies including qualitative methods found low-to-moderate intra- and inter-rater reliability values.Considering the available published evidence, there is lack of high-quality studies evaluating the inter- and intra-rater reliabilities of qualitative or quantitative methods used for the assessment of SD. There are no qualitative methods with high reliability that are fit for clinical applications.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 15 patients (12 males; mean age=39.2 years; age range=23-61) with Rockwood type V ACJD who were treated by the TightRope fixation device. The mean follow-up period was 19.3 (range=12-30) months. Functional status was assessed using the Constant-Murley score (CMS) at the final follow-up examination. To determine the reduction loss of ACJ, we measured and compared the coracoclavicular (CC) distance using radiographs with Zanca view in the early postoperative period and at the final follow-up examination. The fixation procedures were performed with an open technique using the TightRope fixation device. Results The mean CMS at the final follow-up was 93.2 (range=82-100) points. All the patients experienced full recovery of the shoulder's range of motion, were able to return to the activities of daily living, and were satisfied with the treatment. ACJ reduction was successfully achieved in all the patients using the TightRope technique. Postoperative radiographs revealed no reduction loss in the ACJ, and the CC distance was well maintained. The mean CC distance was 19.95 (range=13.1-28.3) mm before surgery. The mean CC distance was 7.47 (range=4.2-11.5) mm in the early postoperative radiographic measurements. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.001). The mean CC distance at the final follow-up examination was 7.70 (range=4.5-11.7) mm. At the final follow-up visit, the shoulders of all the patients were still completely reduced, with a mean difference in the CC of 0.23 (range=0-1.3) mm compared with that in the early postoperative period. The difference in the CC between the early postoperative and final follow-up intervals was not statistically significant (p=0.055). No patient experienced recurrence or required an operation for hardware removal. Conclusion It seems that the TightRope device can provide anatomical restoration in patients with acute type V ACJD without subluxation at the final follow-up examination.

The study subject was a healthy 26-year-old male without any physical problems. A link-segment model was prepared according to the subject's individual anthropometric characteristics and transferred to the MATLAB(®) program. Joint torques were calculated using SimMechanics™ software. Motions were recorded by one digital video camera as the subject performed the movements (sit-to-stand from 20 cm and 40 cm height, crouch down-stand up, and climbing 10 cm and 20 cm high step) and the joint's position data was obtained using a digitization process. In addition, the vertical ground reaction forces were measured using a force plate in order to test the accuracy of the link-segment model. Lower extremity joint torques were calculated. Maximum joint torques occurred in the knee joint. The knee and the ankle joints were the most loaded joint during the high step movement. The highest torques of the knee and ankle joint were 157.2 Nm and 146 Nm, respectively, during the movements. Knee joint torque and the ankle joint torque increased when the sitting height increased. The hip joint experienced the least amount of load during the movements. The knee joint has enough strength against high torques during extension and flexion movement. Joint torques can be successfully calculated using a simulation process involving an inverse dynamics method without an external device mounted on the limbs. The obtained data can be used in the design of prosthetics and orthotics and for structural analysis of the bones.",

The mean follow-up was 36.9 months (range: 24-62 months). The kyphotic angle ranged from 15.2-35.1° preoperatively, with an average measurement of 27.8°. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score system was used to evaluate the neurological deficits and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) used to judge the activity of TB.Spinal TB was completely cured in all 17 patients. There was no recurrent TB infection. The postoperative kyphotic angle was 6.6-10.2°, 8.1° in average, and there was no significant loss of the correction at final follow-up. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases. Neurological condition in all patients was improved after surgery.Single-stage posterior transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, debridement, limited decompression, 3-column reconstruction, and posterior instrumentation can be a feasible and effective method the in treatment of single-segment lumbar spinal TB.",

    "abstract": "Lengthening after acute correction has a negative effect on bone healing during distraction osteogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether correcting an acute deformity prior to lengthening resulted in a negative effect on bone healing. Patients with shortened femora were assigned to 3 matched groups. Retrograde femoral nailing after distal metaphyseal-diaphyseal osteotomy was used in all cases. Group 1 (9 femora) included cases of lengthening >4 cm using intramedullary distraction devices after acute correction. Group 2 (16 femora) included pure lengthening cases of ≥4 cm using intramedullary distraction devices. Group 3 (13 femora) included cases of lengthening ≥4 cm with lengthening and the retrograde nailing method (LORN) following acute correction. Healing indices and full weight-bearing times of patients were evaluated. Mean lengthening values were 6.6 (range: 4-14 cm), 5.7 (range: 4-8 cm), and 5.2 cm (range: 4-6.5 cm) in Groups 1-3, respectively, and mean radiographic consolidation index and full weight-bearing times were 31.0±8.2, 30.2±5.5, and 39.0±5.0 day/cm in Groups 1-3, respectively. The consolidation index was significantly better in the Groups 1 and 2 compared to that in Group 3, but no difference was detected between Groups 1 and 2. Acute correction had no negative effect on bone healing after distraction osteogenesis using new-generation intramedullary distraction devices. We suggest that the negative impact on healing and the prolonged consolidation index in patients undergoing LORN may be due to impaired periosteal blood supply due to fixator pins.",

All patients had initially been examined for an ankle sprain in the emergency room, where the initial plain radiographs did not show any abnormality. Due to the long lasting symptoms all patients underwent an MRI scan by the 3rd week which revealed a posterior malleolar fracture. Patients were treated with an ankle brace for 3 weeks. All patients were followed up for 1 year. Bone healing and degenerative changes were evaluated with plain Radiographs, including a 50° external rotation lateral. Clinical outcome was evaluated with American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot scale. Fracture healing was seen in 6 of the 7 patients by the 6th week. There was no radiographic healing by 6th month in the remaining patient. Mean AOFAS ankle hindfoot scores at the beginning of the treatment and at 3rd month were 20 (11-31) and 86 (43-96), respectively. There was no instability or degenerative changes at one-year follow-up. Isolated posterior malleolar fracture should be kept in mind in patients who present with pain at the posterior part of the ankle following a forced plantar flexion and/or axial compression injury.

The 2 patient groups were similar in terms of age, gender ratio, diagnosis, disease stage, and knee joint alignment. Mean follow-up times were 35 (range: 12-112) months and 32 (range: 13-75) months, respectively. Evaluation was based on the Knee Society scores (KSS) and the Knee Society Total Knee Arthroplasty Roentgenographic Evaluation and Scoring System, with survival data compiled using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Clinical and functional improvements were recorded in all cases, with no statistically significant differences between the 2 patient groups. Survivorship was 95.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 91.8-99.8%) for the multi-radius implant at 60 months and 92.7% (95% CI: 87.7-97.7%) for the single-radius implant at 84 months, with no significant difference (p=0.31).This study demonstrates that both single-radius and multi-radius posterior-stabilized knee endoprostheses can significantly reduce pain and improve knee joint function in patients if used with a proper technique, with the additional benefit of good mid-term survivorship.",

Anterolateral fixation with an anatomical locked plate using a lateral approach was preferred. Mean age was 34 years (range: 17-56 years). AO Foundation/American Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classification was used; all patients had AO/OTA 12-B1.3 type fractures. Inclusion criteria were patients with polytrauma, late-onset radial nerve injury, and unsatisfactory closed reduction. Patients were followed up at postoperative weeks 6, 12, and 24, and in 3-month intervals thereafter. Mean follow-up period was 16 months (range: 14-18 months). Functional results were evaluated using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, visual analog scale (VAS) score, and Mayo elbow performance score.Mean flexion was 135° (range: 128-140°) at 24 weeks postoperatively; there was no loss of pronation and supination of the forearm. All fractures healed uneventfully in an average of 19.3 weeks (range: 16-24 weeks). Mean Mayo elbow performance score and DASH score at 24 weeks improved from 66.6 (range: 50-85) to 100 and from 53.6 (range: 25.75-80.75) to 12.7 (range: 5-26.5), respectively. VAS score at 24 weeks improved from 4 (range: 3-5) to 0.5 (range: 0-1). Postoperative radial nerve paralysis and infection were not observed.We recommend anterolateral anatomical locked plate fixation using a lateral approach as an alternative method in the management of distal humeral extra-articular fractures. This enables rigid fixation of the distal fragment without interfering and impinging on the olecranon fossa, allows early active range of elbow motion, and avoids iatrogenic triceps muscle injury and radial nerve exposure, which prevents surgical radial nerve injury.",

However, unlike the nondiscoid meniscus, discoid medial meniscus is frequently associated with horizontal cleavage tears, attributable to the presence of myxoid degeneration in the intrameniscal substance, in that it may potentially occur deteriorating long-term results because of re-tearing of remaining meniscus or secondary degeneration of cartilage of the medial compartment after meniscectomy. We experienced three rare cases of retear or secondary degeneration of cartilage of the medial compartment after meniscectomy for two patients with torn bilateral meniscus. Both patients were highly active young males. Meniscal allograft transplantation in complicated discoid medial meniscus was performed. At 2 years after meniscal allograft transplantation, clinical outcomes were improved with a normal range of motion. Orthopedic surgeons should recommend activity modification to prevent possible complicated injury of the discoid medial meniscus. Meniscal allograft transplantation may be an alternative option in highly active young patients undergoing complicated discoid medial meniscus to diminish pain, improve knee function, and prevent or delay degeneration.",

The mediolateral and anteriorposterior diameters of the upper and lower endplates were measured with a digital measuring system.Overall, 43.7% of the largest implant footprints were smaller in the anterior-posterior diameter and 42.6% in the mediolateral diameter were smaller than cervical endplate measurements. Discrepancy of the level C5/C6 and C6/C7 was calculated as 56.2% at the anteroposterior diameter and 43.8% at the center of mediolateral diameter.Large disparity has been found between the sizes of devices and cervical anatomic data. Companies that produce CTDP should take care of the anatomical dimensions and generate different sizes of CTDP. Spine surgeon should be familiar with the size mismatch in CTDP that may affect the clinical and radiological outcome of the surgery.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the biomechanical performance of an intramedullary nail combined with a reconstruction plate and a single intramedullary nail in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures with a fracture of the lateral femoral wall (LFW). A three-dimensional finite element (FE) femur model was established from computed tomography images of a healthy male volunteer. A major reverse obliquity fracture line, associated with a lesser trochanteric fragment defect and a free bone fragment of the LFW, was developed to create an AO/OTA type 31-A3.3 unstable intertrochanteric fracture mode. Two fixation styles were simulated: a long InterTAN nail (ITN) with or without a reconstruction plate (RP). A vertical load of 2100 N was applied to the femoral head to simulate normal walking. The construct stiffness, von Mises stress, and model displacement were assessed. The ITN with RP fixation (ITN/RP) provided higher axial stiffness (804 N/mm) than the ITN construct (621 N/mm). The construct stiffness of ITN/RP fixation was 29% higher than that of ITN fixation. The peak von Mises stress of the implants in the ITN/RP and ITN models was 994.46 MPa and 1235.24 MPa, respectively. The peak stress of the implants in the ITN/RP model decreased by 24% compared to that of the ITN model. The peak von Mises stress of the femur in the ITN/RP model was 269.06 MPa, which was lower than that of the ITN model (331.37 MPa). The peak stress of the femur in the ITN/RP model was 23% lower than that of the ITN model. The maximum displacements of the ITN/RP and ITN models were 12.12 mm and 13.53 mm, respectively. The maximum displacement of the ITN/RP model decreased by 12% compared with that of the ITN model. The study suggested that an additional plate fixation could increase the construct stiffness, reduce the stresses in the implant and femur, and decrease displacement after intramedullary nailing. Therefore, the intramedullary nail and reconstruction plate combination may provide biomechanical advantages over the single intramedullary nail in unstable intertrochanteric fractures with a fractured LFW.",

    "abstract": "The exploration of underlying biological risk factors for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has generated a substantial body of literature describing the role of bony morphology of the knee. Morphological risk factors, such as poor tibiofemoral joint congruity, a narrow femoral intercondylar notch, and an increased posterior tibial slope (PTS), have been implicated in contributing to knee instability and biomechanical abnormalities. Additionally, investigations into sex-specific differences in bony morphology have unveiled distinct risk profiles for males and females. In light of these findings, surgical considerations for individuals with high-risk bony morphology have been developed. Procedures like anterior closing wedge high tibial osteotomy, aiming to address increased PTS, and lateral extra-articular tenodesis for patients with specific risk factors, have been established. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current evidence describing the relationship between bony morphology and ACL injury. Moreover, this review aims to discuss the surgical management and outcomes concerning patients exhibiting high-risk anatomic features.",

Ten patients (76.9%) had deformity due to unrepairable nerve injuries, which were associated with surgical procedures in six patients and trauma in the remaining four. In four feet (26.7%), the TP tendon was turned from the intero-anterior aspect of the tibia and fixed by tenodesis to the lateral cuneiform bone, while in 11 feet (73.4%), it was transferred to the extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum communis, and peroneus tertius tendons. The patients were assessed according to the Stanmore system questionnaire. The mean follow-up was 25.3 months (range 12 to 80 months).According to the Stanmore system, the results were poor in two feet (13.3%), moderate in three feet (20%), good in three feet, and very good in seven feet (46.7%). All the patients were satisfied with the final outcome. The mean foot dorsiflexion was 5 degrees (range, -5 degrees to 10 degrees ), which was 10 degrees in four feet (26.7%), and 5 degrees to 10 degrees in six feet (40%). Apart from complaints of bulging in four patients (30.8%) in the dorsum of the foot due to tendon and suture material, no complications were seen during the early postoperative period.Extramembranous transfer of the TP tendon for the treatment of drop foot deformity enables the patients to walk without the aid of orthosis and increases their quality of life.",

Nine knees (50%) had Ahlbäck grade I, eight knees (44.4%) had grade II, and one knee (5.6%) had grade III osteoarthritis. Pre- and postoperatively, femorotibial angle, tibial inclination angle, and patellar height were measured according to the Bauer, Harvey-Moore, and Blackburne-Peel methods, respectively.

Fifteen knees (83.3%) exhibited a significant decrease in patellar height by a mean of 15% (p<0.05). The mean Lysholm-Gillquist score increased from preoperative 61 to 86 at the latest follow-up (p<0.05).

The children underwent three-dimensional gait analysis and a set of pedobarographic data were obtained. The pedobarographs were analyzed by dividing the foot into five segments.The mean power generation from the ankle was 7.6 watts/kg on the hemiplegic side, and 15.9 watts/kg on the uninvolved side (p=0.000). Based on the pedobarographic data, hemiplegic feet exhibited significantly less heel pressure/impulse (8.0 vs. 24.7; p=0.000), time to heel rise (32.1% of stance phase vs. 61.9%; p=0.000), and decreased pressure of the medial forefoot segment (40.8 vs. 52.2; p=0.009). The children were divided into two groups depending on the ankle power generated on the hemiplegic side (<8.0 watts/kg and =/>8.0 watts/kg). Those with an ankle power generation of =/>8.0 watts/kg had significantly longer step length (49 cm vs. 41 cm; p=0.001) and increased velocity (109 cm/sec vs. 89 cm/sec; p=0.000) in gait analysis, and in pedobarographic measurements, increased heel impulse (11.6 vs. 4.4; p=0.047), time to heel rise (46.6% vs. 17.1%; p=0.000), and less varus/valgus positioning (11.1 degrees vs. -34.6 degrees ; p=0.013). In bivariate correlation analysis, ankle power generation on the hemiplegic side demonstrated a significant association with time to heel rise (r=0.574; p=0.000) and varus/valgus positioning (r=0.420; p=0.017), and almost a significant association with heel pressure (r=0.342; p=0.052).Deviations in the pedobarographic data are reflected in the power generation of the ankle joint and can be of help in decision making of treatment in spastic hemiplegic CP. We speculate that efforts to normalize the heel segment pattern may result in decreased power generation differences.",

We performed anconeus interposition arthroplasty in a 31-year-old male patient who developed heterotopic ossification (HTO) in the elbow following surgical treatment of an isolated radial neck fracture. Treatment with implant removal and excision of the radial head resulted in recurrent HTO and a stiff elbow. The patient underwent excision of the heterotrophic new bone and mobilization of the proximal radius. The anconeus muscle was mobilized and interposed between the proximal radius and ulna. Sixteen months after the operation, forearm rotation, elbow flexion and extension increased by 80 degrees , 45 degrees , and 60 degrees , respectively. Control X-rays showed maintenance of the radiohumeral gap without any signs of HTO.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the frequency of meniscal extrusion and associated knee joint lesions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with meniscal tears. We retrospectively evaluated MRI findings of 100 patients (41 males, 59 females; mean age 54 + or - 10 years; range 27 to 76 years) with meniscal tears in 126 knee joints. Using coronal images, extrusion was defined as a distance of = or > 3 mm between the peripheral border of the meniscus and the edge of the tibial plateau. All the knees were assessed with respect to the localization and type of meniscal tear and extrusion, accompanying joint effusion, cruciate ligament pathologies, and degenerative bone and cartilage changes. Meniscal extrusion was detected in 31 knee joints (24.6%), with a mean extrusion of 3.72 mm. All extrusions were found to be in the posterior horn of the medial meniscus and were associated with radial tears (n=18, 58.1%), radial-oblique tears (n=9, 29%), complex tears (n=2, 6.5%), and flap tears (n=2, 6.5%). Meniscal tears with extrusion differed significantly from those without extrusion with respect to the localization of all the tears being in the posterior horn of the medial meniscus (100% vs. 60%) and the higher frequency (58.1% vs. 20%) of radial tears (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in the types and frequencies of accompanying pathologies seen in meniscal tears with and without extrusion (p>0.05). Meniscal extrusion is a common finding particularly in osteoarthritis. It is mostly seen in the medial meniscus and accompanied by radial tears. Therefore, its presence should alert to the possibility of a radial tear extending to the meniscal root.",

According to the Doyle classification, all injuries were type IVb. Following unsuccessful attempts of closed reduction, the patients were treated with open reduction and K-wire fixation. Cast immobilization of the distal interphalangeal joint was employed for four weeks and rehabilitation was started after removing the K-wires in the sixth week. Radiographic and clinical assessments were made according to the Doyle and Crawford criteria, respectively, after a mean follow-up period of 18 months (range 11 to 34 months).Radiographic union was achieved in all the patients and an anatomic reduction was obtained in 31 patients (91.2%). According to the Crawford criteria, the results were excellent in 27 patients (79.4%), good in four patients (11.8%), and moderate in three patients (8.8%). Patients with a good result had a mean extension loss of 5 degrees , and those with a moderate result had a mean flexion loss of 10 degrees . The remaining patients had full range of motion of the distal interphalangeal joint. None of the patients developed joint subluxation, narrowing of the joint space, or degenerative changes.An anatomical reduction is essential in mallet finger deformities. Open reduction and internal K-wire fixation can be preferred due to its low complication rate and ease of application in patients whose mallet deformity cannot be treated by closed reduction.",

We also investigated the deviation from the normal, and determined the compensation mechanisms by comparing this data with the unaffected feet and with the feet of healthy children. Sixteen children [10 boys, 6 girls; mean age, 6.8 years (range 4-9 years)] with surgically treated unilateral clubfoot and 24 age-matched healthy children were included in the study. Foot length, calf circumference, ankle range of motion, and radiographic measurements were recorded. All time-distance (walking velocity, cadence, step time, step length, double support time), kinematic (joint rotation angles of pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle in sagittal, coronal and transverse planes), and kinetic (ground reaction forces, moments, and powers of hip, knee, and ankle) data were evaluated. Calf circumference and ankle range of motion of involved extremity were significantly less than the unaffected side (p<0.05). Quantitative gait data revealed that children with clubfoot had slower walking velocity (0.75±0.25 m/sec vs. 1.02±0.18 m/sec, p=0.01), shorter stride length (0.72±0.23 m vs. 0.91±0.05 m, p=0.01) than healthy children group. Affected foot of unilateral clubfoot patients had more toe-in than healthy children (-14.24±21.78° vs. 18.54±7.90°, p=0.001). Unaffected side showed increased pelvic excursions and medio-lateral ground reaction forces as well as decreased ankle and hip motion in sagittal plane. Even asymptomatic well-treated children with unilateral clubfoot may have gait deviations both in the affected and unaffected sides. These alterations may also be the result of the subclinical involvement of the so called healthy foot by disease (clubfoot) as well as the compensatory mechanisms.",

Eight patients were beyond 60 years of age. According to the Neer classification, five patients had two-part, 13 patients had three-part neck fractures. The patients were evaluated with range of motion of the shoulder, radiographs, and the Disability of Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH).

Full range of motion of the shoulder was achieved in 11 patients (61.1%), including all with two-part fractures. Abduction losses of 60 degrees to 130 degrees and less than 30 degrees were seen in four patients and three patients, respectively, all of whom were older than 60 years. The mean DASH score was 18 (range 0 to 77). Fourteen patients having a score of less than 10 had no pain or functional complaints. Four patients with a score of more than 10 were older than 70 years.

We investigated the efficiency of different irrigation methods and durations in cleansing contaminated bovine femur cancellous bone samples and the extent of tissue damage associated with irrigation.A total of 72 samples of 4x4x1 cm size were obtained from fresh frozen bovine distal femoral cancellous bone. The top surface of the samples were sawed to a 2-mm depth to create four squares equal in size. All the samples were contaminated with construction sand using the same method and were then randomized to three irrigation groups (bulb syringe irrigation, high-pressure pulsatile lavage, and low-pressure pulsatile lavage), each consisting of 24 samples. The duration of irrigation was set as 3, 6, or 9 minutes for every eight samples of each group. After the irrigation procedure, the images were transferred to a computer screen with a video-microscope camera and the number of sand particles on the samples were counted and irrigation-related macroscopic bone damage was assessed.The lowest number of sand particles was found on the samples irrigated by high-pressure pulsatile lavage (p<0.001). The duration of irrigation did not affect the efficiency of cleansing in all the groups (p>0.05). The least irrigation-related bone damage was observed in samples irrigated by low-pressure pulsatile lavage for 3 minutes (p<0.01). The amount of bone damage was similar in all groups after irrigations beyond 3 minutes (p>0.05).Our findings showed that the most efficient method of cleansing contaminated bone samples was high-pressure pulsatile lavage and that prolonged irrigations did not enhance the efficiency of the irrigation method; however, high-pressure irrigation of 3 minute duration resulted in the greatest bone damage.",

A total of 111 patients underwent surgical treatment for proximal humerus fractures. Of these, nine patients (8 females, 1 male; mean age 73 years; range 56 to 84 years) who had concomitant chronic full-thickness rotator cuff tears were included in the study. According to the AO classification, the fractures were type 11A1 (12C1 also present) in one patient, 11A2 (12C2 also present) in one patient, 11B1 in two patients, 11B2 in three patients, and 11C2 in two patients. None of the patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Fracture fixation was made with the PHILOS plate in five patients, and with the S3 Proximal Humerus Plate in four patients. All full-thickness rotator cuff tears were detected during the operation. Following open reduction and internal fixation after a deltoid splitting incision, rotator cuff tears were repaired by primary suture in two patients, and with a suture anchor in seven patients. All the patients used a padded shoulder-arm sling for six weeks and received a standard rehabilitation program. All the patients were evaluated radiographically and functionally using the Constant-Murley shoulder score at postoperative 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. The mean follow-up period was 17.3 months (range 8 to 30 months). The incidence of full-thickness rotator cuff tears was 8.1%. All the patients had supraspinatus tears, which were accompanied by infraspinatus tears in three patients. The sizes of the tears were classified as large (between 3-5 cm) in three patients, intermediate (between 1-3 cm) in five patients, and small (<1 cm) in one patient. One patient had L-shaped, two patients had U-shaped, and six patients had C-shaped tears. None of the patients had healing problems or avascular necrosis. The mean Constant-Murley shoulder score was 85.4 (range 67 to 100). All the patients were satisfied with the results of surgical treatment. The integrity of the rotator cuff must be checked after reduction and fixation of proximal humerus fractures and, when present, the tears should be repaired simultaneously either primarily or with suture anchors. Simultaneous repair of rotator cuff tears does not negatively affect functional outcomes.",

The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and radiological results of posterior spinal fusion with and without extending the instrumentation to iliac bones in treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.Medical records and radiographies of 36 patients with neuromuscular scoliosis who underwent posterior instrumentation between 2011 and 2015 were reviewed. Age and body mass index at time of surgery, underlying diagnosis, gender, postoperative infection rates, perioperative and postoperative blood transfusion, duration of surgery, complication rates were identified for each patient retrospectively. SF-36 physical questionnaire was applied to all patients. Surgery was performed in each patient and included posterior spinal fusion with pedicle screws from the proximal thoracic spine (T2 or T3) to S1 (Group A) or extension of distal instrumentation to pelvis by bilateral iliac screws (Group B).A total of 23 patients in group A were compared with 13 patients in group B. Median age was 14 (9-38) years for group A and 16 (12-25) years for group B. Median follow-up period was 20 (12-66) months. Preoperative median Cobb angles were 66° and 60° and postoperative Cobb values were 33° and 31° in group A and B respectively. Median Cobb angle reduction was 40° and 34° for group A and B. We are able to see in this study that the usage of illiac screws do not increase implant failure and help achieve better functional results.This study shows that the extention of instrumentation to the pelvis with illiac screws can be beneficial in terms of functional and complicational incidences.Level III, therapeutic study.",

Psychological evaluation was made using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) forms TX 1 and 2. Data were analyzed using the SPSS 11.0 and evaluated with the ANOVA, Tukey, Student's t and post hoc tests. A value of p≤0.05 was considered significant.Mean state anxiety and trait anxiety scores were 43.08 and 42.61, respectively. Depression was diagnosed in 24 of patients and anxiety disorder in 29. Changes in the treatment modality were necessary in 4 patients.Mental and behavioral disorders are rather common in patients with chronic orthopedic diseases. Treatment modalities used for such patients should be established in a bio-psycho-social manner with regards to the psychological and social aspects of the disease.",

Of the scaphoid non-unions, 9 were on the scaphoid body and 4 were on the proximal pole. According to Slade's classification system, there were two Grade 4, eight Grade 5, and three Grade 6 fractures. The patients were all male with a mean age of 31, with 25 months of mean time between the onset of trauma and surgery. All fractures were treated through open reduction with autogenous bone grafting (cancellous in 4 cases; corticocancellous in 9 cases) and fixation with compression screws. Bone morphology and carpal alignment were assessed through radiography, using the scaphoid index and scapholunate angle measurements, respectively. Range of motion and grip strength measurements together with the modified Mayo wrist scores were used in the assessment of wrist functionality.Average duration of follow-up was 16 months. In 10 patients, radiological union was attained in a mean time of 12.4 weeks following the operation. There was a substantial improvement in grip strength and range of motion values after surgery. The preoperative mean modified Mayo wrist score of 41.5 improved to 79.2 postoperatively. Accordingly, 4 patients had perfect, 2 had good, 5 had fair and 2 had poor results. The surgical treatment allowed the preoperative mean scapholunate angle of 45.8° and the preoperative mean scaphoid index of 0.69 to be reduced to 32° and 0.6, respectively. The humpback deformity present in 11 patients before the surgery was restored in 10 patients by reconstruction of the scaphoid bone length. Abnormal carpal alignment was restored in 4 of these patients. No statistically significant correlation was found between the functional results and the surgically attained structural restorations and union process.The surgical treatment of scaphoid fracture non-unions can correct bone morphology and resolve alignment problems but might not be sufficient for the improvement of functional results.",

International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14644 criteria were implemented with respect to the sterility standards.All of the drills produced statistically significantly higher levels of particles than the ambient air (p<0.01).

No bacterial growth was detected in microbiological sampling via blood agar medium in the ambient air. Conversely, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus capitis were isolated from the exhaust air of all running drills. There was no correlation between the number of particles produced by drills and the microbiological sampling.Domestic electric drills are not safe and may be a direct source of surgical site infection, as the use or re-use of these drills during orthopaedic surgery increases the risk of infection with contaminated aerosols that are produced by these devices.",

This was described using VATR variable, defined as the change in the absolute Scoliometer® readings in the time intervals against the time interval Δt between the measurements. During back-contour assessment the differential factor (kra) has been used for the digital analysis. The changes in kra over 54 hours of observation were expressed as Vkra factor, defined as the difference in the absolute value of the amplitude differential factor (kra) in the time intervals against the time interval Δt between the measurements.The highest changes were observed in the thoracic as well as in lumbar spine in patients with Cobb angle ≥30°, axial rotation of the apical vertebrae within 5-15°, Risser sign 0-2. The biggest change in the trunk rotation after Chêneau brace had been taken off was noted within the first two hours of observation.The patients should be advised to take the brace off for a minimum of two hours before the scheduled x-ray, to allow full relaxation of the trunk in order to obtain reliable radiological images of the deformation.Level III Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate which ADAMTS genes play a major role in the development of primary hip osteoarthritis, by comparing the tissue and blood samples in patients with hip osteoarthritis and a control group.Human articular cartilage was obtained from femoral heads of 15 patients with end stage osteoarthritis undergoing total hip replacement. As the control group, the cartilages was obtained from femoral heads of 15 patients, who did not have osteoarthritis or degenerative changes in hip joint, undergoing hip replacement following the fracture of the femoral neck. After the cartilage samples were taken from the resection materials, the DNA polymorphisms in the patients' cartilage samples were tested by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), the serum levels of aggrecanase genes were analyzed with Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).The level of ADAMTS5 and ADAMTS9 genes were found significantly lower as a result of ELISA analysis degenerative arthritis group than the control group (p < 0,05). ADAMTS 1, 4, 8, 15 were similar between the two groups in ELISA analysis (p > 0,05). As a result of quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis, the level of ADAMTS8 mRNA increased 3.5 fold in hip degenerative arthritis group when compared with femoral neck fractures group. ADAMTS1, ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 expression levels in hip degenerative arthritis group were decreased 2.5, 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. ADAMTS9, 15 were found to be similar between two groups.As a result of this study on hip osteoarthritis, the ADAMTS8 levels was found to be significantly higher in the end stage of hip osteoarthritis. Unlike similar studies on knee osteoarthritis, ADAMTS1,4,5 levels were found to be lower.",

Multivariable stepwise analysis included preoperative variables (age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, occupation and participation in sports, Oxford shoulder score at baseline, preceding injury and duration of preoperative symptoms) and arthroscopic findings (size of rotator cuff tear, pathology of the long head of the biceps and cartilage lesions). The change in the Oxford shoulder score at the last follow-up was modeled as a function of the above predictor variables. The time to regain a visual analogue scale (VAS) under two points following surgery was considered the time to regain substantial pain relief.The mean follow-up time was 33.2 ± 14.4 months. Twenty three patients had partial thickness and seventy four had full thickness supraspinatus tears. In third of the patients the tears were defined as large full thickness. At the last follow-up the mean Oxford shoulder score improved from 13.8 ± 4.8 to 42.1 ± 7.2 points (P < 0.001). The mean VAS improved from a preoperative score of 6.7 ± 1.3 points to 1.5 ± 0.6 points postoperatively (P < 0.001) and 80 (83%) patients declared they were satisfied to have had the operation. The mean time interval for substantial pain relief was 4.9 ± 3.6 months. Patients with higher preoperative Oxford shoulder score and larger tear size were correlated with lesser improvement in Oxford shoulder score (R = 0.5, P = 0.001).Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair improved pain and function at an average follow-up of three years. A substantial pain relief was regained within five months from surgery. Larger rotator cuff tear size and more favorable preoperative function were predictors of worse postoperative function.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

In the entire series, eight patients did not display any complications, four cases reported minor complications, and five cases were complicated by refractures.Circular external fixator application combined with periosteal grafting is a superior method of CPT treatment. This method provides a healthy biological healing environment while correcting the mechanical problems. The combination of periosteal and cancellous bone grafts with intramedullary rods and an external fixator addresses issues that complicate obtaining and maintaining a union during the CPT treatment.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

METHODS In this retrospective study, 33 non-athletic patients (34 ankles) in whom open debridement and reattachment surgery was performed for IAT from 2006 to 2016 were included. Change in pain intensity was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) preoperatively and at the final follow-up. Functional assessment was done by preoperative and postoperative American Orthopaedics Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and final follow-up Victorian Institute of Sport Tendon Study Group-Achilles Tendinopathy score (VISA-A). Patient satisfaction was evaluated by Roles - Maudsley score (RMS). The recovery time was defined as the time interval from the first appearance to postoperative relief of symptoms and recording. In addition, the recurrent Haglund's deformity was determined by postoperative control radiographs. RESULTS The mean age at the time of the operation was 51.19 years. The mean follow-up was 61.75±8.49 months. According to BMI, 5 patients were determined as morbid obese, 19 as obese, 3 as overweight, and 6 as normal. The mean VAS score significantly decreased from 8.5 preoperatively to 1.3 postoperatively (p<0.001). The mean AOFAS score significantly improved from 55.8 preoperatively to 92 postoperatively (p<0.001). Postoperative VISA-A score was 86% (range=32%-100%). According to RMS, 22 patients reported the result as excellent, 8 as good, 2 as fair, and 1 as poor. The mean recovery time was 11.8 (range=2-60) months, but one patient did not reach a symptom free status and thus was not included in the recovery time analysis. Postoperative control radiographs revealed signs of recurrence deformity in four patients. Recovery time showed a negative correlation with the age of the patients (r=-0.65). Postoperative scores and BMI showed no significant correlations with the recovery time on the basis of Spearman's rho test (p=0.196). CONCLUSION The results of this study have shown that open debridement and reattachment surgery may be an effective surgical method in relieving pain and improving functional status with high satisfaction rate and acceptable recovery time in the management of non-athletic patients with IAT.

    "abstract": "Objective: The study was aimed to determine the survivorship and functional outcomes of modular endoprosthetic reconstruction in the management of primary and metastatic bone tumors of the lower limbs and to investigate the rate and causes of implant failure.Methods: A total of 84 limbs of 82 patients (49 male, 33 female; mean age=48 years, age range=13-78 years) with a minimum follow-up of 12 months in whom resection and modular endoprosthetic reconstructions were performed for primary or metastatic bone tumors of the lower extremity were retrospectively reviewed and included in the study.The mean follow-up was 43 (range=13-119) months.Functional status was assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system at the final follow-up.Implant survival was defined as the time from implantation until partial or complete exchange of the prosthesis secondary to mechanical or nonmechanical causes or amputation.The effects of the anatomical site on functional scores and implant survival were statistically analyzed.Additionally, the effects of diagnosis and adjuvant treatments on functional scores, implant survival, and failure rates were investigated.Results: At the time of the study, 55 patients were still alive with a mean follow-up of 48 (range=15-119) months.The mean MSTS scores resulting from the final follow-up of all patients and of those surviving were 87.9% (range=16%-100%) and 86.8% (range=16%-100%), respectively.Overall implant survival was 95.2%, 89.2%, 87%, and 87% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively.Statistically, both functional scores and implant survival analysis in different anatomical sites were found similar.In 15 of the patients (17.8%), endoprosthetic reconstructions had failed.The causes of failure were soft tissue failure (dislocation) in 5 patients, infection in 5, structural/mechanical failure in 2, local recurrence in two, and aseptic loosening in one.The diagnosis and receiving preoperative and/or postoperative adjuvant treatment did not affect functional scores, implant survival or failure rates. Conclusion:The results of this study have shown that modular endoprosthetic replacement can provide satisfactory functional results and a durable mid-term limb salvage option in the management of patients with primary and metastatic bone tumors of the lower limbs.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with prolonged tourniquet time has the potential to trigger ischemia-reperfusion injury, which can adversely affect knee function. Studies suggest that the magnitude of injury is less if it occurs following an ischemic event which takes place in another part of the body, known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of oxidative stress on muscle injury and knee function and to elucidate if potential IPC effect can attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury metabolites and prevent poor functional outcomes in single-stage bilateral TKA. Thirty patients who underwent single-stage bilateral TKA under tourniquet were enrolled in the study. All procedures were initiated from the right limb. Upon completion of the procedure, the left tourniquet was inflated 20 minutes after the first tourniquet was deflated. The tourniquet time was noted. Pre- and postoperative levels of malondialdehyde (MDH), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were evaluated. Knee function was assessed postoperatively at 1 month using WOMAC score. Postoperative levels of MDH, CK, and LDH were significantly increased in both extremities compared to preoperative levels. Serum MDH, CK, and LDH levels were not found to be correlated with tourniquet time for either extremity. Compared to the left extremity, the right extremity revealed increased postoperative oxidative stress, which was indicated by elevated serum MDH, CK, and LDH levels. Although tourniquet time and postoperative serum MDH, CK, and LDH levels were not found to be correlated with WOMAC index in either knee, the average change in WOMAC score at 1 month postoperatively was found to be higher in the left knee compared to the right. The biochemical and functional outcomes can be attributed to potential IPC effect. During bilateral TKA, a 20-minute interval between tourniquets can create IPC effect and attenuate the magnitude of ischemia-reperfusion injury, preserving better functional outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Although suprascapular nerve entrapment is rare, the most common site of compression is the suprascapular notch. The anterior coracoscapular ligament (ACSL), which lies inferior to the superior transverse scapular ligament (STSL), may also be a cause of entrapment. We aimed to investigate the presence of ACSL and its relations to the suprascapular nerve and vessels. We dissected 50 shoulders of 26 cadavers. We excluded 2 shoulders due to previous shoulder surgery. We observed the course of the suprascapular nerve, artery, and vein(s), and examined whether they passed between STSL and ACSL or under ACSL. We classified the anatomical relations between neurovascular structures, STSL, and ACSL. In Type I, the suprascapular nerve passed between STSL and ACSL; in Type Iıa, the suprascapular nerve and a single suprascapular vein passed between STSL and ACSL; in Type Iıb, a suprascapular vein passed under ACSL and the suprascapular nerve passed between STSL and ACSL; in Type III, the suprascapular artery, vein, and nerve passed between STSL and ACSL. ACSL was present in 16 shoulders (32%). The suprascapular nerve passed between STSL and ACSL in all cases. We observed Type I, Type Iıa, Type Iıb, and Type III anatomical relations in 14%, 12%, 2%, and 4% of cases, respectively. Vascular structures that pass under STSL may cause suprascapular nerve entrapment. Presence of ACSL with vessel(s) passing under it and/or between it and STSL may increase the risk of nerve entrapment.",

The purpose of this study was to analyze the medical outcomes of delay due to bonesetter intervention and factors affecting patient treatment preference. Among outpatients treated at our clinic between January 2010-December 2012, bonesetter-intervened patients were included, and patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and possible social factors were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical examinations and radiological screening measurements were used to evaluate outcomes. Of the 162 patients, 97 (59.8%) were male, and mean age was 27.5±9.4 years. Eighty-nine (54.9%) of the patients lived in a rural area, and 108 (66.7%) underwent surgery. Bonesetter preference was dictated primarily by elderly relatives (47.6%) or neighbors (33.3%). Patients with a primary school education and unemployed patients mostly preferred bonesetters (p=0.03 and p<0.01, respectively), the explanation for which was the long treatment period and concern of being disabled (p=0.04). Complication rate among patients who were evaluated at a hospital was 33.9%. Despite being medically unreliable and often times harmful, bonesetting is still accepted as an alternative treatment modality among uneducated patient and thus remains an ongoing problem in Turkey. Improvements in average education level and increased dissemination of accurate information via various media and non-governmental organizations will be effective in the correction and prevention of the afore-mentioned complications regarding bonesetter interventions.",

A total of 59 knees of 36 consecutive patients who underwent knee replacement surgery were analyzed retrospectively. MRI scans were assessed independently by 3 observers (radiologists), while the plain radiographs were evaluated by an independent radiologist. Results were compared with the intraoperative ACL status. Cross tabulation was used for descriptive statistics to analyze sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI and plain radiographs. When the same observer assessed and classified the MRI twice, the reproducibility of the classification system varied from moderate to excellent. However, the interobserver concordance was moderate. The sensitivity of MRI was 73% and the specificity was 81%, while the sensitivity and specificity of plain radiographs was 36% and 79%, respectively. The accuracy of MRI was 80%, while that of the radiographs was 71%. Detection of intact ACL may be possible on available plain radiographs without necessity for additional means such as MRI, which may cause increase costs and loss of time. In cases where there is uncertainty regarding ACL integrity in degenerative knees, although standard MRI provides additional information on ACL status, it is not of sufficient diagnostic value.",

The Achilles tendons of 21 Wistar albino rats were cut and repaired. A 0.01 ml organic silicon solution (silanol) was injected peri/intratendinously into the left leg of all rats and the same dose of saline into the right leg postoperatively. Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups for biomechanical testing on Day 10 (7 rats) and Day 20 (7 rats) and histological and immunohistochemical assessment on Day 20 (7 rats). Fibroblast cell count and diameter, tissue vascularity and blood vessel diameter were evaluated by histomorphometry. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) immunoreactivity was analyzed with immunohistochemistry on Day 20. Failure load and stiffness of the repaired tendons were measured on Days 10 and 20. The number of fibroblasts per area, average fibroblast diameter, number of vessels parallel to collagen bundles per area and average vessel diameter were significantly higher in the organic silicon group than in the control group (p<0.05). Strong immunoreactivity of bFGF in the silicon group was detected. Failure load was significantly higher in the silicon group than in the control group on Day 10 (p=0.041). On Day 20, while a difference still existed, this difference was not significant. There was no effect of the silicon injection on stiffness of healing tendons. Organic silicon appears to have a positive effect on tendon healing and is suitable for further studies on host healing response modification.",

Operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative complications were compared between the 2 groups. Spinal radiographs for apical vertebral translation, global coronal balance, major curve Cobb angle, global sagittal balance, thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis were measured in all patients preoperatively and at 2-year follow-up; the results were then compared between the 2 groups. Postoperative correction was calculated for all patients and compared between the 2 groups. The average time of surgery ofthe PSF group was significantly longer than that of the HI group (p<0.05). The amount of bleeding of the PSF group was significantly higher than the HI group (p<0.01). No statistically significant difference was found between the groups in respect to the development of complications (p>0.05). Both the major curve Cobb angle and the global sagittal balance showed greater improvement in the PSF group compared to the HI group (p<0.01). Postoperative correction was better in the PSF group than the HI group. The PSF system provided better improvement than the HI system in major curve Cobb angle and global sagittal balance, and postoperative correction was better in the PSF group than the HI group.",

From 2010 to 2014, 17 patients (12 males and 5 females with a mean age of 44 years (range, 19-62 years)) with severely arthrofibrotic knees were treated with this operative technique. The mean follow-up duration was 23 months. The knee range of motion (ROM) was assessed with a goniometer. The functional outcomes were evaluated according to the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score and Judet's criteria. The ROM significantly improved from 29.7° (range, 7°-56°) preoperatively to 127° (range, 120°-136°) at the final follow-up in all patients (p < 0.001). According to Judet's criteria, all patients achieved excellent results (ROM>100°). The HSS score was improved from 70 points (range, 60-85 points) preoperatively to 91 points (range, 84-98 points) (p < 0.001) at the final follow-up. No extension lag, skin necrosis, quadriceps weakness, wound dehiscence or quadriceps tendon rupture occurred. Mini-invasive quadricepsplasty-associated arthroscopic lysis and manipulation of the knee in flexion is simple and easy and should be considered as a legitimate treatment for arthrofibrosis of the knee.",

Our objective was to investigate whether there is a correlation between the amount of change of the joint orientation angle (JOA) and that of the interscrew angle (ISA) of the eight-plate hemiepiphysiodesis construct before and after correction.After the institutional review board approval, medical charts and X-rays of all patients operated for either genu valgum or genu varum with eight-plate hemiepiphysiodesis were analyzed retrospectively. All consecutive patients at various ages with miscellaneous diagnoses were included. JOA and ISA were measured before and after correction. After review of the X-rays, statistical analyses were performed which included Pearson correlation coefficient and regression analyses.There were 53 segments of 30 patients included in the study. Eighteen were males, and 12 were females. Mean age at surgery was 9.1 (range 3-17). Mean follow-up time was 21.5 (range, 7-46) months. The diagnoses were diverse. A strong correlation was found between the delta JOA (d-JOA) and delta ISA (d-ISA) of the eight-plate hemiepiphysiodesis construct (r = 0.759 (0.615-0.854, 95%CI), p < 0.001). This correlation was independent of the age and gender of the patient.There is a strong correlation between the d-ISA and the d-JOA. The d-ISA follows the d-JOA at a predictable amount through formulas which regression analysis yielded. This study confirms the clinical observation of the diverging angle between the screws is in correlation with the correction of the JOA.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

They had free access to food and water. The right sciatic nerves of 40 rats were transected and repaired. Subjects were divided into 4 groups: controls (control-4 weeks and control-8 weeks) and treatments (treatment-4 weeks and treatment-8 weeks). A combination of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E was applied to the repair site by a catheter placed subcutaneously in the treatment group. Only transection-repair was done in the control group. All groups were divided into 2 subgroups for histomorphological, clinical, and electrophysiological experiments because of concerns about possible interference with histomorphological preparation (5 rats in each group). The experiment results were examined by the thermal plantar test, action potential and latency time measurements, and electron microscopy at the end of 4 and 8 weeks. The intact group was studied as the uninterrupted 10 left sciatic nerves of control for 4 weeks.The mean thermal plantar test results of the intact group were better than those of the control groups (P < .05). However, there was no significant difference between the intact and treatment groups. In the histomorphological examination, the number of myelinated axons increased significantly, and the myelin structure was closer to that of the intact group, especially when the treatment-8 group was compared with the control groups (control-4: P < .0001, control-8: P < .01).Local use of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E seems useful in the experimental rat sciatic nerve transection-repair model.",

This retrospective comparison of groups was conducted between May 2016 and May 2020. The study included 40 people with massive irreparable rotator cuff tear and Hamada grade 1-2 arthropathy who had arthroscopic superior capsular reconstruction with tensor fascia latae autograft or reverse shoulder arthroplasty surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to treatment. Clinical outcome measures included shoulder range of motion, pain, and functional scores (Constant-Murley, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons).The mean age was 61.85 ± 7.56 and 71.10 ± 6.42 years, respectively, for group I [superior capsular reconstruction (n=20)] and group II [superior capsular reconstruction (n=20)]. The mean follow-up was 22.30 ± 8.4 and 32.50 ± 8.11 months, respectively. In the postoperative data, flexion degrees and Constant scores were significantly higher in the superior capsular reconstruction group (P=.007, P = .043). No significant difference was found between the 2 groups in all parameters (P > .05) except abduction. The increase in abduction value in the reverse shoulder arthroplasty group was significantly higher than in the superior capsular reconstruction group (P = .003). In addition, postoperative data in all parameters in both groups showed significant changes compared to preoperatively.This study has shown that superior capsular reconstruction with tensor fascia latae autograft can provide clinical and func- tional improvement similar to the reverse shoulder arthroplasty procedure in treating massive irreparable rotator cuff tears with Hamada grade 1-2 arthropathy.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

The study included 80 knees of 58 patients with a mean age of 65.91 ± 9.04 years. The authors collected 3 samples from the T group (after exposure to the fat pad \"t1,\" just before deflating the tourniquet \"t2,\" just before fascia closure \"t3\") and 2 samples from the NT group (t1 and t3) for each patient. BAX, Bcl-2, and HIF-1α staining showed the extent of cellular hypoxia and apoptosis in IPFP cells, whereas the oxidative stress index (OSI) was determined using a biochemical method. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Knee Society Score (KSS), and Kujala score were used as clinical outcome measures.The mean HIF-1α, BAX/Bcl-2, and OSI scores across all time points were significantly higher in the T group than in the NT group (p<0.001) (d=1.16, 2.9, and 0.9, respectively). The mean BAX/Bcl-2 (P=.030) and HIF-1α (P < .001) scores significantly peaked at t2 in the T group (d=-1.2 and -3.9, respectively). The OSI had higher levels at t1 (P=.011) and t3 (P=.073) (d=0.2 and 0.1, respectively) than at t2 in the T group. The third-month postoperative follow-up revealed that the mean KOOS, KSS, and Kujala score improved significantly compared to the baseline preoperative values (P < .001); however, there was no difference between the T and NT groups regarding the maximum and total knee range of motion or clinical outcome scores.Evidence from this study has shown that tourniquet use during primary TKA may be associated with significantly increased cellular hypoxia, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the IPFP.Level I, Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "The optimal glycemic control marker before total hip or knee arthroplasty remains inconclusive. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is widely used, while fructosamine may be valuable for predicting periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Fructosamine levels can be affected by serum albumin levels; albumin-corrected fructosamine (AlbF) can be calculated to overcome this issue. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of different markers for complications after primary total hip or knee arthroplasty.This prospective cohort study included 304 patients (mean age: 65 years [range, 16-85), mean follow-up: 32 months (range, 12-49)] who underwent primary total hip or knee arthroplasty between 2018 and 2021. Of them, 156 patients had diabetes. Mean HbA1c was 6.5% (range, 4.8%-13%), fructosamine 244 µmol/L (range, 98-566 µmol/L), and AlbF 632 (range, 238-2308). Patients who did and did not have diabetes were matched 1 : 1. Hemoglobin A1c 7% and fructosamine 292 µmol/L were used as cutoff. Complications were documented. Glycemic markers were compared using logistic regression analyses, with a special focus on PJI.In the logistic regression analyses, HbA1c was strongly associated with total complications [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 3.61; 95% CI, 1.65-7.91, P = .001], while fructosamine was associated with PJI (adjusted OR: 13.68; 95% CI, 1.39-134.89, P = .025). Albumin-corrected fructosamine did not show any additional benefits.Preoperative assessment before total hip or knee arthroplasty must not focus on a single marker; HbA1c is a good predictor of total complications, while fructosamine is a better predictor of PJI. To the best of our knowledge, in its first orthopedic study, AlbF did not show any advantages.Level II, Prognostic Study.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated functional results of patients who were treated with cemented modular prosthetic replacement for bone tumors of the extremities.The study included 23 patients (12 males, 11 females; mean age 49 years; range 14 to 81 years) who underwent wide resection and cemented endoprosthetic replacement with the TMTS (Turkish Musculoskeletal Tumor Society) prosthesis for bone tumors. Twelve patients (52.2%; mean age 63.5 years) had metastatic, 11 patients (47.8%; mean age 38 years) had primary tumors. The most common site of involvement was the femur (n=17), followed by the humerus (n=5). Functional evaluations were made with the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system. The mean follow-up period was 24 months (range 1 to 108 months), being 30 months for primary, and 3 months for metastatic tumors.Postoperative complications were seen in seven patients (30.4%), being local recurrences in three patients. During the follow-up period, 11 patients died due to tumoral causes, distant metastasis developed in three patients, and nine patients were tumor-free. Survival was significantly better in patients with primary tumors (p<0.001). All the patients were able to walk without crutches in the postoperative period. The mean MSTS score was 58.9% (range 40% to 90%) in survivors, which was 71.5% (range 60% to 90%) for primary tumors, and 47.4% (range 40% to 73%) for metastatic tumors (p<0.001).Reconstruction with cemented modular endoprostheses is an appropriate surgical alternative in the treatment of large segmental defects after resection of extremity tumors, with satisfactory functional results particularly in primary tumors.",

    "abstract": "We compared two mini skin incision techniques utilized in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).Twenty-seven patients who underwent surgery for CTS were evaluated in two groups according to the site of the mini incision performed for surgical release. A single mini skin incision was performed over the transverse carpal ligament in 12 patients (group 1; 17 hands; 1 man, 11 women; mean age 55 years; range 38 to 66 years), and on the distal side of the ligament in 15 patients (group 2; 17 hands; all women; mean age 54 years; range 34 to 71 years). The two groups were compared with regard to improvement in pain and numbness, rigidity and sensitivity of the scar tissue, time to use the hands, and palmar pinch and grip strengths. The mean follow-up was 26.6 months in group 1, and 23.7 months in group 2.Complete disappearance of symptoms was obtained in 14 wrists (82.4%) in group 1, and in 15 wrists (88.2%) in group 2, with no significant difference between the two groups (p>0.05). Rigidity and sensitivity of the scar tissue were seen in nine wrists (52.9%) in group 1, and in two wrists (11.8%) in group 2 (p<0.05), which lasted 3.5 months and 1.5 months, respectively. In group 2, time to use the affected hand for basic needs (9 days) and normal function (21 days) was significantly shorter, compared to 18 days and 35 days in group 1, respectively (p<0.05). The mean differences of grip and pinch strengths of the two hands were -2.78 kg and -0.60 kg in group 1, and -0.77 and -0.46 kg in group 2, respectively (p>0.05).Although both methods of release yield satisfactory results in the mid- and long-term, mini skin incision performed on the distal side of the transverse carpal ligament is associated with less incision-related morbidity.",

We report a single centre long-term outcome study of Southwick's procedure for the management of moderate or severe stable chronic SCFE with irregularity of the femoral head.In the period from January 1978 to January 1990, 20 patients (16 girls, 4 boys; mean age 13 years; range 11 to 15 years) underwent 22 Southwick osteotomies for chronic stable SCFE with closure or partial closure of the growth plate and a slip between 30 degrees and 70 degrees . All osteotomies were performed by the same surgeon. Patients were followed-up for an average of 22 years (range 16 to 28 years).External rotation deformity was corrected, and the Trendelenburg sign was hardly observable in any of the patients from six months of surgery. Radiographically, all patients showed full consolidation of the osteotomy within two months of surgery. There was no further epiphyseal slipping. We did not encounter any infection or avascular necrosis. Only one patient developed chondrolysis, which resolved fully in eight months. At the latest follow-up, no limb length discrepancy was seen in 18 patients, while two patients had a mean of 0.8 cm shortening. Eight patients (36.4%) showed radiographic evidence for degenerative joint disease, but none were symptomatic.The management of chronic stable (moderate to severe) SCFE by Southwick's osteotomy is safe, but technically demanding. It affords good predictable outcome with a low complication rate.",

We explored the possibility of using oxygen tensiometry as a predictor of incision healing problems in patients undergoing TAA.The study included 25 patients who underwent TAA with the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) system at our institution during a three-year period. Transcutaneous oxygen measurements of both ankles were obtained postoperatively to determine whether the results of transcutaneous oxygen tensiometry correlated with wound healing problems. Patients with wound healing problems were compared with those who had an uneventful incision healing.Seven patients (28%) had wound healing problems after TAA, and five patients (20%) had early wound erythema. Wound healing problems included delayed healing in five patients and dehiscence in two patients. Three patients had transcutaneous oxygen tension of less than 40 mmHg (a threshold for impaired skin oxygenation) on the operative side, of whom one had healing difficulty whereas two did not. When the threshold was extended to 50 mmHg, seven patients (28%) had low readings, two having wound healing problems. There was no significant difference with respect to oxygen measurements between patients with and without wound healing problems (p=0.3).Oxygen tensiometry is not thought to be useful for predicting patients at risk for postoperative wound healing complications after TAA, suggesting that, if adequate pulses are present before surgery, the trauma of using excessive superficial traction on the skin during surgery is more responsible for wound healing problems than the underlying blood supply.",

Because of the mechanism of injury, coexistent PCL avulsion with posterior dislocation of the hip is frequently seen in adults. This coexistence, however, has not hitherto been reported in children. We present an eight-year-old boy with traumatic posterior dislocation of hip and PCL avulsion. He was brought to hospital after a car accident in which his knee hit to the front part of the car when he was driving a bicycle. He had limitation of motion in the left hip with adduction and flexion deformity and a mild swelling and ecchymosis on the popliteal fossa of the left knee. Pelvic X-ray showed posterior dislocation of the left hip. Closed reduction was performed under general anesthesia. Six weeks later, he presented again with a complaint of limitation of motion in the left knee. On a knee radiograph, an avulsed bony fragment was noted near the medial femoral condyle. Three-dimensional computed tomography with reconstruction showed avulsion of a 0.5-cm fragment from the medial femoral condyle. Because of delay, no surgical intervention was attempted and he received physical therapy for quadriceps strengthening and improvement in the range of motion of the knee. One month after physical therapy, he had 120 degrees of knee flexion with no flexion contracture. Twelve months after injury, the patient had a normal hip and near-full knee flexion. He had no rotary instability and was active in sport.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the efficacy of simultaneous interscalene block and catheter analgesia applied as an aid to conservative treatment in improving shoulder functions in patients with frozen shoulder.Three patients (2 women, 1 man; mean age 47 years) with frozen shoulder underwent conservative treatment including manipulation under interscalene brachial plexus block and subsequent rehabilitation under catheter analgesia to improve shoulder range of motion and function. Following manipulation under interscalene block, the patients were hospitalized for 15 to 28 days (mean 21 days) for an exercise program performed by a physiotherapist and orthopedist at least twice a day under interscalene catheter analgesia. Thirty minutes before each rehabilitation session, patient-controlled analgesia was administered via a pain relief pump. Active and passive range of motion (ROM) were measured and the severity of pain was rated using a visual analog scale (VAS) prior to and following interscalene block, during the exercise program, and at the end of the treatment. Functional assessments were made before and after treatment using the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Scale. The exercise program under interscalene analgesia was performed until pain-free and sufficient active movements were obtained, with at least 80% improvement in active and passive motion, a VAS score of 0-2, and an UCLA score of >27.Compared to pretreatment values, the ROM values showed remarkable increases at the end of the treatment. Active ROM reached at least 30 degrees external rotation, 40 degrees internal rotation, 150 degrees flexion, 45 degrees extension, and 100 degrees abduction in all cases. On presentation, the VAS scores of all cases were 10 for both active and passive movements, whereas they ranged from 0 to 2 on discharge. The mean UCLA score increased from 12.3 to 30.3 after treatment. Immediately after the interscalene block, two patients exhibited signs of Horner's syndrome which resolved spontaneously within an hour without the need for treatment. No complications or catheter-related problems such as infection, break-off, or displacement developed throughout the treatment period. There was no requirement for additional analgesia.In patients with frozen shoulder, interscalene block and continuous patient-controlled analgesia via an interscalene catheter provided sufficient analgesia and contributed to the recovery of shoulder functions through an effective and safe exercise program, with no side effects or complications. However, further studies are needed to assess the feasibility of home applications of interscalene patient-controlled analgesia to increase cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.",

A unilateral external fixator was used for lengthening. Lengthening was initiated with a distraction rate of 2x0.5 mm/day in the patient with bilateral involvement of the middle and ring metacarpals. On the tenth day of lengthening, distraction was discontinued due to pain and contracture. Then, distraction was continued with a rate of 2x0.25 mm/day. In all other cases, the distraction rate was 0.5 mm/day. Pre- and postoperative range of motion was measured with a goniometer. Patient satisfaction was evaluated with visual analog scale.The mean pre- and postoperative metacarpal lengths were 34.6 mm (range: 33 to 37) and 49.7 mm (range: 47 to 52), respectively. The mean lengthening achieved was 15.1 mm (range: 14 to 17), while the mean distraction rate was 0.55 mm/day (range: 0.48 to 0.63). No functional loss was observed in the fingers at the final check-up. The patients were happy with the functional and cosmetic results.Distraction osteogenesis is a safe method providing acceptable cosmetic and functional results in patients with congenital metacarpal shortness. The length of metacarpals and muscles that will be affected from lengthening should be considered when determining the daily rate of distraction.",

This study included 14 patients, between 15 and 70 years old, whose causes of amputation were tumor, diabetes, Burger's disease, osteomyelitis, and traffic accident. Fifteen stumps in 14 patients, one of whom was bilateral, were evaluated. The elastic bandaging was applied for five stumps, the pneumatic prosthesis for five stumps, and temporary prosthesis for five stumps. A decrease in stump volume was observed for at least 2 or 3 weeks after the use of all three methods in patients who came to the Prosthetics and Orthotics Laboratory at Ankara University. The volume decrease induced by temporary prosthesis fitting was more significant than that achieved using elastic bandaging or pneumatic prosthetics (p<0.01). The greatest volume changes were identified distally for the elastic bandage group, proximally for the pneumatic group, and medially for the temporarily applied prosthesis group. The temporary prosthesis group took less time to permanent prosthesis (39 days) and required less prosthesis training (p<0.01). Three amputees in the elastic bandaging group had postoperative contractures. Use of a temporary prosthesis results in ideal shaping of the stump in the shortest period of time. This approach also shortens the period of transition to permanent prosthesis, improves the quality of life of the amputee, and re-integrates the patient to normal life over a shorter period of time.",

Conclusion:The first results of Micronail ® are promising.It has the advantages of other operative techniques (minimally invasive, stable, intramedullar) without their known disadvantages.Short immobilization is sufficient, after which full load-carrying exercises are indicated.",

Patients were divided into two groups. Group A included 76 patients who were tested with ECG only and Group B included 27 patients with additional clearance. All of these files were reviewed according to a set pro forma. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 17 software. The Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were applied to compare two means.Fifty-three patients had intertrochanteric fractures and 50 had femoral neck fractures. Only 7 patients had a metabolic equivalent task of less than 4. Group B patients had significant delay in time from triage to surgery (p<0.0001) and from surgery to ambulation (p<0.005). Group B patients also had an increased length of hospital stay, although no significant effect on perioperative mortality was observed.Preoperative cardiac evaluation is associated with delay in surgery and subsequent ambulation. Delay in surgery is not associated with increased perioperative mortality at our institute. However, the set of guidelines proposed by ACC/AHA should be followed, as the selection of patients for additional investigation was not justifiable in most cases.",

At this unusual age and location, there is a greater probability of missed diagnosis, due to the lack of definite informative incidence, and difficulty in finding the lesions during arthroscopic examinations. In the present case, multiple loose bodies were hidden by the meniscus, and thus, there were no structural abnormalities in the initial arthroscopic views before probing the meniscus.

Pain was the principal reason for surgery. All operations were carried out by the same senior surgeon. Patients were evaluated in terms of range of motion, DASH and VAS scores, satisfaction, and grip/tip/palmar/key pinch strength compared with contralateral sides. Preoperative carpal height indexes and findings of osteoarthritis were determined radiographically and compared with postoperative evaluations.Mean duration of follow up was 15.2 months. Mean DASH and VAS scores were 13.8 2.7 and 2 1.1 respectively. The mean patient satisfaction score was 3.2 0.4 over 4 points. The mean grip strength in the operated hands was 66.4%, palmar pinch was 75.1%, tip pinch was 71.8% and key pinch was 70.4% when compared to the contralateral unaffected sides. The mean flexion range in the operated hands was 58.8%, extension range was 60.3%, radial deviation range was 65.2% and ulnar deviation range was 65.7% when compared to the contralateral sides. There was no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative carpal height ratios (p = 0.086).Our early term results indicate that lunate excision combined with capitohamate fusion may be an alternative treatment option in patients with stage IIIB and IIIC Kienböck's disease.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

Fifty four patients, who had been found to experience TCS were accepted as group 1 and sixty-two patients without TCS as group 2. Cast index, pre-/post reduction translation, pre-/post reduction angulation, localization and displacement of the fracture, need for re-manipulation, and presence of associated distal ulna fracture were evaluated for both groups. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate cut off value for cast index values for both TCS and loss of reduction and logistic regression analysis of the other possible factors.Pre-/post-reduction translation (over 50% and 10%, respectively) (odds ratios:0.167 and 0.524, respectively), a cast index value below than 0.775 (odds ratio:3.080), displaced type fracture (odds ratio:8.028), presence of re-manipulation (odds ratio:0.131) and associated distal ulna fracture (odds ratio:2.029) were found to be statistically significantly important for the occurrence of TCS. The most important factors were decreased cast index value and presence of initially displaced type fracture. Loss of reduction (LOR) risk was found to be increased in patients with a cast index value of greater than 0.875.One should be very careful when following a pediatric patient who have a displaced distal radius fracture which has initial/post reduction translation in AP plane, which is associated with distal ulna fracture, which required re-manipulation and most importantly which cast index is under than 0.775 in terms of occurrence of TCS. We recommend obtaining a cast index value between 0.775 and 0.875 to prevent both TCS and LOR.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

Group NO (n = 134; 19 men and 115 women; mean age: 66.48 ± 7.66) (patients who were not treated with TXA); group DIV (n = 158; 14 men and 144 women; mean age: 65.67 ± 7.98) (total dose of 10 mg/kg intravenous TXA divided into two doses: 15 minutes before tourniquet inflation and 15 minutes before tourniquet deflation), an extra 5 mg/kg intravenous TXA dose was administered 2 hours after surgery in the orthopedic ward, if needed; and group INF (n = 193; 33 men and 160 women; mean age: 67.08 ± 7.2) (10 mg/kg TXA perioperative intravenous infusion starting 15 minutes before surgery until closure of the wound, and 5 mg/kg additional intravenous dose was administered 12 hours after surgery). Pre-postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Htc) difference, total blood loss (TBL), number of transfused packed red blood cells (pRBC), and length of hospital stays (LOS) were compared between the groups.TBL was lower in group INF (531.61 ± 316.76 mL) in comparison with group DIV (999.91 ± 352.62 mL). TBL was statistically significantly higher in Group NO (1139.23 ± 43 mL). The mean number of transfused pRBC was significantly higher in the control group (1.22 ± 0.58 units) than the in the other TXA groups. The mean number of transfused pRBC was significantly lower in INF group (0.33 ± 0.56 units) than DIV group (0.75 ± 0.63 units). The number of patients requiring transfusion was significantly lower in INF group (28.5%) than DIV group (65.2%). Group NO had the highest number of patients requiring transfusion (96.3%). Pre-postoperative Hb and Htc difference was significantly lower in INF group (-1.19 ± 0.9 gr/dL and -3.74 ± 2.96%).

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to measure the cartilaginous coverage of the acetabulum using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to analyze its effect on the timing and necessity of secondary operations in residual acetabular dysplasia (RAD).The MRI results of 33 children (30 girls and 3 boys) aged between 5 and 9 years who were operated on unilaterally via a posteromedial limited approach were compared with the radiographical findings of acetabular dysplasia at follow-up. The acetabular index (AI) and the center-edge (CE) angles were measured. MRI was used to measure the osseous acetabular index (OAI), cartilage acetabular index (CAI), and cartilaginous center-edge angles (CCE). The Children's Hospital's Oakland Hip Evaluation Score (CHOHES) was used for the assessment of clinical and functional results. The Severin scoring system was used to evaluate the radiographic results. The Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation tests were used for statistical analysis.In all, 30 (90.9%) girls and 3 (9.1%) boys with an average age of 7.4 years (range: 5-9 years) and a mean follow-up period of 6.1 years (range: 4-8 years) were included. While there was a significant difference between non-dislocated hips and operated hips in 3 measurements (AI, Wiberg CE, and Ogata CE) using X-rays (p < 0.05), no significant difference was found in the MRI measurements (OAI, CAI, and CCE) (p > 0.05). The CAI values were lower than the AI measured on X-ray (p = 0.035). The mean CCE was higher than the mean CE (p = 0.022). The mean CHOHES score was 83.1 (range: 52-100) and the score of 62% patients was above 90. There was no significant difference in terms of CHOHES score according to age at the time of operation (p = 0.43). Three (9.1%) patients were Severin class I, 8 (24.3%) patients were class II, 12 (36.3%) patients were class III and 10 (30.3%) patients were class IV. There was no correlation between preoperative hip dislocation and Severin score (p = 0.056). No significant difference was found between the ambulatory and non-ambulatory groups in terms of Severin classification (p = 0.063).Cartilaginous acetabulum should be taken into account in RAD measurements. MRI may be a more appropriate option for the evaluation of acetabular cartilaginous coverage in the evaluation of RAD and the decision to perform surgery, though X-rays are currently the most used method. The results revealed no effect on functional or radiological scores as a result of being of walking age.Level III, Diagnostic Study.",

The patient was a 2-year-old girl at the time of diagnosis, and there was a huge mass in pelvic region. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, type 1 pelvic resection and pelvic reconstruction with bone cement performed. The patient presented with relapse and lung metastasis 6 months after the surgery.

In total, 24 fourth-generation humerus sawbones were used in the experiment. Osteotomy was performed at the humerus shaft, and a defect was created by removing 1 cm of bone. After pre-loading 5000 cycles at a frequency of 2 Hz and a force of 50-250 N for axial loading and 5000 torsion torques between 0.5 Nm and 6.5 Nm at a 2 Hz frequency for torsional loading, the failure load values of each load were recorded. Distal interlocking was performed with an endopin in group 1, while a double cortex screw was used in group 2.All samples successfully passed the cyclic loading. The initial and final stiffness values were similar between the groups after axial loading (p = 0.873 and p = 0.522, respectively). The mean axial failure load values in groups 1 and 2 were 2627 ± 164 N and 7141 ± 1491 N, respectively. A significant difference was found in the axial failure load values (p = 0.004). Significant differences were observed between the initial and final torsional stiffness between the two groups (p = 0.004 and p = 0.004, respectively). No significant difference was found in the failure load values after torsional loading (11791 ± 2055 N.mm and 16997 ± 5440 N.mm) (p = 0.055).These results provide a biomechanical demonstration of the adequate stability of both nails after axial and rotational loading. The reliability of the newly developed InSafeLOCK humeral nail system, which does not require fluoroscopic control and an additional incision for distal locking, supports its use in the clinic.",

The patients were then randomly divided into 3 groups (30 in each): group 1, without injection; group 2, with periarticular injection of 20 mL 0.5% bupivacaine hydrogen chloride (HCl) (100 mg) after implantation; and group 3, periarticular injection of 20 mL 0.5% bupivacaine HCl (100 mg) after implantation and incisional injection of 10 mL 0.5% bupivacaine HCl (50 mg) before wound closure. Post-operative pain levels were measured using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 mm: no pain and 100 mm: worst pain) at 30 min and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h, post-operatively.The mean VAS score in group 3 (the combined group-periarticular and incisional injections) within the first 4 h was lower than that in group 1 and group 2 (p<0.001). The mean VAS scores at the first 30 min were 65.21±9.46 in group 1, 51.86±5.96 in group 2, and 29.33±8.55 in group 3 (p<0.001). The mean VAS scores at the first 1 h were 64.43±9.32 in group 1, 47.26±4.77 in group 2, and 31.66±7.37 in group 3 (p<0.001). The mean scores at the 2 h were 61.46±8.62 in group 1, 48.33±4.66 in group 2, and 30.83±6.76 in group 3 (p<0.001). The mean scores at the 4 h were 64.72±8.91 in group 1, 47.53±4.35 in group 2, and 34.36±6.64 in group 3 (p<0.001). The differences were not significant at 6 h between group 2 (44.91±4.12) and group 3 (41.83±6.71) (p>0.001). However, the values were significantly lower than those of the control group (63.56±9.73) (p<0.001). In addition, VAS scores at all follow-up times were significantly higher in the control group compared with the other groups (p<0.001).Evidence from this study revealed that the combined injection of bupivacaine is more effective than its periarticular injection alone and provides effective post-operative pain management after TKA.Level I, Therapeutic study.",

Standardized fractures were created in the right femurs of the rats and then fixed with an intramedullary Kirschner wire. Four experimental groups were administered 2 mg/kg/day kirenol (Groups C and G) and 4 mg/kg/day (Groups D and H) kirenol by oral gavage.Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed at two time points as follows: on the 10th day (Groups B, C and D) and on the 21st day (Groups F, G and H) after the surgery; fracture healing in each group was assessed radiologically and histopathologically. The Radiographic Union scale of tibia fracture scoring system was used in the radiological examination; callus volume and density were measured using computed tomography. In the histopathologic examination, the scoring system described by Huo et al. was used. Additionally, the mechanism of action was evaluated based on the analyses of protein expression of Wnt3a, LRP5, TCF-LEF1, β-catenin, and Runx-2 proteins using western blot analysis.Among the animals sacrificed on the 10th day after the surgery, the highest histopathological and radiological scores were observed in Group D (p<0.05). Furthermore, the callus density (p<0.05) was highest in Group D. Among the animals sacrificed on the 21st day, the highest histopathological and radiological scores were found in Group H, although the differences among the groups were not significant (p>0.05). The callus volume and density were the highest in Groups G and H, respectively, although the differences among groups were not significant.Kirenol may improve fracture healing in a dose-dependent manner with the early activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the activation of the Runx-2 pathway.",

Patients' injured finger and defect type were recorded. At the last follow-up, the static two-point discrimination (s2PD) test, Semmes Weinstein monofilament (SWM) test, and range of motion of the affected finger were analyzed. We interviewed patients to determine hand dominance, cold intolerance, and their satisfaction with the result. We performed correlation and logistic regression analyses between patient satisfaction and outcome measures.The mean follow-up period was 13.8 (7-18) months. The mean range of motion was 77.3±3.5 (70-80) degrees for the distal interphalangeal joints of affected fingers. The mean s2PD was 6.4 (3-10) mm, and the SWM records ranged from 2.83 to 4.93 monofilament markings. Cold intolerance was noted in seven fingers (41%). Patient satisfaction was negatively correlated with cold intolerance, and cold intolerance decreased as the follow-up period extended.IDAP flap satisfies both patient and surgeon, with the only significant problem being cold intolerance, regarding which patients must be informed. Although cold intolerance is hard to treat, fortunately, it generally improves with time.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "Objective This study aimed to investigate the reasons behind the compliance, diagnostic success, and failure of ultrasound (US) examinations of two radiologists with reference to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the abnormalities of subscapularis (SSC) tendon, including tendinosis. Methods One less experienced radiologist (operator-1) and one senior radiologist, experienced in the musculoskeletal US (operator-2), performed the shoulder US on 78 patients (mean age: 53.18 ± 10.89 [22-73] years), who had undergone MRI for routine reasons except malignancy, within 1-4 weeks of MRI. Tendinopathy, partial (PT), or full-thickness (FT) tears were recorded in the subscapularis. The thickness of the anterior and lateral soft tissues in the shoulder girdle was measured by MRI. The inter-operator agreement on the US results, the US-MRI compliance for each operator, and the relationship between the US-MRI compliance and tissue thickness were investigated. Results The inter-operator agreement on the US findings was moderate. The US-MRI compliance was fair for operator-1, but substantial for operator-2. The circumferential soft tissue thickness and US-MRI compliance were not correlated (p>0.05). The interobserver agreement in US was moderate (K: 0.415). The US-MRI compliance was fair for operator-1 (K: 0.344) and substantial for operator-2 (K: 0.616). The accuracy rates for the differentiation of normal tendon, tendinosis, PT, and FT were 59%, 75%, 72%, and 100%, respectively, for operator-1 and 87%, 83%, 85%, and 100%, respectively, for operator-2. However, the respective sensitivity of operator-1 was 46%, 19%, 44%, and 100%; and operator-2 was 91%, 67%, 82%, and 100%. The diagnostic performance of operator-1 was lower, except for FT. Conclusion The thickness of the surrounding tissue does not affect the US results. The differentiation between tendinosis and PT tear is difficult (more prominent in less experienced user); however, because this would not change the treatment choice, shoulder US is recommended after basic training in subscapularis pathologies.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the Nonarthritic Hip Score (NAHS) into Turkish and determine the validity and reliability of the translated version in physically active patients with hip pain. METHODS Sixty young to middle-aged and physically active patients (34 women and 26 men; mean age=35 years; age range: 18-40 years) with hip pain were included in the study. The original version of the NAHS was first translated into Turkish and back-translated into English by two bilingual translators each. The back-translated version was compared with the initial English version by a committee of the four translators. The Turkish version was then tested with 15 patients with hip pain and 15 healthy individuals. The participants were asked whether they had difficulties in understanding the questions. Subsequently, the questionnaire was accepted for use in the study population. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were assessed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha, respectively. The construct validity was determined via the Pearson correlation coefficient between the NAHS and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), and Short Form-12 (SF-12). Floor and ceiling effects were analyzed. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to test construct validity. RESULTS An ICC of 0.994 and Cronbach's alpha value of 0.908 were obtained; thus, the Turkish version of the NAHS was reliable. Neither floor nor ceiling effects (15%) were found in the sub-parameters (8.3-1.7%) and the total score (1.7%) of the NAHS. The EFA test showed that this questionnaire had four factors. Model fit indices in CFA were χ2/df=2.23, Tucker-Lewis index=0.90, comparative fit index=0.91, goodness of fit index=0.63, root mean square error of approximation=0.14 (90% CI: 0.12-0.16). The NAHS total score showed an excellent correlation with WOMAC (r=-0.909), mHHS (r=0.850), and SF-12 (r=0.811) scores. CONCLUSION The Turkish version of the NAHS is a valid and reliable questionnaire for young and physically active patients with hip pain. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level II, Diagnostic study.",

The patients were nonrandomly assigned to receive PKP (62; 16 men, 46 women) and PMCP (60; 14 men, 46 women). The epidemiological data, surgical outcomes, and clinical and radiological features were compared between the 2 groups. Cement leakage, height restoration, deformity correction, canal compromise, and cement distribution were calculated from the radiographs. Visual pain analog scale (VAS), the Oswestry disability index (ODI), and short-form 36 health survey domains role physical (SF-36 rp) and bodily pain (SF-36 bp) were calculated before surgery and immediately and 2 years after surgery.Although VAS, ODI, SF-36 bp, and SF-36 rp scores improved from 7 (6-9), 71.28±16.38, 22 (0-32), and 25 (0-50) preoperatively to 2 (1-3), 20.02±8.97, 84 (84-84), and 75 (75-100) immediately postoperatively in the PMCP group (p<0.05) and from 7 (6-8), 71.40±13.52, 22 (10.5-31.75), and 25 (0-50) preoperatively to 2 (1-3), 21.78±11.21, 84 (84-84), and 75 (75-100) immediately postoperatively in the PKP group (p<0.05), there was no difference between the 2 groups. The mean cost in the PKP group was less than that in the PMCP group ($5109±231 vs. $6699±201, p<0.05). Anterior, middle, and posterior vertebral body height ratios in the PMCP group were greater than those in the PKP group postoperatively (88.44%±3.76% vs. 81.10%±11.78%, 86.15%±3.50% vs. 82.30%±11.02%, and 93.91%±3.01% vs. 91.43%±6.71%, respectively, p<0.05). The Cobb angle in the PMCP group was lower than that in the PKP group postoperatively (6.67°±4.39° vs. 8.99°±4.06°, p<0.05). Cement distribution in the PMCP group was higher than that in the PKP group (30.48%±5.62% vs. 27.18%±4.87%, p<0.05). Cement leakage was observed to be lesser in the PMCP group (2/60) than in the PKP group (10 vs. 62, p<0.05).Both PKP and PMCP treatments seem to have significant ability in pain relief and functional recovery. Despite its higher cost, PMCP treatment may have a better inhibition ability of cement leakage, cement distribution, height restoration, and improvement in segmental kyphosis than PKP treatment for osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures.Level II, Therapeutic Study.",

Methods A total of 191 patients (105 women and 86 men; mean age 82.26±9.681 [60-108] years) with AO/OTA 31A2.2 intertrochanteric fractures and treated with sliding hip screw, proximal femoral nail, or hemiarthroplasty were included in this retrospective cohort study. The treatment type was decided by the responsible surgeon according to the patients' pre-injury activity level, bone quality, and features of the fracture. Age, sex, type of fracture, type of surgery performed, American society of anesthesiology (ASA) grade, type of anesthesia, time to surgery, type of physical therapy, length of hospital stay, and number of comorbidities were documented. We evaluated the 30-day and 1-year mortality of patients treated with sliding hip screw (SHS), proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFN-A), or hemiarthroplasty and identified the possible risk factors for mortality. Results A total of 49 patients underwent SHS, 58 underwent PFN-A, and 84 underwent hemiarthroplasty. Of these, 2 patients with SHS, 2 with PFN-A, and 11 with hemiarthroplasty died within 30 days after surgery, whereas 7 patients with SHS, 15 with PFN-A, and 23 with hemiarthroplasty died 1 year after surgery. The 30-day and 1-year overall mortality rates were 7.9% and 23.6%, respectively. Both the 30-day and 1-year mortality risks were higher in patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty than in patients undergoing SHS (p=0.068 versus 0.058). The 30-day mortality was higher in patients receiving general anesthesia than in those receiving combined spinal and epidural anesthesia (p=0.009). The 1-year mortality risk was higher in patients with ASA grade 4 than in those with grade 1 and 2 (p=0.045). Advanced age (p=0.022) and male sex (p=0.007) were also found to be the risk factors for 1-year mortality. Conclusion We demonstrated that higher ASA grade, male sex, general anesthesia, and hemiarthroplasty procedures are associated with higher mortality rates in elderly patients with hip fractures. Thus, we highly recommend orthopedic surgeons to consider all these factors in the management of intertrochanteric hip fractures in the geriatric population.

A total of 41 age-matched healthy individuals (19 women; mean age ± Sd = 54.88 ± 13.63) were designated as the control group. In each group, both typical and atypical SD criteria were radiologically examined. The demographic data and presence of SD between the control group and 3 subgroups of TSS pathomechanisms were evaluated.SD characteristics were identified in 83.33% (15/18) of patients in the TDH group, 44.44% (16/36) in the OLF group, 25% (3/12) in the OPLL group, and 17.07% (7/41) of the control individuals. When analyzed by the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis, the presence of SD was significantly associated with TDH (P < 0.01) and OLF (P < 0.05) but not OPLL (P > 0.05). Patients with TDH and OLF showed peak involvement of T10/11, and patients with OPLL did not. Furthermore, we determined that age, sex, body-mass index, and smoking status were not the risk factors for TDH, OPLL, and OLF (P > 0.05). SD was found to be a risk factor for TDH (P < 0.01) and OLF (P < 0.05) but not for OPLL (P > 0.05).Evidence from this study indicated that SD might be a risk factor for OLF and TDH but not for OPLL.",

The patient were then divided into two groups based on the implemented surgical technique: Group A, 20 patients (16 male, 4 female; mean age = 43.41 ± 15.50) receiving screw fixation alone and group B, 22 patients (17 male, 5 female; mean age = 43.38 ± 14.00) receiving screw with small locking plate fixation. The radiographic assessment included Bohler's, Gissane, joint line parallel, and calcaneal varus angles at immediate post-operative and 2-year follow up period through the calcaneal axial and lateral foot radiographs.There was a significant increase in joint line parallel angle from post-operative period to 2-year follow up in Group A compared to Group B, mean (SD) 3.27 (2.15) degrees versus (vs) 0.44 (3.00) degrees, P = 0.025.

A total of 90 patients were included and prospectively allocated to one of three groups: the combined group (n= 30, 14 male, 16 female; mean age = 54.9 ± 12 years), intravenous (IV) group (n = 30, 13 male, 17 female; mean age = 54.9 ± 12.3 years), and local group (n = 30, 13 male, 17 female; 50.3 ± 12.3). Tranexamic acid was used systemically by IV application (15mg/kg) in IV group, locally in the surgical field (2g) in local group as well as combined systemic and local together in combined group. The amount of blood loss, number of erythrocyte suspension transfusion, and changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were documented accordingly. The estimated mean tranexamic acid and erythrocyte suspensions cost, extra nurse care, monitoring and laboratory costs associated with blood transfusion, and total hospital costs were compared among groups.No differences existed in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels after surgery among the groups. The combined group required fewer blood transfusion compared to the local and IV groups, and the total amount of ES was statistically significantly lower (P = 0.039) in the combined group. Although the medication cost was higher in the combined group than in the other groups (P < 0.001), combined group was more cost-effective (P < 0.001) when the total costs related to blood loss were evaluated. No occurrence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was found in the study.Combined administration of IV and local tranexamic acid seems to be more effective in reducing the requirement and amount of blood transfusion without increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications in primary THA compared to IV or local administrations. Despite increasing the prophylaxis costs, combined administration of TXA can result in lower total hospitalization costs by decreasing blood loss and consequent treatment costs in primary THA.Level I, Randomized Controlled Trial.",

The changes in the rates of several surgical interventions after the start of screening program were identified.Between 2012 and 2019, 831 interventions were applied to 711 DDH patients. Closed Reduction (CR) is the least invasive treatment method, and it increased significantly from 20% to 46%. The rate of Open Reductions (OR) also increased from 3% to 9% at this time period, but it was statistically insignificant. Conversely, Pemberton-Salter Osteotomy (PSO) and Dega-Chiari Osteotomy (DCO) rates decreased significantly (41% to 28% and 9% to 0%, respectively). The rate of Pemberton- Salter osteotomy with femoral shortening (PSO-FS) rate decreased insignificantly from 27% to 20%. In patients that used Pavlik harness, the most common intervention was CR (83%). In CR group, the screened newborn rate increased more than two times from 2012 to 2019.The results of this study have shown that after the initiation of the screening program for DDH, less invasive treatment modalities such as CR and OR interventions increased, and major bony procedures such as PSO, PSO-FS and DCO interventions decreased. Furthermore, as the screening program advanced, CR rate and the use of Pavlik harness rate in CR interventions increased.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

We, herein, presented the case of a 79-year-old male patient who suddenly started experiencing marked right hip pain. Radiography showed that the femoral head was spherical; however, after 3 months, approximately half of the femoral head was destroyed despite there being almost no change in the acetabulum. Radiographs of the spine also showed fusion between multiple vertebrae. Significant osteoporosis was observed on roentgenography, together with decreased bone density. Urinary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that a large amount of homogentisic acid was excreted. During total hip arthroplasty, gray and muddy contents were observed in the joint capsule, and the surface of the destroyed femoral head was black. Histopathologically, granulomatous foci containing fragmented bone and cartilage debris were found in the bone marrow space of the joint surface, and the cartilage tissue was pigmented brownish black. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with ochronotic hip joint destruction. The present case report is the first to demonstrate rapidly destructive coxopathy associated with alkaptonuria using both imaging and histopathological findings. These findings clearly show that severe hip joint destruction defined as rapidly destructive hip arthropathy can occur in a very short time period for patients with alkaptonuria.",

    "abstract": "Snapping scapula syndrome represents a rare entity in shoulder surgery. Clinically, it presents as shoulder pain and loud crepitus during shoulder movement. Moreover, glenohumeral bursitis can cause additional pain. Snapping scapula syndrome is caused by an increased angulation of the superomedial part of the scapula combined with bursitis. Other common causes such as subscapular osteochondroma or rib fracture non-unions were excluded. We report a 24-year-old female patient with persisting shoulder pain and disturbing crepitus during movement of the left shoulder. Radiographic examination revealed increased angulation of the superomedial scapula on both sides and MRI, bursitis of the left shoulder. The patient was successfully treated with minimally invasive arthroscopic trimming of the prominent osseous formation at the left scapula combined with bursectomy. Additionally, specific pain-adapted physiotherapeutic exercises of both shoulders were performed. The patient had a pain-free shoulder movement without crepitus on both sides at the 6th month follow-up.",

    "abstract": "A knee fusion is associated with considerable restrictions, including the inability to sit properly, use public transportation, and climb stairs. The purpose of this study is to report and discuss our cases of spontaneous ankylosed knees which were taken down and underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Six patients who experienced spontaneous ankylosis of the knee undergoing conversion to TKA between 2003-2012 were enrolled retrospectively in this study. The etiology was childhood pyogenic arthritis in 2 patients, intraarticular fractures in 2, gunshot in 1, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in 1. The clinical data were recorded with the use of the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee rating system, Western Ontario and McMaster Questionnaire (WOMAC), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), preoperatively and postoperatively at final follow-up. The average follow-up time was 86 months (range: 22-126 months). At the final follow-up, the average range of active flexion was 85° (range: 75-95°). Postoperative average HSS knee rating system was improved from 19.5 (range: 18-22) to 57.49 (range: 46-80), WOMAC was improved from 39.75 (range: 36.4-43) to 62.41 (range: 50.8-74.5). VAS was improved from 9.5 (range: 7-9) to 2.8 (range: 2-4). A pyogenic infection developed in 2 patients; 1 was managed by debridement, and 1 was managed by arthrodesis 2 years later. The ability to walk and sit in a normal fashion is of great importance for patients. With good preoperative planning and careful handling, gratifying results are possible with TKA.",

Between 2011-2014, 29 patients with LE (15 women, 14 men; mean age: 46 years; range: 33-79) who received at least 6 months of conservative treatment methods and did not achieve full recovery and thus underwent arthroscopic surgery were included in this study. One patient was excluded from the functional assessment. Mean follow-up was 20.5 months (range: 7-42). Mean preoperative and postoperative Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores were 81.1±17.5 and 34.7±26.8 (p<0.0001), respectively, and Mayo Elbow Performance Scores (MEPS) were 48.5±11.5 and 101.2±22.9 (p<0.0001), respectively. Twenty-one patients (75%) were satisfied with the functional outcome. As a result, LE treated with the arthroscopic method, with its low complication rate, successful degenerated tendon debridement, and decortication of the lateral epicondyle, is a useful method for intervention in pathologies such as annular plica, loose body, synovial hypertrophy, and radiocapitellar chondropathy.",

The most common (67%) mechanism of injury was ground-level fall, predominantly involving elderly patients. Results were evaluated in terms of union time, implant failure rate, infection rate and functional outcome.Mean duration of surgery was 2.4 hours and average length of hospital stay was 7 days. Mean radiological healing time was 16 weeks. Good healing occurred in 31 (94%) patients within 6 months of surgery. Uneventful healing occurred in 28 (85%) patients and 3 (9%) had delayed healing requiring dynamization in two patients and bone grafting in one. Implant failure occurred in 2 (6%) patients within 2 months of index surgery requiring repeat surgery. One (3%) patient had varus malunion.Intramedullary nailing with spiral blade is a good option for acute subtrochanteric fractures with promising results. We think that this is a superior device compared to conventional methods of fixation for subtrochanteric fractures.",

Thirty lumbar vertebrae were harvested from 6 calves and bone mineral densities (BMD) were measured. Primary polyaxial pedicle screws were randomly inserted and pulled out and the POSs of the specimen were recorded. For revision, specimens were randomly assigned to the CAS-augmented pedicle screws group (Group 1) or PMMA-augmented pedicle screw group (Group 2). Pull-out tests were repeated to compare both groups. Mean BMD of the specimens was 1.006 ± 0.116 g/cm(2). There were no statistically significant differences between BMD results of the two groups (p=0.116). For Group 1, mean POS of primary screws was 2,441.3 ± 936.4 N and was 2,499.5 ± 1,425.1 N after CAS augmentation, demonstrating no statistically significant difference (p=0.865). In Group 2, mean POS of the primary screws was 2,876.6 ± 926.6 N and significantly increased to 3,745.5 ± 1,299.2 N after PMMA augmentation (p=0.047). There was also a significant difference in mean POS between the CAS and PMMA groups (p=0.026). Although CAS augmentation facilitates a revision screw POS as strong as that of primary screws, it is not as strong as PMMA augmentation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to test if robotic surgery can be used while performing hip arthroscopy. Hip arthroscopy was performed on two hip joints of a fresh-frozen male human cadaver. The arthroscopic control of the femoral head and neck and acetabular labrum were evaluated using the da Vinci Surgical System. Docking of the robotic system and manipulation of the instruments were successful. Although most regions reached in standard arthroscopy were also reached with this robotic setting, the 5-mm instrument was limited in movement due to its long articulation section. The 8-mm instrument had shorter articulation section and exhibited a full range of motion inside the joints. The posterior part of the femoral head and the posteroinferior portion of the acetabular labrum could not be observed because of the rigidity of the equipment. Robotic hip arthroscopy appears feasible in a cadaveric model but has some significant limitations. With the development of special instrumentations, arthroscopy of the large or small joints may be possible with robotic surgery. Robotic surgery may also enable surgeons to perform more complex and precise tasks in restricted spaces.",

Seventeen patients [11 male, 6 female; average age 8.5 years (range: 3.5 to 14 years)] with long and flat bone eosinophilic granulomas were followed after biopsy. Involved bones were femur (5), tibia (3), humerus (2), ulna (1), pelvis (3), scapula (1) and clavicle (1). After confirmation of diagnosis by biopsy, no further surgical intervention was performed. Clinical follow-up was done with preoperative and postoperative MSTS and VAS scores. The healing process was followed with periodic radiographs. Limb-length discrepancy, deformity, and lesion progression or recurrence were recorded. Average follow-up was 65 months (range: 28 to 115 months). Average preoperative MSTS score was 45% (range: 30 to 56.6%), while postoperative 6, 12 and 24 months scores were measured as 76% (range: 70 to 83.3%), 88% (range: 73.3 to 93.3%) and 94% (range: 86.6 to 100%) respectively. Average VAS score, which was 8.4 (range: 6 to 10) preoperatively, had a tendency to decrease postoperatively, and was measured as 3.5 (range: 2 to 5), 2.2 (range: 1 to 3.5) and 1.1 (range: 0 to 2) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Even though the majority of lesions demonstrated complete radiographic healing at 12 months, the healing process extended to 24 months for flat bones. No patients experienced limb-length discrepancy or deformity. All lesions regressed following biopsy and no recurrence was seen. Eosinophilic granuloma has a spontaneous healing potential, and confirming the diagnosis by biopsy is sufficient to obtain good functional and radiological results without any further intervention.",

We present a 55-year-old male who was referred to the orthopedics and traumatology clinic for evaluation of pain and discomfort around the left ankle 2 months after diagnosis of locally advanced non-small cell (squamous cell) lung cancer. Physical examination revealed nonspecific pain and tenderness around the ankle. T2-weighted MR images showed lesions like a bone marrow edema around the talar head and neck. Whole body dynamic bone scan revealed a metastatic lesion only in the foot. The patient died 4 months after diagnosis of the metastasis. Early diagnosis of foot metastasis may be challenging and delays in diagnosis of up to 24 months have been reported. Foot metastases are usually associated with advanced metastatic disease and survival rates are poor. Although metastatic disease of the foot is rare, it should be considered in the diagnosis of a painful foot in the elderly lung cancer patients. Palliative treatments such as pain relief medications should be chosen for patients with an expectancy of short survival whereas aggressive approaches may be applied for those with longer survival expectations.",

Although these studies have demonstrated higher extraction torques and lower rates of pin loosening with HA coating, there is little evidence to suggest that these biomechanical advantages translate to a lower rate of pin replacement prior to healing. The research question posed was \"Is there sufficient evidence to prove that hydroxyapatite coating lowers the rate of pin replacement for external fixation?\" An electronic search of Medline (Ovid, 1946 - December Week 4 2011), Embase (Ovid, 1980-2011 Week 52), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 4 of 4, October 2011) was conducted to identify all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials which compared HA-coated pins with non-coated pins for external fixation, with particular emphasis on the premature replacement of pins as a consequence of loosening. The combined search strategies retrieved 72 citations. Four randomized controlled trials (101 patients, 327 HA-coated vs. 354 uncoated pins) were included in this review. None of the studies demonstrated a clear benefit between pin types with respect to premature replacement of pins prior to healing. This review did not find sufficient evidence to validate the preferential use of HA-coated pins over standard pins as a means of avoiding premature replacement of pins used for external fixation. The use of uncoated pins is justifiable, especially within the context of limited financial resources.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop a new calcaneal fracture classification system which will consider sustentacular fragment configuration and relation of posterior calcaneal facet to calcaneal body. The new classification system used sustentacular fragment configuration and relation of posterior calcaneal facet fracture with fracture components of calcaneal body as key aspects of main types and subtypes. Between 2000 and 2014, 126 intraarticular calcaneal fractures were classified according to the new classification system by using computed tomography images. The new classification system was studied in term of reliability, correlation to choices of treatment, implant fixation and quality of fracture reduction. Types of sustentacular fragment comprised type A, B and C. Type A sustentacular fragment included sustentacular tali containing middle calcaneal facet. In Type B and C fractures sustentacular fragment included medial aspect and entire posterior calcaneal facet as a single unit, respectively. The fractures with type A, B and C sustentacular fragments were classified as main type A, B and C intra-articular calcaneal fractures. The main type A and B comprised 4 subtypes. Subtypes A1, A3, B1, and B3 associated with avulsion and bending fragments of calcaneal body. Subtype A2, B2, and B4 associated with burst calcaneal body. Subtype B4 was not found in the study. Main type C had no subtype and associated with burst calcaneal body. The data showed good reliability. The study showed that our new intra-articular calcaneal fracture classification system correlates to choices of treatment, implant fixation and quality of fracture reduction.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the omentum, peritoneum, paratenon and skeletal muscle on the proliferation of the cartilage tissue using rabbit model as an in vivo culture medium. 6 months old forty-five New Zealand rabbits were randomized into omentum, peritoneum, muscle, and Achilles paratenon groups. Standard sized osteochondral grafts were harvested from right knees and immediately placed into the specified tissues. Control group was fresh cartilage at the end of follow-up. After five months, samples were collected and evaluated macroscopically by measuring their dimensions (vertical = D1, horizontal = D2, and depth = D3) and volumes, and histologically by counting the chondrocyte number using camera lucida method. Macroscopically, increase in mean values for D1 and D2 dimensions of specimens from paratenon and omentum compared to pretransplant dimensions was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Although, volume measurements were higher in omentum and peritoneum group compared to pretransplant dimensions, increase was not significant (p > 0.05). Histologically, mean chondrocyte count was 14.0 ± 0.6 in fresh articular cartilage. Mean chondrocyte counts were 14.4 ± 0.9 in omentum group, 15.4 ± 1.0 in peritoneum group, 9.7 ± 1.3 in muscle group and 9.2 ± 0.4 in Achilles paratenon group respectively. However, mean chondrocyte counts were higher in samples of omentum and peritoneum group compared to fresh articular cartilage, increase was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Transplantation of the cartilage grafts into mesothelium enhanced the chondrocyte counts and volumes compared with the pretransplant measurements. Mesothelium may have the potential to be used as an in vivo culture medium for osteochondral tissue growth.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to biomechanically compare cable, trochanteric grip plate, and locking plate techniques in Vancouver type AG fracture model in an in vitro test environment. Fifteen pieces of fourth-generation synthetic femora were separated into 3 groups of 5 models each. A greater trochanteric fracture model was created after femoral stem implantation. Group 1 was fixated with only cable, Group 2 with trochanteric grip plate, and Group 3 with locking plate. Horizontal stiffness, axial stiffness, and failure loads were compared between the groups. In horizontal compression tests, Group 3 had the highest values, but the only statistically significant difference was between the locking plate group and cable group. Axial distraction test results showed that mean stiffness of Group 1 was 94.6±9.44 N/mm, that of Group 2 was 174.8±28.64 N/mm, and that of Group 3 was 185.6±71.64 N/mm. While locking plate versus cable fixation and grip plate fixation versus cable fixation showed statistically significant differences (p<0.05), comparison of locking plate versus grip plate fixation showed no statistically significant difference (p>0.05). In axial failure load test, Group 3 had the highest results. The only significant difference was between the locking plate and cable groups (p<0.05). In Vancouver type AG fractures stable fixation may be achieved with grip plate fixation and locking plates, with the former ensuring more stable osteosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to describe the current situation regarding the training, working conditions, future plans, fields of interest and satisfaction of orthopaedics and traumatology residents in Turkey.A descriptive survey questionnaire consisting of 24 questions was designed to identify the problems and solution suggestions concerning training of orthopaedic residents. All orthopaedics and traumatology residents who took the 2013 Progress Testing for Speciality in Medicine (UEGS) held by Turkish Orthopaedics and Traumatology Education Council (TOTEK) were surveyed in the class at the end thereof as well as the young orthopaedic surgeons who were reached through the email groups of Turkish Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology - Residents and Young Attendings Council (TOTBID-AGUH).A total of 725 residents and 132 young attendings were surveyed. The most outstanding answers are as follows: 62,7% of the respondents replied to the question \"Is there a training program/Is it being applied\" as \"yes/yes\". It was found out that 94,3% of the respondents wanted to be involved in a rotation abroad. The \"patient care\" was the most common answer, with a ratio of 36,9%, to the question \"What's the priority of the department you are studying in?\". Regarding work conditions, \"many emergency on-calls\" was found to be the most important parameter affecting life conditions (p < 0.05).Aiming to identify the challenges that orthopaedics and traumatology residents in Turkey face as regards their training, this survey stands as a pioneering study with a high participation rate. Analysis of survey data highlights the importance of several key factors such as the development of training programs and increasing the time spent with academicians as well as spreading and promotion of log book application.",

In these three search engines, 'anterior cruciate ligament', 'anterior cruciate ligament surgery', 'ACL', and 'ACL surgery' were entered in Turkish. The first 10 pages from each search on the websites were collected. The websites were divided into 3 groups according to their sources. Group 1 was classified as websites prepared by private hospitals or medical centers; group 2, as individual websites of orthopedics and traumatology physicians; and group 3, as non-profit websites providing general health information that does not fall into these two groups. The websites were analyzed based on both the website interface and a specific content scoring guide by two reviewers. The Flesch Kincaid (FK) grade level and the Flesch reading ease (FRE) score were used to determine the readability of information on the websites.Eighty-five unique websites were evaluated. The mean quality score of all the websites was 10.4 ± 4.5 with a maximum score of 25 (range=3-21). No significant difference in quality score was found between the groups. The mean FK grade score of all the websites was 11.2 ± 1.7 (range=7.9-15.3). The mean FRE score of all the websites was 46.8 ± 7.7 (range=24.1-63.7). No statistically significant differences in FK grade and FRE score were found between the groups. Although 59 websites (69%) had a third-party seal indicating the certification of one of the organizations established to provide a standard of health information on the Internet, only 21 websites (25%) were updated in the year before the search.The readability level of the informative texts about the ACL on the Turkish websites was above the educational level in Turkey. In addition, the quality score of the Turkish websites related to ACL was low. The content of the informative texts should be organized while taking into account the patients' literacy level.",

Three patients had Regan-Morrey type 2, five patients had type 3 coronoid fractures. Accompanying injuries were Mason-Johnston type 4 radial head fractures (n=6), olecranon fractures (n=4), lateral humeral condyle fracture (n=1), and lateral (n=5) or medial (n=2) collateral ligament ruptures. Coronoid fractures were fixed with a plate, screw, or a cerclage wire in all the patients except for one patient who underwent coronoid excision. For radial head fractures, plate or screw and K-wire fixation was performed in two patients and radial head prosthesis was used in four patients. Olecranon fractures were fixed with a plate or AO tension band. Functional results were assessed using the Mayo elbow performance score. The mean follow-up period was 22.6 months (range 1 to 65.5 months).Union was achieved in all the patients. At the latest assessments, the mean Mayo elbow performance score was 84.3 (range 50 to 100). All the patients expressed satisfaction with surgical treatment except for one patient who underwent coronoid excision. All the fixation materials used for olecranon fractures were removed after union due to implant-associated pain. Ulnar nerve transposition was required in two patients with fractures involving the anteromedial facet of the coronoid process. Two patients developed heterotopic ossification that did not affect the range of motion of the elbow.Surgical treatment of elbow dislocations associated with Regan-Morrey type 2-3 coronoid fractures enables a concentric reduction of the elbow, stability, and early motion.",

Mosaicplasty was performed with open surgery. All grafts were harvested from the ipsilateral femoral condyle at the level of the sulcus terminalis and transplanted with the mosaicplasty technique to the defect area. The mean defect diameter was 13.5 mm (range 8 to 27 mm), and the mean number of grafts used was 1.5 (range 1 to 4). Final clinical assessments were made using the Lysholm and ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) scoring systems. Radiological evaluations were made according to the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated according to the Bandi scoring system. The mean follow-up was 30.5 months (range 13 to 47 months).The mean pre- and postoperative Lysholm knee scores were 46 (range 28 to 64) and 86 (range 76 to 100), respectively. ICRS scores were grade I in 16 patients (66.7%), grade II in six patients (25%), and grade III in two patients (8.3%). Five patients (20.8%) had slight donor-site disturbance which regressed within six months to a level that did not restrict daily physical activities. All the patients returned to preinjury activity levels. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed no signs of graft loosening or collapse. According to the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria, 20 patients (83.3%) were free from any signs of osteoarthritis, whereas four patients (16.7%) exhibited early osteoarthritic changes.Mosaicplasty is a reliable procedure in the treatment of full-thickness chondral lesions because it is minimally invasive, can be performed at a single session, and has a low complication rate and low cost.",

Involvement was bilateral in 17 patients. Surgical dissection included complete subtalar release (CSTR) in 35 feet, and posteromedial release (PMR) in 12 feet. The mean age was 9.6 months (range 6 to 23 months) in CSTR-, and 10.6 months (range 5 to 23 months) in PMR-treated patients. The patients were assessed with the Laaveg-Ponseti functional score, foot bimalleolar angle, and other radiographic measurements. The mean follow-up was 117.3 months (106.6 months in the CSTR, and 150.6 months in the PMR group).Functional results were excellent in 24 feet, good in 12 feet, fair in six feet, and poor in five feet. All the poor results were seen in the CSTR group. Of these five feet, two developed recurrences, two had both pes cavus and metatarsus adductus deformities, and one had pes cavus deformity. Considering the foot bimalleolar angle, 83.4% of PMR-treated feet, and 85.7% of CSTR-treated feet were rated as type 1 or 2. Functional scores were significantly correlated with the foot bimalleolar angle, talus-first metatarsus angle on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, and with the talocalcaneal angle on anteroposterior radiographs (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between the two surgical procedures with respect to functional scores and radiographic measurements (p>0.05).Extensive surgical dissection enables simultaneous correction of all components of deformity and provides satisfactory results not only in the short-term but also in the long-term follow-up.",

Forty iron plates of high quality (100x35x3 mm) were divided into four groups and two screw holes, 3 mm in diameter, were drilled on each plate at a distance of 15 mm. In group A, the holes were drilled so that the screws would be vertically sent to the bone interface. In the remaining groups, the holes were drilled for convergent (group B, 15 degrees ) and divergent (group C, 15 degrees ; group D, 30 degrees ) screw orientation. Screw-plate fixation was tested in a modified osteoporotic bone (Osteoporotic Generic Bone, Synbone) on an Instron materials testing system with an axial pullout force of 0.1 mm/sec. Failure loads were read from load-displacement curves and the type of failure was noted.Screws placed in divergent orientations showed the highest axial pull-out strength (group C, 83.3 N/mm; group D, 80.8 N/mm), followed by convergent placement (72 N/mm) and vertical placement (66.7 N/mm). The type of failure was breakage of the bone sample in divergent configurations, and screw pull-out in convergent and vertical configurations.Divergent constructs may be a promising alternative to conventional screw placement in treating osteoporotic fractures.",

Twenty-two Wistar albino rats were randomized into two groups. The control group was subjected to femoral fracture followed by intramedullary fixation, whereas the head trauma group was subjected to femoral fracture followed by intramedullary fixation along with closed blunt head trauma. Bone sections obtained with computed tomography from rat femurs were transferred into a computer and a 3D mathematical model of femur was created. At the end of week 4, femurs were examined by biomechanical testing and finite element analysis. The mean maximum fracture load was significantly higher in the head trauma group than in control group (p<0.05). Maximum strain values were also significantly high in the head trauma group (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to maximum deformation (p>0.05). The head trauma group had significantly higher mean bending rigidity than the control group (p<0.05). The head trauma group showed no significant difference from the control group in terms of strain energy and elasticity module (p>0.05). There was no significant difference between experimental biomechanical test and finite element analysis (p>0.05). Noninvasive methods such as finite element analysis are useful in examination of the mechanical structure of bones. Experimental biomechanical test and finite element analysis methods suggest that head trauma contributes to fracture healing.",

Its clinical implications include high-turnover bone disease, low-turnover bone disease, osteomalacia, osteosclerosis, and osteoporosis. A 13-year-old boy who had been on dialysis treatment for renal failure was admitted with a pathologic supracondylar femur fracture after a minor trauma. Radiological studies showed cystic lesions in the femoral supracondyle, left acetabular roof, and right proximal and distal tibia. Based on radiologic appearances of the lesions and on histopathologic findings of the lesion excised from the right distal tibia, brown tumor and fibrous dysplasia were considered in the differential diagnosis. Initially, serum parathyroid hormone level was slightly increased and calcium level was normal, but during follow-up, serum parathyroid hormone level increased significantly, enabling the diagnosis of brown tumor.",

    "abstract": "An effective rehabilitation program is essential to prevent joint stiffness and regain range of motion after surgical treatment of intra-articular fractures of the distal humerus. We evaluated the effect of a physiotherapy program on functional results, that involved passive resistive stretching exercises performed under axillary brachial plexus block after radiographic observation of bone union of intra-articular fractures of the distal humerus treated with open reduction and internal fixation.The study included 21 patients (7 females, 14 males; mean age 34+/-5 years; range 21 to 57 years) who underwent open reduction and internal fixation for intra-articular fractures of the distal humerus. All the patients had closed fractures. Six patients had AO type C1, six patients had C2, and nine patients had C3 fractures. Surgical treatment consisted of a posterior incision, olecranon osteotomy, and fixation of the metaphyseal fragments using two reconstruction plates placed medially and laterally. Active range of motion exercises were started on the third postoperative day. To prevent early development of heterotopic ossification, passive range of motion exercises were avoided. Active stretching exercises were initiated three weeks after surgery. Upon radiographic observation of bone union, axillary brachial plexus block was performed. The physiotherapy program involved passive stretching exercises during nerve block, and active weight exercises after recovery from motor block. The catheter remained in the axillary region for three months, during which functional rehabilitation was continued 2-3 times a week on an outpatient basis. Functional results were evaluated according to the criteria of Jupiter et al. after a mean follow-up period of 31 months (range 24 to 46 months).All fractures united within a mean of 11.9 weeks (range 9 to 17 weeks) except for one type C3 fracture. Functional results were excellent in 10 patients (47.6%), good in eight patients (38.1%), moderate in two patients (9.5%), and poor in one patient (4.8%). Two patients with a moderate outcome had associated multiple fractures in the ipsilateral extremity. Distribution of the functional results according to the type of fractures were 4 excellent, 2 good in type C1; 4 excellent, 2 good in C2; and 2 excellent, 4 good, 2 moderate, and 1 poor in C3 fractures. The mean loss of elbow extension was 16 degrees. The mean elbow flexion, pronation, and supination were measured as 131 degrees, 90 degrees, and 75 degrees, respectively. None of the patients had nonunion at the olecranon osteotomy site, superficial or deep infection, or heterotopic ossification. Three patients developed transient ulnar nerve neuropraxia that resolved spontaneously during the follow-up period. There were no complications related to axillary catheterization.Following surgical treatment of intra-articular fractures of the distal humerus, a regular and pain-free physiotherapy program performed under axillary brachial plexus block on an outpatient basis increases patient compliance and enables early return to daily activities.",

Among nearly 200 cases hitherto reported, only a few cases have familial coexistence, and none are first-degree relatives. A nine-year old girl had complaints of weakness in the right arm and swelling in the right shoulder. On physical examination, a mass-like lesion in the right clavicle, abnormal clavicular movement, and asymmetric shoulders were noted. The range of motion of the shoulder was in normal range on both sides. A plain radiogram showed a defect in the diaphysis of the right clavicle and computed tomography showed discontinuity of the right clavicle. Similar clinical and radiologic findings were also detected in her younger sister who was three years old. None had a history of trauma, difficult delivery, or natal complication, any abnormal findings related to the musculoskeletal system, any abnormality in routine laboratory test results and genetic analysis. The diagnosis was made as congenital pseudarthrosis of the clavicle in both siblings. Since they had normal range of joint movements without pain, they were scheduled for clinical follow-up. To our knowledge, these two siblings are the first to be reported in the literature for having congenital pseudarthrosis of the clavicle.",

Isokinetic concentric Ext and Fl PT of the dominant leg was assessed at 1.04 rad/sec using a Cybex II+ dynamometer and body mass, stature, and pubertal stage were measured. A repeated-measures ANOVA test was performed on absolute PT data with muscle action (Ext and Fl) as a within-subject factor and between-subject factors including sex, group, and pubertal stage. To assess the effects on body size-adjusted PT, linear ANCOVA and log-linear ANCOVA techniques were used with body mass and stature taken as covariates.Peak torque was significantly greater in boys compared to girls, and in the physical education group compared to the arts group. When PT was adjusted for differences in body size, there was a greater difference in PT between girls in the two groups compared to boys, and there was a significant effect of pubertal stage. Allometric analysis showed that PT was influenced more by stature than body mass, and PT increased at a greater rate than body size (both p<0.01).There may be a need for a physical activity intervention in sedentary 12/13 year old girls. Peak torque appears to increase disproportionately to body size. This may result from a greater increase in leg muscle mass relative to body mass.",

Infective wounds were in the hip (n=6), crus (n=5), knee (n=3), sacrum (n=2), and hand (n=1). The causative organism for infections was gram-positive bacteria in 15 patients (88.2%), and six patients (35.3%) had nosocomial infections. The wounds were treated with a negative pressure of 100-125 mmHg applied continuously for the first two days, and then intermittently for the following days. The mean follow-up period was 11 + or - 6 months.The mean duration of vacuum therapy was 16 + or - 4 days and the mean length of hospitalization was 31 + or - 19 days. The patients underwent a mean number of three surgical procedures (range 1 to 6) before vacuum therapy. The mean amount of discharge from the wound was 500 + or - 150 ml. Tissue edema and discharge problems were resolved in all the wounds and a hygienic and dry-looking surgical site was attained. In 11 patients (64.7%), clinical and bacteriologic eradication of infections was achieved at the surgical site through antibiotic use and vacuum therapy. Six patients with nosocomial infections continued to receive antibiotic treatment following resolution of surgical site problems. The mean wound area showed a significant reduction from 36 + or - 14 cm(2) to 11 + or - 10 cm(2) following vacuum therapy (p<0.05). Only two patients (11.8%) required further surgical interventions for the closure of wound site. Two patients (11.8%) complained of pain associated with vacuum application.Besides its topical advantages in the care of infected wounds, vacuum-assisted closure provides a more rapid and comfortable treatment opportunity, representing a reliable alternative to conventional wound care methods.",

Plain x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging showed an osteochondral defect in the medial third of the capitellum. At surgery, as a new technique, the lateral collateral ligament was detached from the humeral attachment to provide access to the capitellum with a clear and perpendicular exposure. Following removal of loose fragments within the joint, an osteochondral graft harvested from the lateral femoral condyle was implanted to the defect area of the capitellum. Postoperative radiologic controls showed that the defect was entirely filled by the graft with appropriate graft height. On follow-up examination at 12 months, the patient did not have any complaint about his elbow, and had no limitation of movement compared to the left elbow. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the graft was successfully adapted to the recipient site without any sign of loosening. At final follow-up 40 months after surgery, the surface of the articular cartilage appeared normal. The range of elbow motion was preserved and the patient had no restriction in daily and sports activities. Considering technical difficulties posed by the narrow and complex structure of the elbow joint, this new technique involving detachment of the lateral collateral ligament facilitates perpendicular implantation of the graft. In our opinion, utilization of this new technique will improve functional and radiological results of osteochondral autograft transfer.",

    "abstract": "Treatment methods in Kienböck's disease remain controversial despite the long-term awareness of the disease by orthopedic surgeons. Currently, excisional arthroplasty with a palmaris longus tendon ball is one of the most frequently used treatment methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term results of thirty-eight patients who had been treated with excisional arthroplasty and palmaris longus tendon ball, as well as the effect of this method on carpal height.In this study, we retrospectively evaluated 38 patients (mean age: 30.4 years; range: 17-64 years) with Stage 3 Kienböck's disease who underwent excisional arthroplasty between 1978 and 2008. According to the Lichtman classification, 8 patients were classified as Stage 3a and 30 patients were classified as Stage 3b in Kienböck's disease. The mean duration of follow-up after surgery was 81.3 (range: 25 to 264) months. The outcomes were evaluated with joint range of motion, grip strength and functional assessment of Nakamura and radiographic changes in carpal height.According to the Nakamura's scoring system the results were excellent in 22 (57.9%) patients, good in 13 (34.2%) and moderate in 3 (7.9%). Comparison of pre and postoperative range of motion of the wrist revealed an average increase in wrist extension of 10° (p<0.05), and an average decrease in ulnar deviation of 4° (p<0.05) after the operation. No significant difference was observed when comparing other joint range of motion parameters. Dynamometric grip strength measurements revealed significant differences between the healthy and operated sides (67.6 kgf vs. 45.9 kgf, respectively; p<0.05). The decrease in the revised carpal height ratio were significant.According to patient satisfaction rate and clinical results, the outcome of excisional arthroplasty with palmaris longus tendon ball in Stage 3 Kienböck's disease is satisfactory. However, carpal height reduction and development of degenerative changes may be expected in long-term follow-up.",

A 34-year-old man working in a printing house presented one hour after guillotine amputation involving all ten digits. Surgery was initiated 80 minutes after admission and took seven hours. Under axillary anesthesia, the operation was performed by two teams each consisting of two microsurgeons and two assistants. Replantation was completed without the use of any skin graft or flap. Fingertip examination showed poor arterial circulation in the second, third, and fourth digits of the left hand after 24 hours of replantation and surgical exploration was performed, during which anastomosis of the ulnar digital artery of the second digit was re-established and a Y-shaped vein graft was placed at the level of the third web to restore revascularization of the third and fourth digits. However, these interventions did not prevent the development of necrosis in the distal segment of the fourth digit which resulted in dry gangrene that required amputation. After 38 months of replantation, radiographic examination showed complete union in all fingers without malunion or damage to the joint surface and about 8 degrees of medial angulation in the proximal phalanx of the fourth digit of the right hand. The patient did not have difficulty in performing daily activities and had a considerably good pinching. Losses of active range of motion of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints were within the rage of 10 to 30 degrees in both hands.

    "abstract": "Autologous interpositional vein grafts are used in peripheral arterial bypass procedures. Sudden exposure of vein grafts to arterial blood pressure is associated with increased wall tension leading to overdistension of the graft and changes in flow patterns. Overdistension of vein grafts often results in anastomotic leaks, thrombosis, and loss of patency. This study was designed to evaluate the use of a biodegradable collagen cover as a means of preventing overdistension of venous bypass grafts in a rat model.Twenty-two Sprague-Dawley female rats weighing 250-350 g were randomly assigned to two groups: study group (n= 15) and control group (n=7). In all the rats, a 10-mm segment of the left femoral vein was harvested and used as a graft in repair of a right femoral artery injury. Following this procedure, control rats remained untreated. After completion of the femoral artery repair in the study group, the graft was wrapped with a collagen cover of appropriate length (NeuraWrap Nerve Protector) and sutured to form a tube around the vein graft. At the end of the procedure, the intensity and duration of bleeding, and vessel patency were recorded and the proximal and distal arterial segments were examined by Doppler ultrasonography. All observations and measurements were repeated at 1 and 2 hours after surgery. After the second hour, all the rats were sacrificed and vein graft samples with the arterial portions were removed for histological study.After removal of the vascular clamps of the control group, a sudden distension was observed in all the vein grafts. In this group, bleeding at the anastomosis site lasted for 1 to 3 minutes and was followed by ballooning of the grafts. In the study group, however, none of the samples exhibited distension and ballooning. There was no bleeding in 11 samples at all, and bleeding time was less than one minute in the remaining four samples. In the control group, only one graft was patent at two hours, one of the grafts was occluded after only three minutes. In the study group, all the grafts were patent and no thrombosis was noted. The mean blood flow velocity of the control group measured at 0 hour by Doppler ultrasonography was 0.93+/-0.33 cm/sec in the proximal artery, and 0.73+/-0.44 cm/sec in the distal artery. The mean blood flow velocities in the proximal and distal arteries of the study group were as follows, respectively: at 0 hour: 0.45+/-0.27 and 0.46+/-0.22 cm/sec; at 1 hour: 0.40+/-0.22 and 0.62+/-0.40 cm/sec; and at 2 hours: 0.55+/-0.22 and 0.64+/-0.37 cm/sec.Prevention of overdistension of vein grafts with the use of an external cover decreases anastomotic leaks, protects the intimal media, maintains blood flow, reduces the incidence of thrombosis, and thus provides a higher patency rate.",

Fixation was achieved by closed reduction and 0.5 mm intramedullary nails. Intramuscular dexketoprofen trometamol was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily to the 30 rats in the study group. Rats were sacrificed in groups of 10 at the 2nd, 4th, and 6th weeks following the fracture. Fracture healing was compared mechanically, radiologically, and histopathologically between the groups.There was no statistically significant difference between the study and control groups in terms of mean values of radiological or histopathological scores at the 2nd, 4th and 6th weeks (p>0.05). Biomechanical evaluation could not be conducted in all rats in the study and control groups at the 2nd week due to early stage fracture healing. Mean biomechanical examination values were not statistically significant at the 4th and 6th weeks between the study and control groups (p>0.05).No radiological, biomechanical, and histological effects were detected in the healing of closed fractures of the tibia fixed with intramedullary nail with the long-term use of dexketoprofen trometamol. Dexketoprofen trometamol may be used in patients undergoing surgical fixation for traumatic fractures, taking into account other drugs administered together.",

This study recruited 105 patients (169 cases) who underwent hybrid TKA for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis from 1999 to 2002. Maxim (Biomet Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA) prosthesis was used, and average follow-up was 8.6 years. Radiologically, femorotibial angle was measured in a standing anteroposterior (AP) view, and a femoral flexion angle and a tibial angle were measured using the Knee Society roentgenographic evaluation and scoring system. Radiolucent lines were detected at the last follow-up. Clinically, range of joint motion and the Knee Society clinical rating system scores were evaluated. The femorotibial angle was improved from varus 4.5° to 6.4° at the last follow-up. The femoral flexion in an AP view at the postoperative and last follow-up was 96.5° and 95.7°, respectively, and the tibial angle was 89.1° and 88.7°, respectively. In lateral view, the femoral flexion was 2.6° and 2.7°, respectively, and the tibial angle was 88.4° and 87.8°, respectively. Total scores of radiolucencies were 4 points or less in all cases, and the average width was 1.1 mm. Flexion contracture was improved from 10.0° to 3.5°, and further flexion was increased from 110.5° to 130.4°. Knee score and function score were also enhanced from 47.6 and 46.8 preoperatively to 89.7 and 88.4 after the operation, respectively. Hybrid technique for TKA can be effective clinically and radiologically on longterm follow-up.",

In this technical note, the use of a partial quadriceps tendon transfer to the adductor magnus tendon is presented as a good solution for revision cases to avoid the use of implants, bone drilling, use of allografts, or two-stage surgical procedures. In addition, this procedure could be also used as a primary procedure in skeletally immature patients.",

Twenty-nine adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients' pre-operative posteroanterior scoliosis radiographs were used for end vertebra selection and Cobb angle measurement by standard method and smartphone-aided method. Measurements were performed by 7 examiners. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to analyze selection and measurement reliability. Summary statistics of variance calculations were used to provide 95% prediction limits for the error in Cobb angle measurements. A paired 2-tailed t test was used to analyze end vertebra selection differences. Mean absolute Cobb angle difference was 3.6° for the manual method and 1.9° for the smartphone-aided method. Both intraobserver and interobserver reliability were found excellent in manual and smartphone set for Cobb angle measurement. Both intraobserver and interobserver reliability were found excellent in manual and smartphone set for end vertebra selection. But reliability values of manual set were lower than smartphone. Two observers selected significantly different end vertebra in their repeated selections for manual method. Smartphone-aided method for end vertebra selection and Cobb angle measurement showed excellent reliability. We can expect a reduction in measurement error rates with the widespread use of this method in clinical practice. Level III, Diagnostic study",

This effect may cause a secondary fracture of the adjacent vertebrae. Elastoplasty has emerged as a new technique to overcome this complication. The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the clinical results of the elastoplasty procedure.Thirthy nine patients (9 males, 30 females, 87 spinal levels) were clinically evaluated pre and postoperatively in terms of pain relief, leakage and silicone embolism. The mean age was 67 (range 38-84) years. The mean follow up period was 12,5 months. The patients were evaluated radiologically for the presence of adjacent level fractures postoperatively. Complications were recorded.The mean VAS score decreased from 7,5 to 3,5 during the last follow-up. Symptomatic silicone pulmonary embolism was not encountered in any patients. Leakage was observed in 5 (13%) cases. There was an adjacent level fracture in 1 case and another fracture which was not at the adjacent level in another one. A hematoma occurred in the needle entry site in a patient with trombocytopenia (<70,000).Elastoplasty is a safe, promising technique in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). Symptomatic silicone pulmonary embolism is not observed. The material's stiffness is close to intact vertebrae. Therefore, elastoplasty may be a good viable option in the treatment of VCFs as it cause less complications and can prevent adjacent level fractures.Level IV, therapeutic study.",

In eight patients (61%) the fracture was associated with ulnar nerve neuritis in Guyon's canal. We assessed the following clinical data: age, sex, mechanism of injury, side of the injured hand and associated lesions, fracture classification, average time from injury to correct diagnosis, surgical technique, complications, and length of follow-up. All patients underwent radiological imaging, including standard radiographs in two planes (anteroposterior and lateral projections), and a CT study. Functional outcomes evaluated were pain, range of motion, grip strength, Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) and Mayo wrist score.The mean follow-up was 36 months (range, 12-144 months). All 13 cases were treated with ORIF of the hook of the hamate. Mean VAS pain score was 5 preoperatively (4-9) and 1 (0-2) postoperatively. All patients returned to pre-injury level and only one patient felt pain on activity. Preoperative modified Mayo wrist score was 51 and the postoperative value was 94. All outcomes scores improved significantly from preoperative values. The patients who participated in sports postoperatively were able to do so at or near pre-injury levels. Postoperative average range of wrist motion was 76° in extension, 71° in flexion, 14° in ulnar deviation, and 21° in radial deviation. Mean grip strength in the hand with the hook fracture was 58 kg compared with 53 Kg in the unaffected hand. All patients returned to their pre-injury level of functioning after 10-12 weeks and there were no complications. Analysis of grip strength revealed values comparable with the unaffected hand.ORIF of hamate hook fractures is a safe and effective technique to restore normal grip strength and return to pre-injury level.

Eight of them had a kyphotic trunk deformity (Scheuermann kyphosis, neurofibromatosis, posterior thoracic hemivertebra), and the rest of the 53 patients had a scoliotic trunk deformity (mostly adolescent idiopathic scoliosis - AIS, lateral hemivertebra). The TceMEP recordings in all four limbs were analyzed every 30 min, or upon the surgeon's command. Upper limb TceMEP recordings were used as a control of systemic and anesthetic related changes, and as the indicator of positioning brachial plexopathy.Four out of 8 patients (50.0%) from the kyphotic group experienced noteworthy decreases in TceMEP amplitude (≥65%) in one or both arms, and only 2 out of 53 patients (3.8%) from the scoliotic group, confirming significant statistical difference (Chi-square 16.75, p < 0.05). Two out of 8 patients with decreases in TceMEP amplitude suffered from transitory postoperative brachial plexopathy, and both of them were from the kyphotic group.It seems that kyphotic trunks have a higher risk for positioning-related brachial plexopathy, probably due to distribution of trunk's weight onto only four points (two iliac bones and two shoulders), compared to the scoliotic trunks that have wider weight-bearing areas. We emphasize the importance of proper patient positioning and close intraoperative neuro-monitoring of all four limbs in more than one channel per limb.Level IV Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this animal study was to investigate the short and long-term local histomorphologic effects and the utility of intra-articular application of ibuprofen.Forty-six Wistar Albino rats were used in the study. The rats were randomized into 5 groups of 8 and a sham group of 6. The 40 rats in the study groups were anaesthetised with 60 mg/kg of ketamine, then 0.25 ml ibuprofen (25 mg) was injected to the right knee joint of each rat (ibuprofen group) and 0.25 ml 0.9% saline to the left knee joint as the control group. To the 6 rats in the sham group, only puncture was applied to both knee joints. The rats in each of the 5 study groups were sacrificed on days 1, 2, 7, 14 and 21 respectively. The histomorphologic changes were graded on a 6-point scale regarding inflammation of the synovia, cartilage tissue, and subchondral bone. Inflammation scores were compared using the Mann Whitney U-test and comparisons of the sacrifice day and drug used were evaluated with the Kruskal Wallis test. The p values below 0.05 were considered as significant.Statistically significant difference was found between the ibuprofen injected knees (10/40) and the saline injected (0/40) and sham knees (0/12) in respect of hematoma positivity (p = 0.002). Significantly higher inflammation scores were found in ibuprofen injected knees on the 1st, 2nd, 7th and 14th days compared to controls and sham (p < 0.05). Inflammation scores were similar in ibuprofen injected knees with and without hematoma (p > 0.05). Inflammation of the ibuprofen injected group was most severe on day one and the severity of inflammation reduced gradually throughout the 3 weeks.Our results show that intra-articular injection of ibuprofen can cause intra-articular hematoma. It also leads to transient inflammation of the synovia that is more severe in the early period, which gradually recovers.",

Methods From our archive files between the years of 2012-2018, excised, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded adipocytic tumors were retrospectively screened and 61 subjects were selected. The gender, age, tumor location and tumor diameter were evaluated. The cases were investigated in terms of p16, CD34, MDM2 expression and clinicopathological information. Results Of the 61 patients included in the study, we found that 2 had hibernoma, 4 had lipoblastoma, 14 had spindle cell lipoma (SCL), 10 had lipoma, 20 had atypical lipomatous tumor/well differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDL), and 11 had dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL). In terms of diameter, ALT/WDL and DDL were significantly different from the others (p=0.001, p=0.001, respectively). There was a significant difference between the groups according to the location (p=0.001). 35% (7/20) of ALT/WDLs were in the lower extremities (thighs) and 35% (7/20) were located in the retroperitoneal region. 70% of DDLs (7/11) were located in the retroperitoneum. When CD34 expression was evaluated among the groups, a significant difference was observed (p=0.001). CD34 was positive in 92.9% of SCL cases. p16 immunoreactivity was significantly different between the groups (p=0.001). p16 expression was observed in 50.5% of ALT / WDL cases and 79% of DDL cases. Conclusion p16 and CD34 expression are valuable in the differential diagnosis of lipomatous tumors when radiological and clinical considerations do not help to differential diagnosis of adipocytic tumors.

In the target group (TXA/DEP group: n=50; 19 men and 31 women, mean age 72.5±11.1 years), the surgical sites were injected with 35 mL normal saline mixed with 3 g of TXA with 0.2 mg of DEP at a 1:200,000 dilution (TXA/DEP) immediately after musculoaponeurotic closure. In the control group (TXA group: n=50; 22 men and 28 women; mean age: 70.5±12.2 years), the surgical site was injected with 35 mL normal saline containing 3 g of TXA alone. The main outcome measures were postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) levels, hematocrit, drainage volume, and total blood loss (TBL); the secondary measures included transfusion requirements and perioperative complications.The mean Hb levels among patients in theTXA/DEP group were significantly lower than among those in the TXA group, measured on postoperative day 1 at 101.0±14.1 g/L vs. 106.9±10.5 g/L and day 3 as 104.2±8.2 g/L vs. 108.5±9.1 g/L, respectively (p<0.05). Drainage volume from the surgical site and TBL measured on postoperative day 2 were also significantly reduced in the TXA/DEP group vs. the TXA group, measured at 71.4±26.0 mL vs. 82.5±24.6 mL and 343.6±148.0 mL vs. 419.6±165.4 mL, respectively (p<0.05). Furthermore, 11 patients (22%) from the TXA group and 15 (30%) from the TXA/DEP group received blood transfusions; the mean number of transfusion events (1.2±0.4 vs. 1.9±0.7) and the amount of blood transfused (1.7±0.5 Units vs. 2.9±1.0 Units) was also markedly reduced in the TXA/DEP group (p<0.05). Two cases in the TXA/DEP group and three in the TXA group were diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis, a difference that did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05).Local administration of TXA with DEP reduced blood loss and limited the need for blood transfusions after surgery for trochanteric femoral fracture without increasing the risk of perioperative complications. Our study indicates that the local administration of TXA/DEP is safe and more effective than the administration of TXA alone in treating trochanteric femoral fractures.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

Methods A total of 27 patients (2 men and 25 women) with bilateral hip OA secondary to Crowe type-IV DDH were enrolled in this study. Their mean age at the time of surgery was 40,36±12,35. All patients underwent simultaneous, bilateral THA between January 2015 and December 2016. Clinical assessment included Oswestry disability index (ODI) score and Harris hip score (HHS), and pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), lumbar lordosis (LL), and pelvic tilt (PT) were measured from radiographs. Results Preoperatively, all the patients had hip and low-back pain. Preoperative and final follow-up ODI scores were 48.3 and 3.9 (p=0.000), respectively. HHS changed from 43.54 to 92.68 (p=0.000). PT and PI significantly changed from -20.4°±20.4° to 3.2°±16.7° (p=0.001) and from 26.6°±35.1° to 47.4°±17.9° (p=0.001), respectively. There were no significant differences regarding the SS and LL measurements. Age or limb-length discrepancy was not significantly associated with the spinopelvic alignment measurements. Conclusion Restoring the function of the hip with THA is shown to improve hip-associated LBP, but the accompanying hyperlordosis does not change. THA in patients with bilateral Crowe type-IV hips relieves hip pain as well as associated LBP. Hyperlordosis of the lumbar vertebra does not change after surgery, but PI and PT changes are observed; this improvement might have a role in the relief of LBP.

Fourteen knees of 9 patients operated on by a single surgeon between 2009-2012 were included in the study. The tensor fascia was divided into 2 strips, and these strips were passed via the joint and sutured to themselves. The combined procedure additionally includes lateral capsular release, vastus lateralis (VL) resection, medial capsular plication, and Z-plasty of the rectus femoris (RF) tendon. Mean age at the time of surgery was 6.9±3.3 years (range: 4-13 years). The mean follow-up was 37.6±0.9 months (range: 26-49 months). Patellofemoral instability was restored for all patients by using combined surgical technique. Patellar lateralization developed in 2 patients, in whom stability was obtained via secondary medial plication.

Diagnosis can be determined by hypertrophied synovial tissue with synovial lining cells containing adipose tissue on examination using a light microscope. The synovial plica of the knee is formed during the embryogenic phase of development. This development is incomplete in many individuals. When the synovial plica of the knee persists, it is transformed into an embryonic relic that is located in either the suprapatellar or midpatellar region of the knee. We present a rare case with both a complete type of suprapatellar plica and a symptomatic lipoma arborescens in the suprapatellar recess.",

Anterior approaches that facilitate direct reduction and fixation of coronoid fractures have been described. The present study was based on the hypothesis that anterior-to-posterior headless screw (Acutrak Mini® 3.5 mm × 26 mm, Acumed, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) fixation of coronoid fractures would be as strong as posterior-to-anterior 2.7 mm Association for Osteosynthesis (AO) cortical screw fixation. This study included 14 ulnas obtained from 14 formalin-preserved adult cadavers. Coronoid type 2 fractures were created and fixed randomly using anterior-to-posterior headless screws (antegrade group) and posterior-to-anterior 2.7 mm AO cortical screws (retrograde group). The experimental constructs were loaded until 2 mm of displacement. Failure load (N), fixation stiffness (Nmm-1), and indentation stiffness were calculated. Failure load was higher in the retrograde screw group (p=0.03), whereas loading stiffness values of the fixation devices and bones did not differ between the 2 fixation groups (p>0.05). The present study failed to show that anterior-to-posterior directed headless screw fixation of coronoid fractures could adequately replace posterior-to-anterior placed screw fixation.",

The C4w and S4w groups were sacrificed 4 weeks and the C8w and S8w groups 8 weeks after the end of local treatment. Before sacrifice, intracardiac blood samples were retrieved for biochemical analysis and radiographies were taken. The right femurs of mice were then removed for histopathological evaluation. There were significant differences between the control and treatment groups when evaluated radiologically. Significantly higher levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin values were found in the treatment groups than in the controls (p<0.05).

Irreducibility in fracture-dislocations around the knee has only been described twice in the literature and never in association with a tibial plateau fracture. We report a unique case of an irreducible tibial plateau fracture-dislocation in which closed reduction was prevented by incarceration of the medial meniscus within the fracture site. The patient required transfer to our institution due to a concomitant traumatic brain injury. This contributed to a delay of 10 hours from injury to arrival in our resuscitation room. Progressive swelling and absent foot pulses resulted in immediate transfer to the operating theater where open reduction and internal fixation was performed with four-compartmental fasciotomies. The patient made a rapid and full recovery. Where closed techniques have failed, open reduction must then be undertaken in order to prevent the devastating complications of compartment syndrome and neurovascular compromise.",

Nineteen patients (12 male, 7 female; mean age: 34.4 years, range: 19 to 57 years) with thoracolumbar burst fractures treated using PS-LH between 1996 and 2006 were evaluated. The 17 patients (11 male, 6 female) who had a minimum of 2 years follow-up were included in the study. Radiographic outcome was evaluated by measuring the local kyphosis angle (LKA) and anterior vertebral height (AVH). Mean follow-up was 81 (range: 38 to 122) months and 15 patients completed more than 5 years of follow-up. Preoperative vertebral height loss and LKA of 41.2% (range: 29% to 64%) and 16.8° (range: 5° to 36°), respectively, were corrected to 16.3% (range: 0% to 44%) and -1.2° (range: -17° to 10°), respectively, after the operation. Mean losses of correction for vertebral height and local kyphosis were 1.8 ± 7.9% and 4.3 ± 7.1 degrees, respectively, at the 2-year follow-up and -1.8 ± 4.5% and 0.5 ± 1.5 degrees, respectively, between 2 years and 5 years. Loss of correction was significant for the LKA (p=0.023) but not for vertebral height (p=0.360). Five patients had losses of correction of more than 5 degrees. Changes between 2 and 5 years were not significant for vertebral height loss and local kyphosis (p=0.147 and p=0.205, respectively) and remained improved when compared with the preoperative values (p<0.001). Average SF-36 scores of the 15 patients evaluated at the final follow-up were comparable with the general Turkish population. The PS-LH construct provided a significant correction of the local kyphotic deformity. Augmentation of the upper and lower pedicle screw by the sublaminar hook did not completely prevent correction loss but was found to stabilize at the 5th year of follow-up without any clinical problems.",

Ischemia was created by clamping femoral arteries four and a half hours. Animals were killed and radiographic, histological and biomechanical evaluation was performed sixth week after surgery. The radiological and histological scores of the fracture-ischemia-CAPE group were significantly better than the fracture- ischemia group at 6th week follow-up.

Postoperative sexual functions were the same with the preoperative sexual function in 12 patients (11%). However, the postoperative scores were decreased in 96 (89%) patients, which meant that the sexual functioning was impaired. None of the patients reported persistent SD.EF in the cruris may impair sexual functions in males. The rate of SD was higher in male patients who were treated with EF.

The right sciatic nerve of 30 Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 260-330 g) was cut 1.5 cm proximal to the trifurcation and repaired primarily with 8/0 sutures using epineural technique. The rats were then divided into 3 groups. Saline was applied in Group 1 (n=10), ABS in Group 2 (n=10), and heparin in Group 3 (n=10) for 5 minutes to the repair site and surrounding tissues. In each group, electrophysiological measurements were performed with electromyography (EMG) at postoperative week 12. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used at week 12. Macroscopical and histopathological evaluations were conducted after sacrificing the rats at week 24 with total excision of the repaired sciatic nerves and surrounding tissues. The ABS and saline groups showed better healing than the heparin group. The ABS and saline groups were better in the histopathologic evaluations, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Statistically significant differences were not found between the 3 groups. Significant results may be obtained with larger studies.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of a new reconstruction with anconeus interposition arthroplasty in acute multiligamentous elbow injuries with irreparable radial head fractures. Five patients (3 males, 2 females) with a mean age of 42.6 years who underwent reconstruction with anconeus arhtroplasty were evaluated. With lateral approach, lateral capsuloligamentous structures were repaired, the radial head was excised, and anconeus interposition arthroplasty was performed. With medial intervention, the medial collateral ligament was repaired, and the ulnar nerve was transposed anteriorly. Clinical and radiological evaluation was performed the end of a mean follow-up period of 63 months. Mean Mayo Elbow Performance, Oxford Elbow, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores were 91, 41.4, and 13.76, respectively. Average elbow extension loss was 10.2° and average forearm supination loss was 5.2°. Dynamic elbow instability tests were within normal limits. On elbow radiographs, the average increase in cubitus valgus angle was 5.4°. No patient reported limitation in daily activities. There was no heterotopic ossification in any patient. Mean radial shortening was 1.39 mm, and no patient suffered from wrist pain at final follow-up. Average Mayo wrist score was 91 points. The combination of repair of the medial and lateral structures, radial head resection, and anconeus interposition arthroplasty may be a good alternative in the treatment of acute multiligamentous elbow injuries with irreparable radial head fracture.",

The review of our database revealed 176 cases of osteoid osteomas and 18 of osteoblastomas. Painful scoliosis was seen in 5 out of 6 cases. The lesion was found on the posterior part of the apical vertebra in the concave side of the scoliotic curve. Surgical treatment consisted of simple en bloc excision. Mean period between diagnosis and operation was 2.6 years, mean age at the time of surgery was 12.5 years, and mean preoperative major Cobb angle was 37.2°. Four patients with a mean follow-up of 4.3 years were included in the study. At final follow-up, Cobb angle was 7.6°, and the average percentage of correction was 79.6%.

All the patients had severe hip pain. In all cases, femoral shortening by subtrochanteric segmental resection and an anatomical reconstruction of the acetabulum were performed with the use of cementless femoral components and cementless acetabular components with screws, respectively. The Harris hip scoring system was used for functional assessments. Radiologic assessments were based on the DeLee and Charnley criteria for the acetabular component, and on the Gruen zones and the Engh criteria for the femoral component. The mean follow-up period was 44 months (range 22 to 79 months).Union was achieved in all cases in a mean of 14 weeks (range 11 to 15 weeks). The mean leg length discrepancy decreased from 4 cm to 1.5 cm postoperatively. A positive Trendelenburg sign was found in 13 patients and four patients before and after surgery, respectively. The mean Harris hip score improved from 37 to 83 postoperatively. None of the patients developed deep infection, dislocation, sciatic nerve palsy, or nonunion at the osteotomy site. No clinical and radiologic signs of loosening were observed and no revisions were required.Femoral shortening with subtrochanteric segmental resection in THR is a safe technique in patients with high total dislocation of the hip, leading to satisfactory functional results.",

Four patients had low- and 25 patients had high-level radial nerve palsy. The mean duration of tendon transfer after injury (paralysis time) was 19.7 months (range 1 day to 180 months). Clinical evaluations included joint range of motion and muscle strengths. Functional evaluation was made using the Tajima criteria. The mean follow-up was 56.9 months (range 5 to 90 months).Muscle strengths were measured as follows: 3 (n=3), 4 (n=10), and 5 (n=12) for the wrist extensor muscle; 3 (n=7), 4 (n=10), and 5 (n=12) for the finger extensor muscle; and 3 (n=6), 4 (n=13), and 5 (n=10) for the thumb extensor muscle. The mean wrist range of motion was 67.4 degrees , extension was 48.3 degrees (10 degrees to 70 degrees ), and flexion was 21.5 degrees (10 degrees to 55 degrees ). The mean metacarpophalangeal joint extension was 1.7 degrees (0 degrees to 12 degrees ), thumb abduction was 45.6 degrees (34 degrees to 56 degrees ), and thumb interphalangeal joint extension was 18 degrees (0 degrees to 30 degrees ). According to the Tajima criteria, the results were excellent in 15 patients (51.7%), good in nine patients (31%), and moderate in five patients (17.2%). Eight patients (27.6%) had radial deviation deformity and four patients (13.8%) had 1-level weaker finger extensor muscle strength compared to the other fingers. The flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) was used in the transfer of patients who developed radial deviation deformity.Treatment of irreparable radial nerve palsy with tendon transfers yields successful results. Radial deviation deformity mostly occurs in patients receiving FCU transfer for finger extension.",

Methods:In this retrospective study at our institution, patients in whom LSS was first performed because of an extremity-located musculoskeletal sarcoma, and subsequently amputation was carried out for various indications were included.Patient and tumor characteristics, details of surgical procedures, indications of amputation, number of operations, presence of metastasis before amputation, and post-amputation patient survival rates were analyzed.Results: A total of 25 patients (10 men, 15 women; mean age=41.96±21.88years), in whom amputation was performed after LSS as initial resection of an extremity sarcoma or re-resection(s) of a local recurrence, were included in the study.The leading oncological indication for amputation was local recurrence that occurred in 18 (72%) patients.Non-oncological indications included prosthetic infection in 5 (20%), mechanical failure in 1 (4%), and skin necrosis in 1 (4%) patient.The patients underwent a median of 2 (range, 1-4) limb-salvage procedures before amputation.Distant organ metastasis was detected in 22 (88%) patients during follow-up; in 13 (52%) of these patients, metastasis was present before amputation.A total of 11 (44%) patients were alive at the time of study with no evidence of the disease (n=3) or with disease (n=8), and 14 (56%) patients died of disease.The mean overall and post-amputation survival were 47±20.519(range, 11-204) months and 22±4.303(range, 2-78) months, respectively.The median follow-up was 27 (range, 6-125) months. Conclusion:The most common causes of amputation after LSS were local recurrence and prosthetic infection.Patients who underwent amputation after LSS developed a high rate of distant organ metastasis during follow-up and had reduced survival.",

The angle of cutting block to PCA and Cutting Thickness of the Medial and Lateral Condyle (CTMC, CTLC) were intraoperatively measured. In radiographic analysis, Preoperative Mechanical Femorotibial Angle (Pre-mFTA), Postoperative Mechanical Femorotibial Angle (Post-mFTA), and joint line changes were examined. Femoral component Rotation Angle (FCRA) was also measured by computed tomography. In gait analysis, the spatiotemporal parameters (walking speed, step length, and single support time) and kinematics parameters (flexion angle, extension angle, and transversal rotation) were collected at 12 months postoperatively. Furthermore, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) were performed at 12 months after surgery.CTMC and CTLC were both significantly higher in GB group than in the MR group (9.8±2.0 mm vs 8.5 ± 1.2 mm; 7.9 ± 1.8mm vs 6.8 ± 1.4mm; P = 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively). Angle of cutting block to PCA was statistically lower in GB group than in the MR group (1.7 ± 1.5° vs 3.1 ± 0.5 °; P < 0.001). FCRA is greater in the GB group compared to the MR group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (1.2 ± 2.8 ° vs 0.7 ± 2.0 °; P > 0.05). Although post-mFTA significantly improved compared with pre-mFTA in both groups, no significant difference was observed in the changes of post-mFTA between the two groups (0.9 ± 1.7° vs 0.3 ± 1.8°, P > 0.05). No significant differences were determined between the two groups in spatiotemporal gait parameters including walking speed, step length, and single support time. The sagittal max knee flexion range was significantly larger in the GB group than in the MR group (49.27 ± 5.24 ° vs 45.99 ± 8.21 °, P < 0.05). The flexion range did not reach the level of the control group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in WOMAC at 12 months follow-up (P > 0.05).Evidence from this study has revealed GB and MR techniques have both little effect on early clinical results of TKA. Nonetheless, GB technique can provide better knee flexion in the early postoperative gait status compared with MR technique.Level I, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of innervated digital artery perforator (IDAP) flap in the treatment of patients with fingertip injuries. Eighty-three patients (93 fingers; 70 male, 13 female; mean age = 35.2 years, age range = 5-65) with fingertip injuries who underwent acute or late reconstruction with IDAP flap between 2011 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The mean age was 35.2 (range = 5-65) years. Reconstructions performed in 85 fingers (91.4%) were acute, and 8 fingers (8.6%) were late. Hypersensitivity, cold intolerance, and patient satisfaction were questioned as subjective evaluation parameters. The objective patient outcome evaluations consisted of static two-point discrimination (s2PD) test, the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) test, and range of motion of the reconstructed fingers. The mean follow-up period was 33.1 (range = 12-62) months. The smallest flap size was 1.6 x 0.7 cm; the largest flap size was 4 x 2 cm. All flaps survived completely. There was no postoperative infection or donor site morbidity. Hyperesthesia was observed in 4 fingers (4.3%), of which 3 were mild and 1 was moderate. Eighteen patients (18 fingers, 19.3%) experienced mild cold intolerance on reconstructed fingertips. 75 patients (90.3%) were highly satisfied, and 8 patients (9.7%) were satisfied with functional and aesthetic results of their fingertip reconstructions. No range of motion limitation was observed in any joints of 90 fingers (96.8%). The s2PD in the flaps ranged from 2mmto 6mm(mean = 3.71 ± 0.97 mm), compared with 2mmto 5mm(mean = 2.73 ± 0.66 mm) on the contralateral hand. TheSWMtest results of the flaps ranged from 2.44 to 4.56, compared with 2.44 to 4.31 on the contralateral hand. The difference regarding s2PD and SWM test was statistically significant (P < 0.001). IDAP flap seems to be a sensate, reliable, and versatile flap that can be used in acute and late reconstructions of any type of fingertip defects. Satisfactory functional and aesthetic results can be achieved with better sensorial results and lower complication rates compared to other conventional reconstruction techniques.

Limb length was calculated using radiological assessment and their growth plate activation recorded from scintigraphic region of interest (ROI) assessment in the 3rd and 6th weeks. Histopathological findings of the growth plate were measured using qualitative and quantitative methods. All data were compared to the non-operated right side.Group 1 had effective scintigraphic, radiologic and histopathological findings than the other groups (p<0.05). In Group 3, growth plate activation was detected to be higher than the regular physis activity (p<0.05).Preoperative and postoperative scintigraphy combined with radiological assessment can provide an idea on the reversibility of growth plate activation.",

We investigated the feasibility of using a standard 3.5 mm AO locking compression plate (LCP) of adequate length for the stabilisation of mid-shaft fractures of the clavicle. The length and acromial and diaphyseal curvature depths were measured in 49 cadaveric clavicles. We then assessed how well the 6, 7, 8 and 9-hole plates fit on the clavicles. The mean clavicular length was 155±12 mm, with a mean acromial curvature of 18.1±3.7 mm and a mean diaphyseal curvature of 12 mm±4 mm. The optimum plate for the clavicle was a 7-hole LCP, providing adequate fixation in 48 of the 49 clavicles. The described technique for plate osteosynthesis of the clavicle with AO locking compression plate is feasible and results in a biomechanically strong construct for mid-shaft fractures. With the use of a locking plate, comminuted fractures may be bridged without a reduction in the strength of the construct.",

Forty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups, each containing 15 rats. The hydroxyapatite ceramics were vascularized by the superficial inferior epigastric artery and vein in all groups. These vessels passed through the hole of the hydroxyapatite blocks. In Group 2, mesenchymal stem cells were administered into the hydroxyapatite. In Group 3, both mesenchymal stem cells and HBOT were administered. The presence and density of any new bone formation and neovascularization were evaluated by radiography, microangiography, scintigraphy, biochemical analysis, and histomorphometry. Neovascularization and bone formation were significantly greater in Group 3, in which both mesenchymal stem cells and HBOT were applied, than the other groups. HBOT enhances neovascularization and osteogenesis, thus HBOT can provide optimal and faster prefabrication of a vascularized bone graft.",

First, the 12 intact specimens were mounted onto a materials testing machine to carry out biomechanical tests in pronation, supination and neutral positions, respectively. An axial load of 100 N was applied along the longitudinal axis of the forearm for 30 seconds in each position. Then, the twelve specimens were randomly divided into two groups. The radial head was resected in 6 specimens. And the central band of IOM was severed in another 6 specimens. Each group was tested by the same method. Finally, both the radial head and the IOM were excised in all specimens and biomechanical tests were performed.The rotational position of the forearm or simple severance of the IOM had no effect on longitudinal displacement. The radial longitudinal displacement increased significantly after resection of the radial head. The severance of the IOM had no effect on compressive stiffness of the radius. However, compressive stiffness of the radius decreased significantly after resection of the radial head.The radial head fracture combined with the IOM injury was the most important cause of the Essex-Lopresti injury, and the radial head fracture was the major factor. The IOM was the major structure to maintain the longitudinal stability of the forearm after resection of the radial head.",

In this retrospective study, files of 64 patients who underwent posterior decompression surgery with instrumentation for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis between March 2004 and April 2008 were examined. Patients were evaluated with Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) form, form of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis and the most recent postoperative orthopedic inspection findings for a minimum of one year after surgery. Mean age of patients was 59.9 years and mean follow-up was 27.9 months. When evaluated using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association form, postoperative scores in 63.5% of the patients improved. Based on this postoperative improvement; Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores were found statistically significant (p<0.001).

But Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores were found to have improved (83%) in cases with no systemic diseases. Our findings show that posterior decompression surgery with instrumentation is a useful treatment modality for patients with severe degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a space-occupying lesion in the proximal forearm resembling a glomus tumor. Excision of the mass and release of the AIN were performed. Histopathology confirmed a glomus tumor, and the patient remains asymptomatic at 1 year postoperatively. We stress the importance of imaging studies in patients when a suspected secondary nature of nerve entrapment is present.",

In this paper, a new technique is reported for the late treatment of OBPP patients with upper limb length discrepancy, in which both humeral external rotation osteotomy (ERO) and lengthening are applied with an intramedullary elongation nail. With this technique, upper limb function is improved through re-orientation of the shoulder arc to a more functional range, and further improvements will be seen in the appearance of the upper limb with the elimination of length discrepancy. It is also advocated that there is a potentiating effect of the humeral lengthening on shoulder movements gained by ERO when the osteotomy is applied above the deltoid insertion, as this allows more lateralized placement of the deltoid insertion.",

Seven patients were treated with Coonrad-Morrey total elbow arthroplasty for distal humeral nonunion. All patients were female, and the mean age was 65.6 years (range: 64-68 years). Patients were followed for at least 5 years, and the mean follow-up time was 73 months (range: 63-84 months). Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs at preoperative and early postoperative period of the joint replacement and latest follow-up were used to detect postoperative radiological changes in terms of loosening. The Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI) and Q-DASH Score were used for functional evaluation. At the latest follow-up, joint stability had been achieved in all 7 patients. Six patients (85.7%) were pain free. The mean range of motion was 30° (range: 0-60°) preoperatively, and this improved to 90.7° (range: 60-110°) at the latest follow-up (p<0.05). Five patients (71.4%) had excellent or good outcomes on the MEPI. The mean Q-DASH Score was improved from 93.2 to 34.5 (p<0.01). Two humeral components had aseptic loosening, and 1 of them was revised. Semiconstrained total elbow arthroplasty can be a reliable choice of treatment if other internal fixation methods fail. Significant pain relief and improvements in elbow function and stability can be achieved with semiconstrained elbow arthroplasty in patients with distal humeral nonunion.",

While 84 of the TKA patients underwent low-angle CPM application, 86 of the patients underwent high-angle CPM application. The patients' functional activities were compared using the Iowa Level of Assistance Scale (ILAS), gait speeds using the Iowa Ambulation Velocity Scale (IAVS), knee scores using the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Knee Score, and the duration of hospital stays with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) preoperatively and on postoperative Day 2, Day 6, and at discharge.It was found that patients in the high-angle group had lower pain levels than did the patients in the low-angle group postsurgery (p<0.05). Patients in the high-angle group achieved their functional activities more independently on postoperative Day 2, Day 6, and at discharge than did the patients in the low-angle group (p<0.05). However, gait speed of patients in the former group was lower than that of the patients in the latter group (p<0.05).Although low-angle CPM application produced better results in terms of gait speed following TKA, the high-angle CPM application was superior in terms of independence levels of functional activities in the early postsurgery period. This result suggests that the appropriate use of rehabilitation methods such as CPM applications may guide clinicians to increase patients' level of independence.",

The study included 28 PD cases (mean age: 8 ± 3.8) and 25 healthy age-matched control subjects. EPC, serum VEGF-A and immunoglobulin levels were measured in peripheral blood samples. Comparisons and correlation analysis were performed. In the PD group, 17 subjects were in the fragmentation stage and 11 in the healing stage. Four patients had bilateral disease and 14 had hypogammaglobulinemia. Median EPC count of the PD group was 80 and was significantly higher than those of the control group (p=0.011). No significant difference was determined in serum VEGF-A levels (p=0.354). EPC count were inversely correlated with serum IgG levels of the PD group (r=0.403, p=0.03). Absolute EPC count was also significantly higher in the fragmentation stage than in the healing stage and were also greater in bilaterally affected than in unilaterally affected patients. Circulating EPC count was correlated to the serum VEGF-A levels in patients with fragmentation stage of PD (r=0.605, p=0.01) and in those with hypogammaglobulinemia (r=0.599, p=0.001). High EPC count at the fragmentation stage of PD and relatively higher counts in bilateral disease suggest that EPC may be a valuable marker in the diagnosis and follow-up of PD. Additional studies are needed to explain the strong correlation between EPC and serum VEGF-A level in the fragmentation stage and in the presence of hypogammaglobulinemia.",

In an experimental design, 3 different doses of teicoplanin and ciprofloxacin (800, 1600 and 3200 mg) were added to bone cement. Mechanical tests using compression and four-point bending tests were performed on Day 1 and after antibiotic leaching in water at 37°C on Day 15. Specimens that contained no antibiotics served as controls. Mechanical strength for each antibiotic concentration on Day 1 and Day 15 were evaluated. Both teicoplanin and ciprofloxacin significantly decreased the mean strength values in compression and four-point bending tests at Days 1 and 15 (p<0.05). While teicoplanin significantly decreased the mean strength values at high doses in both tests at Days 1 and 15 (p<0.05), ciprofloxacin did not significantly change these values. When the effects of two drugs compared, there were significant differences at the 3200 mg dose at Day 1 and at 1600 and 3200 mg doses at Day 15 in the compression testing and at 3200 mg at Day 15 in the four-point bending test. Teicoplanin and ciprofloxacin addition may adversely affect the biomechanical strength of bone cement. Ciprofloxacin addition seems to have less of a negative effect on strength than teicoplanin.",

The knee and ankle joints were fixed with a Kirschner wire in the immobilization atrophy group and sciatic nerve resection was performed in the denervation group. The unaffected side of each group was used as controls. The weight, volume, height, diameter and the rate of elongation of the Achilles tendons, and the amount of fat deposition, degeneration and fibrosis were compared between the two groups at the end of 3 weeks. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed for a histopathological assessment of the muscles. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for comparisons. Loss of the volume, weight and muscle length was significantly lower in the denervation group than the immobilization group (p<0.05). Differences between the diameter of the Achilles tendon and length and diameter of the short heads were not statistically significant. There were statistically significant differences in fat deposition, degeneration and fibrosis between the degeneration group and the immobilization group (p<0.05). Pixel counting revealed a significant difference in the number of pixels in the fatty tissue area (white area) between the denervation group and the immobilization group (p<0.05).

The results indicated that the posterolateral window was bounded medially by the lateral tubercle of the posterior process of the talus (LTPT), laterally by the posterior border of lateral malleolar (PBLM), superiorly by the trochlear articular surface (TAS), and inferiorly by the posterior calcaneal facet (PCF). The height and width of the posterolateral window were 1.89±0.04 cm and 0.91±0.01 cm, respectively. LMT was 0.40±0.01 cm, LAT was 0.19±0.02 cm, and SN was 0.62±0.04 cm. The present data showed that posterior screw insertion may be a safer screw insertion technique for talar neck fractures. Performing the operation through the posterolateral window had no negative effect on surrounding tissues such as the flexor hallucis longus and posterior talofibular ligament tissues when the ankle joint was positioned in a neutral position. Additionally, the screw head should be countersunk to reduce intraoperative risk. The posterolateral window is a safer point for posterolateral screw insertion for talar neck fractures.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to present a technique that allows the surgeon to easily and reliably achieve volar tilt in dorsally displaced distal radius fractures treated with variable-angle volar locking plates. The study introduced this technique using 2.4 mm variable angle locking screws as reduction tools, and investigated the radiological outcomes of this technique. A total of 42 patients (30 female and 12 male; mean age: 58 years, range, 25 to 84 years) with unstable distal radius fractures were treated with this technique. All were patients with insufficient volar tilt in spite of primary fracture reduction through classic reduction techniques such as traction, manipulation, and direct fragment manipulation. Postoperatively, the patients were instructed to perform wrist active and passive motion exercises at home for minimum 30 minutes a day, and were allowed to perform activities of daily living after removal of splint. The patients were evaluated radiographically at minimum twelve months after surgery. Mean follow-up period was 15.1 months (range: 12 to 24 months). Volar tilt of the distal radius before surgery was -11.9±10.4 (minus value means dorsal angulation), and after screw leverage was 11.5±4.3° (uninjured side: 11.7±2.3°). Mean radiological outcomes at final visit were as follows: volar tilt; 10.8±4.5°, radial inclination; 24±3.2°, radial height; 12.2±1.7 mm, and ulnar variance; 0.2±1.7 mm. We describe a simple, reliable technique to fine-tune volar tilt in dorsally displaced distal radius fractures fixed with variable-angle volar locking plates. This technique is especially useful when volar tilt remains insufficient in spite of primary fracture reduction through classic techniques.",

Rabbit rotator cuff tenotomy and repair was conducted on 24 rabbits in 4 groups: control (Group A), Dualmesh® (Group B), Seprafilm® (Group C), and silicone (Group D). Anti-adhesive barrier materials were sutured over the repaired rotator cuff. Macroscopic and histological evaluations were made at the end of the sixth postoperative week. Macroscopic evaluation revealed that minimal adhesion occurred in the control and silicone groups, while the Seprafilm® and Dualmesh® groups showed evidence of fibrosis. Microscopic evaluation revealed diffuse fibrosis and collagen accumulation in the Dualmesh® and Seprafilm® groups, whereas minimal collagen deposition and inflammatory cell reaction was found among the silicone and control groups. Significant differences were found between the silicone and Dualmesh® (p=0.001) and silicone and Seprafilm® groups (p=0.002), as well as between the control and Dualmesh® (p=0.002) and control and Seprafilm® groups (p=0.002). Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE/Dualmesh®) and sodium hyaluronate carboxymethyl cellulose (SH-CMC/Seprafilm®) did not prevent or attenuate postoperative subacromial fibrosis following cuff tear repair.

All the rabbits were randomly divided into two groups (n = 6 per group): PRP group and control group. A two-ring, circular external fixator was applied to the right tibia of each rabbit in both groups. After corticotomy, all the tibiae were distracted at a rate of 0.5 mm/day for 20 days. PRP was injected to the osteotomy sites on the 7th, 14th, and 21st days postoperatively. Mineral density of the new bone tissue formed in the distraction zone was measured using quantitative computed tomography in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th weeks. At the end of the 6th week, the animals were sacrificed, and the specimens were evaluated biomechanically and histologically.Microcomputed tomography assessment showed significant bone mineral density increase from the 3rd to the 6th week (62.3% and 43.7% for the PRP and control groups, respectively). In the PRP group, the measurements on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th weeks were 416 ± 29, 487 ± 9.9, and 675 ± 37.8 HU (Hounsfield units), respectively, whereas in the control group were 313, 374, and 450 HU, respectively. In the comparison of weekly measurements of the two groups, the increase in bone density in the PRP group was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.001). During the mechanical tests, in the PRP group, the mean torsion was 46.50°and the mean torque 0.53 Nm, while in the control group, the mean torsion was 19.33°and the mean torque 0.65 Nm. The mechanical analysis of the groups revealed significant differences in the mean maximum torsion angles (P = 0.024). The histological examination showed that both groups had external and internal periosteal calli. Callus tissue in four rabbits in the PRP group and two rabbits in the control group was remodeled; normal bone formation occurred and distracted bone ends were completely healed.The results of the present study have indicated that PRP injection can enhance bone regenerate consolidation and increase bone mineral density during the healing process of distraction osteogenesis.",

The patient data, including Harris Hip Score (HHS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and conversion to THA, were documented.The right hip of 26 patients and the left hip of 28 patients were involved. Bilateral FVFG surgery was performed on seven patients due to bilateral OFH. The mean follow-up time was 5.5 (range 2-14) years. Survival of the femoral head was observed in 39 hips (72.2%), while the femoral head collapse was observed in 15 femoral heads (27.8%). The mean preoperative HHS increased from 46.5 (range=12-85) to 86.5 (range=33-100) postoperatively (P < 0.001). The mean preoperative VAS score improved from 8.2 (range=2-10) to 1.3 (range=0-10) postoperatively (P < 0.001). THA was performed on seven hips at a mean follow-up time of 1.8 years (range=0.7-3.3). There was no significant difference in the collapse rate between unilateral or bilateral OFH (P=0.175).

Patients were queried regarding the presence of preoperative and postoperative paresthesia. Electromyography (EMG) was performed on all patients preoperatively and at the final control. Preoperative and postoperative pain with palpation were evaluated over the cubital tunnel. The Dellon classification was used for preoperative evaluation of patient symptoms, and the Bishop classification was used for postoperative evaluation. Hand grip strength was measured with a dynamometer. At the preoperative and postoperative final follow-up, the palmar, key, and tip pinches were measured with a pinchmeter. The surgical incision length was measured with a ruler at the end of the operation in all patients. The operation duration was recorded as the time interval between the beginning of the incision and the end of the tourniquet.The overall mean age was 43.8 (range; 22 to 66) years. Nine patients were female, and 23 patients were male. No Dellon I patients were present in either group. Overall, 68.75% of the patients were Dellon II and 31.25% were Dellon III. According to the Bishop score, excellent and good results were obtained in 84.6% of the patients in Group I and 73.7% of the patients in Group II. The final follow-up examination found continued paraesthesia in 6 (18.75%) patients. Comparison of the improvement in the postoperative NCV value showed a statistically significantly superior improvement in Group I compared to Group II. The postoperative palmar pinch and tip pinch tests results were statistically significantly better in group I than in group II.Although EISD had better results clinically, no statistically significant difference was found between the two techniques in terms of Bishop scores and complications. Examination of the electrophysiological results suggested a better outcome in patients who underwent EISD.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

Data were collected both before surgery (T0) and one year after surgery (T1). QoL was measured using ODI and COMI. The successful clinical outcome was defined by the combination of the following four criteria: no recurrence of spondylodiscitis, back pain ≤4 on visual analogue scale or relief of ≥3 points, absence of LS-related neurological deficit, and radiological fusion of the affected segment. For subgroup analysis, group 1 consisted of patients with a favorable treatment outcome (meeting all four criteria), while group 2 included patients with unfavorable treatment outcome (meeting ≤3 criteria).Ninety-two LS patients (median age = 66 years; age range = 57-74) were analyzed. QoL scores improved significantly. Threshold values for the ODI and COMI were calculated at 35 and 4.2 points, respectively. The area under curve for the ODI was 0.856 (95%-CI 0.767- 0.945; P<0.001) and 0.839 (95% CI-0.749-0.928; P<0.001) for the COMI score. Eighty percent of patients achieved a favorable outcome.Objective measurement and evaluation of successful surgical treatment of spondylodiscitis require defined thresholds of quality of life scores. We were able to define such thresholds for Oswestry Disability Index and Core Outcome Measures Index. These can be useful to assess clinically relevant changes and therefore allow a more precise estimation of the post-surgical outcome.Level II, Prognostic study.",

The mean age was 47.5 years (range=18-61). The mean follow-up was 92.3 months (range=24-120). Failure to preserve the biological hip joint, as treated with total hip replacement or the Girdlestone procedure, was defined as a poor outcome. Patients' demographic information, comorbidities, fracture types, surgical approach, concomitant injuries, reduction quality, and complications were analyzed. Computed tomography was utilized to evaluate the fracture type and quality of reduction. Factors affecting poor outcomes were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. The modified Harris Hip Score was also used to evaluate the functional status.The poor outcome rate was 10.1%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that dislocation (odds ratio: 44.87, confi- dence interval: 3.18-633.22, P=.005), wound site problems (odds ratio: 9.09, confidence interval: 1.01-81.12, P=.04), reduction quality (odds ratio: 77.88, confidence interval: 5.95-1019.07, P = .001), and diabetes (odds ratio: 7.29, confidence interval: 1.01-52.07, P = .04) were associated with poor outcomes. Eight of the 12 patients with poor outcomes had a fair Harris Hip Score, and 4 had a poor Harris Hip Score. The relationship between poor outcomes and Harris Hip Score was found to be significant (P < .001).For a favorable functional outcome in acetabular fractures, preservation of the biological hip joint should be a top priority. The accompanying dislocation and the patient's diabetes appear to be uncontrollable factors for the poor prognosis. Good reduction qual- ity and wound infection protection are modifiable factors.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of osteosarcopenia on second fracture development and mortality in patients aged above 60 years undergoing vertebroplasty because of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF).A retrospective evaluation was conducted on 104 patients treated by vertebroplasty because of OVF between 2016 and 2021. The L3 vertebra Hounsfield unit values and the psoas muscle index (PMI) values measured at the L3 vertebra level were obtained from the patients' medical data and computed tomography images. Using these measurements, the patients were divided into 3 groups: only osteoporosis (OO group), only sarcopenia (OS group), and osteosarcopenia (OSP group). Differences between the groups were evaluated regarding second OVCF development and mortality.The study included 104 patients, comprising 30 males and 74 females aged 60-92 years. The OS group included 10 patients, the OO group included 54 patients, and the OSP group consisted of 40 patients. A single vertebral fracture occurred in 72 patients, and 2 vertebral fractures occurred in 32 patients. The chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis results showed no statistically significant difference between the 3 groups for the risk of second vertebral fracture. Sarcopenia, either alone or in combination with osteoporosis, was seen to have a negative effect on the survival of patients who underwent vertebro- plasty following a vertebral fracture.This study has shown that osteosarcopenia did not increase the risk of developing a second vertebral fracture, but it increased mortality 2.8-fold for those who underwent vertebroplasty after vertebral fracture.Level III, Prognostic study.",

A 34-year-old woman presented with severe right-sided pain in the shoulder, arm, neck, and hemithorax, and numbness in her right upper extremity. Systemic radiographs, cervical and brachial plexus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and thorax computed tomography (CT) did not show any pathology. In a retrospective review of the shoulder MRI sections, an edematous appearance was noted in the right clavicle and adjacent soft tissues, suggesting a stress fracture of the clavicle. The patient was followed-up with activity limitation and analgesic treatment and her complaints subsided gradually. Control radiographs obtained 10 months later showed fracture healing with atypical callus formation. Stress fractures of the clavicle must be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of shoulder pain presenting as an atypical severe arm pain radiating to the upper extremity and hemithorax. In suspected cases, it may be helpful to obtain CT and MRI sections parallel to the long axis of the clavicle.",

The mean age was 46+/-14 years (range 21 to 82 years) in the dorsal and 47+/-14 years (range 18 to 69 years) in the palmar plate groups. The fractures were classified according to the AO/ASIF system. Objective and subjective functional assessments were made using the Gartland-Werley and Quick-DASH scales, respectively. The mean follow-up was 78+/-19 months (range 12 to 101 months) and 18+/-5 months (range 12 to 28 months) with dorsal and palmar plating, respectively.The mean Gartland-Werley and Quick-DASH scores were 2.3+/-2.1 (range 0 to 9) and 2.0+/-2.2 (range 0 to 9) with dorsal plating, and 2.0+/-2.1 (range 0 to 6) and 1.9+/-2.7 (range 0 to 9) with palmar plating, respectively. The two groups did not differ with respect to the Gartland-Werley and Quick-DASH scores (p>0.05). Time to return to work or daily activities was also similar (1.9+/-0.3 months vs 1.8+/-0.4 months). However, patients treated with dorsal plating exhibited significantly greater values in the following parameters measured on early and late postoperative radiograms: loss of palmar tilt (p=0.001), radial height (p=0.001), radial inclination (p=0.049), and change in ulnar variance (p=0.049). Moreover, complications were seen in eight patients (19.5%) with dorsal plating, whereas no complications occurred with palmar locking plate (p=0.024).Although the two fixation methods do not differ with respect to functional results, palmar locking plating seems to provide a more rigid fixation resulting in significantly reduced collapse and a very low complication rate.",

Seven patients had femoral, and four patients had tibial involvement. The main complaint was pain. The patients were evaluated with respect to complaints and radiologically (X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) after a mean follow-up of 12.4 years (range 6 to 24 years).During the follow up period, all the patients remained symptom-free without the need for antibiotic treatment except for one patient with tibial involvement, whose pain recurred after five years. The patient's complaint disappeared following reoperation with the same technique. Histologic examination of surgical biopsies showed nonspecific changes consistent with low-grade chronic osteomyelitis. Cultures were negative in all cases. Control radiographies showed no progression of sclerosis. Computed tomography showed cortical bone formation surrounding the transposed muscle, and magnetic resonance imaging showed fatty degeneration in the transposed muscle, without any signs of active osteomyelitis.The aim of gutter creation and muscle transposition is to increase blood supply to the diseased bone segment, without the need for microsurgical interventions and secondary reconstructive procedures. Our long-term results show that this technique is efficacious in patients with femoral and tibial involvement.",

The control group (n=28) received only conventional physical therapy. Group I and II, each consisting of 29 patients, were treated with conventional physical therapy combined with CPM that was started on the first and third postoperative days, respectively, and continued until discharge with three one-hour sessions daily. Preoperative and postoperative measurements of the knee range of motion were recorded. Clinical and functional results were assessed using the Knee Society rating system. The patients were followed-up for at least two years (range 26 to 52 months).The duration of CPM was 22 hours in group I, and 19 hours in group II (p>0.05). Knee flexion values measured in the CPM groups on day 3 and at discharge showed significant differences with those of the control group, but no significant differences were found between the groups after the first postoperative month in this respect (p>0.05). The mean duration to reach 100 degrees of passive knee flexion (p=0.03) and the mean length of hospital stay (p=0.04) in the CPM groups were shorter by three and two days compared to the control group, respectively.

Six patients were diplegic, two patients were paraplegic, and one patient was hemiplegic. Four patients had unilateral, five patients had bilateral involvement.

The patients were assessed with the AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) hindfoot scoring system pre- and postoperatively. The mean follow-up was 30 months (range 6 to 81 months).Compared with the preoperative values, the mean AOFAS hindfoot score increased from 53 (range 41 to 81) to 68.4 (range 51 to 96), the mean talocalcaneal angle decreased from 52.6 degrees to 30.4 degrees , and from 55.8 degrees to 35.9 degrees in frontal and sagittal planes, respectively (p<0.05). The mean ankle valgus angle measured on anteroposterior radiographs remained unchanged (mean 5 degrees ). Of five patients who underwent bilateral surgery, three (21.4%) developed donor-site fibular nonunion on one side. One (7.1%) of these patients also had graft nonunion and displacement. Treatment was rated as satisfactory by the parents of seven patients (77.8%; p<0.05).Despite donor-site morbidity, the Grice subtalar extra-articular arthrodesis is an effective procedure for the correction of hindfoot alignment in patients with pes planovalgus deformity secondary to cerebral palsy.",

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of pedicle screw fixation in the thoracic spine.We retrospectively reviewed 144 patients (65 males, 79 females; mean age 38 years; range 9 to 82 years) who underwent posterior thoracic pedicle screw instrumentation. A total of 827 thoracic pedicle screws were inserted to the thoracic spine (T1-12) by the same senior spine surgeon using the free-hand technique. Indications for thoracic spine surgery were deformities (n=47, 32.6%), metastatic or primary tumors (n=15, 10.4%), spinal infections (n=7, 4.9%), degenerative diseases (n=13, 9%), and spinal trauma (n=62, 43.1%). Screw containment was assessed by three independent reviewers on postoperative plain radiographs. In addition, thin-slice computed tomography scans were obtained in 21 suspected cases (29 screws).Screw containment was found in 94.3% (780 screws). Incorrect screw placement was found in 47 screws (5.7%), including 31 screws (3.8%) demonstrated by plain radiographs, and 16 screws (1.9%) demonstrated by thin-slice computed tomography scans. More than half of the faulty screws (n=24, 51.1%) were detected in scoliosis patients, especially on the concave side of the curvature (83.3%). The most frequent site of faulty screw placement was the T8 level (21.3%). No symptoms or complications occurred related to faulty screw placement.The high accuracy of thoracic pedicle screw placement (94.3%) using the free-hand technique suggests that pedicle screw fixation of the thoracic spine is safe, reliable, and useful in the treatment of all types of spinal diseases.",

This study, sonographically examined the patellar tendons of patients treated via intramedullary nailing.Thirty-two patients with a tibial shaft fracture requiring intramedullary nailing via a transpatellar approach were included in the study. After all patients were grouped by reference to the presence of anterior knee pain, bilateral patellar tendon ultrasonography was performed.Thirty-two patients were included in the study. Patients were measured postop average in 38.3 months (10th months - 84th months). It was determined that 10 patients of total 32 (31.3%) had anterior knee pain. There were no statistically differences between study groups in the length of patellar tendon. In the painless group; patellar tendon was wider and thicker in the operated side than the non operated side. The mean differences in the thickness between operated side versus non - operated side of the painless group were 5.3 ± 1.8 in the operated side and 3.9 ± 1.4 in the non - operated side (p = 0.007 < 0.05).

Seventeen extremities of 13 patients (7 women and 6 men; mean age: 16 ± 5.4 years) who had fixator assisted plating of the distal femur for genu valgum deformity were evaluated. Mechanical axis deviation (MAD) and mechanical lateral distal femoral angles (mLDFA) were measured pre-operatively and post-operatively. mLDFA was graded as perfect if it is between 85° and 90°(85° ≤ x ≤ 90°); overcorrection if it is between 91° and 95° (91° ≤ x ≤ 95°) and undercorrection if it is between 80° and 85° (80° ≤ x < 85°). Measurements beyond those limits were graded as a poor result. The position of the mechanical axis line with respect to center of the knee was graded from zone 1 to zone 4 pre-operatively and post-operatively. The mean follow-up period was 12.8 ± 3.7 months. The pre-operative and post-operative mLDFA was 70.5°±9.4° (range, 57°–82°) and 87.7° ± 3.5° (range, 80°–94°), respectively (p < 0.001). Based on post-operative standing radiographs, the correction was graded perfect in 12 femurs. The correction in three femurs were graded as overcorrection and graded as undercorrection in two femurs. Sagittal plane correction was also achieved in two femurs. Peroneal nerve decompression was done in three patients (5 extremities) with valgus deformity over 30°. The mechanical axes in all lower extremities were passing through zone 2 or more, pre-operatively, whereas the mechanical axes were in zone 2 or more in five extremities post-operatively. Fixator assisted plating is an effective treatment modality in patients with distal femoral valgus deformity. Although the technique enables to obtain significant correction in coronal plane it has the disadvantages of over- and undercorrection. Thus, we advise intraoperative confirmation of the correction under fluoroscopic control. Level of Evidence: Level IV Therapeutic Study.",

Patients' ARCO staging indicated 36 hips of stage IIa, 115 hips of stage IIb and 48 hips of stage IIc. The etiology of ONFH mainly including hormones (93 patients), alcohol (64 patients) and other (23 patients). The mean follow-up time of SMBF and CIDBF groups were (51.78 ± 2.35) and (52.73 ± 3.71) months, respectively. The time of removing sutures, operation time, amount of bleeding and length of incision in SMBF group were superior to those in the CIDBF group, and those differences between the SMBF and CIDBF groups were not significant (all p values > 0.28). The Harris score between the two groups was similar after operation and postoperative 12 month, and the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05), whereas the difference of the postoperative 24 and 48 months was statistically significant (p ˂ 0.05). X-ray analysis showed improvement of osteonecrosis in both two groups after surgery, and as time went on, the total hip amount decreased, the replacement amount increased.Both bone flap grafts appear to be effective methods for treatment of early osteonecrosis of femoral head (ARCOⅡ), and the SMBF is a relatively simple technique and easy for mastering, and it is a reliable method for clinical application.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

The patients with CRHD were identified according to medical history, plain radiographs or magnetic resonance imagings. The outcomes were evaluated through comparison of the preoperative and postoperative motion range of elbow and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS).After a follow-up of 13-35 months (22.29 ± 5.80), compared with pre-operation, the flexion (132.14 ± 3.23° vs 123.21 ± 7.75°, P = 0.003), extension (8.21 ± 4.21° vs 1.07 ± 3.50°, P = 0.003), and pronation of elbow (83.21 ± 4.21° vs 80.36 ± 4.14°, P = 0.011) improved significantly in all patients. Furthermore, the carrying angle was recovered to the normal level (5-15°) in all of these patients (18.57 ± 5.69° vs 8.21 ± 2.49°, P = 0.001).

Patients were divided into two groups according to the technique used, which depended on the date of their surgery. Group 1 consisted of 18 children (14 males and four females; mean age: 10.3 years; age range: 7-16 years) who underwent both-bone fracture fixation using closed reduction and percutaneous pinning; Group 2 consisted of 16 children (12 males and four females; mean age: 10.1 years; age range: 6-15 years) who underwent only radius fracture fixation. The average follow-up was 65.6 months in Group 1 and 38.9 months in Group 2. Operating time, fluoroscopy exposure time, functional results (Mayo Wrist Score, visual analogue scale score, and range of motion), radiological results (time to union and malunion), and complications were recorded as outcome parameters.The mean operating time was 35 min (range: 30-45 min) in Group 1 and 19 min (range: 10-25 min) in Group 2 (p<0.001). The mean fluoroscopy exposure time was 54 sec (range: 40-70 sec) in Group 1 and 18 sec (range: 10-26 sec) in Group 2 (p<0.001). Only three patients in Group 1 and four patients in Group 2 exhibited <10° of limitation in pronation and supination. No significant differences were determined between the groups with respect to functional scores (p=1.000). Final follow-up radiographs showed no malalignment in either group. In terms of time to union, there was no significant difference between groups (p=1.000). Additionally, only three minor complications associated with the pin track (two patients in Group 1 and one patient in Group 2) were noted.In children with distal both-bone fractures, fixation of the radius fracture alone may be considered as an alternative method of treatment to fixation of both forearm bones as it results in satisfactory functional and radiographic outcomes.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

The survey comprised a total of 19 questions to evaluate the academic works conducted and obstacles encountered during residency. Academic work was defined as an article published in the peer-reviewed journals as well as an oral or poster presentation at a national or international congress. Case reports, letters to the editor, and technical notes were excluded.Data were obtained from 116 respondents who completed the survey. In peer-reviewed journals in Science Citation Index (SCI) or SCI-Expanded, the mean number of articles published with and without the first name per resident was 0.09 and 0.73, respectively. In peer-reviewed journals other than those in SCI and SCI-Expanded, the mean number of articles published with and without the first name per resident was 0.37 and 1, respectively. The mean number of oral and poster presentations per resident at national and international congresses was 2.63 and 4.67, respectively. No significant difference in the number of academic works was noted between the regions and institutions (p>0.05). A significant positive correlation was observed between the number of associate professors and assistant professors in the clinic and the total number of academic works (article plus presentation) (p<0.01 and p=0.017, respectively). Regarding encouragement and support to academic works, 6.9% of the respondents found the clinic to be excellent, 20.7% good, 24.1% moderate, and 48.3% bad. No significant difference in encouragement and support to academic works was noted among the institutions (p=0.115). The most common obstacle encountered in conducting academic works was long working hours (74.5%).Regardless of the region and institution, the participation of orthopedic residents in academic works is low in Turkey. Several obstacles were encountered in conducting academic works, with the most common being long working hours.Level IV, Diagnostic study.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the clinical, pathological, and prognostic characteristics of acral metastases in patients with malignant disease and to determine the impact of different types of acral metastasis treatment on patient survival. METHODS In this retrospective study, 64 acral metastatic lesions in 46 patients (17 women, 29 men; mean age, 61.5 years; age range, 35-82 years) who were evaluated by the Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors Council of our institute from 2015 to 2019 were included. The patients' primary tumor site, tumor type, localization of acral metastases, main symptom, duration from the diagnosis of the primary tumor to the diagnosis of acral metastasis, duration from the diagnosis of acral metastasis to death, and survival data were analyzed. The diagnosis of acral metastasis was confirmed by histopathological evaluation in 38 patients and clinical and radiological assessment of the lesions in 8 patients. The treatment type for each acral metastasis was individualized by the institutional Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors Council and categorized into 3 groups: excisional surgery (amputations and resections), palliative surgery (prophylactic fixation, intralesional curettage, and bone cement augmentation), and non-surgical treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy). RESULTS A total of 16 acral metastases (25%) were identified in the upper extremity and 48 (75%) in the lower extremity. The most common primary tumor site was the lungs (32.6%), and the most common tumor type was adenocarcinoma (43.2%). The most frequent symptom and the primary reason for admission was pain (58.7%). The mean duration between the diagnosis of primary tumor and the diagnosis of acral metastasis was 19.1 (range, 0-124) months. No significant correlation was determined between the primary tumor types and duration from the diagnosis of primary tumor to the diagnosis of acral metastasis (p=0.278). Acral metastases were treated by excisional surgery in 15 (32.6%) patients, palliative surgery combined with non-surgical treatment in 10 (21.7%) patients, and only non-surgical treatment modalities in 21 (45.7%) patients. No significant correlation existed between the treatment types and patient survival (p=0.058). At the final follow-up, 30 (65.2%) patients were dead owing to the disease. The mean overall survival of the entire study group was 24.9 (range, 3-55) months. The mean duration between the diagnosis of acral metastasis and death was 7.6 (range, 3-24) months in patients who were dead owing to the disease (p=0.012). CONCLUSION When the diagnosis of acral metastasis is established, it should be borne in mind that the most common primary tumor site and type are most likely the lungs and adenocarcinoma, respectively. The treatment type for acral metastasis may have no significant impact on patient survival, but the extensiveness of the disease may be a critical factor for survival.

    "abstract": "Objective The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of treatment and the rate of complications in children treated with flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) for radial neck fractures. Methods The study included 26 children (11 males and 15 females) with a median age of 9.5 years, treated with FIN for the radial neck fractures between May 2011 and May 2018. Immobilization after the surgery was not used. The median follow-up was 41 months. According to the Judet classification, 15 fractures were classified as type III and 11 as Type IV. For each patient, clinical, radiological, and disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) scores were calculated. Results All patients achieved complete radiographic healing at a median of 5 weeks. The nails were removed at a median of 4 months. The rate of complications was 11.5%, including 1 radial head necrosis, 1 angulation of 15°, and 1 displacement of the radial head. Twenty patients (76.9%) achieved a perfect clinical healing, while 23 patients (88.5%) achieved a perfect radiological healing. The median DASH score was 1.25. No cases of delayed healing were recorded. After removing of the nails, all patients returned to full function of the extremity and all complications were resolved. Conclusion The use of FIN for treating fractures of the radial neck in children shows very good functional and cosmetic results. It allows mobilization with rapid pain reduction. It is a minimally invasive, simple, and reproducible technique with a low rate of complication. Owing to excellent results, surgical stabilization of radial head and neck fractures using FIN is recommended in children and adolescents. Level of evidence Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

They were then divided into 2 groups according to the age at which the surgery was performed: before and after the age of 4 years. Improvement in the acetabular index was examined on follow-up radiographs. The presence of avascular necrosis (AVN) was determined and classified on the basis of the Kalamchi-MacEwen classification on final follow-up radiographs. Clinical assessment was performed with the modified McKay criteria at the final follow-up appointment.A total of 19 children (14 girls, 5 boys; mean age=37.5±21 months) (25 hips) were included. Their mean age was 27.9±4.9 and 63.3±19.7 months in children operated before and after the age of 4 years, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 29.9±19 and 19.6±5 months in children operated before and after the age of 4 years, respectively. No significant difference was observed in improvements in the acetabular index between children younger than 4 years (24±6.9°) and those older than 4 years (20.7±6.7°) (p=0.25). According to the modified McKay criteria, all the children younger than 4 years exhibited excellent or good clinical results compared with those operated after the age of 4 years (67%) (p=0.013). At the final follow-up, 64% of all patients demonstrated no radiographical sign of AVN. The rates of AVN were significantly higher in children operated after the age of 4 years (33%) than in those operated before the age of 4 years (19%) (p=0.049).Better clinical and radiographical results can be expected from radical reduction in children undergoing surgery before the age of 4 years.level III, Therapeutic Study.",

Overall, 952 patients were included with a sample size that ranged from 20 to 314. Studies included both arthroscopy and open surgery and presented low to moderate ROB. The prognostic factors investigated were depression, psychological distress, anxiety, catastrophizing, fear avoidance beliefs, self-efficacy and quantitative sensory testing. Only avoidance behaviors and self-efficacy were significantly related to post-surgical pain and function at 12 months after surgery.Fear avoidance beliefs and inadequate coping strategies seem to be the most correlated factors with the worst pain and function scores. Surgeons and physical therapists should look for patients with signs of altered central pain modulation before surgery as they might be at risk of unfavorable outcome.Level II, Therapeutic Study.",

The status of joint awareness after knee replacement surgery was assessed using the Turkish version of the FJS-12 at the final follow-up by telephone interview. Also, The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and The EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) scores were obtained to assess the clinical status of the patients.The mean follow-up was 2.8 years (range = 24-49 months) in the TKA group and 3.2 years (range = 24-50 months) in the UKA group. The FJS-12 was significantly higher in the UKA group (73.60 ± 9.95) than in the TKA group (64.88 ± 9.47) (P = .001).

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of the anatomy of the proximal humerus is an indispensible prerequisite to achieve good clinical results and long-term prosthesis stability. Modern, adjustable prostheses have greater flexibility of inclination, retrotorsion, as well as medial and dorsal offset, in comparison to older prostheses. Such improvements are expected to allow for more accurate reconstruction of the anatomical condition, such as targeted reconstruction of the primary and the secondary rotational centers. The reconstruction of the humeral rotational center was assessed in 48 second-generation prostheses. All reconstructions were compared by radiographic parameters with the preoperative state and the operated opposite side. The positions of the new rotational centers after arthroplasty were not close to those of pre-operative and healthy opposite side's radiographs. No characteristic change in the position of the humeral head, or of its rotational center was detected. Second-generation prostheses can only provide a limited reconstruction of the original anatomy in shoulder hemiarthroplasty. In contrast, the modern third- and fourth-generation modular prostheses with variable inclination are more potent in replicating the original shoulder anatomy with its primary and secondary rotational centers.",

Samples were divided into groups and debrided with high-pressure (80 psi) pulse lavage using a saline, rifampicin irrigation solution (50 mg/l), gentamicin irrigation solution (50 mg/l) and low- (50 mg/l) or high-concentration (500 mg/l) fusidic acid irrigation solution for 30 seconds from a distance of 10 cm. After irrigation, allografts were incubated in the culture and developed colonies were counted. Mean±standard deviation (min-max) values were calculated. The differences between the four irrigation groups were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis and groups were compared two at a time using the post-hoc Mann-Whitney U test.No colonization was detected with the exception of one allograft in the rifampicin irrigation group. The gentamicin irrigation group had similar results as the high-concentration fusidic acid irrigation group and both results were superior to those of the saline and low-concentration fusidic acid irrigation groups (p=0.010 and 0.004, respectively). The low- and high-concentration fusidic acid irrigation groups were similar and were not shown to have superior results than saline irrigation group.Rifampicin irrigation solution was the most effective in the decontamination of allografts previously contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus. Gentamicin, high-concentration fusidic acid, low-concentration fusidic and saline irrigation solutions may also be used respectively, according to their effectiveness.",

Calcium phosphate-coated Ti-6Al-4V anchors were used in the test group and non-coated Ti-6Al-4V anchors in the control group. A new approach was applied to synthesize the CaP coatings via the biomimetic growth in the Lac-SBF containing Ca(2+) and PO4(3-) ions, Na-lactate and lactic acid (HL). Titanium anchors were implanted into the right tibia, followed by biomechanical tensile strength tests. Histological studies were carried out after removal of anchors (bone-implant surface).The CaP-coated Ti-6Al-4V anchors had significantly higher tensile strength (p=0.003) and displacement values (p=0.004) than the non-coated anchors. Control group scores were higher than those of the test group (14 and 9, respectively) in tensile strength tests.The new CaP coating can be used in orthopedic surgery as catalyzer to improve bone ingrowth. We believe that our research will form a model for further research on biomimetic coatings on Ti-6Al-4V substrates.",

Traditionally, preferred treatment method for desmoid tumors is wide local excision. Depending on the side and type of resection, the reported local recurrence rates range from 15 to 77%. Similarly, in our institution there is a significant recurrence rate (24%) in patients who underwent surgery for desmoid tumor. After several recurrences, amputation may be inevitable following repeating vascular and nerve reconstructions. There is a need for a nonviable barrier in order to prevent the invasion of the viable tumor to the neurovascular structures which are also viable tissues. Depending on this need, we present two cases that we used synthetic vascular graft in their operations to cover neurovascular structures in order to prevent tumor invasion. For patients who are not suitable for radiotherapy and the neurovascular structures need to be secured because of the risk of local recurrence, this method can prevent possible future invasion of vessels and nerves.",

Patients from this group who met the following criteria were considered eligible for our study; presence of primary OS, had typical histological and radiographic features of OS, no prior history of cancer or any treatment elsewhere and no prior history of preexisting bone abnormalities.The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the entire group, with a 95% confidence interval, at two and five years showed the survival rates as 76.2% and 72.8% respectively. The surgical margin was a significant factor affecting the survival. Presence of a pathological fracture also had a significant effect on the survival rate.Osteogenic sarcoma remains a challenging disease to treat. Despite the expectation that elderly patients may not tolerate aggressive modern chemotherapy as the younger patients, we believe that patients with primary OS over the age of 40 should be treated aggressively with effective chemotherapy and complete surgical excision whenever possible.Level IV, therapeutic study.",

Anteroposterior weight-bearing knee radiographs of the patients with and without osteoarthritis (40 knees in each group) were obtained. The adductor ratio was determined using the following formula: ATJL/FW (adductor tubercle-joint line distance/femoral width). All radiographs were evaluated at the baseline and at one-month intervals afterwards. Intraobserver reliability of the two measurements was assessed using interclass correlations (ICC). Pearson's correlation test was used to evaluate the correlation between the ATJL and the FW. The differences between the adductor ratios of the two groups were evaluated by the independent samples two-tailed t-test.Most of the ICC values were well above 0.95, indicating a very high intraobserver reliability. The adductor ratio was significantly greater in Group 2 in comparison to Group 1 (Mean AR in Group 2: 0.522 ± 0.031 and Mean AR in Group 1: 0.502 ± 0.032; p = 0.005). There was a significant correlation between the ATJL and FW in the groups when assessed both separately and combined.In conclusion, we can assert that if the AR is used to determine the articular level in revision arthroplasty cases, it may be sensible to measure the FW intraoperatively rather than measuring it on primary or contralateral radiographs of arthritic patients.Level III, Diagnostic study.",

Both anchors were loaded with a USP Nr. 2 FiberWire® suture. An established cyclic testing protocol was performed. The maximum failure load (Fmax), the system displacement and the modes of failure were recorded.The Fmax and system displacement of the Sombrero® in osteopenic and healthy humeri was equivalent to the Bio-Corkscrew® benchmark anchor; there were no significant differences in the maximum failure loads and system displacement values. Only anchor and suture dislocations were observed; suture ruptures did not occur.This study shows that the Sombrero® yields similar maximum failure loads and system displacement values as the established Bio-Corkscrew® benchmark anchor. The primary stability of the Sombrero® and Bio-Corkscrew® seems to be independent of the bone mineral quality.

All rabbits underwent distal femoral medial condyle fresh massive osteochondral allograft transplantation from California rabbits. The group 1 underwent transplantation without any preliminary process. The group 2 underwent fractionated local radiotherapy of 100 cGy for five days starting on the transplantation day. The group 3 included the rabbits to which the grafts transplanted after radiating in vitro by a single dose radiation of 1500 cGy. The hosts were sacrificed twelve weeks later. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were taken. Synovial tissue, cartilaginous tissue, and subchondral bone were assessed histopathologically.Nonunion was present in three cases of group 2 and one of group 3 in which cartilage degeneration was more severe. Synovial hypertrophy and pannus formation were more obvious in non-radiated rabbits. Hypocellularity and necrosis of the subchondral bone were rare in group 2. More cartilage tissue impairment was present in group 3 compared to group 1.In osteochondral massive allograft transplantations, the immune reaction of the host could be precluded with radiotherapy, and the side-effects can be prevented by low-dose fractionated regimen. The total dose of fractionated radiotherapy for an immune suppression should be adjusted not to damage the cartilage tissue, but to avoid articular degeneration in the long term.",

Immobilization was achieved by casting from the crista iliaca anterior superior to the lower part of the foot for 2 weeks. The applied WBV protocol involved a frequency of 45 Hz and amplitude of 3 mm for 7 days starting a day after the end of the immobilization period. Serum type I collagen turnover markers were measured by using ELISA kits.Serum NH2-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP) levels were significantly lower in the immobilization groups (p < 0.02) compared with the control groups. Although WBV improved PINP levels in the control groups, there were no differences in PINP levels among the immobilization groups. Similarly, serum COOH-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) levels were higher in the WBV controls than their own controls (p < 0,05). Immobilization led to deterioration of tendon tissue, as observed by histopathological analysis with a transmission electron microscope.Although 1 week of WBV had a positive effect on type I collagen turnover in controls, it is not an efficient method for repairing tissue damage in the early stage following immobilization.",

Secondly, whether the use of a 450 left side bent Arthro-Pierce™ (Smith & Nephew, Andover, USA) during suture passage can be more effective on the strength of the configuration compared to a straight Arthro-Pierce™. Twenty-eight bovine infraspinatus muscle tendons were randomized into four groups. Group 1; 5 mm wide 'bite size' × 15 mm length 'distance from the tear edge's mattress'; Group 2: 7.5 mm × 10 mm; Group 3: 15 mm × 5 mm 'using straight Arthro-Pierce™' and Group 4: 5 mm × 15 mm using left sided 450 bent Arthro-Pierce™. The repair specimens underwent cyclic loading prior to loading the failure testing. Cyclic elongation (mm), peak-to-peak displacement (mm), ultimate load (N), stiffness (N/mm) and failure mode were recorded for each specimen. The mean ultimate load in Group 1 was higher compared to group 3. The peak to peak displacement was higher in Group 4 compared to Group 1 (p < 0.05). The predominant failure mode in Groups 1, 2 and 4 was suture rupture. The Group 3 most specimens failed due to suture cut through the tendon. Bite size from the edge of the tendon seems to be more important than the width of the mattress. The curve of the suture passing device may also have an effect on the strength of the suture tendon interface.",

Mean age of patients at time of surgery was 30.7 years (range: 15-53 years). Mean follow-up duration was 7.6 years (range: 5-9.2 years).During follow-up, 1 patient died because of leukemia, and 1 patient was lost. The remaining 26 hips of 19 patients were evaluated. According to Ficat classification, at time of surgery, 17 hips were grade II, and 9 hips were grade III, 3 hips underwent total hip arthroplasty. Postoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS) in grade II disease was excellent in 12 patients, good in 3 patients, and fair in 1 patient. In grade III disease, 1 patient was excellent, 5 patients were good, and 1 patient was fair. There was a significant increase in HHS scores from preoperatively to postoperatively (61±9.7 vs 84±17.8, p<0.001).FVFG yields extremely good results, particularly in pre-collapse stages of the disease in young patients. The operation time does not markedly increase if the surgical team is knowledgeable of the procedure and the residual fibular defect of the donor site does not impair functions of daily living.",

No neurologic or vascular complications were seen and the patient returned to his preinjury work and was pain-free in the second postoperative year. In order to determine the anatomic relationship of the iliolumbar screw with the major neurovascular structures, a cadaveric study was performed on the corpse of an adult man. Following dissection, it was observed that the iliolumbar screw inserted from the lateral wall of the iliac wing passed through the iliopsoas muscle and advanced to the L(5) vertebral corpus posterior to the fourth and fifth lumbar roots and with a reasonably distant course from the common iliac veins and arteries.",

    "abstract": "We present a 13-month-old boy who had a successful Computed Tomography (CT) guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment for the osteoid osteoma (OO) on proximal part of the tibial diaphysis. The complaints of the patient were being restless due to pain and refusing to bear any weight on his left leg for 6 months. An asymmetrical cortical thickening and a focal sclerosis was detected on medial proximal diaphysis of the left tibia on radiographs and axial T2-weighted STIR-MR image showed bone marrow and soft-tissue edema with low-signal-intensity nidus due to central calcification with a high-signal-intensified unmineralized periphery. CT findings (the nidus on the cortex of tibia with well circumscribed lucent region around a central sclerotic dot and cortical thickening around the nidus) confirmed the diagnosis of OO. After CT guided percutaneous RFA treatment, the patient had an immediate pain relief in 24 h after and could bear weight on the leg. 12 and 16 months after RFA respectively, CT images and radiographs revealed sclerotic healing of the nidus and a slow regression of the adjacent cortical thickness without any recurrence.",

Mean age was 30.03 ± 5.67 years in healthy subjects and 45.2% were of male gender. The patient group had mean age of 31.57 ± 7.37 years and 46.7% of the patients were male. Q angles were measured at standing, supine and sitting positions. Patellar and femoral tendon thicknesses and areas were measured ultrasonographically. Kujala questionnaire were used to evaluate the functional status of the participants.No significant difference was detected between groups regarding profession, educational background, and body mass indices (BMI) (p > 0.05). Q angle values were significantly higher in the patient group when compared to controls at standing (17.03 ± 3.84 vs. 13.87 ± 1.75°, p < 0.001), supine (16.20 ± 3.74 vs. 13.45 ± 1.79°, p = 0.001) and sitting (16.50 ± 3.28 vs. 13.71 ± 1.72°, p < 0.001) positions. Kujala score was significantly lower in the PFPS group when compared to controls (70.57 ± 8.37 vs. 98.58 ± 2.05, p < 0.001). Patellar (0.39 ± 0.08 vs. 0.32 ± 0.05 cm, p < 0.001) and quadriceps (0.64 ± 0.10 vs. 0.52 ± 0.09 cm, p < 0.001) tendon thicknesses were significantly higher in the PFPS group when compared to controls. There was no significant difference between groups regarding patellar tendon areas (p > 0.05). Patellar tendon thickness values of ≥0.35 cm were found to have 66.7% sensitivity and 67.7% specificity for PFPS diagnosis in the ROC curve analysis (area under curve: 0.771, 95% confidence interval: 0.655-0.887, p < 0.001). Quadriceps tendon thickness values of ≥0.54 cm were found to have 80% sensitivity and 71% specificity for PFPS diagnosis in the ROC curve analysis (area under curve: 0.824, 95% confidence interval: 0.710-0.939, p < 0.001). In PFPS patients, quadriceps tendon thickness had significant positive correlation with age (r = 0.405, p = 0.027) and BMI (r = 0.450, p = 0.013); and significant negative correlation with Kujala score (r = -0.441, p = 0.015). In the multivariate regression analysis, quadriceps tendon thickness was independently associated with the presence of PFPS (Exp (B): 3.089, 95% confidence interval: 1.344-7.100, p = 0.008).Our study demonstrates that ultrasonographically measured patellar and quadriceps tendon thicknesses are significantly higher in subjects with PFPS and particularly, quadriceps tendon thickness may be used for the diagnosis.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

All the patients underwent open reduction with posteromedial limited approach. The average follow-up time was 108 months for the male patients and 110 months for the female patients. The Tönnis grade, acetabular index, Kalamchi and MacEwen classification, and Severin classifications were determined for all patients. The Mc Kay classification system was used to evaluate the functional results.From the total, 25 (60%) male and 70 (85%) female patients had satisfactory radiographic outcomes (Severin Ia, Ib, or II) according to the Severin classification. There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of the Severin classification (P = 0.04). Residual acetabular dysplasia (RAD) was observed in 12 (15%) female and 17 (41%) male patients (P = 0.001). Grade 2 or higher osteonecrosis was observed in 7 (9%) patients in female and 6 (15%) patients in male group. The clinical outcomes in terms of the Mc Kay classification showed satisfactory outcomes in 72 (87%) female and 34 (82%) male patients. Further, 8 (9.7%) female patients and 6 (14.6%) male patients underwent a second operation. However, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of postoperative osteonecrosis presence (P = 0.982), functional outcomes (P = 0.571), and secondary operation rates (P = 0.298). Male sex was associated with poor outcomes in terms of the Severin classification (P = 0.04) and RAD (P = 0.001).Although our results indicated that male sex is a poor prognostic factor for radiological results and RAD, there was no difference between male and female patients in terms of osteonecrosis, redislocations, and functional outcomes.

Methods This retrospective study reviewed 122 patients (50 males, 72 females; mean age, 44.1 years) who underwent hip arthroscopy from September 2012 to March 2018. For all patients, CK was investigated preoperatively, on postoperative days 1 and 3, and at postoperative weeks 1 and 2. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed for parameters including sex, age, body mass index, preoperative glomerular filtration rate, diagnosis, duration of surgery, and duration of traction to determine the risk factors for CK > 10 upper limit of normal (CK > 10 ULN; 1900 IU/L for males and 1500 IU/L for females) after surgery. Results Mean CK was 104.7 ± 68.7 IU/L preoperatively and 839.2 ± 2214.0, 523.9 ± 1449.4, 186.0 ± 690.7, and 122.0 ± 307.1 IU/L on postoperative days 1 and 3 and at postoperative weeks 1 and 2, respectively. CK was significantly higher on postoperative days 1 and 3 than before surgery. In total, 11 patients (9.0%), including 8 males (16.0%) and 3 females (4.2%), had CK > 10 ULN. Younger age and longer duration of traction are independent risk factors for CK > 10 ULN. Conclusion After hip arthroscopy, CK levels should be monitored, especially in young patients and cases of prolonged duration of traction during surgery.

    "abstract": "Brodie's abscess of the calcaneus is an uncommon benign lesion that has rarely been reported in the literature. This study presents a rare case of a Brodie's abscess of the calcaneus caused by Staphylococcus aureus in an adult patient. A 46-year-old immunocompetent man had undergone nonsurgical treatment since childhood owing to the diagnosis of a heel spur. Radiological evaluation revealed a benign radiolucent cystic lesion of the calcaneus surrounded by a sclerotic rim. This condition was accompanied by perilesional bone marrow edema. Thereafter, surgical treatment was planned. During surgery, the content of the lesion was observed to be purulent. Meticulous intralesional debridement was performed, and antibiotic-loaded bone cement beads were placed. Subsequent to microbiological and pathological examinations, the cystic lesion was confirmed to be a Brodie abscess; however, direct clinical evidence of an intraosseous infection was lacking. The patient was followed up for 14 months with no complications until recovery. A Brodie abscess may mimic bone tumors. The onset of a Brodie abscess is insidious, and the clinical findings of such lesions may be obscure. A Brodie abscess of the calcaneus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with chronic heel pain when suspicious radiological findings are evident.",

All the participants had a moderate curve magnitude (Cobb angle: 20°-45°), with a primary thoracic curve. A 3-D electromagnetic tracking system (Ascension Technology Corporation, Shelburne, VT, USA) was used to record 3-D shoulder and thoracic kinematics. ADL movement tasks included touching the mouth/drinking, touching the back, touching the contralateral shoulder, reaching upward, and bilateral 4-kg weight lifting. Two separate strips of elastic tape were applied using the same correction technique for each shoulder and scapular region to control scapular alterations in the resting position.Elastic scapular taping significantly improved scapular external rotation and scapular upward rotation. Similarly, humeral horizontal adduction, external rotation, thoracic flexion, and lateral bending significantly increased in the taped condition depending on the specific task (p<0.05).Elastic scapular taping can change scapular orientations on the convex and concave sides, thereby affecting upper extremity and trunk kinematics. Thus, the dynamic stability of the scapula increases to produce larger movements during functional activities.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

The rats were randomly divided into three groups (10 in each), including one control (group 1) and two experimental groups (group 2, conventional microsuture repair; group 3, cyanoacrylate repair). In each group, the sciatic nerve was identified and transected. No further intervention was performed in group 1. The nerve was repaired using the epineural technique with a 10/0 atraumatic nylon in group 2 and synthetic cyanoacrylate adhesive in group 3. At the fifth postoperative week, needle electromyography (EMG) was performed to measure distal latency, combined muscle action potential (CMAP), and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV). Following the EMG recordings, animals were euthanized. Nerve samples were collected to evaluate vacuolar degeneration, fibrosis, and foreign body reaction histopathologically.In the EMG analysis, mean distal latency was significantly shorter in group 1 (0.85±0.09 ms) than in groups 2 (1.17±0.25 ms) (p=0.0052) and 3 (1.14±0.14 ms) (p=0.0026) while no significant differences existed between groups 2 and 3 (p>0.9999). The mean CMAP was greater in group 1 (10.5±0.35 mV) than in groups 2 (2.86±1.28 mV) (p=0.011) and 3 (2.16±1.34 mV) (p=0.0002), but there was no significant difference between groups 2 and 3 (p>0.9999). The mean MNCV was 53.5±5.95, 39.62±7.31, and 39.84±4.73 mm/sec in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There was a significant difference between groups 1 and 2 (p=0.0052) and between 1 and 3 (p=0.0026), but not between 2 and 3 (p>0.9999). In the histopathological evaluation, the mean vacuolar degeneration score was 0, 2.12, and 1.88 in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. No obvious difference was observed between groups 2 and 3 (p=0.743). The mean fibrosis score was 0, 1.62, and 1.77 in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

A senior surgeon performed all the surgical procedures. SPLATT was performed as part of a single-event multilevel surgery for the lower limb, and the concomitant procedures on the same extremity were recorded. The patients who required any additional foot or ankle surgery that could affect the clinical outcome (except heel cord lengthening) were excluded from the study. The Kling's College Criteria were used to evaluate the procedural outcome of the foot position and gait, and the associated complications were recorded.The mean follow-up time was 28.8±5 months (range: 24-42 months). The postoperative Kling scores were excellent for 27 feet of the patients who had a plantigrade foot, without fixed or postural deformity, in a regular shoe, having no calluses; good for 5 cases for those who walked with less than 5° varus, valgus, or equinus posture of the hind foot, wearing regular shoes, having no callosities; and fair for 1 case for those who had recurrence of the deformity. There was only one wound detachment, which was treated with wound care and dressing. None of the patients had overcorrection, infection, or bone fracture.The dynamic SPLATT to PT surgery for the management of the equinovarus foot deformities in the CP patients is a safe and less complicated surgical alternative with a good functional outcome. It is a safe and effective treatment method for the management of equinovarus foot deformities in CP.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

The D-dimer concentration was also high, which raised the suspicion of pulmonary artery embolism. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed right inferior lobar pulmonary artery embolism and FES. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TEE) was performed, which showed a PFO. The presence of a PFO in patients with pulmonary embolism increases the risk of systemic embolism. Therefore, we recommend the routine echocardiogram for patients with pulmonary embolism to exclude any cardiac defect in causing right-to-left shunts, which predisposes the patient to paradoxical embolism.",

We surveyed all the enrolled patients to describe recurrence rates and reproducibility for both the techniques without supervision as well as the number of emergency visits.In total, 52 patients (age range: 18-44 years) answered the survey from the 60 patients enrolled in the study. The total rate of recurrence was 38.5% (20 patients). For the Sp group, 4 of the 30 patients were lost. There were 9 recurrent patients (30%), and 7 were treated in the emergency department (ED). For the BHM group, 4 of the 30 patients were lost. There were 11 recurrent patients (37%), and 2 were treated in the ED. The difference in self-reduction rates and ED visits for both the groups was statistically significant (p=0.025).Teaching the BHM technique to the patients is effective and reproducible without direct supervision. It can decrease the number of visits to the ED and is a valid option to teach the patients at risk of recurrence when not being able to get immediate help.Level I, Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "Objective This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) for reducing perioperative blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusions in revision hip arthroplasty. Methods TXA was routinely administered as an intravenous preoperative dose in all the revision hip arthroplasty cases in our institution from December 2012. We retrospectively reviewed 803 patients who underwent revision hip arthroplasty from January 2008 to September 2018. These patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether they received intravenous TXA (n=482; 231 men and 251 women; mean age: 63.27±11.73 years) or not (n=321; 159 men and 162 women; mean age: 63.91±11.69 years). The 2 groups were compared in terms of estimated intraoperative blood loss, visible blood loss, hidden blood loss, the rate and volume of allogeneic blood transfusions, and the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The patients were also compared depending on whether they underwent total hip revision, isolated acetabular revision, or isolated femoral revision. Results Regardless of the type of revision involved, the patients who received TXA showed significantly lower estimated intraoperative blood loss, visible blood loss, hidden blood loss, and allogeneic blood transfusion rate and volume (all p values were less than 0.001). Use of TXA was not associated with significant changes in the incidence of postoperative symptomatic venous thromboembolism (p=0.911). Similar results were obtained with subgroups of patients who underwent different types of revision surgeries, except hidden blood loss (p=0.994) of patients in the isolated femoral revision subgroup. Conclusion The administration of intravenous TXA can safely and effectively reduce the perioperative blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusions in revision hip arthroplasty.

A total of 28 patients (11 men and 17 women; mean age: 74.95±7.06 years) were operated on using the SuperPATH approach (group 1), and the remaining 30 patients (12 men and 18 women; mean age: 75.63±7.89 years) were operated on using the conventional posterior approach (group 2). To summarize the early functional results of the SuperPATH approach, we retrospectively analyzed the following demographics, perioperative factors, and measures of joint function: age, sex, preoperative diagnosis, preoperative visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, body mass index, the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, operation time (skin-to-skin), intraoperative bleeding, incision length, postoperative VAS, Harris Hip Score (HHS), Barthel Index (BI), length of hospital stay, positioning of the implants, and postoperative complications.All 58 operations were successfully completed, and the average follow-up time was 45 (45.03±2.44) months. The patients in group 1 had shorter incision length (8.84±0.59 versus 13.26±2.41 cm) and length of stay (7.86±0.51 versus 10.80±1.93 days), lower postoperative VAS score (2.43±0.69 versus 3.13±0.94), and better postoperative HHS (88.37±4.31 versus 83.81±6.00) and BI (91.47±5.27 versus 83.59±6.83) at 3 months than the patients in group 2; however, group 1 patients had longer operation time (113.95±25.36 versus 87.22±25.43 min) than group 2 patients (all P<0.05). No significant intergroup differences were found with respect to intraoperative bleeding, cup abduction angle, anteversion angle, and stem positioning. During the follow-up, no deep venous thrombosis, postoperative infection, and hip dislocation were observed in any patient.Compared with the conventional posterior approach, the SuperPATH approach provided better early functional results with less postoperative pain and shorter hospitalization time.

Methods From June 2012 to June 2015, 16 consecutive patients (10 males and 6 females, mean age: 38 (range: 19-57) years) presented with isolated tibial avulsion injuries of the PCL. We used a 3.5-mm LCHP and lag screws for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) through the posterior medial approach. The operation time, quantity of bleeding, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, stability of posterior drawer test (PDT) results, and fracture healing time were studied to assess clinical efficacy. At the 12-month follow-up, a functional evaluation using knee range of motion (ROM) and the Lysholm knee scoring system (LKSS) was performed. Results The data from a mean follow-up of 24.1 (range: 14-33) months from 16 patients were recorded. No neurovascular complications, incision infections, or delayed union or nonunion were observed. The mean operation time was 61.4 (range: 45-80) min. The mean quantity of bleeding was 41.6 (range: 25-66) mL. The mean bone healing time was 11.8 (range: 45-80) weeks. The mean VAS score was 1.63 (range: 0-3) after surgery. The average LKSS and ROM of the knee were 51.75±7.67 and 50.94°±10.19° before surgery and 92.75±5.46 and 127.75°±6.13° at 1 year, respectively. The outcomes were judged to be excellent for 11 patients, good for 4, and fair for 1 (excellent and good rates: 93.8% for 15/16). At the final follow-up (≥1 year), the PDT scores returned to normal. Conclusion The results showed that 3.5-mm LCHP provided reliable fixation following ORIF of isolated PCL tibial avulsion fractures and was a safe, simple, and effective procedure.

This study evaluated the antinociceptive and paralytic effects of BTX-A on an experimental supraspinatus repair rat model and its effect on functional outcomes (running performance). Thirty rats were grouped into the surgical repair group (group A), repair + intramuscular BTX-A group (group B), or control group (group C). At the end of the 3-month follow-up, running performance of the rats on a motorized treadmill was evaluated in four time periods (0-30 min, 30-60 min, 60-90 min, and 90-110 min), and penalty points (i.e., number of shock stimuli per lane) were recorded. Afterwards, the supraspinatus muscles were removed and evaluated histologically. Regarding running performance, group B received significantly fewer penalty points than did group A (p<0.05). The penalty points received were not significantly different between groups B and C in the first three time periods, but were significantly higher in group B at the 90-110-min interval than in group C. On necropsy, all repaired tendons were intact, with no sign of failure at the repair site. Histological evaluation revealed marked degeneration and necrosis of muscles in both repair groups, which was much less evident in group B. Groups A and B had less fatty infiltration than group C. BTX-A injections resulted in a better function based on running performance, probably due to decreased tissue tension at the repair site and less pain. Further studies on humans are needed to demonstrate this effect clinically.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of high intensity zone (HIZ) and to assess discrepancy in the interpretation, as well as investigate the effects of parameters of HIZ on interobserver variation. Four spine surgeons made independent observations on lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 207 consecutive patients from 3 institutions. The κ statistic was used to characterize inter- and intraobserver reliability for visual assessments of HIZ. The corresponding MRI was provided to 2 additional spine surgeons for quantitative measurements. The parameters of HIZ, including signal intensity (SI) and area ratio (HIZ%), were used to assess the interobserver variation of HIZ. The overall interobserver agreement for visual assessments was substantial (κ=0.62 at L4-5 and 0.61 at L5-S1), and intraobserver agreement was excellent (κ=0.84 at L4-5 and 0.86 at L5-S1). Of 93 observed HIZ, 17 instances (18.3%) were agreed upon by all visual observers. The SI with full agreement was significantly brighter than all the others (p<0.01). The HIZ% with 2 agreements was significantly smaller than those with 4 agreements (p=0.04) and 3 agreements (p=0.03). Although fewer observers with consensus were associated with smaller HIZ%, the difference was not significant (p>0.05). The reliability in the interpretation of HIZ was sufficient for spine surgeons with differing levels of experience. This study highlighted that signal intensity was the primary cause of variability in visual observation.",

An intraperitoneal injection of H2 was given to the IRH group, while an equivalent amount of air was given to the sham and I/R groups. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after reperfusion, serum MDA level as well as skeletal muscle iNOS and eNOS mRNA expression levels were determined.Both iNOS mRNA expression and serum MDA levels were higher in the I/R group than the sham group (p<0.01) and lower in the IRH group than the I/R group (p<0.01, p<0.05, respectively) at various time points after reperfusion. The eNOS mRNA expression level exhibited no significant difference between the I/R and sham groups after reperfusion but was significantly higher in the IRH group than in the sham group (p<0.01, p<0.05, respectively).During the I/R process, the expression of iNOS mRNA was up-regulated along with an increase in MDA. Intraperitoneal injection of H2 can down-regulate iNOS mRNA expression and up-regulate eNOS mRNA expression in the I/R process, suggesting a protective effect of H2 in I/R-induced skeletal muscle injury.",

Three-dimensional computed tomography of the knee joint was taken in the 2nd and 3rd postoperative month. The three-dimensional computed tomography and isokinetic muscle strength tests were repeated at the 6th month follow-up. Each tunnel was divided into six equal parts, and the tunnel width in the sagittal and coronal planes was measured and the same points in the axial plane were measured in the tunnel area.No significant difference was found between the single- and dual-bundle reconstructions in isokinetic muscle strength values. No statistically significant difference was detected between the tunnel expansions in 2nd, 3rd and 6th month tomographies following single- and dual-bundle ACL reconstruction.Single- and dual-bundle ACL reconstructions seem to provide similar results in terms of early tunnel enlargement and isokinetic muscle strength.",

The knee pain group (n=52; mean age: 42.6±4.1 years; mean height: 1.56±5.11 m; mean weight: 75.2±14.1 kg) included patients with mild to moderate knee pain scores.

Body composition was assessed using the TANITA Body Composition Analyzer. Concentric maximal torque of the knee flexor and extensor muscles was recorded using an Isomed 2000 isokinetic dynamometer at 180 deg/s. Coordination and proprioception were assessed using the Functional Squat System.There was no significant difference in terms of physical characteristics, body composition parameters and coordination results between groups (p>0.05). Peak torque of flexion (0.65±0.21 N/kg) and extension (0.88±0.23 N/kg) of the affected side in the knee pain group were significantly lower than the without knee pain group dominant side flexion (0.74±0.19 N/kg) and extension (0.98±0.19 N/kg) (p<0.05).

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate health-related quality of life in veterans with hip disarticulation suffered during the Iran-Iraq War. All war-related injured with hip disarticulation were invited to a 7-day recreational camp. Of 183 subjects, 76 participated in this study. The impact of hip disarticulation on quality of life was measured using the 36-item short form health survey and compared with the scores of the general public. Mean age at the time of interview was 44.1±6.98 years. The lowest score of health-related quality of life subscales was bodily pain (32.88±33.20). The health-related quality of life in veterans with hip disarticulation was significantly lower than the general public in all subscales (p<0.05), with the exception of vitality (p=0.114). Veterans with hip disarticulation due to war suffer from poor health-related quality of life. Appropriate interventions and rehabilitation programs are recommended to enhance quality of life in such patients.",

In the other 19 hips, the femoral component angle was greater than 5 degrees valgus position. The mean inclination angle of the acetabular component was 46.1 ± 7 degrees. In 22 hips, the mean inclination angle of the acetabular components was 45 degrees or less. There was no significant difference in the clinical outcomes between patients with femoral component angles of greater than 5 degrees valgus position and those with angles of less than 5 degrees valgus position (p>0.05). There was also no significant difference between the clinical results of patients with an acetabular inclination of 45 degrees or less and those with an acetabular inclination exceeding 45 degrees (p>0.05).The orientation of femoral and acetabular components in the coronal plane does not appear to have an effect on clinical outcomes in resurfacing hip arthroplasty.",

    "abstract": "The use of intralaminar screws (ILS) in spinal surgery has experienced a recent increase in popularity. The aim of this study is to define the morphological parameters of the lumbar laminas so that guidance may be defined for ILS placement. The study involved the evaluation of lumbar computed tomography (CT) images of patients. Two hundred thirty-five patients (127 male, 108 female) were included in the study. The mean patient age was 44.2 years (19-78 years). The measured parameters of the lamina were the transverse inner diameter, transverse outer diameter (lamina width), lamina length, subdural space (safe zone), and spinolaminar angle for each lumbar level (L1-L5). The mean transverse outer diameter (L1-L5) ranged from 7.2-7.8 mm, and mean transverse inner diameter ranged from 2.5-3.0 mm. The lamina of L3 had the largest width and the lamina of L1 and L5 the smallest. The mean lamina length was 26.6 mm, ranging from 21.0-34.0 mm, and the mean spinolaminar angle was 124.7°, ranging from 111-135°. The L1 level had the shortest mean lamina length and L4 the lowest spinolaminar angle. Mean subdural space (safe zone), which was narrowest at the L5 level, was 2.4 mm, ranging from 1.3-3.6 mm. ILS of the appropriate size (3.5-4.5 mm) and length (20 and 25 mm) can be used safely in the lumbar spine. However, further biomechanical studies should be performed to measure strength of the fixation.",

Grafts were used in all revisions. The patients were evaluated retrospectively. The bone defects were classified according to the classification of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS). Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used for clinical evaluation. Radiolucent lines, implant sizes, osseointegration, and heterotopic ossification in the 3 regions defined by DeLee and Charnley were evaluated radiologically.The success rate of ARR revisions after an average follow-up of 8.93±4.10 years (range: 4-23 years) was 87.9%, and the cumulative survival rate at year 10 postoperatively was 91%. Average HHS score increased to 83.70±8.98 postoperatively, from 40.10±2.49 preoperatively (p<0.01). The success rate of BSAPC revisions after an average follow-up of 7.06±2.39 years (range: 4-12 years) was 83.3%, and the cumulative survival rate was 78%. Average HHS score increased from 42.55 preoperatively to 73.86 postoperatively (p<0.01). All failures of ARR revisions occurred in type 3 defects (p<0.05). In 40 of the 47 patients in which an allograft was used, osseointegration occurred. No statistically significant difference was found between the increase in HHS scores of patients who underwent femoral component revision with acetabular revision and those who did not (p=0.06). Patients who underwent more than 1 revision had statistically significantly higher failure rates in comparison to patients undergoing revision for the first time (p=0.008).The mid-term and long-term results of the use of ARR and BSAPC with allografts in bone deficient acetabular revisions are satisfactory. The implants facilitate graft osseointegration, increase the bone stock, and make future revisions easier. ARR should be preferred in type 1 and type 2 acetabular bone defects, while BSAPC should be preferred in type 3 and 4 defects.",

Retrospective analysis of 15 patients (10 men, 5 women; mean age, 49.1 years; mean follow-up 49 months) with 6 anterior and 9 posterior fracture-dislocations of the proximal ulna. The proximal ulna was reconstructed with plates and screws in 13 patients and tension-band wiring in 2 patients. At the final follow-up, elbow range of motion (ROM) was measured and Mayo elbow scores (MEPS) were recorded. Broberg-Morrey criteria were used for osteoarthritis staging. Concomitant radial-head fracture was seen in all posterior fracture-dislocations. Four ligamentous injuries occurred in this group. All anterior dislocations had trochlear-notch fractures without associated injuries. Mean flexion ROM was 130.6° (100°-140°) and mean loss of extension ROM was 12.6° (0°-30°) in the study group. The mean MEPS score was 92.3 (70-100). Patients with posterior fracture-dislocations showed lower ROM and MEPS and higher level of osteoarthritis than patients with anterior fracture-dislocations. Recurrent dislocations occurred in 2 patients who had ulna fractures fixed with tension-band wiring. Radial-head fracture and ligamentous injury are specific components of posterior fracture-dislocations. The injury is limited to the trochlear notch in anterior fracture-dislocations. Posterior fracture-dislocations have lower functional outcomes. Proximal-ulna fractures should be fixed with rigid internal fixation (plate and screw) even if the fracture is a simple 2-part fracture.",

Between January 2007 and January 2014, 223 patients were identified from the department's surgical database with retrospective chart and radiographic review. Sixty-eight patients were over 60 years of age. All fractures were operated with Acu-Loc® (Acumed, Hillsboro, OR, USA) wrist volar locking plating systems. Longitudinal fracture lines (LFL) beneath volar plate-extending proximal shafts were documented. Correlations between age groups and LFLs were investigated. Radiographs with LFLs were assessed at final follow-up for the following parameters: volar tilt, radial inclination and radial length. Twenty-eight of 68 patients over age of 60 years had LFLs. Correlation was significant for age groups (p<0.05). The effect of these fracture lines on radiographic parameters was not significant (p>0.05). Surgeons should be aware of the complications that may occur with volar locking plates. Understanding of potential complications and their results are important. As a result of aging, thinning, and weakening, the near cortex may become more brittle. When the plate is reduced on the bone with a nonlocking screw, the conical head of diaphyseal locking screws can extend over plate thickness and penetrate the near cortex, acting as a screwing wedge. Additional divergent configuration may promote this effect and crack the cortex.",

Thirty-three patients (21 male, 12 female) who had displaced fractures and at least 2-cm shortening fixed with expandable flexible locked intramedullary nailing and 38 patients (24 male, 14 female) who underwent anatomical locking plating were recruited. Duration of surgery, incision size, duration of hospital stay, union time, and early and late complications were compared between the groups. Functional results were compared with Constant scoring system. Mean duration of surgery was 32.4±9.1 minutes (range: 20-42 minutes) in the nailing group and 54.1±11.9 minutes (range: 42-70 minutes) in the plating group. The incision was 4.1±0.9 cm (range: 3-5 cm) in the nailing group and 9.5±1.7 cm (range: 7-12 cm) in the plating group. Mean union time was 14.8 weeks (range: 10-24 weeks) in the nailing group and 21.3 weeks (range: 12-33 weeks) in the plating group. Mean duration of hospital stay was 3.6±1.1 days (range: 2-4 days) in the plating group, whereas it was 2.3±0.8 days (range: 1-3 days) in the nailing group. In the plating group, an average of 2.7-mm (range: 0-7 mm) shortening was determined in the clavicles that underwent surgery as compared to the intact clavicles, whereas shortening was 2.3 mm (range: 0-6 mm) in the nailing group. Expandable flexible locked intramedullary nailing can provide more successful outcomes than plating in displaced clavicular midshaft fractures, due to advantages such as shorter union time, lower complication rate, and better cosmetic outcomes.",

Rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 10 per group): control-1, control-2, sham-1, sham-2, experiment-1, and experiment-2. The same surgical procedure was performed in all rats; a full thickness Achilles tenotomy was performed, and the tendon was repaired using a modified Kessler suture. Enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) was orally given to the Experiment-1 and Experiment-2 groups for three and six weeks, respectively. Thirty rats were sacrificed at three weeks (Control-1, Sham-1, Experiment-1); the remaining 30 rats were sacrificed at six weeks (Control-2, Sham-2, Experiment-2). Then, macroscopic, biomechanical, and histologic investigations were performed.Adhesion degree was found macroscopically lower in the Experiment-1 and 2 groups than others. In the histologic examination, the fibrosis level was found the lowest in the Experiment-2 group. Biomechanical evaluation indicated that mean maximum resistance before tendon rupture was significantly higher in the Experiment-2 group than in other groups.Evidence from this study has shown that ACEIs can decrease fibrosis and tendon adhesion during tendon recovery in rats due to their antifibrotic effects as the result of Angiotensin-II suppression.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyse the factors that led to resignations from Orthopaedics and Traumatology Residency pro- grammes in Turkey, and to determine the overall rate of resignation among residents from Orthopaedics and Traumatology programmes.In this cross-sectional survey,120 residents who either resigned or transferred to other OT clinics between autumn of 2013 and spring of 2020 were included. They were asked to complete a questionnare which was sent via Whatssapp application or e-mail. The ques- tionnare was comprised of 2 sections; Section A, which adressed resignation, consisted of 15 questions and Section B, which adressed transfer to another OT programme, consisted of 12 questions. Both sections had open ended and multiple choice questions.Of 120 residents, 96 (6.6%) resigned and then transferred to another specialty, and 24 (1.6%) transferred to another orthopedics and traumatology clinic based on our review. The overall resignation rate as per the total quotas for orthopedics and traumatology residency from 2013 to 2020 was 8.2%. Of the 120 orthopedics and traumatology residents who were eligible for the survey, 83 (70%) completed the questionnaire. Sixty-one (60 males, 1 female; median age = 26 years; age range = 25-35) of 96 residents who resigned from the orthopedics and traumatology residency completed section A (the response rate was 63.5%); 22 (22 males; median age=27.6 years; age range=25-34) out of 24 residents who transferred to another orthopedics and traumatology clinic completed section B (the response rate was 91.6%). In section A, 40 out of 61 individuals (65.5%) preferred orthopedics and traumatology specialty as the first choice in TUS, and 34 residents (55.7%) reported not to have had enough information regarding the residency program before starting their clinics. In section B, out of the 22 residents, 13 (59%) stated that orthopedics and traumatology residency was not their first choice in TUS, and 18 (81.8%) reported not to have had sufficient knowledge about the preferred clinic. The most common reason for resignation or transfer to another specialty was heavy workload (n=46, 74.19%), followed by excessive hours of work (n=45, 72.58%). The most common reason for transfer to another orthopedics and traumatology clinic was drudgery (n=10, 45.5%), followed by problems with the hierarchy in orthopedics and traumatology residency (n = 9, 40.9%).The results of this survey have shown us, with an overall resignation rate of 8.2% as per the total quotas for OT residency from 2013 to 2020, that resignation from OT residency represents an important problem in Turkey. Workload and excessive hours of work were the most common reasons for resignation from orthopaedic residency programmes. Furthermore, extra work that diverted residents from their actual job responsibilities, as well as academic and educational concerns, were the main factors leading to transfer to another OT residency programme.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate whether endostatin, a crucial anti-angiogenic factor, plays a negative role in angiogenesis and osteogenesis and aggravates the progression of osteonecrosis of the femoral head induced by steroid use in a rabbit model.66 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: glucocorticoid model (GC) group (GC group, n = 18), glucocorticoid model and endostatin group (GC;ES group, n = 18), ES group (ES group, n = 18), and blank control group (CON group, n = 12). In the GC group, 10 μg/ kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was intravenously injected into the ear margin, and 24h after LPS injection, 20 mg/kg GC methylprednisolone (MPS) was injected into the gluteus muscle three times, each time at an interval of 24h. The animals of the GC;ES group were given as same treatment as the GC group, except for the addition of ES. MPS was not used in the ES group and CON group. ES group was only given ES, while the CON group was only given the same amount of normal saline. All animals successfully established models of femoral head necrosis, and then the difference among the Immunohistochemistry, Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Biomechanical test, etracyclline-calcein double labeling, and Van Gieson staining indices were compared among the four groups.The combination of MPS and LPS was successful in establishing the femoral head necrosis model in New Zealand white rabbits. The incidence of osteonecrosis after MPS and LPS intervention was 70% (7/10), while that plus ES was 100% (10/10). At the same time, after MPS and LPS intervention, while the empty bone lacuna rate of the femoral head was significantly increased, the number of osteo- blasts was decreased. Also, the expressions of CD31 positive cells, Runx2, Osterix, COL1A1, and VEGF mRNA in the femoral head were decreased, and the levels of osteogenesis-related protein b-ALP, OCN, and angiogenic factor VEGF in the femoral head were decreased. The percentage of the trabecular bone area (%Tb.Ar), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), labeled perimeter percent (%L.Pm), mineral apposition rate (MAR), and bone formation rate (BFR/BS) in the femoral head after MPs and LPS intervention detected by tetracycline calcein double labeling and Van Gieson staining decreased significantly, except trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) increased significantly. The compressive strength (CS), elastic modulus (EM), and strain energy (SE) of the femoral head examed by biomechanical measurement decreased significantly. All the above changes were more obvious after adding ES intervention. ES mRNA in the femoral head was undifferentiated and increased in the GC, ES, and GC;ES group compared with group CON.This study has revealed that ES can inhibit angiogenesis and osteogenesis in the femoral head and aggravate the occurrence and development of femoral head necrosis. Thus, antiangiogenic factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ONFH.",

One set of tissue samples was taken from each patient in the patient group intraoperatively and two sets of samples were taken from each cadaver in the cadaver group posthumosly from the ligamentum flavum (medial and lateral) and from the facet joint capsules (superior and inferior articular process) at the L4/5 segment. Western blot analysis was performed for collagen types I, II, III and for elastin. Disc degeneration was scored according to the Pfirmann Classification, facet joint arthrosis was scored according to the Fujiwara Classification and their relationship with protein expression was investigated.There was a strong expression of Collagen type I in the patient group (PG) compared to the body donor group (BDG) in the facet joint capsule (FJC) and in the lateral samples of the ligamentum flavum. Samples of the FJC showed lower expression of elastin in the PG compared with the BDG, but without statistical significance. An increased expression of collagen type I compared to elastin in the PG could be shown. In contrast, elastin predominated in the samples of the BDG group compared to collagen type I (collagen type I/ elastin PG: PAsup 2,78; PAinf 2,61; LFmed 2,23; 225 LFlat 1,83; BDG: PAsup 0,15; PAinf 0,2; LFmed 0,2; LFlat 0,27). Rank correlation coefficient according to Spearman showed low to moderate correlations for collagen type I, III and elastin for the degree of disc degeneration accord- ing to Pfirrmann and the degree of facet joint osteoarthritis according to Fujiwara, all of them without statistical significance.This study has shown us that in the context of degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, there is an increased expression of collagen type I and a dominance over elastin.Level III, Diagnostic Study.",

The patients were divided into 2 groups accord ing to the grade of osteoarthritis: group 1, including 52 patients (32 females and 20 males) with Kellgren-Lawrence grades 1 and 2, and group 2, including 36 patients (24 females and 12 males) with Kellgren-Lawrence grades 3 and 4. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Harris hip score, visual analog scale, EuroQoL general health questionnaire, and the Barthel index.The mean age was 74.8 ± 5.5 (range=63-87) years in group 1 and 75.06 ± 5.3 (range=64-87) years in group 2. At the last follow-up, the mean Harris hip score was significantly higher in group 1 (71.3 ± 4.3) than that of group 2 (69.5 ± 3.5) (P=.047). There was no signifi cant difference between the groups in terms of the visual analog scale (P=.102), EuroQoL general health questionnaire (P=.144), and the Barthel index (P=.261) scores. The EuroQoL general health questionnaire and Barthel index scores were worse with increasing age.As the grade of hip osteoarthritis increases, it may adversely affect the specific hip score, but this parameter alone may not be a poor prognostic factor that affects the quality of life and daily activity level.Level III, Prognostic Study.",

This study retrospectively analysed the clinical and radiographic data of 8 patients diagnosed with upper thoracic tuberculosis. All patients underwent posterior approach debridement, interbody fusion, and internal fixation. We conducted pre- and postoperative assessments of the visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), ASIA score, and kyphotic Cobb angle. Back pain and lower limb weakness were the most common presenting symptoms. The mean duration of surgery, amount of blood loss, and volume of postoperative drainage were 262.5 ± 43.3 min, 625.0 ± 333.8 mL, and 285.0 ± 118.1 mL, respectively. Patients were followed up for 36 to 48 months. Three months after surgery, there was a significant improvement in VAS and ODI scores, which further improved until the final follow-up. A statistically significant difference was observed between the preoperative and postoperative periods (P < .05). At the final follow-up, lower extremity function had fully returned to normal in all 5 paralyzed patients. The ESR and CRP returned to normal, 18.1 ± 7.3 mm/h and 9.95 ± 5.41 mg/L, respectively, within 3 months postoperatively. There were statistical differences between the preoperative and postoperative periods (P < .05). The average kyphotic correction rate was (71.5 ± 7.3)%, and the average loss of correction angle was (3.5 ± 1.4)°. Intervertebral bone fusion was achieved by all patients within 15 months (mean 8.3 ± 3.2 months) postoperatively.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the novel Estaş Medical Anodization (EMA) surface treatment technique with the techniques commonly used in the literature and to examine their effects on osteointegration in the rabbit tibia. A total of 24 rabbits used in this study were divided into 3 groups, with 8 rabbits in each group. Using both tibias of all rabbits in the study, screws belonging to the control group were placed in the left tibia, and the right tibia belonging to the experimental group were placed. In the first 8 rabbits, a single experimental group in the right tibia were used; in the second 8 rabbits, 2 different experimental groups in the right tibia were used; and in the last 8 rabbits, 2 different experimental groups in the right tibia were used. Thus, 5 different experimental groups with 8 screws in each group and a separate control group were formed for each of them. EMA-treated surfaces were named 200-800 nm iris oxidation and 800-1200 nm gray oxidation according to the TiO2 layer thickness. Group 1 was implanted with mini-screws prepared with chemical etching+EMA iris oxidation, while group 2 was implanted with sandblasted, large-grit and acid-etched (SLA) mini screws treated with EMA gray oxidation. Group 3 was implanted with mini-screws treated with EMA gray oxidation, group 4 was implanted with mini-screws treated with chemical etching+micro-arc oxidation, and group 5 was implanted with mini-screws treated with chemical etching+EMA gray oxidation. The control group was implanted with mini-screws prepared with pure titanium. At the end of 6 weeks, osseointegration percentages were calculated and compared using histological and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses. The histological results confirmed the increase in osseointegration percentages in all experimental groups compared to those that received pure titanium implants (P values control group vs group 1=.005, control group vs group 2, 3, 4, 5=.001). The comparison between the groups revealed that the chemical etching+EMA gray oxidation modification technique (group 5) significantly increased osseointegration compared to the SLA+EMA gray oxidation technique (group 5 vs group 2 P=.016) and the chemical etching+EMA iris oxidation technique (group 5 vs group 1 Pp=.001). The EMA gray oxidation technique (group 3) significantly increased osseointegration compared to the chemical etching+EMA iris oxidation technique (group 1) (group 3 vs group 1 P=.043). The results of the SEM analysis showed that osseointegration was significantly increased in all experimental groups compared to that in the pure titanium (control) group (P values control group vs group 1, 2, 3=.001, control group vs Group 4,5=.006). The mean osseointegration percentage in the experimental groups was the highest in group 5, followed by group 4, group 3 and group 1 equally, and group 2. However, the differences among the experimental were not significant (group 1, group 2, group 3, group 4 vs group 5 P=.408). The EMA titanium surface modification techniques we developed significantly increased osseointegration compared to the pure titanium surface. The EMA gray oxidation technique seems to result in higher osseointegration rates than the EMA iris oxidation technique, and similar rates can be found with the SLA and chemical etching techniques.

Sixty patients (23 male, 37 female) who underwent surgical treatment for pelvic ring injuries after the earthquake were analyzed in this study. Demographic data, such as age and gender, operations, and fracture details were recorded. Laboratory results and the amount of blood used were included in the analysis. Fractures were classified according to the Young-Burgess classification. Surgical treatment methods, side of injury, accompanying injuries, and treatment results were analyzed using SPSS software. Left-sided trauma was the most common mechanism of injury, with 36 patients (60%) sustaining left-sided pelvic fractures. Pelvic ring fractures were detected in 78.3% of patients, and combined acetabulum and pelvic ring fractures were identified in 21.7% of patients. Thoracic trauma and extra-pelvic fractures were seen in 12 (20%) and 18 (30%) patients, respectively. Twenty percent of patients underwent emergency abdominal surgery prior to pelvic surgery. Complications were observed in 7 patients (11.6%) in the early period. The average amount of blood used for patients was 2.91 U (min: 0, max: 13 U, SD: 2.66). This study has shown us that lateral compression injuries are more common, and that low hemoglobin levels, high inflammation parameters, previous abdominal surgery, accompanying fractures, and lung injury are the main characteristics of patients with earthquake-related pelvic injuries. It also demonstrates that for the optimal use of materials and implants, experience in different techniques is required, and shows the significant need for blood transfusions in the treatment of these injuries.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the mid-to-long-term surgical outcomes of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using a hybrid locking plate/cable technique for the treatment of Vancouver type B1 and type C periprosthetic femoral fractures (PPFs) in a consecutive group of patients from a single tertiary referral center. Twenty-five patients (25 PPFs; 17 female, 8 male) in whom a Vancouver type B1 or type C PPF was diagnosed and treated by a hybrid locking plate/cable technique from 2005 to 2016 were included in the study. Patients' functional status was categorized into 4 groups based on the Harris Hip Score (HHS) at the final follow-up: 70=poor result; 70-80=fair; 80-90=good, and 90-100=excellent. Intraand postoperative complications were also recorded. PPF union was defined clinically as the patient's ability to bear full weight with or without assistance and radiographically as the presence of a callus bridging the fracture. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the Vancouver classification and type of fixation regarding the HHS and time to union. The mean age was 57 ± 16.6 (range, 17-82) years at the time of the primary hip replacement and 64 ± 18.7 (range, 24-88) years at the time of PPF. The mean follow-up was 5.6 ± 3.3 (range, 2-14) years from primary procedure to PPF and 6.5 ± 4.1 (range, 3-15) years following PPF. There were 7 type B1 and 18 type C PPFs. At the final follow-up, the mean HHS was 71 ± 7.74 (range, 57-89). According to HHS, functional results were poor in 8 patients, fair in 14 patients, and good in 3 patients. No major intra- or postoperative complications were noted. Fracture union was achieved in all patients without complications at an average of 13 ± 4.9 (range, 6-24) weeks. In subgroup analysis, while no significant differences were observed in the HHS (P=.87 for the Vancouver type, P=.96 for the type of fixation), time to union differed among groups. Time to union was significantly shorter in type B1 than in type C PPFs (P=.006). Time to union was considerably shorter in the uncemented group compared to the cemented one (P=.017). Adding cables to the locking plate can provide adequate stability to preserve fracture alignment and achieve bony union in Vancouver type B1 and C PPFs. Although union can be achieved by ORIF in such patients, a longer union time may be required for PPFs in the setting of a cemented femoral stem or Vancouver type C. Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

We conducted a retrospective study of 99 patients (110 hips) from March 2006 to May 2017 who underwent MoM HRA. The Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score were measured, and the patients underwent clinical and radiological management. Serum levels of cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), and molybdenum (Mo) were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) at 1, 6, and 12 months, and each year follow-up after prosthesis implantation. Patients were followed up from 1 to 156 months, with a mean of 98 months. No complications occurred. Metal ion analysis revealed significantly elevated levels compared to preoperative levels. The metal ions levels increased and reached a peak after surgery, and then the levels began to decline gradually. Approximately 84-108 months after surgery, the metal ion levels increased again to approximately peak levels. Then, up to 156 months after surgery, the metal ions levels will drop approximately to preoperative levels. The serum levels of Cr in women were higher than those in men, with the difference being statistically significant. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥24.9 kg/m2 Co levels were significantly higher than those of normal-weight patients. The serum levels of metal ions showed no significant differences between the prostheses. The use of the MoM HRA was clinically effective, and the Co, Cr, and Mo levels increased significantly after HRA; however, upon long-term follow-up, serum metal ion levels tended to decrease to preoperative levels. Longer follow-up periods and larger study samples are needed to establish the long-term outcome of patients undergoing HRA with MoM bearings. Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "Nerve guidance channels are natural or synthetic tubular conduits used to bridge the gap between the nerve stumps. Creation of a biological membrane may be a simple and cheaper way to obtain a nerve guidance channel. The goal of this study was to examine the role of a biological membrane in expediting nerve regeneration.Twenty adult male Wistar albino rats weighing 200 to 250 g were divided into two groups equal in number. All the animals underwent median nerve dissection to create a 5-mm gap. In the first group, the defect was repaired with a graft obtained from the contralateral median nerve, while in the second group, a silicon implant was sutured and anastomosed between the stumps. After five weeks, the silicon implant was removed and a nerve graft taken from the contralateral median nerve was anastomosed inside the neoformed biological membrane. Recovery of muscular function indicating nerve regeneration was assessed by the prehension test proposed by Bertelli and Mira. In both groups, measurements were started after five weeks of grafting and continued for 12 weeks.Rats in the second group exhibited an accelerated recovery and nerve regeneration compared to the first group. Nerve regeneration was completed at 10 weeks in the second group, whereas the recovery rate was 90.2% at 12 weeks in the first group (p<0.05).The use of autogenous grafts is still the gold standard in nerve repair. This biological membrane not only expedites nerve regeneration, but also facilitates surgery and reduces operating time because it requires small incisions at the two ends. Considering these advantages, it may prove to be a good alternative to other techniques.",

In one group (distal group, n=8), the right sciatic nerve was transected near the proximal segment of, and in another (proximal group, n=7) at 15 mm proximal to, its branching. In the graft group (n=7), the nerve was resected from 5 mm to 15 mm proximal to its branching and the defect was repaired with the removed segment. All the nerves were repaired using the epiperineural technique. Electrophysiologic studies were performed before and after surgery. In the third month, bilateral biopsies were taken from the L4-5 dorsal root ganglion and from distal nerve segments for histopathologic examination and neuron and axon counts.At two months, the distal group exhibited significantly shorter latency (p=0.001) and higher amplitude (p=0.05) values. However, at three months, all the groups had similar values of latency, amplitude, and conduction velocity. At three months, the number of the dorsal root ganglion neurons was significantly greater in the distal group compared to the graft group (p<0.001), but this did not differ from the proximal group (p>0.05). Axon counts per square millimeter were similar (p>0.05), but axon diameter was greater in the distal group (p<0.05). In correlation analyses, increases in the number of L4-5 dorsal root ganglion neurons were significantly associated with increases in the percent changes in distal latency (p<0.05) and conduction velocity (p=0.018).Our findings suggest that distal injuries and primary repair of the sciatic nerve result in a faster and better recovery.",

According to the Regan-Morrey classification, the fractures were type 2 in nine patients (69.2%), and type 3 in four patients (30.8%). Nine patients had associated injuries (elbow dislocation, radial head or olecranon fractures, and/or ligamentous injuries). The mean duration to treatment was 2.3 days (range 1 to 7 days). Functional results were assessed according to the Mayo elbow performance score (MEPS), and signs of arthritis were assessed according to the Broberg-Morrey criteria. The mean follow-up was 41.1 months (range 12 to 96 months).A functional range of motion of the elbow joint was achieved in 10 patients (76.9%). The mean elbow range of motion was 110.7 degrees (range 85 degrees to 130 degrees ) and the mean forearm rotation was 134.2 degrees (range 120 degrees to 155 degrees ). Three patients who had comminuted fractures and associated elbow injuries had decreased range of motion. None of the patients exhibited signs of instability. The mean MEPS was 86.5 (range 75 to 100). The results were excellent in four patients (30.8%; the mean MEPS 98.8) having isolated or noncomminuted coronoid fractures, and good in nine patients (69.2%) with comminuted fractures and/or associated bone or ligament injuries. Post-traumatic arthritis was detected in seven patients (53.9%) whose mean MEPS was 81.4. Patients with an excellent functional result did not develop arthritis. All the patients returned to preinjury activity levels.Coronoid fractures are the most important component of complex elbow injuries. The presence of comminuted fractures, associated bone and ligament injuries, and post-traumatic arthritis affect the outcome adversely.",

    "abstract": "Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the strength of the locking plate and lag screw construct that is applied in two different working lengths on the simple distal femur fracture model with a finite element analysis (FEA) method. Methods From the computerized tomography scan data of a 60-year-old healthy male, the AO/OTA 33A1-type fracture model was simulated; the fracture gap was stabilized with the models of locking plate construct with (groups C and D) or without an interfragmentary lag screw (groups A and B). Furthermore, 102-mm plate (groups A and C) and 82-mm plate working lengths (groups B and D) were tested using FEA. Two loading conditions (axial compression and torsion) were applied at the center of the femoral head. Construct stiffness, interfragmentary micromotion, and the peak von Mises stress (VMS) on the plate were assessed. Results Group D provided the highest axial stiffness (1347 N/mm), and group A was the weakest (439 N/mm). With the lag screw, shear micromotion remained generally low compared with that without the screw for all axial and torsional load levels and for both plate working lengths, i.e., 0.23 mm with lag screw versus 0.43 mm without lag screw (102 mm working length, 700 N). The percentage decreases of shear micromotion under axial (350/700/1400 N) and torsional loads for the 102-mm working length were >22% and 73%, respectively; while those for the 82-mm working length were >28% and 33%, respectively. The reduction of axial micromotion was observed with the lag screw for all axial load levels as well as for both plate working lengths, i.e., 0.33 mm with lag screw versus 0.87 mm without lag screw (102-mm working length, 700 N). The percentage decreases of axial micromotion under axial loading (350/700/1400 N) for 102 mm and 82 mm working lengths were >42% and 50%, respectively. The peak VMS on the plate stayed generally low with lag screw compared with without lag screw throughout all tested load levels, as well as for both plate working lengths, i.e., 124.26 MPa versus 244.39 MPa (102 mm working length, 700 N). The percentage decreases of the peak VMS under axial (350/700/1400 N) and torsional loads for the 102-mm working length were >40% and 69%, respectively, while those for the 82-mm working length were >47% and 61%, respectively. Conclusion The current FEA concludes that in a simple distal femur fracture, adding a lag screw to a locking plate construct provides better torsional stability with a 102-mm plate working length and better axial stability with a 82-mm plate working length. Additionally, the strength of the materials is increased and implant failure can be minimized by using this technique.",

    "abstract": "Pudendal syndrome is primarily characterized by stress urinary incontinence, dysuria, sexual arousal syndrome, painful erections, and anal incontinence. The syndrome occurs when the pudendal nerve or one of its branches is compressed, stretched, or injured. Double crush is the compression of a peripheral nerve at two or more separate areas with various signs and symptoms. We, herein, aimed to introduce the case of a 42-year-old male who underwent the distal release procedure due to the diagnosis of \"double crush pudendal syndrome\" following a proximal release surgery previously performed elsewhere. The patient's history revealed a pelvic fracture with urethral injury 27 years ago. Throughout the years, the patient had been evaluated by various medical disciplines and undergone several treatments. In 2017, an orthopedic surgeon performed proximal pudendal nerve release using transgluteal approach, and then rectal pain and defecation complaints relieved. However, in 2019, the patient was referred to our clinic because of the persistence of erection and perineal complaints after the proximal pudendal nerve release. Based on a detailed clinical and laboratory assessment, the diagnosis of double crush neuropathy was established, and distal release of the pudendal nerve using transperineal approach was performed. To determine the efficiency of the surgical treatment, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QAQ) tests were used preoperatively and at the first postoperative year. Furthermore, to assess the perineal pain, erection pain, and pain during intercourse Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used. The erectile dysfunction improved from the severe degree (9 points) to the mild degree (22 points) postoperatively. The patient's general and sexual satisfaction scores, and erection quality score improved compared to the preoperative baseline. According to VAS, the perineal pain, erectile pain,and pain during intercourse decreased postoperatively. (from 7 to 2 out of 10, from 8 to 3 out of 10, from 7 to 2 out of 10, respectively). When perineal and sexual complaints are encountered following pelvic trauma, the pudendal nerve-related problems, especially double crush syndrome, should be kept in mind in differential diagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach must be established in order to avoid any delay in diagnosis and treatment. Surgical intervention may provide a significant improvement in clinical and functional status.",

In the obstetric US, alpha angles of both hips of the fetuses were measured based on Graf's method, and each case was assessed ultrasonographically by a second physician at 6-10 postnatal weeks. Prenatal and postnatal hips were then classified according to alpha angles as ≥ 60° or < 60°. The kappa coefficients between the diagnoses based on prenatal and postnatal alpha angles were calculated.According to the postnatal alpha angle, 77 fetuses were diagnosed to have type 1 right hip and 7 fetuses had type 2A right hip. The prenatal alpha angle provided the same results (77 type 1 and 7 type 2A right hips). Similarly, the postnatal alpha angle revealed type 1 left hip in 82 fetuses and type 2A left hip in 2 fetuses, which was the same as the diagnoses based on the prenatal alpha angles. There was a complete agreement between prenatal and postnatal alpha measurements for both the left and right hips (kappa = 1.00, P < 0.001).Evidence from this study has revealed that DDH can be identified by obstetric ultrasonographic examinations in the prenatal period.",

TESS was translated into Turkish and back translated to determine language validity. To test convergent validity, the Turkish versions of the Short Form-36 (SF-36), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) were used. SF-36 was used on all patients while WOMAC and DASH were used onpatients with lower extremity tumors and upper extremity tumors respectively. The tests were repeated 15 days later and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determine test-retest reliability.The Turkish version of TESS was found to have a strong negative correlation with WOMAC (r = -0.702; P < 0.001) and DASH (r = -0.774; P < 0.001) as well as a strong negative correlation with ROMS (r = 0.601; P < 0.001). Turkish TESS also had a statistically significant correlation with SF-36-Physical functioning, SF-36-Role Physical, SF-36-Bodily Pain, and SF36-General Health at levels ranging from 0.326 to 0.669 (r values ranging from 0.326 to 0.669, P < 0.001). The internal consistency (Cronbach's α:0.96 for lower extremity and Cronbach's α:0.94 for upper extremity) and test-retest reliability of Turkish TESS were found to be excellent (ICC lower extremity: 0.96 [0.935-0.983]; P < 0.001 and ICC upper extremity: 0.99 [0.967-0.997]; P < 001). ICC values varied between 0.674 and 0.987 for each item of the scale for both extremities. Conlusion: The Turkish version of TESS seems to be a valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measure to evaluate physical function after musculoskeletal tumor surgery in Turkish patients.Level II, Diagnostic Study.",

Multiple databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and Web of Science were searched, and articles comparing incidence for traumatic fractures before and after of COVID-19 outbreak were Results: From 8 published studies which had been reported from July 2020 to September 2020, a total of 9305 patients were identified. The study period of each study included varied from January 24 to May 22 in 2020. There was a significant decrease in the total number of trauma cases during lockdown by 3229 cases (pre-lockdown n = 6267 and lockdown n = 3038), amounting to a decrease by a pooled percentage of 51.6% (P = 0.012). The incidence of hand and tibia fractures decreased while the incidence of femoral fracture significantly increased during COVID-19 outbreak (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the fracture frequency for all other skeletal areas (P > 0.05).Evidence suggests that there was a significant decrease in the overall number of traumatic fractures during the COVID-19-related period of societal restrictions and lockdown. Proportions of most fractured areas were not significantly influenced by the state of emergency, except for femoral fractures, which had occurred more often during this state. Care must be taken, while developing contingency plans for reallocating resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, not to assume that all trauma presentations will decrease.

Group 2 represented the second waveof the pandemic, during which restrictions were not applied and only emergencyand trauma surgeries were performed, from 1 September to 31 October 2020. Group3 represented the normal period before the pandemic, including surgeriesperformed between 1 September and 31 October 2019. In addition, patients ineach group were divided into two groups as younger than 16 or older than 16 inorder to understand the difference between paediatric and adult orthopaedictraumas. The distribution of patients and their fractures were evaluated.In Group 1, the rates of intra-articular fractures, distal extremity fractures, and proximal humerus fractures decreased, while the rate of proximal femur fractures increased (P < 0.05 for all). The frequency of hand fractures treated in Groups 1 and 2 compared to Group 3 was reduced (P < 0.05 for both). There was no statistically significant difference between Groups 2 and 3 for fractures in different parts of the body except for hand fractures (P = 0.001 for hand fractures, P > 0.05 for the other fractures).We observed that the frequency of fractures decreased, and the distribution changed due to severe restrictions and lockdowns in the first wave of the pandemic. When the restrictions and lockdowns were removed in the second wave, the frequency of fractures decreased, but the distribution of fractures was similar to the normal period in 2019.Level III, Diagnostic Study.",

    "abstract": "Although conventional suture techniques yield satisfactory results in the treatment of meniscal ruptures, they are inherent with long operative time and high complication rates. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of meniscal repair with the use of the RapidLoc device.The study included 57 consecutive patients (all males; mean age 24 years; range 17 to 33 years) who underwent meniscal repair with the RapidLoc device. The mean time from injury to surgery was 20 days (range 7 to 60 days). The mean length of meniscal ruptures was 25 mm (range 10 to 35 mm). A mean of two RapidLoc fixators were used for each rupture. Thirty patients had associated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture; of whom 17 patients underwent ACL reconstruction with hamstring autografts. Thirteen patients refused ACL reconstruction and underwent only meniscal repair. Functional results were evaluated using the Tegner activity score, Lysholm score, and IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) subjective knee evaluation form. Clinical assessments were made using the Barrett criteria. The mean follow-up was 39 months (range 18 to 66 months).The mean operation time including diagnostic and surgical arthroscopy was 25 minutes (range 15 to 35 min). Compared to the preoperative scores, all functional scores showed significant improvements (p<0.001) with the following increases: Lysholm score from 58.8 + or - 13.7 to 93.3 + or - 7.7, Tegner activity score from 3.5 + or - 1.0 to 6.0 + or - 1.6, and IKDC score from 52.8 + or - 10.5 to 91.4 + or - 4.0. According to the Barrett criteria, meniscal healing was achieved in all the patients. Second-look arthroscopy was performed in one patient due to pain and swelling, which showed an unabsorbed tophat of the RapidLoc device.Our findings suggest that the RapidLoc meniscal repair device may be an appropriate choice in selected cases because of satisfactory short-term clinical results, ease of applicability, short operation time, and low complication rate.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the morphological features of the mediopatellar and lateral folds in fetal knees in the absence of any exposure to certain stress factors such as exercise or trauma. The study was performed in the knee joints of 15 fetuses (6 males, 9 females) obtained as spontaneous abortion material at 20-34 weeks of gestation. The mediopatellar and lateral folds of the fetuses were classified into eight subgroups according to the following morphological features: A- Absence of folds; B- Short vertical band; C- Long vertical band; D- Narrow horizontal band; E- Broad horizontal band; F- Horizontal band accompanied by a vertical band; G- Horizontal band without a vertical band; H- Fenestrated band. The synovial membrane, covering the infrapatellar fat pad and forming the alar folds, extended upwards and formed the medial and lateral horizontal folds that covered the inferior part of the posterior aspect of the patella. These horizontal folds were thicker in the lower parts (close to their insertions) and became thinner towards the free ends. The horizontal band of the mediopatellar fold was observed in all cases, with an accompanying vertical band in 76.7% of the cases. A horizontally located lateral fold was absent in both knees of one fetus. The frequency of a horizontally located lateral fold was 93.3% and a vertical fold was accompanying in only 28.6% of these cases. It is of note that the horizontal band of the mediopatellar fold observed in all specimens has never been defined in previous classifications. In 10% of the knees, the vertically located part of the mediopatellar fold presented as a large band extending upward and being squeezed between the articular surface of the patella and the medial condyle of the femur. The lateral fold was observed as a large band in 10% of the knees. Another observation was that the higher level the vertical band of the mediopatellar and lateral folds began, the wider the horizontal band was, occupying more place in the patellofemoral space. It was remarkable that the frequencies of the vertically located parts of the lateral and mediopatellar folds in fetuses were higher than those reported for the adults in the literature. Our findings suggest that the resorption process of the mesenchymal tissue, particularly in the lateral part, continues until adulthood and causes age-dependent alterations in the formation of intra-articular folds. The synovial folds occupy more space between the patella and femur in the early stages of life than seen in adults. This may be a more frequent cause of unexplained knee pain in children than expected.",

We investigated cartilage destruction and oxidative stress parameters in the blood and synovial fluid of knee joints of rabbits exposed to varying periods of immobilization.Twenty-eight mature New Zealand albino male rabbits were divided into four groups equal in number. In three groups, the knees were immobilized with a rigid cast for 3, 6 and 9 weeks, respectively. The cartilaginous tissue of the femoral condyles and tibial plateau were analyzed with respect to total count, total volume, and numerical density of chondrocytes using stereohistological methods. Antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathion peroxidase (GSH-Px), and oxidative stress parameters including nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in the plasma and synovial fluid.Compared to the control group, total count and total volume of chondrocytes in the femoral condyle and tibial plateau showed significant decreases, while numerical density showed a significant increase at 3 weeks of immobilization. Subsequent immobilization periods resulted in significant decreases in all these parameters, being most remarkable compared to the control group at the end of nine weeks (p<0.001). In plasma and knee joint synovial fluid, all antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px) and oxidative stress parameters (NO and MDA) showed consistent increases compared to the control group throughout the immobilization period (p<0.001).Increased levels of ROS in the blood and synovial fluid might result in cartilage destruction and ROS may be one of the potential factors involved in the etiopathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Prolonged joint immobilization should be avoided in the treatment of orthopedic diseases.",

Radiographic evaluations included femoral and acetabular components and signs of loosening. The mean follow-up was 25.2+/-8.7 months in the SA group and 26.1+/-7.2 months in the MIA group.The amount of blood loss and blood transfusions were significantly reduced and length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the MIA group (p<0.001). The mean operation time did not differ between the two groups (p>0.05). Improvements in the VAS and HHS scores were significantly better in the MIA group (p<0.001). Similarly, improvements in all the SF-36 subscales other than general health, mental health, and role-physical subscales were significantly greater in the MIA group. Radiographically, no signs of loosening and osteolysis were seen. Superficial or deep wound infections did not occur.Compared to the SA approach, the MIA approach in THA operations is associated with shorter hospital stay, reduced blood loss and blood transfusions, better postoperative pain control, and higher levels of improvements in HHS and SF-36 scores.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the early results of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed through the midvastus approach.This retrospective study included 48 knees of 42 patients (29 females, 13 males; mean age 69 years; range 54 to 82 years) who underwent TKA for grade 4 knee osteoarthritis. All TKA operations were performed by the same orthopedic surgeon through the midvastus approach. Preoperatively, 40 patients (95.2%) had primary osteoarthritis, and two patients (4.8%) had rheumatoid arthritis. In all cases, a posterior stabilized cemented prosthesis with a fixed insert was used. Patellar resurfacing was performed in seven knees (14.6%). All the knees were rated according to the Knee Society knee and function scores before surgery and at the final follow-up. Postoperative radiographic evaluations were performed on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs according to the Knee Society TKA Roentgenographic Evaluation and Scoring System. The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range 12 to 49 months).The mean knee score significantly improved from 49.0+/-9.3 preoperatively to 87.5+/-9.9 postoperatively (p=0.000). The corresponding increase in the knee function score was from 48.8+/-9.9 to 79.6+/-14.0 (p=0.000). The mean increases in the knee and function scores were 38.5 and 30.8 points, respectively. The knee and function scores were excellent or good in 46 knees (95.8%) and 42 knees (87.5%), respectively. The mean knee flexion significantly increased by 28.6 degrees , from 84.3+/-14.7 degrees preoperatively to 112.9+/-11.9 degrees postoperatively (p=0.000). Among patients with bilateral osteoarthritis, the knee function scores were significantly higher in patients who had undergone bilateral versus unilateral TKA (90.0+/-11.5 and 78.8+/-10.8, respectively; p=0.007). None of the patients had patellar tracking abnormality intraoperatively; thus, there was no need for lateral retinacular release. Postoperative clinical and radiographic assessments showed no signs of instability or loosing. Clinical and radiographic loosening of the patella and osteolysis were not observed in patients who had undergone patellar replacement. No changes were observed in the tracking and position of the protheses. Neurovascular injury did not occur. One patient who developed early infection of the knee that required a two-stage revision was assessed as failure.In our study, lateral retinacular release was not needed due to achievement of proper patellar tracking in TKA operations with the midvastus approach, and satisfactory clinical and radiographic results were obtained.",

Injuries involved the second, third, fourth, and fifth fingers in seven, three, two, and four patients, respectively. Primary tendon repair was performed in 14 patients. Two patients were treated after one week and two months following primary injury, respectively. Tendons were repaired by modified Kessler and epitendinous sutures in four patients, and by locking running suture in 12 patients. Following surgical repair, three patients underwent K-wire fixation in extension for two weeks, while 13 patients received the short arc motion protocol. The patients were assessed with respect to proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint motion and extension loss. Functional results were assessed using the Strickland formula. The mean follow-up was 58 months (range 8 to 120 months).Full range of motion of the PIP joint was achieved in 15 patients (93.8%). The mean PIP joint motion was 98 degrees. One patient (6.3%) had an extension loss of 10 degrees in the range of motion of the PIP joint. There were no losses in the range of motion in three patients treated with K-wire fixation. The mean of the Strickland formula was 94.8% (range 74% to 100%), showing an excellent result in 15 patients (98.3%) and a good result in one patient (6.3%). All the patients returned to their pre-injury work status. None had buttonhole deformity or soft tissue complication.A proper suture technique combined with the short arc motion protocol provides good results in the treatment of isolated zone 3 extensor tendon injuries.",

Thirty-two adult male rats were randomly divided into 4 equal groups. Traumatic edema in one paw of each rat was produced by established protocol. Different drugs were then administered to each group: intraperitoneal (i.p.) saline (group 1, control group), topical diclofenac gel (group 2), i.p. diclofenac sodium (group 3), and i.p. iloprost (group 4). The volume of the paws was measured at baseline (before trauma) and at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after trauma. The anti-edema effects of these 3 drugs (diclofenac gel, diclofenac sodium i.p., iloprost i.p.) were compared to each other and to the control group. The greatest increase in paw edema in the first, second and fourth hours was seen in the control and iloprost groups. At the 4-hour measurement, edema levels were all equal except control group. Following 4- and 8-hour measurements, edema began to decrease in all groups. After 8 and 24 hours, the fastest decrease in edema was in iloprost group, with complete resolution of edema by 72 hours. The next fastest decrease in paw volume was seen with i.p. diclofenac sodium, followed by diclofenac gel. Iloprost has experimentally higher anti-edema effect than diclofenac sodium for the conservative treatment of the traumatic soft tissue edema.",

A custom-made prosthesis or a proximal osteotomy is required for such cases, and these also increase the rate of complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of the thrust plate prosthesis (TPP) in patients with deformity of the proximal femur.Fifteen patients (7 females, 8 males) with a mean age of 56.4 years (range 19-75 years) at the time of the surgery were included in the study. The etiology was traumatic coxarthrosis in 12, and nonunion of a femoral neck fracture with osteonecrosis of the femoral head in the remaining three. While the femoral component was a third-generation TPP in all patients, the acetabular component was a Protek expansion cup in 12, and a cementless standard cup in three patients. All operations were performed through a Hardinge approach. Patients were followed up for at least 3 years (range 36-116 months) and evaluated clinically with the Harris Hip Score.The mean preoperative Harris Hip Score increased from 51.2 (range 15-79) to 92.7 (range 60-100) at the latest assessment. In two cases, loosening of the femoral component was observed in zone 3, both 12 months postoperatively. One was replaced by an intramedullary prosthesis, and the other was asymptomatic.TPP is a good alternative for patients with malformations of the proximal femur. The use of TPP avoids technical difficulties and a custom-made prosthesis.",

We aimed to compare the effect of equine-derived BPE, an osteoinductive agent composed of a high amount of type-I collagen and other bone proteins (Colloss-E), with that of human demineralized bone matrix (DBM) for treating cavitary bone defects not requiring scaffold use.Rabbit distal femoral condyle was used as a stable cavitary bone defect model. Bone defects of 6-mm diameter and 10-12-mm depth were created in the femoral condyles. Rabbits were assigned into the equine-derived BPE (BPE), human-derived DBM (DBM), and control (C) groups. Approximately 20 mg of BPE was implanted into the defect in the equine-derived BPE group (n=6), whereas 0.3 cc of DBM was implanted in the DBM group (n=6). Defects were left empty in the C group (n=6). The defect area was histologically examined after 6 weeks.There were no instances of macroscopic defect collapse or failure. Histopathological examination revealed that the BPE group had better scores (statistically significant) than both the other groups in terms of quality of union. The BPE group also had higher scores than the DBM group in terms of graft incorporation and new-bone formation.The current study revealed results consistent with those of the previous studies concerning BPEs. Equine-derived BPE was found to be successful for treating cavitary bone defects not requiring scaffold use.",

The present study included a total of 42 patients (31 men, 11 women) who underwent Chevron osteotomy of the medial malleolus and who had been followed for more than 2 years. Mean age of the patients was 34 years (range: 18-54 years). Preoperatively, size of the lesions was measured in millimeters in the coronal and sagittal planes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The angle between the osteotomy with the long axis of the tibia was measured on the coronal plane, the angle between the arms and the angle for the screws to be directed to the osteotomy line were measured on the sagittal plane on the postoperative images. Nonunion, malunion, and complications from the screws were evaluated from X-ray images taken at the final follow-up. Mean duration for follow-up was 31.4 years (range: 24-46). On the X-ray images taken at the final follow-up, no distraction, migration of the distal part, or rotation was observed. Only 1 patient experienced radiological non-union. Mean duration to union was 5.8 weeks (range: 4-14 weeks). Screws of 8 patients were removed at an average of 7.4 months (range: 5-11 months). The angle between the osteotomy line and long axis of the tibia was 29.0°±6.5°, the angel between the osteotomy arms on the sagittal plane was 74.7°±8.3°, and the direction angle of the screws on the coronal plane was 85.7°±5.9°. Chevron osteotomy is an assistive surgical method used for treatment of osteochondral lesions located in the medial talar joint surface (TOL) which provides fast anatomical healing because it allows efficient fixation due to its geometry.",

There were 36 patients (mean age: 68.3 years, range: 56 to 82 years) in the EHL-referenced (ERT) group and 43 patients (mean age: 70.2 years, range: 54 to 78 years) in the 2nd metatarsal-referenced (MRT) group. There were 47 components in the ERT group and 53 in the MRT group. Frontal alignments of the tibial components were measured. Angles of 90±2° were accepted as the normal boundaries while those above that value were labeled as 'varus' and those below as 'valgus'. Average frontal alignment was 88.57° in the MRT group and 89.17° in the ERT group. The number of tibial components in the normal range was significantly higher (p=0.017) and the number of varus-oriented components significantly lower (p=0.024) in the ERT group. There were no significant differences in valgus-oriented outliers between groups (p=1.000). The use of the EHL tendon as a reference improves coronal tibial alignment.

Forty-five patients-39 women (86.7%) and 6 men (13.3%)-were included. Mean age was 58.68±8.63 years with mean follow-up of 51.71±20.96 months. Preoperative and postoperative clinical evaluation was performed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for overall pain. Preoperative and postoperative imaging studies were used to measure the degree of spondylolisthesis and the angle of scoliosis and lumbar lordosis. The presence of preoperative facet joint arthrosis and changes in the diameter of anterior, posterior, and transverse spinal canal were assessed by computed tomography (CT). Preoperative disc degeneration, disk herniation, and spondylolisthesis were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mean preoperative ODI and VAS scores were 59.2% and 7.06, respectively, while postoperative ODI and VAS scores were 14.4% and 1.7%, respectively (p=0.001). Anteroposterior diameter of the central canal increased from 10.43±2.18 mm preoperatively to 19.63±2.01 mm postoperatively (p=0.0001). Mean preoperative and postoperative spondylolisthesis were 5.81±4.88 mm and 3.87±4.53 mm, respectively (p=0.0001).

    "abstract": "Middle third clavicular fracture is effectively treated by conservative means. Previous studies showed that comminution and displacement of clavicular fractures might affect fracture healing. However, the clavicle horizontally aligns in the shoulder girdle and has different biomechanics from vertical weight-bearing bones. Therefore, this study was conducted with the hypothesis that comminution has no effect in worsening fracture healing and union configurations in conservatively treated middle third clavicular fractures. One hundred ninety-eight middle third clavicular fractures treated by conservative means were reviewed and divided into 2 groups. Group 1, simple fractures, included 97 patients. Group 2, comminuted fractures, included 101 patients. Patient demographic data, initial fracture deformities, and union configurations such as angulation, overlying, and displacement were measured. Union rate and union complications such as delayed nonunion were evaluated. Data were analyzed for statistically significant differences (p<0.05). Initial deformities of Group 1 and Group 2 were 11.94°±9.59° and 9.40°±8.57° angulation, 12.24±12.96 and 11.76±10.06 mm of overlying, and 13.31±8.63 and 13.72±7.42 mm of displacement, respectively, and exhibited no significant differences (p>0.05). Union rate and union complications of Group 1 were 74/97 (76.29%) and 23/97 (23.71%), respectively. For Group 2, the rates were 82/101 (81.19%) and 19/101 (18.81%), respectively. Union configuration of Group 1 and Group 2 were 13.76°±10.63° and 12.80°±8.65° angulation, 11.93±10.75 and 11.52±9.38 mm of overlying, and 9.79±8.33 and 10.74±6.68 mm of displacement, respectively, and showed no significant differences between the groups. Comminution plays no role in worsening fracture healing of conservatively treated middle third clavicular fractures in terms of healing rate, union complications, and union configurations.",

Fifteen embalmed adult cadavers (8 males, 7 females) were used in this study. All pelvic specimens were placed in the supine position on a radiolucent carbon fiber table. The ideal angle of screw placement, appropriate screw diameter, and perfect attachment point were determined by the computerized navigation system. According to the above data, cross-cannulated screws 6.5 mm in diameter were implanted by the guide pins. Based on detailed local dissection, the entry-exit points of double screws were exposed in the pelvis. The distances were measured between the entry-exit points and the major structures. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans of the pelvis were performed to reassess the position of screws. The trajectory of the first screw originated from the trailing edge of the pubic tubercula to the anterior-lower corner of the contralateral pubic tubercula. The second screw was directed from the base of the pubic tubercula to the junctional zone between the pubic tubercula and inferior ramus of the pubis of the opposite side of the body. Both screws maintained a safe distance from the surrounding major structures. All screw corridors were found intact without any damage under X-ray and CT images. The Orbic 3D computer navigation system is a reliable and new method of achieving a secure corridor for screw implantation in the pubic symphysis.",

Surgical instruments and a digital caliper were used for dissection and measurements, and the critical structures were recorded by a Canon 250D camera to be illustrated later.All parameters were significantly longer in male cadavers compared to females. According to the correlation analysis, while there was a significant and robust correlation between the axial line and pternion-deep plantar arch (R=.830, P .05), a moderate correlation was found between the axial line and sphyrion-bifurcation (R=.575; P < .05), axial line and deep plantar arch-2nd interdigital commissure (R=.457; P < .05), and sphyrion-bifurcation and pternion-deep plantar arch (R=.480; P < .05). Variation in any branch of the posterior tibial artery was observed in 27 of the 48 studied sides.In our study, the branching and variability of posterior tibial artery on the plantar surface of the foot were described in detail with the determined parameters. In conditions that cause tissue and function loss and require reconstruction, such as diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis, the most critical factor in increasing treatment success is a better understanding of the region's anatomy.",

Patients who undergo shoulder arthroplasty could obtain a good American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (Mean Difference [MD], 1.87; 95% CI, -2.08 to 5.82), regardless of their body mass index.Obesity had a negative impact on the prognosis of patients treated with shoulder arthroplasty. Additionally, obese patients require longer surgical times than normal-weight patients, although all patients can attain positive functional outcomes.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of adrenomedullin on the healing of the segmental bone defect in a rat model.Thirty-six Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups based on follow-up periods and administered a dose of adrenomedullin hormone. In each group, bilaterally, a 2-mm bone defect was created at the diaphysis of the radius. Sodium chloride solution was administered to sham groups 3 times a week for 4 and 8 weeks intraperitoneally. Adrenomedullin was administered to the study groups 3 times a week: 15 μg-4 weeks, 15 μg-8 weeks, 30 μg-4 weeks, and 30 μg-8 weeks, respectively. After euthanasia, the segmental defects were evaluated by histomorphometric [new bone area (NBA)] and microtomographic [bone volume (BV), bone surface (BS), and bone mineral density (BMD)] analyses.Although the 4- and 8-week 15 μg administered study groups had higher NBA values than the other study and control groups, the histomorphometric analysis did not reveal any statistical difference between the control and study groups regarding NBA (P > .05). In microtomographic analysis, BV was higher in the 15 μg 4-week group than 30 μg 4-week group (296.9 vs. 208.5, P=.003), and BS was lower in the 30 μg 4-week group than in the 4-week control group (695.5 vs. 1334.7, P=.005), but overall, no significant difference was found between the control and study groups (P > .05). Despite these minor differences in histomorphometric and microtomographic criteria indicating new bone formation, the BMD values of the 15 μg 8-week study group showed a significant increase compared with the control group (P=.001, respectively).Adrenomedullin positively affected BMD at 15 μg, but this study could not show healing in the segmental defect site at different dose regimens. Further studies are needed to assess its effects on bone tissue trauma.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the effects of a medial buttress plate (MBP) or a trochanteric lag screw (TLS) to augment cannulated screws (CSs) in fixing Pauwels type III femoral neck fractures.This retrospective study included 58 patients (21 female, 37 male; mean age=46 years; age=19-64 years) treated by CSs for Pauwels type III femoral neck fractures from 2014 to 2017. All the patients were divided into 2 groups based on the internal fixation patterns: the MBP-augmented group (group A, n=26) and the TLS group (group B, n=32). The mean age was 47 (range=24-57) years in group A and 45 (range=19-64) years in group B. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, reduction quality, Harris score, and postoperative complications were recorded and compared between both groups.All patients were followed up for an average of 44.8 months in group A and 47.3 months in group B (P=.406). No significant difference was noted in reduction quality (P=1.000). However, group A had a longer operation time (100.2 vs. 64.3 minutes, P < .001) and greater intraoperative blood loss (153.1 vs. 30.0 mL, P < .001) than group B. At the final follow-up, the union rate was equal between group A (96.2%) and group B (90.6%) (P=.760). The mean bone union time was 21.6 weeks in group A and 23.6 weeks in group B (P=.431). The delayed union rate was lower in group A (0%) than in group B (15.6%) (P < .001). The incidence of postoperative complications in terms of implant failure (7.7% vs. 28.1%, P=.048) and femoral neck shortening (7.7% vs. 28.1%, P=.048) were lower in group A than in group B. No significant difference was noted in avascular femoral head necrosis (P=1.000) and the Harris score (P=.659) between the 2 groups.In the surgical treatment of Pauwels type III femoral neck fractures, medial buttress plating can offer fewer complications but equal avascular femoral head necrosis rate and functional outcome compared to trochanteric screw application.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

This study was designed prospectively. All school-aged patients with upper or lower extremity fractures requiring hospitalization or outpatient treatment were included in this study. Information about school absences and school starting dates were recorded at the outpatient clinical presentations of these patients.A total of 126 patients were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 11.7 (range=6-17) years. The gender ratio was determined as F/M=20/106. The average time absent from school was 14.7 (range=2-61) days. Distal radius fractures were the most common upper extremity fractures; the mean time away from school was 7.9 days. In lower extremity fractures, lateral malleolar fracture was the most common complaint, and the mean duration of absence was calculated as 21.8 days. The periods of absence were mainly determined by the family or the child.One of the critical findings in this study was that rest periods were primarily determined by the parents and/or the child and not by the physician. The need to use crutches and/or transportation difficulties were other reasons for the absence. For these reasons, teachers and school management should be sensitive to the adverse effects of absenteeism on the child's success and provide facilitating support and home education opportunities when necessary.Level II, Prognostic study.",

    "abstract": "The orthopedic load following earthquakes exceeds that caused by any other disaster. This is due to the large number of musculoskeletal injuries due to falling debris, coupled with the widespread damage to general and medical infrastructure, causing a huge imbalance between surgical needs and the ability to address these needs, necessitating a switch in mindset and operational mode. Clinically, the operational mode will be that of damage control surgery, considering \"life before limb\" with only lifesaving and limb-saving procedures being performed during the acute phase of the event. Open wounds are treated by thorough debridement, and fixation is performed using plaster casts or external fixation. Open reduction and internal fixation of closed fractures will be deferred until the surge subsides or the patient reaches a fully functional medical facility. Organizational and logistic needs will be addressed considering the \"4 S's\": space, staff, supplies and system. Geographical changes will be necessary in the hospital, shifting activities from damaged structures to safe ones or to open spaces. Field hospitals may be erected on the hospital grounds or on an independent site. Medical staff will be overloaded, especially traumatologists, orthopedic and plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and surgical nurses. This can be addressed by the recruitment of supplementary personnel, task shifting, and on-site training. Supplies will be augmented from nonfunctional hospitals and other external sources, and the hospital system will switch to surge mode with appropriate work shifts and emergency standard operation procedures. All this necessitates preplanning, preparing, and drilling in order to mitigate the effects of this disastrous event.",

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the irregularity of a distal attachment of the biceps brachii and peripheral signal changes. We diagnosed a partial rupture of the distal biceps tendon. Because conservative treatment failed, surgical treatment was performed through a single anterior approach. The insertion of the tendon was partially ruptured at the radial tuberosity. After the involved site was debrided, the palmaris longus tendon was grafted with suture anchors to reinforce the remaining tendon. Postoperative immobilization was not performed, and all moves were freed after 3 weeks. At the 6-year postoperative follow-up, the patient no longer experienced pain and returned to his original job without any limitations.",

The mean follow up time was 36.2 ± 16.7 (12-57) months. Functional results were evaluated with perception of pain, range of joint motion, grasp and pinch strengths.Union was achieved in 17 of 18 patients. Only one patient had non-union due to infection and underwent debridement. The mean time for union was 7.8 ± 5.9 months (2-20). Patient perception of pain was X = 1.88 ± 2.50 and X = 4.55 ± 2.68, respectively, at rest and activity. The active ranges of joint motion were adequate for functional use. General functional state of affected extremity (DASH-T) was perfect (X = 27.14 ± 25.66), the performance of elbow joint was good (X = 84.44 ± 11.57). There were no differences in the comparison of grasp and pinch grip of patients with uninvolved extremity (p > 0.05).In distal humeral extra-articular fractures, use of distal medial tibia plate has advantages such as providing high rates for union, low rates for complication, and early return to work with early rehabilitation, therefore it may be considered a fixation choice that can be used for distal humeral extra-articular fractures.Level IV, therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) on posterolateral lumbar fusion in a rat model.Methods: 36 male Sprague Dawley rats underwent posterolateral fusion at L4-5 level.They were randomly assigned to 3 groups: 1-Sham control group where no local augmentation was made, 2-Local Hydoxyapatite b-tricalcium phosphate (HA/b-TCP) augmentation group and 3-Local HA/b-TCP þ EGF augmentation group.Rats were euthanized at 8 weeks post-surgery.6 rats from each group were selected for manual palpation examination, micro-computed tomography analysis and histologic analysis; and the rest was used for biomechanical analysis.Results: Based on manual palpation, there was no fusion in the sham control group.Fusion rate was 33.3% in the HA/b-TCP group and 66.7% in the HA/b-TCP þ EGF group (p ¼ 0.085).Micro-CT results revealed that new bone formation was higher in the HA/b-TCP þ EGF group (BV/TV: 40% vs. 65%) (p ¼ 0.004).Histologically newly formed bone tissue was more pronounced in the EGF group and compacted and bridging bone spicules were observed.The median maximum bending moment values were 0.51 Nmm (0.42e0.59), 0.73 Nmm (0.49e0.88) and 0.91 Nmm (0.66e1.03) in the sham control, HA/ b-TCP and HA/b-TCP þ EGF groups, respectively (p ¼ 0.013).The median stiffness values were 1.69 N/mm (1.12e2.18),1.68 N/mm (1.13e2.74)and 3.10 N/mm (1.66e4.40)as in the previous order (p ¼ 0.087).Conclusion: This study demonstrates that EGF enhances posterolateral lumbar fusion in the rat model.EGF in combination with ceramic grafts increased the fusion rates.Our findings may provide insights to further studies, investigating EGF's clinical usage as an alternative fusion enhancer.",

The first group underwent MRI studies and the second group underwent FLSS studies. Two-step procedures were carried out. Knee MRI in 60 consecutive adult patients simply taken for meniscus or ligament injuries were utilized at the first step. The standardized patellar center (PC) and tibial tubercle (TT) on the frontal plane of MRI were positioned. At the second step, the FLSS in other 100 consecutive young adult patients taken for chronic unilateral lower extremity injuries were used for locating the two landmarks from MRI. The Q-angle was then determined on the anterior superior iliac spine, standardized PC, and TT on the FLSS.For 60 patients, the standardized PC was at the point 42% from the lateral end of the trans-epicondylar line of the femur. The TT was at the point 2 cm distal to the tibial articular surface and 37% from the lateral end of the tibial width. For 100 patients, the Q-angle was an average of 9.5° and 65.2% of the Q-angle was contributed by the upper arm (the femur). Women had a larger Q-angle (10.1° vs. 8.8°, p = 0.02) and a shorter femur (41.1 vs. 44.7 cm, p < 0.001).The Q-angle is about 9.5° with 65.2% contributed by the femur. The Q-angle may mainly be influenced by the femoral component.Level IV, Diagnostic Study.",

Reliability of the measurements was tested by three different investigators on randomly selected films by using the standard method.CEA values of 3192 hips of 1596 children, who had no hip pathology, were measured. Mean CEA value was found as 26.2°±5.5°. The mean CEA was 26.2°±5.3° in males (%54) and 26.2°±5.7° in females (%46) (p=0.224). Mean values for the right and left hips were 25.7°±5.4° and 26.6°±5.6°, respectively.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of morphological changes of the patellar tendon (length, width, and thickness) on the development of anterior knee pain (AKP) after intramedullary nailing (IMN) of tibial shaft fractures.A total of 39 patients, treated by IMN using the transpatellar approach for tibial shaft fractures, were retrospectively reviewed and included in the study. The patients were then divided into 2 groups based on the presence of AKP: group A, patients who developed AKP (9 men, 9 women; mean age=35.39±9.32 years), and group B, patients without AKP (13 men, 8 women; mean age=41.38±14.78 years). To assess the morphological changes in the patellar tendon, magnetic resonance imaging was performed on the operated and unoperated, contralateral knees of the patients. The patellar tendon index (PTI) was calculated using the length, width, and thickness of the patellar tendon, and a set of variables was established to be a proportion of the measurements of the operated knees to those of the unoperated ones (operated/healthy PTI ratio). PTI ratios were compared between both the groups. Furthermore, the morphological features of the patellar tendon, including the length, width, and thickness, were examined within the groups as independent variables. To assess pain intensity in group A, a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) was used. To evaluate functional status, the Lysholm knee scoring system was used.The PTI ratio was significantly higher in group A (1.37±0.12) than in group B (1.03±0.08) (p<0.001). In group A, the mean VAS score was 5.35±1.11, and a moderate linear correlation was found between PTI ratios and VAS scores (r=0.494, p=0.044). The mean Lysholm score was significantly lower in group A (80.17±3.05) than in group B (89.76±3.05) (p<0.001). In group A, the width and thickness of the patellar tendon were found to be significantly different between the operated and unoperated knees (p=0.024 and p=0.002, respectively). In group B, there was no difference between the operated and unoperated knees in terms of the 3 measurements (length, width, and thickness) (p=0.762, p=0.753, and p=0.118, respectively).Evidence from this study revealed that morphological changes occurring in the patellar tendon after IMN for tibial shaft fractures using a transpatellar approach may have a significant role in the development of AKP. The increase in the tendon width and thickness may be the cause of pain and insufficient knee function in such patients.Level III, Therapeutic study.",

Conclusion:Hand disorders in a rural area seem to correlate with the occupational sector activities, such as farming and agriculture.CTS was the most common disorder in the past; however, the dramatic increase in the incidence rate of TF made it the most common hand disorder in the last decade.Incidence rates in both males and females showed an increasing trend.",

Various dorsoulnar flap options have been used in the regional flap armamentarium of the upper limb. Poor venous drainage may be a considerable handicap when moderate to large skin paddle dorsoulnar flaps are used. In the present case, we aimed to reduce the risk of necrosis by supercharging the dorsoulnar island flap. The current literature regarding dorsoulnar island flap has also been reviewed with focus on this flap. This technique has successfully been used for a complex wrist defect in a 48-year-old man. Postoperative follow up was one year. The flap survived completely with perfect hand function. We think this modification can prevent possible venous stress in the pedicled and free dorsoulnar flaps by obtaining extraveneous drainage. The method is simple, does not need sophisticated microsurgical procedure and longer operative time.",

Mechanical axis deviation (MAD), leg-length discrepancy (LLD) and lateral femoral distal angle (LDFA) and medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) were measured from standing orthoroentgenographics. All measurements were repeated after external fixator removal.The frame was applied for an average of 20.3 (range: 4 to 36) weeks. Mean follow-up time following removal of external fixator was 32 (range: 15 to 54) months. An effective and accurate correction was achieved in all cases. Solid bone consolidation was obtained in all but two cases which underwent bone grafting.Taylor spatial frame appears to be a safe and effective method for the gradual correction of the complex translational and rotational deformities around the knee.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of long-segment posterior instrumentation and allograft application in obtaining fusion in congenital scoliosis.Twenty-one patients with congenital scoliosis who were treated with long-segment posterior instrumentation (>6 levels) and freeze-dried allograft and followed up for more than 24 months were reviewed. Six patients were excluded from the study due to anterior procedures. Fifteen patients with congenital scoliosis (13 females, 2 males; mean age: 12.2 ± 3 years, range: 7-17 years) were retrospectively reviewed. Mean follow-up time was 30.9 ± 9.4 (range: 24 to 48) months. Six patients had laminectomy either due to previous posterior surgeries or to address intraspinal pathologies during the posterior fusion procedure. Preoperative, postoperative and final follow-up anteroposterior and lateral spine X-rays were reviewed. Fusion was graded according to the classification reported by Bridwell et al.Two patients were graded as 'no fusion' (pseudarthrosis), four patients as 'probably fused', and nine patients as 'definitely fused'. The major curve was corrected from an average of 68 ± 18.6 to 39.3 ± 12.2 degrees (p<0.001). Mean correction lost in the major curve was an average of 4.5 ± 5.2 degrees in the latest follow-up. There was significant correction in the compensatory curve (preoperative 37.9 ± 13.2 degrees, postoperative 20.2 ± 6.6 degrees; p=0.001). Preoperative and postoperative global thoracic kyphosis were 39.5 ± 13.3 and 32.3 ± 7.9 degrees, respectively (p=0.018). Preoperative and postoperative global lumbar lordosis was 36.3 ± 7.4 and 36.1 ± 8.9 degrees, respectively (p=0.883). Successful fusion was detected in %86.7 of patients in the final follow-up.The usage of allograft alone to achieve fusion increases the rates of pseudarthrosis while additional anterior procedure decreases the pseudarthrosis rate in patients with congenital scoliosis that require long-segment posterior instrumentation. Further studies should be performed to assess the efficacy of the usage of polysegment pedicle screw instrumentation.",

Methods Patients who underwent ORIF due to perilunate injuries from 2004 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Surgery was mostly performed using a standard dorsal approach. Each injury was graded as per Mayfield staging. At the final follow-up, pain intensity was evaluated using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). Wrist and elbow range of motion, handgrip and pinch strength, Modified Mayo Wrist Scores, and the disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) scores were measured. On plain radiographic examination, the scapholunate (SL) angle, SL interval, carpal height, and continuity of Gilula arcs were evaluated. The presence of arthritis was also assessed using the Herzberg classification. Results In total, 26 male patients (27 wrists) who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The mean age was 40 years (range: 20-58); the mean follow-up was 45 months (range: 16-96). Most of the injuries were fracture-dislocations (n=20; 71.4%). According to Mayfield staging, 7 wrists were grade 3, and 20 wrists were grade 4. According to Herzberg staging, 11 (40.7%) patients were stage 2a. The mean VAS was 2.3 (range: 0-5) at rest and 3.3 (range: 0-7) during activity. The mean wrist flexion and extension were 50° (range: 21-80°; 73.5% of the unaffected side) and 45.1° (range: 20-74°; 70.9% of the unaffected side), respectively. The mean radial and ulnar deviation were 14.6° (range: 6-25°; 63.6% of the unaffected side) and 22.3° (range: 5-40°; 64.7% of the unaffected side), respectively. Grip and pinch strength were 57.6 kg (range: 15-106; 65.5% of the unaffected side) and 18.6 kg (range: 8-28; 78.2% of the unaffected side), respectively. The mean Mayo score was 63.3 (range: 20-90), and the DASH score was 24.1±25.2. The mean SL angle was 61.6° (range: 40-83). There was 1 wrist with a pathological SL interval, 11 wrists with dorsal intercalated segmental instability, and 3 wrists with fractures of the Gilula arcs. The mean carpal height was within the normal range.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This study aims to develop and evaluate a simple tool for daily practice that might allow a rough estimate of individual braking performance (brake response time, BRT) of patients with osteoarthritis or those with arthroplasty of the knee or hip. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we examined 162 patients (72 men, 90 women; mean age = 64±12.8 years) who suffered from osteoarthritis of the knee (n=45) or hip (n=64) or who underwent a total hip (n=37) or knee (n=16) arthroplasty. BRT of each patient was measured in a brake simulator. The results were compared to demographic data, various clinical tests, and pain surveys. From these data, a multiple linear regression model was developed. RESULTS From the observed correlations, the regression model consisted of age (correlation with BRT τ=0.176, p=0.001), sex (τ=0.361, p<0.001), Hau's step test (τ=-0.345, p<0.001), and the pain dimension of the Hip disability/Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (τ=-0.265, p<0.001). We, therefore, suggested the following formula: BRTest = 634.8 - (8.8 x Hau) + 119.2 (for women) + (3.0 x age) - (1.3 x H/KOOS Pain). The above-mentioned variables contributed significantly to the prediction of BRT and could achieve a multiple R² adj of 0.31. The model leaves a residual standard error (i.e., SD of the residuals) of 158.4 ms, which is superior to a model without predictors; F (4.140)=16.8, p<0.001. CONCLUSION Our evaluated regression model offers an uncertainty which is comparable to the one based on a fixed time period after surgery or a defined pathologic condition. The high variability even within a single patient over several brake simulator measurements makes it unlikely for a model to be generated solely based on clinical testing. Taking the available data in literature into account, we advise caution when formulating a real-time- or condition-based recommendation. We rather suggest being aware of risk factors that might lead to impaired BRT to sensitize patients to their impaired ability to drive. We identify such risk factors, namely old age, female sex, impaired musculoskeletal function, as tested in Hau's step test, and high levels of pain. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

The reliability and consistency of SRQ-T for all the samples were acceptable with a Cronbach's coefficient of 0.979. The test-retest method was used to determine reliability of the scale. Cronbach's alpha was measured pre-assessment and post- assessment; the values were 0.815 and 0.770, respectively. The correlation analysis was determined for all the samples and calculated as 0.780.

In each group, a partial capsulotomy, and synovectomy were performed in knee. After a partial capsulotomy and synovectomy were performed in each group, the collagenase group received intra-articular CCH of 0.008 mg in 0.1 mL saline solution while the control group received the equal volume of intra-articular saline solution alone. After 6 weeks of surgery, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation, and the following outcome measures were collected. Knee range of motion (ROM) was measured using with a goniometer under 20 g force. Adhesion formation was rated using the macroscopic visual scoring system after the knee joint was exposed through a lateral parapatellar approach. Histological evaluation was performed on samples including connective tissue and fibrotic adhesions, and fibroblast cell numbers were measured performed per square. Levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were assayed by ELISA from the intra-articular fluid.The macroscopic visual scoring system was significantly lower in the collagenasegroup (median = 1, range = 0-2) than in the control group (median = 2, range = 1-3)( < 0.001).ROMwas significantly higher in the collagenase group (102° ± 12.1°) than in the control group (77° ±8.94°) (P <0.001).

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of femoral tunnel orientation, drilled through the accessory anteromedial (AAM) portal or the high AM portal in anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.In 16 cadaver knees, using o'clock method, centers of the ACL femoral footprint were drilled with an 8-mm reamer via an AAM portal (eight knees) or a high AM portal (eight knees). Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken of each knee. Three-dimensional (3D) models were constructed to identify the femoral tunnel orientation and to create femoral tunnel virtual cylinders for measuring tunnel angles and length.In two of the 16 specimens, we observed a posterior femoral cortex blowout (PFCB) when drilling through a high AM portal. When drilled through the high AM portal, the femoral tunnel length was significantly shorter than when using an AAM portal (30.3 ± 3.8 mm and 38.2 ± 3.1 mm, p < 0.001). The femoral tunnel length was significantly shorter in the group with PFCB compared to the group with no PFCB (25.9 ± 0.6 mm and 35.5 ± 4.5 mm, p = 0.011). The axial obliquity of the high AM portal was significantly higher than that of the AAM portal (52.2 ± 5.9° and 43.0 ± 2.3°, p = 0.003).In anatomic ACL reconstruction, a mal-positioned AM portal can cause abnormal tunnel orientation, which may lead to mechanical failure during ACL reconstruction. Therefore, it is important to select accurate AM portal positioning, and possibly using an AAM portal by measuring an accurate position when drilling a femoral tunnel in anatomic ACL reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "One third of the people aged 65 years and over fall every year, and 1-5% of these falls result in a fracture. For these people, history of fracture and surgery become a risk factor for recurrent falls. In osteoporotic patients, repeated fractures often require several osteosynthetic procedures within a short time frame. Despite the lack of biomechanical studies, clinical experience suggests that additional fractures adjacent to implants occur because of the difference in stiffness between the metallic implant and the osteoporotic bone. This requires customized fixation techniques to ensure stability. The technique was first performed in an 81-year old female patient presenting with a dislocated proximal femoral fracture at the tip of a previously implanted distal femoral nail (DFN), and non-union of the old fracture. For this technique, the DFN was advanced until it passed the proximal fracture, thereby reducing both fractures, while a lateral femoral nail (LFN), extra-long and 3 mm thicker than the DFN, was introduced and advanced distally. The LFN was implanted in a \"kissing nail technique,\" meaning the tips of the two nails were touching each other, and all fracture fragments were held in functional reduction. The DFN was slowly pulled backwards and fragment stability was maintained, while both nails passed the distal non-union. The Kissing Nail Technique allows simple, safe and fast reduction of all instable fragments, precise and easy positioning of the proximal entry point by the retrograde guide wire, a minimally invasive procedure, and stable fixation of a periprosthetic fracture. We found this new customized procedure accommodating to the unique anatomical features of a single patient, that can be applied as a strategy especially for osteoporotic patients with periprosthetic fractures.",

Thirty-eight extremities of 23 children (14 girls and 9 boys; mean age = 9.2 years, age range = 3-17 years) were then divided into two groups according to the plate location in the sagittal plane (anterior or midline). Preoperative and postoperative TS were measured from the medial and lateral tibial plateaus separately.The mean follow-up was 34.3 (range = 12-96) months. The mean preoperative and postoperative medial TS were 4.05 ± 5.65 and 0.83 ± 3.91 degrees, respectively, in 18 patients in whom anterior epiphyseal plates were placed (P = 0.004). The mean preoperative and postoperative lateral TS were 4.88 ± 5.33 and 0.11 ± 3.34 degrees, respectively, in 18 patients in whom anterior epiphyseal plates were placed (P < 0.001). The mean preoperative and postoperative medial TS were 4.2 ± 5.19 and 4.9 ± 6.02 degrees, respectively, in 20 patients in whom midline epiphyseal plates were placed (P = 0.532). The mean preoperative and postoperative lateral TS were 5 ± 5.51 and 4.8 ± 5.7 degrees, respectively, in 20 patients in whom midline epiphyseal plates were placed (P = 0.871).

Postoperative TS changes in midline-placed eight-plates were not significant regarding the medial and lateral plateaus (P = 0.532 and P = 0.871, respectively).The results of this study have shown that TS decreases following guided growth by the eight-plate in children in whom plates are placed at the anterior epiphysis.

The NL was split during the surgical approach and repaired at the time of wound closure. The frequency and spinal levels of NL disruption at one month, six months, and one year postoperatively were evaluated on mid-sagittal and axial magnetic resonance images. Postoperative axial symptoms, Neck Disability Index, T1 slope, flexion and extension angle, C2-C7 lordotic angle, and decrease rate of C2-C7 range of motion (ROM) were examined at six months and/or one year postoperatively. Based on the NL disruption levels, the patients were divided into the upper group (C2-C5), lower group (C6-T1), and non-disruption group.Although the lower group contained patients with NL disruption (10%) after LP at final follow-up, all PDF patients belonged to the non-disruption group. For the LP patients, the postoperative axial symptoms, Neck Disability Index, T1 slope, flexion and extension angle, and C2-C7 lordotic angle did not significantly differ between the lower and non-disruption groups; however, the rate of C2-C7 ROM decrease in the lower group (48%) was considerably larger than that in the non-disruption group (33%) after LP.Evidence from this study has shown that postoperative disruption of the repaired NL has no significant effect on postoperative axial symptoms and C2-C7 alignment, but it can affect the rate of decrease in C2-C7 ROM after LP.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

The study was conducted with children aged 5-18 years, including 60 children with non-displaced, impaction type upper extremity and lower extremity fractures resulted from low-energy trauma. In addition, 60 healthy children were included as controls. In all participants, risk factors for low bone mineral density were assessed and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured. Vitamin D levels were compared among groups.Vitamin D deficiency (25-OH D <20) was 14.8 times (OR= 95% CI= 5.61 - 39.8) and 2.9 times (OR= 95% CI= 1.46-5.75) higher in patients with upper and lower extremity fractures, respectively. In the upper extremity fracture group, serum 25-OH D level was considered deficient (25-OH D level=<20 ng/mL) in 91.6% (55/60). In comparison, it was considered as insufficient (serum 25-OH D level=20-30 ng/mL in 8.3% (5/60) of the patients. In the lower extremity fracture group, serum 25(OH)D level was considered as deficient in 75.0% (45/60), while it was considered as insufficient in 25.0% (15/60) of the patients. In the control group, serum 25-OH D level was considered deficient in 10.0% (6/60), while it was considered insufficient in 61.6% (37/60) of subjects. The 25-OH D deficiency and insufficiency were more common in the whole fracture group (upper plus lower extremity fracture groups) when compared to healthy controls.This study has shown that hypovitaminosis D is associated with an increased risk for fracture in the pediatric population, and the fracture risk is higher in upper extremity fractures than in lower extremity fractures. In children with fractures, routine vitamin D evaluation should be considered.Level III, Diagnostic Study.",

One-millimeter multidetector computed tomography scans were collected and assessed by OsiriX-Lite version 8 and Horos v3.3.5. Entry point locations, projected and true femoral neck-shaft, anteversion, and newly defined nail entrance angles were measured.The entry points of 16 femurs were placed at the tip of the greater trochanter, and the remaining 47 femurs were in the trochanteric fossa (i.e., piriformis fossa). Thirty-three of the entry points found in the trochanteric fossa were overlapped by the greater trochanter. When the parameters of the right and left sides were compared, it was found that; projected neck angle, nail entrance angle, and the differences between true neck angle and nail entrance angle were found significantly different. The relationship between nail entrance angle and entry point localization was assessed, and the probability of the entry point being at the tip of the greater trochanter is 63 times greater when the NEA is below 90.This study has demonstrated that the ideal entry point for straight nails, which is based on the anatomic axis of the femur, is found mainly at the trochanteric fossa, and the greater trochanter overlapped 70.21% of them.Level IV, Diagnostic Study.",

A 47-year-old male patient with irreducible medial malleolus and distal fibula fracture was referred for treatment. Intraoperatively, it was discovered that failed reduction was due to the interposition of the posterior tibial tendon in the syndesmosis. The posterior tibial tendon was pushed posteriorly through the tibiofibular interosseous interval and relocated to its anatomical position. Reduction and fixation were only achieved after relocation of the tendon. In conclusion, when anatomical reduction is not easily achieved, interposition of the posterior tibial tendon in the syndesmosis should be considered.",

We present a case of psoas hematoma formation following scoliosis surgery due to intraoperative violation of the intertransverse plane. A 13-year-old female patient with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis underwent a posterior deformity correction and instrumented fusion which was complicated with intraoperative inadvertent violation of the intertransverse plane during dissection of the posterolateral gutter leading to a unilateral psoas hematoma. She experienced abdominal pain and a CT scan confirmed the presence of a psoas hematoma. Antibiotic coverage was provided in view of positive blood culture of Bacillus species to avoid infective seeding of the hematoma. Resolution of the hematoma was observed on the reassessment CT one month postoperatively. It is not uncommon for patients to develop atrophic transverse processes due to spinal deformity. This may cause difficulties in identification of the anatomy intraoperatively and thus, extra caution should be exercised during dissection to prevent violation of the intertransverse plane and subsequent psoas hematoma complication.",

The PTW sign was confirmed on the sagittal MRI. In addition, the patellar tendon length, tibial-femoral angle and tibial anterior translation (TAT) were compared between the groups.The PTW sign was present in 41/50 (82%) MRI scans in group 1 and 10/50 (20%) in group 2, with significant difference between two groups (p = 0.000). Significant differences were also found, in medial TAT (6.29 ± 3.25 mm versus 3.12 ± 2.85 mm) and in lateral TAT (7.62 ± 3.85 mm versus 1.58 ± 3.93 mm) between two groups (both p = 0.000). Comparison of MRI with and without PTW sign, ACL injury was found to be of significant difference with 41/51 (80.4%) versus 9/49 (18.4%) (p = 0.000), and both medial and lateral TAT were with significant differences, 5.39 ± 3.90 mm versus 3.99 ± 2.71 mm (p = 0.039) and 7.67 ± 3.77 mm versus 1.40 ± 3.81 mm (p = 0.000), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of PTW sign were 82% and 80%. The positive and negative predictive value were 80.4% and 81.6%. The diagnosis accuracy was 81%.The PTW sign is a useful secondary MRI sign to establish the diagnosis of an ACL tear. It may be associated with the TAT secondary to an ACL tear.Level III, diagnostic study.",

We retrospectively reviewed 283 patients (138 men and 145 women; mean age: 59.7 ± 9.3 years) who underwent arthroscopic repair for full-thickness rotator cuff tear. We evaluated the characteristics of 16 patients in whose needle tip had been broken and embedded and remained in the rotator cuff (remnant needle group) and compared them with the remaining 267 patients (control group). Afterwards, another 64 patients were selected from control group (1:4 matching) after propensity score matching (PSM). The groups were compared anatomically with MRI or ultrasonography and functionally (serial pain VAS and ROM; ASES, Constant, UCLA and SST scores) at a minimum follow-up of 1 year. The remnant needle group showed preoperative thicker tendon (6.72 mm vs 5.33 mm, p = 0.047), higher tendinosis (mean grade, 1.88 vs. 1.43, p = 0.029), and more frequent delaminated tears (p = 0.035) compared with control group.

    "abstract": "Objective: Due to the biomechanical importance of the meniscal root ligament, several surgical techniques have been defined in order to treat meniscal root tear.Different application techniques have different levels of difficulty.We aimed to find a stronger and simpler repair technique.Methods: Sixteen bovine knee joints were prepared.The posterior root of the medial meniscus was dissected and repaired with one of two different techniques.The knees in group 1 (\"knotted group\") were repaired with the knotted suture anchor technique, and the knees in group 2 (\"knotless group\") were repaired using the knotless suture anchor technique.The strength of the repairs was tested biomechanically.Results: Cyclic loading tests were done.On the 0-20 N one-cycle test, the knotted anchor group's equivalent stiffness average was 5.28 N/mm, and the knotless anchor group's equivalent stiffness average was 5.48 N/mm.The 5-20 N two-cycle test results were 8.29 N/ mm for the knotted group and 8.66 N/mm for the knotless group.On the 5-20 N 100-cycle test, the equivalent stiffness averages were 8.59 N/mm for the knotted group and 10.18 N/mm for the knotless group.Elongation was 5.83 mm for the knotted group and 4.86 mm for the knotless group.After performing load-to-failure tests, the failure forces were recorded as 237.83N for the knotted group and 204.90 N for the knotless group.The failure test elongation values were 26.83 mm for the knotted group and 18.70 mm for the knotless group.The failure energies were 3.87 J for the knotted group and 1.83 J for the knotless group.Except for elongation until failure (p=0.009),there were no significant differences between the two groups tested (p>0.05).The average elongation was significantly less in group 2, showing that the knotless anchor had an advantage, with less meniscal excursion compared to the sutured anchor. Conclusion:Knotless anchors have a mechanical advantage over knotted anchors for preventing meniscal excursion.When thought together with technical simplicity during arthroscopic surgery, knotless anchors could be used safely for the fixation of the meniscal root ligament.",

Instability of the hallux IP joint has rarely been reported in barefoot contact sports, and its treatment has not been sufficiently explored.This study investigated chronic varus instability of the hallux IP joint. We performed a surgical reconstruction owing to conservative treatment failure. A good surgical outcome was achieved by reconstruction of the collateral ligament using the 4th extensor tendon-a promising alternative treatment option for this type of injury. This method indicated no morbidity outside the site of surgery and was more cost-effective than reconstruction using an allograft.",

In this report, we describe the case of a 37-year-old patient with palmar-divergent dislocation of the scaphoid and lunate and discuss the mechanism of this type of injury. We also report a potential treatment for this pattern of palmar-divergent dislocation. The scapholunate and scaphocapitate joints were stabilized with K-wires and a modified pin-in-plaster fixation for 5 weeks after successful closed reduction. At the 1-year follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of avascular necrosis of the scaphoid or lunate. However, radiographs showed mild dorsal intercalated segment instability deformity. The patient experienced no intermittent wrist pain or limitation in motion, with only 15% loss in grip strength. The Mayo wrist score was 90/100, and the patient resumed work as a craftsman. The carpal height ratio at the 4-year follow-up was 1.51 and 1.52 for the left and right wrists, respectively. In conclusion, we recommend this treatment method due to its benefits of being relatively simple, easy to perform, and having a relatively short operation time. Essentially, a good outcome was achieved using this method, including full range of motion and freedom from pain.",

The rats were divided into four groups: Group A (control group without any treatment, n=10), Group B (spacer without PDGF Group, n=10), Group C (spacer with PDGF group, n=10), and Group D (healthy rat Group, n=5). Standardized fractures were created in the right tibias of rats, and then biodegradable implants made of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy valerate were implanted at the fracture sites in Groups B and C. In Group C, implants were loaded with 600 ng of PDGF. Animals were sacrificed 30 days after the operation, and fracture healing in each group was assessed radiologically based on the Goldberg score. Furthermore, the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) callus diameters were measured macroscopically, and fracture sites were mechanically tested. Results In the radiological assessment, Group C showed higher fracture healing rate than Groups A and B (p=0.001), whereas no significant difference was found between group C and Group D (p>0.05). In the macroscopic assessment, while Group C exhibited the thickest AP callus diameter (p=0.02), no significant differences in ML callus diameters existed among the groups (p>0.05).

METHODS A total of 1,487 patients who underwent primary (n=1,328; 1,131 females, 197 males) or revision TKA (n=159; 137 females, 22 males) between 2010 and 2017 at our institution were retrospectively included in the current study. The patients' demographics (age and gender), the length of hospital stay, comorbidities, and septic and aseptic revision rates were collected from our hospital database. The total costs of revision and primary TKAs were calculated based on the prostheses and surgical equipment used, hospital stay, and other administrative costs in both the Turkish lira (TRY) and US dollar (USD) based on the parity of the 2 currencies from 2010 to 2017. RESULTS The average cost per patient for primary TKAs was 7,985±2,927 TRY (5,265 USD) in 2010 and 7,070±1,775 TRY (1,852 USD) in 2017. The average cost for revision TKAs was 13,647±4,095 TRY (8,999 USD) in 2010 and 22,806±6,155 TRY (5,973 USD) in 2017. In terms of the total costs, significant differences existed over the years, with a significantly higher difference in 2015 compared with that from 2010 to 2013 (p<0.001); however, no difference was determined among the age groups (p=0.675). The difference between the total costs of the septic (n=34; 17,964±13,028 TRY) and aseptic revisions (n=125; 23,377±12,815 TRY) was significant (p=0.001), with a higher cost for patients with septic TKAs but with no significant difference between the total costs for the patients with and without comorbidities (p=0.254). Additionally, the length of hospital stay was 2 times higher in patients with revision TKAs than in those with primary TKAs (12.3 vs 6.2 days). CONCLUSION Revision TKAs cause higher costs than primary TKAs, with a prolonged hospital stay. The septic background seems to be an independent predictive factor for increased costs in revision TKAs.",

The clinical outcomes in terms of fracture union, Quick Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, implant irritation, failure rate, and reoperation rate were evaluated retrospectively. The patient billing records were reviewed to obtain primary operation, reoperation, and total operative cost for midshaft clavicle fracture. These values were analyzed and converted from Malaysia Ringgit (RM) to United States Dollar (USD) at the exchange rate of RM 1 to USD 0.24. All patients were followed up for at least one-year duration. Results The mean time to fracture union, implant irritation, implant failure, and reoperation rate showed no significant difference between the two groups of patients. The mean Quick DASH score was significantly better in the reconstruction plate group with 13 points compared with 28 points in the LCP group (p=0.003). In terms of total operative cost, the LCP group recorded a cost of USD 391 higher than the reconstruction plate group (p Conclusion The 3.5-mm reconstruction plate achieved not only satisfactory clinical outcomes but was also more cost-effective than the LCP in the treatment of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures.

    "abstract": "Objective The aim of this study was to analyze the contamination rates of the skin under the iodophor-impregnated plastic adhesive drape (IOD) at the time of incision closure in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Methods A total of 225 patients undergoing primary THA (28 men, 197 women; mean age=65 years; age range=30-85) were included in this study. After asepsis using a solution of 1% chlorhexidine with 83% alcohol by volume, the surgical site was painted with a 10% povidone-iodine solution, and IOD was attached tautly at the start of surgery. Swabs of the surgical site were collected as follows: swab A from the skin before IOD application, swab B from the surface of the IOD at the time of incision closure, and swab C from the skin after peeling back the IOD. The obtained samples were promptly sent for microbiological analysis. The contamination rate was determined for swabs A, B, and C, and the contamination rate of swab C was compared with that of swabs A and B, and the bacterial species were identified. Results Positive cultures were seen in 8 cases (3.6%) for swab A, 10 cases (4.4%) for swab B, and 22 cases (9.8%) for swab C. The contamination rate of swab C was significantly higher than that of swabs A (p=0.008) and B (p=0.028). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n=10) and Cutibacterium acnes (n=7) were the most frequently cultured microorganisms from swab C. Conclusion In THA, the contamination rate of the skin after peeling off the IOD before incision closure was higher than that of the skin immediately after sterilization with povidone-iodine and higher than that on the IOD at the time of incision closure. The detected bacterial species were considered clinically significant pathogens. Preventive measures against infection, such as minimizing stripping of the IOD or re-sterilizing bare skin after IOD stripping, should be instituted in consideration of these findings when performing THA using IOD.",

    "abstract": "Vacuum phenomenon is a commonly observed radiological entity in the degenerated intervertebral discs of the lumbar spine in the elderly population. The entity is frequently asymptomatic. Although disc herniation containing gas (DH-CoG) is commonly associated with the vacuum phenomenon, DH-CoG associated with clinical symptoms is a rare condition. There are very few reports which have histologically demonstrated the existence of the gas itself within DH-CoG. Herein, we report a rare case of a 65-year-old female with symptomatic DH-CoG at L5/S1. The patient was admitted to our hospital with a one-month history of pain in the left buttock and leg in addition to neurogenic claudication. Roentgenograms illustrated a degenerative lumbar spine with the vacuum phenomenon at the L5/S1 disc space. Computed tomography showed a round and low-density lesion within the spinal canal at left L5/S1. Additionally, a lesion characterized by an iso- and partially hypointense signal on T1 and hypointense signal on T2 was detected in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by the spin-echo method. The decision for posterior lumbar interbody fusion surgery using pedicle screws was made as the symptoms had not responded to the conservative treatment. After a degenerated prolapsed nucleus was carefully extracted, the specimen was sent to the laboratory for histopathological analysis. The prolapsed nucleus of DH-CoG histologically showed many small vacuoles containing degenerated mucopolysaccharides. The left leg pain drastically resolved on the first post-operative day, and no recurrence had been observed. Degenerated mucopolysaccharide may be a precursor of nitrogen or \"the gas itself\" in DH-CoG. Surgical intervention for DH-CoG should be considered if conservative treatment fails.",

The second group included 38 patients without any known knee pathology. Patients were matched according to age and gender. The medial joint opening (medial patellofemoral angle) was calculated on a T1-weighted transverse image by measuring the anatomic angle between the femur and the patella. The lateral joint opening (lateral patellofemoral angle) was calculated in a similar way. The medial patellofemoral angle was significantly higher than the lateral patellofemoral angle in both groups (p<0.001). The medial patellofemoral angle is significantly higher than the lateral patellofemoral angle in both healthy knees and knees with effusion. Therefore, the medial approach appears to be more accurate for intra-articular knee injection due to the medial joint's larger opening.",

The authors concluded that minimal invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis appears to be a successful technique for the treatment of humerus shaft fractures based on plain radiographs, range of motion assessments and some patient reported outcome (PRO) measure which were American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES), University of California, Los Angles (UCLA), Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI) and The Disability of The Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores. However, before a PRO measure can be used in a society other than the one in which it was developed, it must be translated and culturally adapted. Additionally, the psychometric properties of the translated version of the PRO measure need to be assessed and compared to those of the original version [2]. Even though, the ASES and DASH have been translated and culturally adapted to Turkish and also psychometric properties of the these outcomes were provided, the authors did not use them in their study [3, 4]. UCLA and MEPI have not been translated and culturally adapted to Turkish yet and also there is not enough evidence to the psychometric properties of the original verison of the UCLA and MEPI. The result of the study Gazi et al, mostly depended on PRO’s. Clearly, reliable, valid, and responsive PRO’s are required in order to enable accurate and complementary examination of the patients’ function. Finally, I advise the authors that they should use the avalible PRO’s which are proven culturally adapted, reliable, valid and responsive in their future studies.",

    "abstract": "Transfer of the brachioradialis muscle, proposed by Özkan et al. can be applied to cases, in which, the biceps rerouting technique is not appropriate for the correction of forearm supination contracture and restoration of active pronation. We have aimed to assess the biomechanical effects of the brachioradialis transfer. Pronation strength was acquired in nine fresh-frozen cadaver forearms by applying rerouting of the brachioradialis muscle through interosseous membrane (Group 1) or transferring the same muscle to the distal insertion of extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) (Group 2). Then, a force of 5 to 35 N was applied to the muscle and the range of forearm rotation and rotation strength were measured. The normalities of the data were analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk test. Comparisons between the groups were made with independent-sample t-test and comparison of the data, obtained from the same group, was carried out with paired-sample t-test and Bonferroni correction. A maximum of 74° (with a mean of 61°) gain of pronation with rerouting and a maximum of 72° (with a mean of 65°) gain with ECU transfer of brachioradialis muscle were observed. A significant regression was also found in the first group. Regression constant was - 9.59 (p = 0.001, 95%: -13.20; -6.00) for the applied force of 2.06 N (p = 0.001, 95%: 1.90; 2.22). Furthermore, a significant regression was found in the second group. Regression constant was - 9.73 (p = 0.001, 95%: -13.13; -6.34) for the applied force of 1.91 N (p = 0.001, 95%: 1.76; 2.06). The brachioradialis muscle works as a pronator in full forearm supination. However, when the forearm comes close to the neutral rotation, due to the lateral location of the proximal insertion, the brachioradialis muscle loses this pronator effect. The additional release or lengthening of contracted soft tissues increases the range of pronation.",

The study retrospectively evaluated the clinical course of 4 patients with low-energy femoral shaft and subtrochanteric fractures admitted to our department between 2009 and 2011. Three patients had prior long-term alendronate therapy and one had prior glucocorticoid therapy. There were 5 femoral shaft fractures, 2 incomplete shaft fractures, 2 subtrochanteric and 1 intertrochanteric fractures. All femoral shaft fractures had characteristic fracture patterns with thickened lateral cortices at the proximal fragment. Six femurs had excessive medial femoral bowing, which complicated intramedullary nailing. Additional fractures were seen on both femurs of one patient who had been primarily treated with short implants. A bifocal femoral fracture was seen in one femur. Union was achieved in all patients. Two patients were able to walk independently, one with a cane and one with double crutches. We suggest the addition of another radiographic pattern of 'excessive medial femoral bowing' in low-energy femoral shaft fractures in elderly patients. This bowing complicates intramedullary nailing. Moreover, these insufficiency fractures should be fixed with long cephalomedullary nails.",

Patients were identified through a prospective registry and all fractures were classified anatomically. Cases were matched with control patients without fracture, and prescription orders were examined to assess drug exposures. Conditional logistic regression tested for a significant association between bisphosphonate exposure and fracture.Thirteen of the 106 cases (12%) and 76 of 804 controls (9%) received at least one year of prescriptions for bisphosphonates prior to fracture. Odds ratio for bisphosphonate exposure as a risk factor was 1.52 (95% confidence interval: 0.76 to 3.05), suggesting no statistically significant association (p=0.24). Results were similar when four-year exposure or alendronates only were studied.Bisphosphonate exposure was not associated with non-articular femur fracture in this case-control study. We suggest that the majority of low-energy, geriatric femur fractures are not associated with bisphosphonate exposure.",

    "abstract": "Articular penetration of K-wires is a possible complication of the modified tension band wiring technique. However, there is no clear information or evidence regarding the entry point or introduction angle for K-wires to avoid this complication. The aim of this experimental study was to evaluate the effect of varying K-wire insertion points and angles on the risk for articular penetration during modified tension band wiring for olecranon fractures.All anatomical measurements were made on 50 cadaveric ulnas, and all other measurements were performed on exact foam replications of the 50 cadaveric ulnas. Morphometric measurements, including olecranon height and heights of the central, radial and ulnar facets of the semilunar notch, were taken. In the sagittal plane, articular angle and tubercle angle were measured. Two 1.6-mm parallel K-wires were inserted from 0, 5 and 8 mm anterior to the dorsal cortex of the olecranon process at angles of 20° and 30°. K-wire articular penetration was evaluated both visually and radiographically.The mean central, radial and ulnar heights of the semilunar notch were 17.3 mm (14.7-20.0), 16.2 mm (12.0-21.0) and 15.8 mm (13.30-20.5), respectively. We observed no articular penetration at the 0-mm level at 20° and 30° (0 mm 20° and 0 mm 30°, respectively) or at 5 mm 20°. At 8 mm 30° wire introduction, more than 64% articular penetration was observed on either facet. The sequence from least to most likely to cause articular penetration was: 0 mm = 5 mm 20° > 5 mm 30° = 8 mm 20° > 8 mm 30°. The radial height of the semilunar notch was negatively correlated to the risk of articular penetration, when the wire was introduced at 8 mm 30°, 8 mm 20° and 5 mm 30° (all p<0.047). There were poor correlations between radiological and direct observational assessments, particularly for 8 mm 20° and 5 mm 30°. The frequency of intra-articular positioning for those observed to be radiologically extra-articular was 4/28 (14.3%) for 8 mm 30°, 4/7 (57.1%) for 8 mm 20° and 5/6 (83.3%) for 5 mm 30°.When applying the modified tension band wiring technique to prevent articular penetration, K-wires should be inserted in the first 5 mm from dorsal cortex of the olecranon process at a maximum angle of 20°. Moreover, if the wires are required to be inserted more anteriorly because of the anatomical configuration of the fracture, they should be inserted at a shallow angle in the sagittal plane in relation to the proximal cortex of the ulna.",

Hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red cell distribution width, white blood cell count, platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and plasma fibrinogen concentration were compared between 62 consecutive CP patients [28 girls, 34 boys; mean age 8.8 years (range 2-16 years)] and 130 consecutive orthopedic patients as control [64 girls, 66 boys; mean age 9.2 years (range 2-16 years)] who did not have any skeletal, cranial, thoracic, abdominal or major soft tissue injuries, or any other infectious, metabolic, hematological or malignant tumor disorders. CP and control groups were similar with regard to the above-mentioned hematological parameters. In the CP group, no difference was found between Gross Motor Function Classification System for Cerebral Palsy (GMFCS) level I/II patients and GMFCS level III/IV patients in terms of these hematological parameters. Preoperative blood tests results of pediatric CP patients, walking with or without any supportive devices and undergoing orthopedic interventions, are similar to those of other orthopedic patients. Advanced preoperative hematological tests can only be recommended for CP patients with abnormal blood test results.",

The study included 10 patients with IAD. All patients were assessed using the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score. Radiographs, MRI and CT were conducted during the preoperative and postoperative procedure. A 3D RP model was created for each patient. The model was used to obtain detailed information of each pedicle and used as an intraoperative reference. Assisted by the model, transoral atlanto-axial reduction plate fixation was performed in each case. The average operation time was 145 (range: 90 to 180) minutes and average blood loss was 120 (range: 60 to 250) ml. JOA scores improved after surgery. All 40 transoral pedicle/lateral mass screws were placed without serious complications or internal fixation failure. Postoperative radiographs and CT scan showed 38 transoral pedicle/lateral mass screws located in the pedicle tracts. Satisfactory reduction was achieved in 95% of screws. Two screws perforated the lateral wall of the C2 pedicles in an extremely narrow pedicle case. No neurologic sequelae or vertebral artery injury were detected. The RP technique is effective and reliable in achieving an accurate and safe screw insertion during IAD surgery, especially in anatomically abnormal cases.",

Group A consisted of 50 cases (35 women, 15 men; mean age: 61.3 years), who had C-TKA and Group B consisted of 125 cases (94 women, 31 men; mean age: 70.9 years), CA-TKA.

The achievement rate of optimal alignment in the coronal plane was significantly higher in the CA-TKA group (95.2%) than the C-TKA group (74%) (p<0.0001). The average surgical time was 69.32 minutes in the C-TKA group (range: 45-94 minutes) and 70.21 minutes in the CA-TKA group (range: 46-98 minutes). The average surgical incision length was 15.78 (range: 11-18.4) cm in the C-TKA group and 12.6 (range: 9.2-16.6) cm in the CA-TKA group. The average hospital stay was 7.3 (range: 5-16) days for the CA-TKA group and 8.5 (range: 5-17) days for the C-TKA group. Our results suggested that computer assistance provides a more accurate alignment in TKA. The reduced incision length and hospitalization time appear as two other advantages of this technique.",

Fifty-one feet of 47 patients underwent surgery due to hallux valgus. Mean age was 41.2±14.0 years, and mean follow-up period was 99.5±36.0 months. Patients were evaluated with standing anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographies obtained in the preoperative and early postoperative periods, and during final follow-up. The parameters of hallux valgus angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle (IA), metatarsal distal phalangeal angle (MDPA), and first metatarsal length (ML) were measured. For clinical evaluation, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux metatarsophalangeal-interphalangeal (MTP-IP) scale was used. Mean preoperative HVA was 36.9°±7.3°, mean early postoperative HVA was 16.6°±6.2°, and mean final postoperative HVA was 28.9°±11.5°. Mean preoperative IA was 17.3°±4.5°, mean early postoperative IA was 8.8°±3.6°, and mean final postoperative IA was 14.3°±4.9°. Mean AOFAS hallux MTP-IP score was 71.9±20.1 at final follow-up. From studies in the available literature, it is not clear whether the proximal open-wedge osteotomy technique itself is unsuccessful in adults or the lack of internal fixation led to failure. Application of an adequate fixation material should be used in order to avoid the collapse of the graft and to maintain the correction of the radiological parameters.",

    "abstract": "Compartment syndrome is one of the most devastating complications in orthopedics both for the patient and the treating physician. Among the many causes, trauma and its treatment are the most common reasons for compartment syndrome, which most frequently occurs in the lower leg following tibial fractures. Since bridge plating of difficult metadiaphyseal tibial fractures is becoming increasingly popular, serious concerns have been raised about the increased intracompartmental pressures and possible compartment syndrome.This study investigated the intracompartmental pressure changes in anterolateral compartment of the leg during and immediately after anterolateral bridge plating of tibial fractures. Intracompartmental pressures were measured before and during plate application, just after the completion of fixation, and immediately and 4-5 min after the tourniquet release in 22 isolated closed comminuted tibial fractures.Baseline anterolateral compartment pressures were higher than those on the uninjured side (9.3 vs 27.8 mmHg). Pressures were 69.5, 57.4, 65.8, and 56.8 mmHg, respectively, for the other measurements times. None of the patients received prophylactic fasciotomy, and none developed clinical compartment syndrome.We found that anterolateral compartmental pressures were higher than pressures on the uninjured side in all patients. Although there is a considerable increase in intracompartmental pressures during and immediately after anterolateral percutaneous bridge plating of comminuted tibial fractures, intraoperative prophylactic fasciotomy is not routinely needed. One should monitor the patients on the first postoperative day for signs of compartment syndrome. Fasciotomy decisions should be based on both clinical symptoms and serial intracompartmental pressure measurements rather than a single measurement.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the morphometric characteristics by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of type I split cord malformation (SCM) patients.All subjects received conventional MRI with the Achieva 3.0T system (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA, USA), including T1WI/axial and sagittal T2WI/axial FLAIR. Transverse diameter (TD) and sagittal diameter (SD) of the split cord, TD of the convex (TDconvex) and the concave (TDconcave), cranial SD (SDcranial), and caudal SD (SDcaudal) were recorded on the sagittal image combined with the two-dimensional view. Statistical comparison was performed within and between the groups.Twenty-nine type I SCM patients were included, 24 (82.8%) of whom had scoliosis. Mean TD and SD of the split cord were 0.55±0.31 cm and 7.52±4.03 cm, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in TD, SD, and other parameters among the 3 groups. However, mean TD of the split cord in type I SCM patients with congenital scoliosis (0.49±0.29 cm) was significantly greater than in those without congenital scoliosis (0.18±0.44 cm) (p<0.05). TDconvex was significantly smaller than TDconcave in type I SCM patients with congenital scoliosis (p<0.05). Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference between SDcranial and SDcaudal in type I SCM patients with congenital scoliosis (p>0.05); however, SDcranial was significantly smaller than SDcaudal in Group 2.Our study provides the first MRI characterization of the morphometric features of type I SCM, and our findings will help orthopedic surgeons in better navigating the surgical field in corrective surgery of congenital scoliosis of type I SCM patients.",

Pediatric patients with hand injuries referred from the emergency department were evaluated retrospectively. Age and gender of the patients, timing, etiology, mechanism of hand trauma, localization of the injury, diagnoses of the patients, and hospitalization rates were reviewed. Amongst the 310 pediatric patients evaluated, 31 patients (10%) experienced injury related to public exercise equipment. Within this group of patients, most were between 5 to 9 years of age, and all injuries were blunt and crush type. Lacerations and fractures were the main diagnoses. Complex injuries that required inpatient care were reported in 19.3% of the patients. Public exercise equipment-related injuries are increasingly prevalent in pediatric hand traumas. Preventive actions such as shielding the moving parts should be taken to reduce these rates.",

Average duration of non-union was 59 (range: 12 to 156) months. Fixation was achieved with intramedullary nailing in 3 patients and plates in 3. One case was lost to follow-up at the third postoperative month. The remaining five patients were followed up for an average of 37 (range: 12 to 53) months.In four cases, union was achieved with a single operation at an average of 4.4 months. A secondary intervention for grafting was required for one patient for inadequate consolidation of the proximal bone-graft interface. Mean radiographic humeral length difference was 3.6 (range: 1 to 7) cm. Average elbow range of motion was 130 (range: 100 to 145), shoulder flexion 167.5 (range: 165 to 170), shoulder abduction 172.5 (range: 170 to 180), internal rotation 75 (range: 70 to 80), and external rotation 92.5 (range: 80 to 100) degrees. Mean DASH score was 10 (range: 5 to 19). According to the Tang system, 3 patients had excellent and 2 good clinical evaluations. Radiologic evaluation revealed four excellent and one fair result. No donor site morbidity was detected.Our results suggest that vascularized fibular grafting is an effective treatment option for the reconstruction of humeral diaphyseal non-unions.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the relationship between morphometric parameters such as height, weight, and body mass index with the development of the Trendelenburg gait following the Hardinge approach, which is one of the most commonly used approaches in total hip arthroplasty.The study included 59 patients (43 women, 16 men; mean age 55 years; range 37 to 74 years) who underwent total hip arthroplasty via the Hardinge approach for primary coxarthrosis. The patients were examined postoperatively at 15 days, and at the end of the first and third months. The mean follow-up period was 24.3 months (range 12 to 37 months). The height, weight, and body mass index values of the patients with and without a positive Trendelenburg sign were compared.The Trendelenburg sign was positive in 19 patients (32.2%) following total hip arthroplasty with the Hardinge approach and persisted for a mean of 8.3 months (range 4-14 months). Patients with a positive Trendelenburg sign had a mean height of 157.4 cm (range 151 to 173 cm), mean weight of 82.5 kg (range 70 to 108 kg), and mean body mass index of 33.2 kg/m(2) (range 25.4 to 30.5 kg/m(2)). The corresponding figures in patients without a Trendelenburg sign were as follows: 166.3 cm (range 158 to 180 cm), 79.4 kg (range 72 to 94 kg), and 28.7 kg/m(2) (range 21.6 to 30.5 kg/m(2)). There was no significant difference between the two patient groups with respect to weight, but height and body mass index showed highly significant differences (p<0.0001).Based on our finding that patients having a significantly shorter height and greater body mass index sustained Trendelenburg positivity for quite a long time, we recommend that these two factors be taken into consideration in the preoperative evaluation of patients for total hip arthroplasty with the Hardinge approach. Thus, the use of the Hardinge approach in total hip arthroplasty may not be convenient in short subjects having borderline obesity.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare 2 methods of ulnar variance (UV) measurement (the perpendicular method and the circular method) and to determine whether UV changed based on the demographic characteristics (sex and age). METHODS UV was measured on bilateral wrist radiographs of 124 patients (62 men, 62 women; mean age=48.5 years; range=18-79 years) who had no history of trauma, congenital wrist anomaly, previous wrist surgery, and wrist osteoarthritis by a single radiologist with 4 years of experience. All measurements were made on standardized radiographic images using 2 methods: the perpendicular method and the circular method. All the patients were then divided into groups based on sex and age, and the study population was determined by selecting a similar number of patients for each sex and age group. RESULTS The mean UV of the right and left wrists was measured as 0.33 (range=-4.3 to 5.7) mm by the perpendicular method and as 0.034 (range=-5 to 5.7) mm by the circular method. A significant difference was determined between the 2 measurement methods (p<0.001). There was a statistically significant difference between sex and UV values in the left wrist measurements by both methods (p<0.05). A significant correlation was found between the UV and age in both right and left side measurements, indicating a statistically significant difference between the methods (p<0.001). CONCLUSION The results of our study demonstrated significant differences in the UV measurement between the 2 methods. Furthermore, UV measurement may change based on age and sex. These differences should be considered in the treatment planning of patients with wrist disorders. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

The common pathologic finding is a thick fibrotic band extending from epiphysis to metaphysis on one side of the bone. The tethering effect of the fibrotic band around the growth plate is thought to be the main etiology for the development and progression of the deformity. FFCD mostly affects the proximal tibia and the distal femur. The literature contains different treatment options. Here, we present the case of a 20-month-old girl with FFCD on the medial side of the distal femur causing varus deformity. Our treatment protocol included excision of the fibrotic band from the medial side and application of a two-hole plate for guided growth on the lateral side of the distal femur. Deformity correction was achieved rapidly with no complications. A literature review is also presented along with pathologic and magnetic resonance imaging findings.",

    "abstract": "We, herein, presented a rare case of bilateral brachial artery infiltration by tumoral calcinosis located on both elbows. A 58-yearold man presented with a history of painless, palpable solid mass restricting the range of motion of both elbows. These masses were located on the anterior aspect of the elbows and gradually enlarged. After clinical, laboratory and radiological examinations, tumoral calcinosis was suspected, and excisional biopsy was planned for a definite diagnosis. Surgery was first performed on the left elbow. The median nerve was found to be compressed but not infiltrated by the mass. Interestingly, the brachial artery was totally infiltrated throughout the entire mass. Occlusion was observed in the brachial artery located within the mass. The tumor on the left elbow, 8.5 × 5.5 × 2.5 cm in size, was totally excised with approximately 12-cm brachial artery segment. The artery was resected until the healthy tissue was reached. The defect was reconstructed with saphenous vein graft obtained from the ipsilateral lower extremity. The same surgical procedure was performed on the right elbow after 3 months. The tumor size on the right elbow was 7 × 3.5 × 1.7 cm. Approximately 15-cm brachial artery segment was excised, and the defect was reconstructed with saphenous vein graft. Tumoral calcinosis is a rare benign condition that can be located in close relationship with neurovascular structures. In such cases, detailed neurologic and vascular examination, including imaging modalities, for arterial flow is essential to establish a more accurate surgical plan and avoid any unexpected situation during surgery.",

The mean follow-up was 28 (14-39) months. Patients were categorized into 2 groups on the basis of whether calcium phosphate cement (CPC) was used. Group 1 had 37 patients with CPC (38 calcaneal fractures) and group 2 had 47 patients without CPC (47 calcaneal fractures). In the clinical assessment, the American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Society (AOFAS) hind foot score and the Maryland Foot Score (MFS) were used at the final follow-up.

    "abstract": "Progranulin (PGRN) is a growth factor that has antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive, and chondroprotective effects. It blocks Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) signal pathway by binding its receptor. Recently, it has been claimed that PGRN may be overexpressed in patients with Osteoarthritis (OA). However, these patients tend to be obese and obesity also may be one of the factors that affect PGRN levels. The aim of this study was to compare the PGRN levels of patients with Knee OA (KOA) with that of healthy controls by eliminating the effect of obesity and to evaluate PGRN-to-Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) ratio in KOA, both of which were investigated first in literature by this study.A total of 80 individuals (40 patients with KOA and 40 healthy controls) were included in this study. The patients and controls were divided into two groups according to their Body Mass Indexes (BMI): nonobese (BMI between 18.5 and 24.9) and obese (BMI of 30 or higher). Each of the groups included 20 subjects and had an equal number of men and women. Blood samples were obtained from all participants, and the serum PGRN and TNF-α levels were measured using commercial ELISA kits.There was no difference among groups in terms of age (P = 0.416) and gender distribution. There was no statistical difference among study groups with regard to serum PGRN levels. Serum TNF-α levels were significantly higher in obese controls (P < 0.001) and nonobese patients (P = 0.003) compared to that of nonobese healthy controls. Correspondingly, serum PGRN-to-TNF-α ratio was considerably lower in obese controls (P < 0.001) and nonobese patients (P < 0.001) by comparison with that of nonobese healthy controls.We determined that both obesity and KOA increased serum TNF-α levels and concordantly decreased serum PGRNto- TNF-α ratio. The results of the study suggest that the activation of the PGRN pathway and/or the inhibition of the TNFα pathway may be essential in terms of the reestablishment of the disrupted inflammatory balance in patients with KOA.Level III, Diagnostic study.",

    "abstract": "Complex tibial plateau fractures in elderly patients exhibiting severe osteoporosis and articular surface collapse are challenging. Decision-making is difficult when the posterior column is involved. Open reduction and internal fixation of complex tibial plateau fractures in patients with severe osteoporosis are prone to failure. In this paper, we describe a new method for the maintenance of the articular surface of complex tibial plateau fractures in elderly patients. An anterior horizontal rafting plate (3.5-mm-thick reconstruction and locking plate [Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA]) is placed via conventional posteromedial and anterolateral incisions. The plate is inserted between the anterior bony surface of the proximal tibia and the subpatellar fat pad; plate positioning is checked under direct vision. The patient is encouraged to begin functional recovery soon after operation. Progressive weight-bearing begins at 10 weeks postoperatively and is gradually increased during fracture healing. Clinical follow-up was performed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, 6 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. No articular collapse or fragment displacement was evident on three-dimensional computed tomography performed 6 months after surgery. The knee range of motion was 5-130º at the last follow-up (4 years after surgery). This technique may be a good option for treating complex tibial plateau fractures, especially in elderly patients with severe osteoporosis.",

Level of the fractures was categorized as the proximal third, middle third, and distal third of the diaphysis, and then all the fractures were classified according to the AO/OTA classification system. The trend of incidence of PORNP was investigated. All the operations were performed by a single surgeon. The recovery time of PORNP was also recorded.There were 13 cases of proximal third, 67 cases of middle third, and 38 cases of distal third fracture. Based on AO/OTA classification, there were 29 cases of A1-type, 23 cases of A2-type, 42 cases of A3-type, 17 cases of B2-type, 3 cases of B3-type, and 4 cases of C2-type fracture. The overall incidence of PORNP was 11% (13 cases). All the PORNP cases fully recovered within 10.3 ± 10.4 weeks (range = 1 - 44) with conservative treatment. Incidence of PORNP significantly decreased with increase in surgical experience (P = 0.009). The incidence of radial nerve palsy was not significantly related to the level of the fracture (P = 0.199). The incidence of radial nerve palsy was not significantly related with the fracture pattern according to AO/OTA classification (P = 0.659).Evidence from this study has shown that the incidence of PORNP following the posterior triceps splitting approach for the treatment of humeral shaft fractures is significantly associated with the surgeon's experience.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

A simple modified Charnley external fixator was used for stabilization of the osteotomy. Based on the Ahlback classification, 15 knees had grade I, six knees had grade II, and two knees had grade III osteoarthritis.

The mean functional score increased from 52.3+/-18.8 (range 10 to 80) to 75.6+/-18.5 (range 35 to 100) at final analysis (p<0.001). The knee and functional scores did not differ significantly between three groups of patients having a different range of postoperative tibiofemoral angle (p>0.05).Our results show that the alignment obtained after high tibial osteotomy does not influence knee and functional scores provided that it is within an acceptable range.",

The poorly defined calcific deposition was found in plain radiograph. The arthroscopic debridement of the calcification and screw removal from the distal femur was performed due to resist to conservative treatment with analgesics. After operation, the symptoms were resolved completely. The arthroscopic debridement of calcific periarthritis should be considered in specific cases, such as refractory cases with conservative management during 4-6 weeks.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyse the variability among Turkish spinal surgeons in the management of thoracolumbar fractures by carrying out a web survey.An invitation text and web-link of the survey were sent to the members of the Turkish Spine Society mail group. A fictitious spine trauma vignette, a 23 year-old male with a L1 burst fracture, was presented and 25 questions were asked to participants. Variability of answers in a given question was assessed with the Index of Qualitative Variation (IQV). Questions with high IQV values (>%80) were selected to evaluate the relation between participant factors (speciality, age, degree and experience level of the surgeon, type of the work centre and volume of the trauma patients).Sixty-four (88%) among the 73 participating surgeons completed the survey. 45 (70%) of them were orthopaedic surgeons and 19 (30%) were neurosurgeons. 11 questions had very high variability (IQV ≥ 0.80), 5 had high variability (0.58-0.75) and 2 had low variability (IQV≤0.20). The question with the highest variability was related to the use of brace after surgery (IQV = 0.93). Following one was about the selection of fixation levels (IQV = 0.91). Neurosurgeons were more likely to use brace postoperatively and professors were less likely to perform decompression.This survey shows that thoracolumbar spine trauma practice significantly varies among Turkish spine surgeons. Surgeons' characteristics affected some specific answers. Lack of enough knowledge about spine trauma care, fracture classifications and surgical techniques and/or ethical factors may be other reasons for this variability.",

The identified manuscripts were classified according to the level of evidence, number of citations, subject, publication journals, time period until publication, and citation index of the journal.Between 2008 and 2014, a total of 561 presentations were made, comprising 278 posters and 283 oral presentations. Of these presentations, 164 (29.2%) were published as a manuscript. Of the published articles, 114 were originated from oral presentations (40.2% of total) and 50 from poster presentations (18% of total). A significantly higher number of oral presentations compared to poster presentations were converted into publications (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was determined between the conversion rates of oral and poster presentations in 2014. The mean time from presentation at the congress to publication was 15.4 months (range: -144 months to +62 months). The mean impact factor of the journals at the time of publication increased for each congress. Evidence level of presented articles was significantly higher in the 2014 congress when compared to previous congresses.The rate of conversion into publication was higher for oral presentations, which can be attributed to the fact that studies with a higher level of evidence are more likely to have been presented as oral presentations. Based on these study results, authors of oral presentations at congresses should be encouraged to increase the rate of conversion into publication.",

In the present case, we report a 48 -year-old woman with recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome due to a MSC. This report showed that MSC can be detected at deeper locations than the regions described in the literature.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the effect of transverse atlantal ligament (TAL) integrity on clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with unilateral sagittal split fracture (USSF) of the C1 lateral mass (LM).Twenty-six consecutive patients (16 men and 10 women; mean age: 52 years (range: 32-69)) with C1 LM USSF were included in this study. Sixteen were TAL injury group (nine of type I injuries and seven of type II injuries according to Dickman's classification) and ten were TAL intact group. All cases were conservatively treated with a rigid brace for TAL intact or by halo-vest stabilization for TAL injury for three months. The mean follow-up was 16 months (range, 12-47 months). The results were compared with radiological assessment of fracture healing, LM displacement and Neck visual analog scale.At the last follow-up, for TAL intact group, total LM displacement (LMD), unilateral LMD of fracture side, atlanto-dental interval, basion-dental interval, clivus canal angle, and atlanto-occipital joint axis angle were maintained compared to initial presentation. However, for TAL injury group, all radiological parameters were worsened. The worsening of radiological parameters was more severe in type I injury than type II injury except for total LMD and unilateral LMD. Neck visual analog scale significantly decreased and patient's satisfaction was higher in TAL intact group compared to TAL injury group.Conservative treatment for USSF of C1 LM with TAL injury failed to achieve healing of the fracture, which resulted in lateral displacement of C1 LM. This caused coronal and sagittal malalignment of occipitocervical junction, resulting in unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. Our results suggest that early surgical stabilization should be considered in USSF of C1 LM with TAL injury, especially type I injury. However, conservative treatment may be sufficient for a USSF of the C1 LM with TAL intact.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "Extraskeletal osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor of soft tissue characterized by osteoid production and has a very low prevalence, comprising approximately 4% of all osteosarcomas and about 1% of all soft tissue sarcomas, and a total of about 350 cases have been reported until now. Heterotopic ossification is a pathological finding of bony tissue in soft tissue regions such as muscle, skin and subcutaneous tissue. We report a case of an 86-year-old woman with a history of total hip arthroplasty (THA), in which open reduction and internal fixation were done for periprosthetic femoral Fracture. The ossified lesion misdiagnosed as heterotopic ossification initially was diagnosed as extraskeletal osteosarcoma at 6 months after the surgery. Both extraskeletal osteosarcoma and heterotopic ossification have no definite symptoms, but show radiopaque shadows on simple radiograph. Therefore, careful attention and thorough evaluation with multiple imaging tests may be necessary for the differential diagnosis of these entities.",

    "abstract": "Objective:The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and radiological results of our high tibial osteotomy technique combining fixator-assisted nailing and subtubercle tibial osteotomy in varus malalignment. Methods:This was a retrospective study of a consecutive series of 32 knees in 32 patients ('2 follow-up loss' 12 males and 18 females; mean age at the time of operation: 50.6±7.8(36-62) years) operated on between 2014 and 2016.Radiographic and clinical measurements were assessed pre-and postoperatively.Kolmogorov-Smirnov, paired t and Wilcoxon rank tests were used in the statistical analyses. Results:The mean follow-up period was 36.1±8.15(31-53) months, the mean duration of the hospital stay was 3.6±0.1 (2-6) days, and the mean Kellgren-Lawrence score was 2.4±0.6 (2-4).Time to bony union was an average of 16.17 (12-29) weeks.Compared to the preoperative mechanical medial proximal tibial angle, femorotibial angle and mechanical axis deviation measurements, all the postoperative values showed significant changes (p<0.01).However, there was no statistical difference between the preoperative and postoperative tibial slopes (p>0.05), and the postoperative Caton-Deschamps index did not show a meaningful change (p>0.05).The postoperative visual analog scale, Knee Society Score, and Modified Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Scoring System measures showed significant improvement compared to the preoperative values (p<0.01).The postoperative walking distance increased to 1137.50±845.1 meters, from 359.4±306.2meters (p<0.01). Conclusion:This percutaneous technique is minimally invasive, corrects the alignment in two planes, and does not affect patellar height.We believe that this technique could be a promising alternative to other knee preserving surgeries in correcting varus malalignment.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in lesser trochanter shapes in relation to femoral rotations and to develop a reference value for the determination of clinically relevant malrotation of the femur.Patients who underwent computed tomography angiography between January 2009 and July 2018 were identified based on a review of their institutional medical records. Thereafter, three-dimensional (3D) images of the whole femur for a total of 860 patients were obtained from their tomographic sections. The distance between the lateral outer cortex of the femur and the most medial point of the lesser trochanter with the femur in neutral rotation was measured and set as the reference value. Then, the same distance was measured at 5°, 10°, 15°, and 20° of femoral internal rotation and at 5°, 10°, 15°, 20°, and 25° of femoral external rotation. To avoid magnification errors, the reference values were divided by each measured value at these different rotation angles and then multiplied by 100.The mean distances between the lateral cortex and the most medial point of the lesser trochanter at 5°, 10°, 15°, and 20° of femoral internal rotation were 97%, 93%, 90%, and 88%, respectively, of those measured with the femur in neutral rotation. The same distances at 5°, 10°, 15°, 20°, and 25° of femoral external rotation were 102%, 104%, 106%, 107%, and 108%, respectively, of those measured with the femur in neutral rotation. There was no statistically significant difference between the measured distances in males and females (p>0.05). However, significant differences were observed among each measured distance at different angles of femoral rotation (p<0.01).The surgeon should be aware of the possible femoral malrotation if the distance between the lateral cortex of the femur and the most medial point of the lesser trochanter on the operated side is more than 106% or less than 90% of that measured with the femur in neutral rotation on the healthy side.Level IV, Diagnostic study.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether orthopedic and traumatology residents who are undergoing training achieve competence in surgical techniques after completion of their specialization and to determine whether there are significant differences between the responses of residents from accredited and nonaccredited institutions.A total of 131 orthopedics and traumatology residents from nine institutions in the İstanbul province answered the questionnaire during the morning training meeting. In addition to basic demographic data, level of seniority, equipment competence, and theoretical and practical training, the residents were asked about their opinion on what type of surgeries they could perform after their specialization, considering the surgery and follow-up of the case as well as the complications occurring during this period. The residents responded to questions on 46 surgeries under the main headings of trauma, arthroscopy, arthroplasty, spine, pediatric orthopedics, hand surgery, deformity, and bone and soft tissue tumors. In addition to descriptive statistical methods, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey's multiple comparison test, and chi square test were used to evaluate the data. The significance level for the results was set at p<0.05.In total, 131 orthopedics and traumatology residents answered the questionnaire. Furthermore, 53 (40.5%) specialization students were employed at accredited institutions and 78 (59.5%) at nonaccredited institutions. According to the responses, case presentations, article-writing sessions, and in-province meetings held regularly at accredited institutions showed a significant difference compared to non-accredited institutions (p<0.05), and the residents at the accredited institutions benefited significantly more from the availability of books and electronic media in gaining theoretical knowledge (p<0.05). When the responses of the residents from accredited and nonaccredited institutions regarding 46 different surgeries were compared, a significant difference was found in 17 of them (p<0.05). There was a significant difference between the averages of residents' responses on the surgical fields they have interest for (p<0.05). It was determined that the residents believed that they could mostly perform surgeries in the fields of trauma, followed by arthroplasty, deformity, arthroscopy, pediatric orthopedics, hand surgery, and spine and tumor surgery. According to their level of seniority, a significant difference was found between the averages of residents' opinions regarding their surgical skill levels (p=0.02).We believe that it would be beneficial for the trainers to take necessary precautions to increase the skill levels of the residents of orthopedic surgery. Accreditation significantly contributes to the standardization of education as well as quality improvement. Further action should be taken to increase the number of accredited clinics.",

The patient demographics, physical examination findings (pain and hip range of motion [ROM]), standard anteroposterior and Löwenstein lateral hip radiographs, and hip arthrography data were retrospectively collected. The arthrographies were performed immediately before the surgery under general anesthesia. The patients were staged according to the Catterall and Herring classifications and examined in terms of head-at-risk signs before the study. Four sets of patient files were established based on the aforementioned data, with each child in a randomized and blinded order. Ten consultant pediatric orthopedic surgeons randomly assessed the patient files on 4 separate occasions (Set 1 vs Set 2 and Set 3 vs Set 4), with a minimum time interval of 4 weeks. In the first and second sets, the demographic and clinical information, including the age, gender, hip ROM, and hip radiographs, were presented. In the third and fourth sets, hip arthrography was presented in addition to the data from Set 1 and Set 2. The observers were instructed to choose the best treatment options. The percent agreement (PA) and Gwet's AC1 statistics were used to establish a relative level of agreement among the observers.The mean intra-observer reliabilities ranged from fair to moderate after adding the hip arthrography data (Gwet's AC1 = 0.36 for Set 1 vs Set 2 and 0.42 for Set 3 vs Set 4). The mean PA was 56.6% (range = 29.8% to 78.7%) with a Gwet's AC1 value of 0.51 (range: 0.21 to 0.77) between Set 1 and Set 3 (moderate intra-observer reliability). The decision for the treatment strategy was changed in 43.4% of the patients. For inter-observer reliability, Gwet's AC1 was computed as 0.48 (moderate reliability). The correlation between the intra-observer reliability and stage progression was not significant (p>0.05) for any of the subgroups. Thus, there is a negative correlation with the disease progression.Hip arthrography seems to have a significant role in the treatment decision making for children with LCPD, especially in the advanced stages of the disease.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "Objective This study aimed to evaluate the thickness of the remaining patellar bone stock following extra-articular knee resection (EKR) preserving the extensor mechanism in human cadaveric knee joints. Methods A total of 14 human cadaveric knee joints (8 men and 2 women) were dissected, and the patellar thickness from the joint capsule insertion to the anterior cortex of the patella was measured using an electronic caliper. The mean age of the cadavers was 37 years (range=28-50). Measurements were performed by an anatomist and an orthopedic surgeon. As the total number of the cadavers was not enough to show the patellar thickness with sampling (sex and age), we endeavored to supplement the content with magnetic resonance images (MRI). Accordingly, the patellar bone thickness was also measured on axial MRI scans of 100 adult and 25 pediatric knees of patients (71 women and 54 men; mean age=36 years; age range=7-67 years) admitted to our hospital in whom meniscal tears were suspected. The rate of specimens with remaining patellar thickness of less than 10 mm after presumed resection was evaluated. The macroscopic measurements in cadavers and MRI measurements in adult knees were compared statistically. Results The mean thickness of the residual patellar bone of the cadaver dissections following a presumed EKR preserving the extensor mechanism was 8.2 mm (range=3.4-15.8). Additionally, in 71.4% (10/14) of the cadaveric knees, the thickness of residual patellar bone was less than 10 mm. In MRI scans, the average thickness of residual patella after presumed resection was 8.6 mm (range: 3.6-16) in adult knees and 6.9 mm (range: 3.4-10) in pediatric knees, and the residual patellar thickness less than 10 mm after presumed resection was determined in 72% of all MRI scans. Macroscopic measurements in cadaveric knees were statistically similar to MRI scan measurements in adult knees (p=0.765, Mann-Whitney U test). Conclusion Evidence from this study revealed that the thickness of the remaining patellar bone stock after EKR preserving the extensor mechanism may be low. A preoperative assessment with MRI can guide the surgeon to select the appropriate method for knee resection in order to prevent from the complications of resected patella.",

METHODS In this study, three experimental groups, which consisted of vancomycin (subgroups containing 1 g, 2 g, and 3 g vancomycin), daptomycin (subgroups containing 0.5 g, 1 g, and 1.5 g daptomycin), and tigecycline (subgroups containing 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg tigecycline) and one control group without antibiotics were used. Using a standardized protocol, all antibiotic loaded bone cements were prepared. For each antibiotic group, including the control group, 10 samples were tested. All samples were biomechanically tested in terms of compressive strength and tensile strength. RESULTS Compression tests showed that all determined antibiotic concentrations resulted in a significant decrease when compared with the control group (p 0.0011). In addition, all statistically significant results from between groups comparisons revealed higher tensile and compressive mechanical strength values for the tigecycline groups (p<0.0011). CONCLUSION Evidence from this study has demonstrated that tigecycline loaded bone cement may have no mechanical disadvantage compared with vancomycin and daptomycin loaded bone cements in terms of mechanical strength when used at defined concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe the evolution of patients admitted for elective orthopaedic surgery during the immediate post-COVID-19 peak of the pandemic.This is a multi-center, observational study conducted in 8 high complexity hospitals of Catalonia, one of the highest COVID-19 incidence areas in Spain. We included patients ≥18 years of age undergoing elective surgery (total knee or hip arthroplasty, knee or hip revision arthroplasty, shoulder or knee arthroscopy, hand or wrist surgery, forefoot surgery, or hardware removal) after the COVID-19 peak (between May 5th and June 30th, 2020). The main exclusion criterion was a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 PCR within the 7 days before the surgery. The primary outcomes were postoperative complications within 60 days (+/-30) or hospital readmission due to a COVID-19 infection. Following the recommendations of the International Consensus Group (ICM), elective surgeries were re-started when the nationwide lockdown was lifted. Before the surgery, patients were contacted by phone to rule out any exposure to confirmed COVID-19 cases, a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was performed in all patients 48-72 hours before hospital admission, and they were asked to maintain home confinement until the day of the surgery.675 patients were included: 189 patients in the arthroplasty group (28%) and 486 in the ambulatory surgery group (72%). Mean [SD] age was 57.6 [15.3] years. The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 2.21 (SD = 2.01, Min = 0, Max = 13). A total of 84 patients (12.75%) obtained an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥ 3, showing no association between the ASA score and the risk of developing COVID-19 symptoms at follow-up (χ 2 (4) = 0.77, P = 0.94). The mean occupation rate of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients was 13% and the mean occupation rate of critical care beds for COVID-19 patients was 27% at the time of re-introducing elective surgeries. These were important rates to consider to decide when to reintroduce elective surgeries after lockdown. Surgical time, time of ischemia and intra-operative bleeding were not related with a higher risk of developing COVID-19 post-operatively (χ 2 (1) = 0.00, P = 0.98); (χ 2 (2) = 2.05, P = 0.36); (χ 2 (2) = 0.37, P = 0.83). Only 2 patients (0.3 %) presented with a suspected COVID-19 infection at follow-up. None of them presented with pneumonia or required confirmation by a reverse transcription PCR assay. Hospital re-admission was not needed for these patients.The risk of developing COVID-19 during the immediate post-COVID-19 peak in a region with a high incidence of COVID-19 has not been proved. These data suggest that elective orthopaedic surgeries can be resumed when assertive and strict protocols are followed.",

Surgeons often have difficulty in selecting the most appropriate treatment, especially the plating technique for internal fixation since the available femoral locking plates are made to fit the femoral lateral condyle and there is no anatomical plate for the medial condyle. We, herein, report a case of a 44-year- old female patient who suffered from an osteochondral fracture of the medial femoral condyle accompanied by medial wall fracture treated by a low-profile mesh plate contoured to fit around the fracture site. Bone union was achieved at postoperative week 12 and the patient was able to return to her normal activities. At the 16-month follow-up exam, the patient's functional and clinical outcomes were satisfactory. Her Oxford knee score was 47 points, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index scores were 2 points for pain and 5 points for physical function. We believe that the mesh plate has several advantages. This is the first report of using a mesh plate for the femur, and we were able to achieve good results. We conclude that treatment with a mesh plate can be applied in well- selected patients with medial femoral condyle osteochondral fracture and has the potential to be applied to the treatment of fractures in various regions in the future.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes and complications, such as tibiofemoral instability and recurrence of valgus deformity, of total knee arthroplasty for valgus knees with a new technique preserving the deep layer of the medial collateral ligament.In this study 33 (4 male and 29 female) patients, and a total of 36 (26 knees with osteoarthritis and 10 with rheumatoid arthritis) knees with a standing femorotibial angle (FTA) of <170° were included. Posterior Stabilized (PS) implants were used in 34 knees, rotating hinged knee implants were used in 2 knees. The procedures were carried out by a single surgeon protecting the deep layer of the medial collateral ligament. The patients' average age at the time of the operation was 67.6 ± 12 years, and the average follow-up period was 9.0 ± 3 years (range, 4-15 years). The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) knee score, range of motion (ROM) (extension/flexion; measured in degrees), FTA (measured in degrees) and complications were investigated.The Japanese Orthopaedic Association knee score significantly improved from an average of 51 ± 12 points before the operation to 86 ± 9 points after the operation (P <0.001). The extension ROM and flexion ROM improved from, -13 ± 13° to a postoperative average of -2 ± 4°, and 115 ± 25° to a postoperative average of 125 ± 18° respectively (P <0.001). The standing FTA significantly improved from 158 ± 9° to an average of 173 ± 2° after the operation (P <0.001). Thirty-four knees with severe valgus deformity were operated on using pos- terior stabilised implants, while only two knees required constrained implants. During follow-up, no complications, such as tibiofemoral instability, recurrence of valgus deformity, patellar necrosis, deep infection, wound problems, or peroneal nerve paralysis were observed.This study has shown us that after performing TKA while preserving the d-MCL for valgus knee deformity good clinical results were obtained and no complications were observed.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

An initial e-mail including the electronic survey followed by three reminder e-mails was sent to 110 members, and then reminder telephone calls were made.The survey response rate was 66/110 (60%). In recent years, a definitive trend to surgical treatment was not seen 98%, 77%, 39%, and 88% of the responders in the closed humerus, forearm, femur, and tibia mid-shaft fractures, respectively. Neither the years of expertise nor the intensity of daily pediatric patients of the participants did not affect the treatment trend in any fracture scenarios. The patient's age was the most cited factor influencing the responders' decisions on whether conservative or surgical treatment would be performed in each fracture scenario. The most cited lowest age limits for surgical treatment inclosed mid-shaft fractures of the humerus, forearm, femur, and tibia, were the adolescent age group, 10-12 years, six years, and ten years, respectively.This is the first study assessing the daily clinical practice of members of TSCO in the management of closed, isolated, non- complicated middle-third diaphyseal long bone fractures in children just before the covid-19 pandemic started. A marked tendency toward surgical treatment is seen in femur mid-shaft fractures, followed by forearm mid-shaft fractures up to a certain level. The patient's age is the main determinant of the responders' decisions on the type of treatment in closed, isolated, non-complicated middle-third diaphyseal long bone fractures in children.",

The median at the time of surgery was 43 (17-78) years, and the median follow-up was 102 (26-288) months. All patients were treated by intralesional curettage followed by cementation with high-viscosity bone cement (polymethylmethacrylate). Complications and local recurrence rates, as well as clinical outcome scores were recorded.Five patients (5.49%) developed local recurrence at an average of 6.6 (6-9) months postoperatively. Four were treated with local wide excision and reconstruction with tumor prosthesis. One patient received recurettage and cementation. Two recurred patients were dedifferentiated into grade II chondrosarcomas in the last intervention. No major postoperative complication was identified in the series. Patients achieved an average Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scoring system of 92.4% (standard deviation 5.2; range 80-100) in the sixth postoperative month. Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scores in the recurrent patients decreased from an average of 90% to 75.3% after the final intervention.Intralesional curettage and cementation seem safe and reliable techniques with low recurrence and complication rates in treating low-grade chondrosarcomas of the appendicular skeleton. Clinical, radiological, and pathological evaluations are mandatory before surgical intervention, and a multidisciplinary approach is crucial. A strict follow-up regimen in the early postoperative period is needed and strongly recommended to detect local recurrence.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

We retrospectively evaluated 16 patients (10 females, 6 males; mean age: 43.4 years; mean follow-up: 34 months) with atlantoaxial instability who underwent C1-C2 fusion by reduction and sublaminar spiral silk knotting. All patients underwent open reduction, bounding both laminae with thick spiral silk instead of wiring and arthrodesis with autografting. Reduction rates, screw position and fusion rates were evaluated using computed tomography. Preoperative mean atlantodental interval (ADI) was 8 (range: 6 to 11) mm and postoperative ADI was 2.1 (range: 0.5 to 2.5) mm. There was no dural or spinal cord injury. Complete reduction was observed in all cases. Fusion was unsuccessful in 1 case (6.25%). Postoperative mean flexion ADI was 10 mm and mean extension ADI was 1 mm. Graft separation between C1-C2 was observed in slice tomographic examination in one patient. Malposition was observed in 2 screws (4%). The sublaminar silk knotting technique appears to provide safe anatomical reduction. As this method is cheap and simple and does not require extra implantation, loosen, create neurologic compromise or cause radiologic crowding, it can be considered an alternative surgical technique to sublaminar wiring.",

Patient results were evaluated based on healing time, lower extremity alignment and knee functions. Average follow-up was 2.8 (range: 1.1 to 5.6) years for the 27 of the 32 patients who completed follow-up. All osteotomy sites healed at an average of 4.0 (range: 3.5 to 5.0) months. Average preoperative varus knee deformity was 19.6° (range: 14° to 26°). Immediate postoperative varus knee deformity was an average of 0.4° (range: valgus 2° to varus 3°) (p<0.001). At the final follow-up, the varus knee deformity was an average of 1.5° (range: valgus 1° to varus 3°) (p<0.001). Satisfactory knee function in patients improved from 0% to 93% (p<0.001). There were no serious complications. Retrograde locked nailing appears to be an excellent alternative for the treatment of varus malunion of femoral supracondylar fractures after CBP treatment.

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, In a recent issue of Acta Orthopaedica et Traumatologica Turcica, we read with great interest the article by Zehir et al. entitled ‘Red cell distribution width and mortality in patients with hip fracture treated with partial prosthesis’.[1] They evaluated the outcome of patients with hip fracture treated with partial hip replacement, and investigated the relationship between red cell distribution width (RDW) and mortality in patients who underwent partial hip replacement surgery. They concluded that there was a significant correlation between elevated RDW level and mortality. We believe that these findings will act as a guide for further studies, and we thank the authors for their contribution to the literature. However, we think that some points should be discussed. As a parameter, RDW is provided by automated hematology analyzers and reported as a component of complete blood count. It is reported as an index of heterogeneity in size of circulating erythrocytes.[2] Some studies have reported that higher RDW levels are associated with poor prognosis in coronary bypass surgery, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, heart failure, and in elderly subjects.[3] RDW levels may also reflect nutritional deficiencies (i.e. iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid), ethnicity, neurohumoral activation, inflammatory diseases, recent transfusion, renal and hepatic dysfunction, thyroid disease, bone marrow dysfunction, chronic or acute systemic inflammation, and the use of some medications.[4–7] Patients having these conditions are usually excluded from the studies about the prognostic and predictor value of RDW.[2] Hence, it would be better if the authors of this study had defined all of these factors in their study group. In conclusion, elevated RDW levels in elderly patients with hip fracture who receive a partial prosthesis may be associated with mortality, as presented in the current study. It has been shown that each 1–point increase in RDW level was related to an increase in 1–year mortality in hospitalized patients.[8] However, this may be affected by many factors, and hence, RDW level itself without other parameters may not provide sufficient information to clinicians on the mortality risk in patients treated with partial hip replacement surgery. We believe that these findings will act as a guide for further studies that will show the association between RDW and mortality in patients with hip fracture treated with partial prosthesis.",

Eight pairs of normal cadaveric ulnae were analyzed. The ulnar Cartesian coordinate system was standardized using a user-defined coordinate systems feature. DAC was defined by the best-fit curvature of serial apexes in the posterior border in axial cross-sections along the ulna, whereas the best-fit curvature was obtained using polynomials interpolation method. DAC apexes in three different planes were determined by calculating the second derivative value of curve function, and subsequently, DAC angulations were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance with repeated measures with significance level set as 0.001. The average ulnar length was 246±15 mm (224-274 mm). The average ratios of dorsal apex, varus apex, and edge point were 23±3% (17-27%), 33±4% (27-43%), and 10±1% (8-13%), respectively, relative to the ulnar length.

We found no significant differences between left and right ulnae or between male and female ulnae. Dorsal apexes and angulations are important landmarks for surgeons when applying plates and attempting total elbow replacement surgery.

Limb-sparing surgery was used for 4 patients with malignant tibia tumors. All patients were male, with an average age of 39.5 years (range: 34-46 years). Mean length of the resected tibia segment was 135 mm (range: 120-150 mm). The defects were primarily reconstructed with bone cement and locked plate until completion of the medical treatment of the tumor. The bone transport was made through locked plate, and the docking site was grafted at the final stage. Mean follow-up period was 49.75 months (range: 71-22 months). Mean distraction index was 1148 mm/days (range: 1130-1175 mm/days), and mean external fixation time was 167 days (range: 152-187 days). According to Paley, functional results were excellent in 2 cases and good in the other 2 cases. Radiological results were excellent in all cases. Two major and 2 minor complications were observed. In this method, stable internal fixation and active usage of extremities are provided until biological reconstruction, and possible wound problems can be completely eliminated during the duration of medical treatment of the tumor.",

Twenty-five consecutive adult patients with poliomyelitic sequelae of unilateral dysfunction of both knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion were treated. Patients had an average shorthening of 5.4 cm (range: 4.5-6.5 cm) on the affected side. The tibia was osteotomized and lengthened with external fixators, which were then replaced with plates supplemented with bone grafting. Ankle arthrodesis was performed concomitantly. Protected weight bearing was advised until bony union was achieved. Gait function was evaluated with Functional Mobility Scale and modified Mazur Scoring System. Twenty-one patients were followed up for an average of 4.3 years (range: 2.0-8.2 years). External fixation was applied for an average of 6.2 weeks (range: 5-8 weeks). Complete bone healing was achieved in all patients and the average union time was 4 months (range: 3.5-4.5 months) after plating. At final follow-up, gait function significantly improved according to Functional Mobility Scale and modified Mazur Scoring System scores (p< 0.001 for both). The tibial lengthening with ankle arthrodesis appears to be an efficient alternative for treating poliomyelitic patients with unilateral dysfunction of both knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop a disease-specific multidimensional hallux valgus (HV) scale, as well as to establish the validity and reliability thereof. The 14-item Multidimensional Nil Hallux Valgus Scale was developed. The scale has a score range of 0-60, with higher score indicating increased HV symptoms, complaints, and functional disorder. Among the patients referred to our clinic with HV diagnosis based on anterior-posterior non-weight-bearing radiography of the affected foot, 129 feet of 66 patients (63 bilateral, 3 unilateral) were included in the study. In clinical evaluations of these HV patients, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Hallux Metatarsophalangeal Interphalangeal Joints Scale (AOFAS-MTF-IF), Manchester Scale, and Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) were used to test the validity and reliability of the new scale. From factor analyses, it was observed that the items clustered in 5 factors, which explained 73.2% of the variance. Floor and ceiling effects were observed to be within normal limits (floor effect: 3.1%; ceiling effect: 0.8%). The Cronbach's alpha level related with the overall internal consistency of the scale was estimated as 83.3%, and the Cronbach's alpha for the subheadings of the scale varied between 33.9% and 74.2%. High correlation was observed regarding test-retest reliability of the scale. This newly developed scale allows for the holistic evaluation of HV including the condition-specific parameters and is a valid and reliable scale that can be conveniently used by health care professionals.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the effects of cam and pincer morphology on the hamstring injury rate, treatment duration, and recurrence number of elite young male football players.Seventy-five elite young male football players were included in this study. Participants were evaluated physically and radiologically for femoroacetabular impingement during pre-season or pre-transfer routine health examinations. Athletes' injury and treatment data for 6 seasons were then collected prospectively and evaluated retrospectively. Athletes were divided into 2 groups: patients with cam and pincer morphology (group 1) and those without (group 2). Both groups were compared regarding the number of hamstring injuries, treatment duration, and recurrence numbers.The mean age was 20.35 ± 1.37 in group 1 (n = 23) and 18.92 ± 1.48 in group 2 (n = 52). There was a significant difference between the 2 groups regarding age and body weight. The rate of hamstring injuries in group 1 was higher than in group 2, and this difference was statistically significant. Although the recurrence rate (group 1-35.7%, group 2-27.8%) and treatment duration (group 1: 18.4 ± 10.1 days, group 2: 12.1 ± 6.2) in group 1 were higher than in group 2, there was no statistical significance between 2 groups.The present study has shown that hamstring injuries are more common in elite young male football players with cam and pincer morphology than those without. Therefore, further studies of musculoskeletal dysfunctions of femoroacetabular origin should be considered in the programs prepared to prevent and treat hamstring injuries.Level III, Prognostic Study.",

Three-dimensional printed models of the distal radius fractures were created using 2-dimensional computed tomography scan files in Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine format, processed with the 3-dimensional Slicer software, and segmented, creating a 3-dimensional printed model in Standard Triangle Language format. Threedimensional models were printed using fused deposition modeling (FDM) type 3D printer Zortrax M200Plus using polylactic acid material on a scale of 1 : 1. Twenty observers were invited into the study.Intra- and inter-observer reliability was analyzed using Fleiss' kappa statistics. Overall kappa values for both groups in interobserver agreement range from 0.113 to 0.283 and in intra-observer agreement from 0.25 to 0.545. Generally, inter-observer agreement increased with additional 3-dimensional printed models from slight to fair, and intra-observer agreement increased from fair to moderate. Surgeons' opinions about 3-dimensional printed models with Likert scale-type questions show positive overall results ranging from 8.3± 2.1 to 8.6 ± 1.4.This study has shown that the inter- and intra-observer agreement with the addition of a 3-dimensional printed model for the evaluation of the distal radius fractures of Association For Osteo synth esis/ Ortho pedic Trauma Association C type for classification, fractures morphology, and preoperative planning tends to increase; however, improvements for an inter-observer agreement remain fair.Level III Diagnostic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare radiological and clinical results between early (≤3 weeks) and late (>3 weeks) removal of pins in patients treated with the stepwise percutaneous leverage technique for radial neck fractures.37 patients (aged 3-15) who underwent fixation with stepwise percutaneous leverage technique for Judet class III and class IV radial neck fractures between 2003 and 2019 were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the time of pin removal; 19 had early pin removal (≤3 weeks) and 18 had late pin removal (>3 weeks). The patients' radiological results were graded using the Metaizeau classification and their clinical results were evaluated by measuring their range of motion (ROM) and Mayo elbow performance scores (MEPS) at postoperative follow-ups. Statistical tests, including the Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests, were performed to compare the demographic factors and outcomes.The mean time of removal of pins for all patients was 21 (10-43) days. The mean time for early and late removal was 15.1 (10-21) and 27.6 (22-43) days, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between groups radiologically according to the Metaizeau classification (P = .723). Furthermore, no statistically significant difference was found in the ROM (extension/flexion: P = .620, pronation/supination: P = .578) or MEPS (P = .695) between groups.This study has shown us that early removal of pins in patients with pediatric radial neck fractures treated with stepwise percutaneous leverage technique demonstrated good radiological and clinical results comparable to late pin removal.

The control group consisted of randomly selected 92 athletes (10 women and 82 men) 85 of whom had practiced sports in the past, aged 40-76 years, who during their sports career did not experience Achilles tendon ruptures. Material for genetic tests was obtained by the swab from the oral cavity epithelium of all the study population.102 (96%) of patients with traumatic Achilles tendon ruptures were people with polymorphism B or heterozygotes for the elastin gene. 97 (92%) of patients with traumatic Achilles tendon ruptures were people with polymorphism B and heterozygotes for the FBN2 gene. Patients with homozygote A of the elastin gene and homozygote A of the FBN2 gene demonstrated a considerably lower incidence rate of sport-related Achilles tendon rupture. The type of sport that led to the Achilles tendon rupture and the amount of experience practicing it, as well as BMI and drug usage, did not contribute to a higher rate of incidence of any additional musculoskeletal problems or a longer time to return to their pre-injury sports activity. Polymorphisms of the fibrillin 2 (P=.0001) and elastin (P=.0009) genes impact the occurrence of traumatic injury to the Achilles tendon. However, it does not affect the length of full recovery time (P =.2251).Minimally invasive and, above all, safe collection of genetic material from the epithelium of the oral cavity in order to assess the polymorphic state of the FBN and elastin genes may allow the identification of a group of players at risk of Achilles tendon rupture resulting in long-term injury, which will significantly affect their sports career in the future.Level II, Prognostic Study.",

We, herein, present a rare case of cervical myelopathy observed in a 14-year-old patient, who was previously a healthy boy treated with cervical laminoplasty, which was caused by cervical spinal canal stenosis based on multiple level disc herniation. The patient presented to the clinic with spastic and ataxic gait with previous diagnostic challenges. Magnetic resonance imaging showed cervical degenerative changes mainly marked at the C3-C4 and C4-C5 levels, along with canal narrowing and a central high signal cord abnormality on T2-weighted images. A C3-C4 open-door laminoplasty surgery technique was performed. The neurological symptoms and signs improved dramatically following surgery. Subsequently, cervical computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed good decompression of the cervical spinal cord during the 5 years of follow-up with the preservation of the range of movement. We concluded that though it is pretty rare, cervical myelopathy should be considered in diagnosing adolescent patients with gait and balance disorders.",

The damage to the spinal cord was formed by the clip compression technique. A neurological evaluation was conducted on days 1, 14, and 28. All rats were sacrificed following the treatment period, and samples of their spinal cords were collected for histopathological analysis.The inclined plane angle was significantly increased on the 14th and 28th days in the isotretinoin 15 mg and acitretin 10 mg groups, compared to the spinal injury group (P=.049 and P=.009, respectively). The Drummond-Moore criterion was significantly higher in the acitretin 10 mg group than in the injury group (P=.026). Cleaved Caspase-3 expression was similar in the isotretinoin 15 mg day 28 group and the control group (P > .05), but significantly decreased in the acitretin 10 mg 14th-day and acitretin 10 mg 28th-day groups compared to spinal injury isotretinoin 15 mg 14th-day and isotretinoin 15 mg 28th-day groups (P < .05).This was the first study elaborating that isotretinoin and acitretin reduced neuronal apoptosis and improved functional recovery after spinal cord injury.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to improve the surgical anatomical knowledge of pelvic/acetabular trauma surgeons by providing detailed morphometric data on some of the most vulnerable arteries and nerves due to constant bony landmarks during anterior intra-pelvic approach fixation of acetabular fractures in women.Ten hemipelvis were dissected from 5 female cadavers. The following measurements relative to the symphysis were performed: (1) the distance of the corona mortis anastomosis and (2) the bisection of the external iliac vein with the pubic ramus. In addition, dis- tance to the pelvic brim at the level of pectineal convexity of the following structures was measured: (3) depth of obturatory neurovascu- lar bundle, (4) superior vesical artery, and (5) vaginal artery. Also, the clock position of the (6) gluteal superior and inferior vessels due to sciatic notch in the supine position. Due to antero-superior corner of sacroiliac joint (7) location of the common iliac artery bifurcation, (8) location of the bifurcation of internal iliac vessels to truncuses, (9) bifurcation of superior gluteal artery and lateral sacral artery, and (10) L5 nerve were measured. The descriptive statistics were given as medians and ranges as this is a descriptive anatomical study without comparisons.The median distance of corona mortis to symphysis pubis was 59.5 mm (range = 58-61). The external iliac vein bisected the pubic arm 68.5 mm (range=65-70) lateral to the symphysis pubis. At the level of pectineal convexity (about the middle of the pelvic brim), obturatory neurovascular bundle, superior vesical artery, and vaginal artery were 15 mm (range=13-16), 24 mm (range=23-25), and 36 mm (range=34-38) inferior to the pelvic brim, respectively. The superior gluteal vessels leave the sciatic notch at 12 o'clock position in supine position. Inferior gluteal vessels leave the sciatic notch at 31⁄2 o'clock position (given for left side). Common iliac artery bifurcation bisects the SI joint 5 mm (4-7) superior to antero-superior corner of the Sacro-iliac (SI) joint. The internal iliac artery gives its posterior trunk 18 mm (range=15-20) straightly anterior to antero-superior corner of the SI joint. Bifurcation of superior gluteal artery and lateral sacral artery was 11 mm (range = 10-12) away from the beginning of the posterior truncus. L5 root's medial margin was 9 mm (range = 7-10) medial to this landmark, where its lateral margin was on the SI joint (2 mm medial to 2 mm lateral).The majority of the bleeding complications of the major branches of the internal and external iliac arteries and neurologic palsies due to obturatory nerve and L5 nerve root damage within the operative field of the anterior intra-pelvic approach can be avoided or managed by utilizing morphometric data provided from this study.N/A.",

Eight rats from each group were sacrificed and evaluated for fracture healing at the first experimental group and control group, second experimental group and control group, third experimental group and control group, and fourth experimental group and control group weeks. Fracture healing was radiologically assessed according to the \"Spencer Index\" and \"Lane and Sandhu Scoring System,\" and histologically evaluated according to the scoring system devised by Huo et al. Results: According to the Spencer Index, the mean union score was statistically significantly higher in the E3 group than in the third con- trol group (P = .014). Furthermore, the mean union score was statistically significantly higher in the fourth experimental group compared to the fourth control group (P=.047). According to the Lane and Sandhu Scoring System, only the mean union scores of the E3-4 groups were statistically significantly higher than the mean union scores of the C3-4 groups (P=.048). There was no histological difference between groups in terms of union, according to the criteria defined by Huo et al (P > .05).This study showed us that repeated intravenous administrations of tranexamic acid had no negative effect on fracture heal- ing in the rat tibia fracture model. Although tranexamic acid demonstrated better radiological healing in the late period, it had no effect on histological union.",

    "abstract": "To compare the use of cannulated screws in an inverted triangular configuration, medial buttress plates, and the combination of these 2 fixation methods in the treatment of Pauwels type 3 femoral neck fractures.Twenty-eight anatomical composite third-generation femoral bone models were divided into 4 groups. The control group (group 1) was formed with 7 third-generation intact bone models. The fracture model was created with a 70° cutting block to fit 21 Pauwels type 3 fracture configurations. Seven models were fixed with an isolated 3.5 mm one-third semi-tubular medial buttress plate (group 2), 7 were fixed in an inverted triangular configuration with 6.5 mm cannulated screws (group 3), and 7 were fixed using a combination of 6.5 mm cannulated screws and a medial buttress plate (group 4). Cyclic loading was applied using axial forces ranging from 60 N to 600 N and moments ranging from 0.7 Nm to 7.0 Nm for 500 cycles. Once the cyclic loading stage was completed, the loads were removed from the system, and the quasi-static loading stage was employed to determine the stiffness and failure forces of the system under both axial and torsional forces. Quasi-static tests were performed with an axial speed of 1.8 mm/min and a torsional speed of 4.5°/min. The biomechanical properties of all groups were examined in terms of axial stiffness, torsional stiffness, and maximum axial force parameters.The stiffness values of groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 303 ± 35.8 N/mm, 159.6 ± 25 N/mm, 232 ± 35.9 N/mm, and 366.9 ± 58 N/mm, respectively, under axial forces (P < .01); 2172.7 ± 252.1 Nmm/°, 1225.3 ± 238.6 Nmm/°, 2123 ± 359.4 Nmm/°, and 2721.85 ± 304 Nmm/°, respectively, under torsional moments (P < .01); and 2072.1 ± 256.1 N, 1379.9 ± 290.6 N, 2099.1 ± 454.2 N, and 2648.4 ± 364.6 N, respectively, under the maximum force (P < .01).This study showed that in the fixation of Pauwels type 3 fractures formed on third-generation bone models, the utilization of half-thread cannulated screws in an inverted triangle configuration, along with a medial buttress plate, provided stronger fixation compared to the remaining implant groups and the control group. According to the evaluation of the parameters, the isolated application of a medial buttress plate had poorer biomechanical properties than other fixation methods.",

At the end of the consolidation period, the distraction zone was compared radiologically and histologically.While there was no radiological difference between the groups, the highest histological scores were obtained from group 3. Osteocalcin staining revealed similar involvement in groups 2 and 3, butless involvement in group 1.Evidence from this study has shown that as the size of the segment used for bone transport increases, more stable fixation and better histological union tissue can be obtained in the rabbit femoral defect model.",

The scans were reviewed for pars defect independently by two experienced musculoskeletal radiology consultants.Among the 220 patients, 9 patients (4.09%; 8 female, 1 male) were found to have a pars defect. The mean age of the affected patients was 14 (range: 11-20) years. We noted two lumbar/thoracolumbar curves (Lenke 5), four King Type 1, one King Type 2 and two King Type 3 curves. All scoliotic deformities were non-structural. Bilateral pars defect was noted in eight (89%) of these patients. All of the pars defects were at the L5 vertebral level.Our study revealed a 4.09% incidence rate of pars defect in AIS patients which appeared similar to those previously reported in roentgenographic studies.",

Arthroscopy revealed a huge amorphous mass arising from ACL fibers at the tibial attachment that impinged on the femoral intercondylar notch on knee extension. The treatment included excision of the mass and accompanying abnormal ACL fibers and notchplasty, and resulted in complete recovery of knee motion and symptom relief without instability. This case shows that a degenerative mass in the form of a mucoid hypertrophied ACL can cause a knee extension block.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the changes in electrophysiological characteristics of the contraction forces of the gastrosoleus complex due to stretching in experimental tibial lengthening.Distraction histiogenesis was performed in 22 guinea pigs weighing 600 to 800 g. Following the application of a semicircular external fixator and right tibial osteotomy, distraction was applied at a rate of 0.25 mm two times a day for 15 days without a latency period. The animals were randomized to two groups. In the study group, a foot plate preventing ankle plantar flexion was affixed to the external fixator, while ankle motions were unrestricted in the control group. On days 5, 10, and 15, the posterior tibial nerve was stimulated with a nerve stimulator at a constant frequency. Gastrosoleus muscle contractions were measured with a transducer and contraction forces were recorded.On day 5, muscle contraction forces measured in the study group were much higher than the control group (p<0.05). On day 10, however, muscle contraction forces showed a rapid decline in the study group and, at the end of the study, muscle contraction forces decreased by 81% compared to the baseline values (p<0.05). Yet, throughout the study period, muscle contraction forces were always higher than the control group (p<0.05). In addition, the rate of the decrease in muscle strength slowed down after day 10 in the study group, and gastrosoleus function and strength were much better preserved. Equinus deformity developed progressively in the ankles of the control animals whose muscle contraction forces also showed significant decreases during the experiment (p<0.05).In clinical applications of tibial lengthening, the strength of the gastrosoleus complex should be preserved to prevent equines deformity and maintain ankle functions. This can be achieved through gradual stretching of the muscle during distraction. If there is shortening before surgery or muscle stiffness is expected during lengthening, measures should be taken before distraction osteogenesis and muscle length should be preserved.",

The nail is recommended for simple diaphyseal fractures involving the middle third of long bones, where the nail can bypass the fracture site by at least 5 cm. We encountered a unique complication with the expandable nail in a simple transverse shaft fracture at the junction of the middle and distal third of the left femur in an otherwise healthy 57-year-old man. The fracture was reduced and a 12-mm expandable nail was inserted. Following full expansion, intraoperative radiographs were obtained prior to closure. After six postoperative weeks, it was noted that the nail expanded the femoral canal, converting a simple fracture to a distally progressing comminuted fracture with a butterfly fragment. A review of the intraoperative radiographs showed slight widening of the medullary canal at the level of the fracture. As the alignment was satisfactory and callus was present, no further surgical intervention was considered. The patient was advised not to bear weight and was provided with a locked knee brace in extension to wear for six weeks. Radiographs at 12 weeks demonstrated good progress of healing with adequate callus and the patient was permitted to bear weight as tolerated and commence knee flexion. The fracture united satisfactorily at four months. This adverse experience emphasizes that caution should be exercised when expanding the nail, with close observation of the medullary canal diameter during the later stages of expansion.",

We observed the changes in the avulsed flaps every other day for 10 days. At the end of follow-up period we evaluated the lesions in avulsed flaps by macroscopic measurement of necrosis and histological ulcer scoring using the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) Scale.The average length of necrosis in avulsed tail flaps was 28.42 ± 3.04 mm, whereas there was no necrosis in avulsed hindlimb flaps (p < 0.05). The average ulcer score of the lesions in tail and left hindlimb were 3.42 ± 0.78, and 1.28 ± 0.48, respectively (p < 0.05). Despite the lack of visible necrosis TUNEL staining revealed an increased amount of apoptotic cells in avulsed hindlimb flaps. Literature review revealed a significant variability in previous studies in terms of the amount of necrosis observed in tail degloving injury model.Tail degloving injury model proved to be a more reliable animal model for degloving injuries. However, standardization of the magnitude of degloving force is required to decrease the variability of necrosis observed in the literature.",

Methods Pulvinar, LT, and HJC specimens were obtained from 38 hips of 36 children (31 girls, five boys; mean age=49 months; age range=18-132 months) during open reduction surgery for DDH. All specimens underwent subsequent routine tissue processing (formalin fixation and paraffin embedding). To determine tissue morphology, haematoxylin and eosin staining was used. SNEs were analyzed immunohistochemically using a mouse monoclonal antibody against S-100 Beta Protein based on the classification of Freeman and Wyke including four types of SNEs including mechanoreceptors: type I Ruffini corpuscles, type II Pacini corpuscles, type III Golgi organs, and type IVa unmyelinated free nerve endings (FNEs). Additionally, children were sorted into three groups based on their age at the time of surgery: Group 1 (age 5 years; 9 hips of 8 children). Results Although no Type I, II, or III SNEs were identified in any specimen, type IVa mechanoreceptor (FNEs) was immunohistochemically characterized in 13 (34%) pulvinar, 19 (50%) LT, and 16 (42%) HJC specimens. The total density of FNEs was 3.31±5.70)/50 mm2 (range 0-21) in pulvinar specimens, 3.18 ± 5.92)/50 mm2 (range 0-24) in HJC specimens, and 4.51±6.61/50 mm2 (range 0-22) in LT specimens. Furthermore, the operated side, gender, and the number of FNEs in specimens did not differ significantly among the age groups (p>0.05 for all), and the number of FNEs was not significantly correlated with age, gender, or the operated side (p>0.05 for all). Conclusion Evidence from this study revealed that pulvinar, LT, and HJC include only FNEs, which play a role in pain sensation, among mechanoreceptors. Surgical excision of these tissues may not cause a significant loss of sensory function in the hip joint of children with DDH. Level of evidence Level II, Therapeutic Study.",

All the animals were randomly categorized into four groups, and dorsal spinal exposure of all lumbar vertebrae was routinely performed in each group. While disc degeneration was created in groups B, C, and D, spinal fusion was added to disc degeneration in groups C and D. Disc degeneration was typically created by puncturing the discs with an 18-gauge needle under the guidance of C-arm imaging. Fusion was achieved with posterior/posterolateral decortication and iliac bone grafts. The rabbits in groups A, B, and C were euthanized, and the discs were removed in the first week after the surgery. The rabbits in Group D were sacrificed, and the discs were harvested at 5 weeks after the surgery. The levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, Nitric Oxide (NO), Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, MMP-13, and Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in the discs were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.Significant increase was observed in the protein levels of both pro-inflammatory and catabolic mediators in disc degeneration groups (Group B, C, and D) compared to Group A. In the fusion groups (Group C and D), these increased mediators decreased, compared to non-fusion group (Group B), (IL1-β P = 0.017, TIMP-1 P = 0.03, NO P = 0.03). However, there was no statistically significant difference in mediator levels between the short- and long-term fusion (Group C versus D).The results of this study have shown that a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory and catabolic mediators may be expected after vertebral fusion whereas there may be no significant difference between the first and fourth week of fusion surgery. These findings may contribute to clarifying the mechanism of action of vertebral fusion in the treatment of low back pain.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to provide anatomic considerations in the first metatarsophalangeal joint (FMPJ) innervation and to evaluate the feasibility of the denervation surgery in the treatment of hallux rigidus. In this cadaveric study, 14 fresh frozen cadaveric transtibial amputation specimens was used. For nerve dissection, dorsal and plantar longitudinal incision centered over the FMPJ were performed. Deep peroneal and dorsomedial cutaneous nerves were dissected in the dorsal aspect of the joint. Medial plantar nerve branches, medial and lateral hallucal nerves, were dissected in the plantar aspect of the joint. The presence, number, and location of articular branches to the FMPJ capsule were recorded. Dorsal and plantar incision length for proper dissection were also recorded. Nerve dissection of the 14 specimens revealed the following number of articular branches from the relevant nerves: 14 from dorsomedial cutaneous nerves, 11 from deep peroneal nerves, 6 from medial hallucal nerve, and 5 from lateral hallucal nerve. Dorsal incision mean length was 60.53 (range, 42.48-85.12) mm, and the plantar incision mean length was 88.08 (range, 77.32-111.21) mm. Evidence from this study has shown that partial dorsal denervation of the FMPJ may be a technically feasible procedure along with the presence of superficially easily dissected nerves with relatively small incision.

A1-31.A2 pertrochanteric fractures were enrolled and allocated one of the two groups based on the treatment type: group DHS, (n =20,mean age = 78.4 ± 6.9 years) and group PFN (n = 20, mean age = 77.75 ± 7.0 years). Operation time was recorded in both groups. In each patient, circulating levels of high sensitivity interleukin-6 (hs-IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatine kinase (CK), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)weremeasured fromblood samples collected 1 hour preoperatively and 24 hours postoperatively.The operation time was slightly shorter in group PFN than in group DHS (51.9 ± 21.1 and 38 ± 15.2 min, respectively; P = 0.02). DHS and PFN both increased hs-IL-6 (143.81 ± 89.12 and 94.13 ± 67.14, respectively), CRP (98.84 ± 31.81 and 104.4 ± 31.80, respectively), and CK (400.8 ± 31.81 and 250.7 ± 31.80, respectively) 24 hours postoperatively. However, PFN compared to DHS resulted in a lesser increase from baseline to 24 hours postoperatively only in hs IL-6 (58.91 ± 59.02 vs 113.30 ± 76.24, respectively; P = 0.0016) and CK (163.6 ± 123.3 vs 310.0 ± 198.3, respectively; P < 0.0001).Moreover, there was a positive correlation of CK levels' surgery time in DHS (r = 0.38, P = 0.0065) and PFN (r = 0.45, P = 0.0013).The results of this study have shown that PFN can induce a lower early postoperative inflammatory response and muscle tissue injury based on the assessment of hs-IL-6 and CK levels, compared to DHS in after the treatment patients pertrochanteric fractures.Level II, Therapeutic Study.",

The medical records of patients who underwent lower extremity amputation (LEA) or UEA because of diabetic gangrene between January 2005 and December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were then assigned to one of two groups: the UEA group (n = 15, 9 male; mean age = 62 ± 12.4) and the LEA group (n = 280, 196 male; mean age = 64.6 ± 10.9). A Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to compare the five-year survival rates between the two groups. A multivariable logistic analysis including demographic characteristics, laboratory data, and dialysis status was conducted to identify the risk factors for diabetic hand gangrene. The five-year mortality rate in the UEA group (86.7%, 13 of 15 patients) was significantly higher than that in the LEA group (51.8%, 145 of 280 patients, P < 0.001). Dialysis status was determined as a risk factor associated with the development of diabetic hand gangrene (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 1.23-13.29; P = 0.021). Evidence from this study has revealed that that amputation for diabetichand gangrene is associated with a high rate of mortality.

Based on the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification system, seven hips (43.7%) were stage 2, and nine hips (56.3%) were stage 3. The mean follow-up was 48.4 ± 25.7 months (range = 12-107). All the patients were evaluated postoperatively at the 6th week, 3rd month, 6th month, 1st year, and annually thereafter until their final follow-up. Clinical assessment was performed using the Harris Hip scoring (HHS) system, Non-Arthritic Hip score (NAHS) and Visual analogue pain scale (VAS). At the final follow-up, degenerative changes were examined according to the Kellgren-Lawrence scale. ThemeanHHS increased from53.43 ± 9.0 (range = 36-67) preoperatively to 83.81 ± 6.1 (range = 72-95) at the final follow-up (P < 0,001). Themean NAHS increased from 51.5 ± 8.2 (range = 36.25-61.25) preoperatively to 86 ± 3.2 (range = 81.5-90) (P < 0,001) at the final follow-up. The mean preoperative VAS decreased from 7.85 ± 0.9 (range = 6.45-9.5) to 3.05 ± 0.9 (range = 1.6-5.2) (P < 0,001) at the final follow-up. 13 hips demonstrated 80 and higher scores according toHHS. In the remaining three hips (ARCOstage 3), the mean postoperative HHS, NAHS, and VAS scores were 76, 82, and 3,2 respectively. According to Kellgren-Lawrence scale, three hips (18,75%) were determined as grade 0, 10 hips (62.5%) as grade 1, and 3 hips (18.75%) as grade 2.

Seventy-eight patients were included in this study (67 with acute or chronic AC instability and 11 with symptomatic ACJ arthritis). The mean interval between test and retestwas 13.2 ± 4.6 days. The reliability of the tools was measured with the intraclass correlation coefficient. External validity was evaluated using correlations between the SACS,Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder score, and the SF-36 version 2 (SF-36v2). Floor and ceiling effects were also analyzed.The mean time to complete the Turkish SACS was 3 min 18 s (range, 1 min 40 s to 7 min 9 s). The test-retest reliability was excellent (ICC, 0.988). There was a very good correlation between SACS,OSS, SPADI, and ASES scores (r = 0.645, 0.645, and -0.682, respectively, P < 0.05). A poor correlationwas observed between SACS and subscales of SF-36v2 (P > 0.05).

This study was designed to determine the reasons for late degradation of PLLA fixators.Three unused and three used meniscal PLLA fixators (BioStinger) were analyzed. The latter were removed from three patients due to persisting symptoms within six months after knee arthroscopy. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed and external and internal surfaces of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluoroscopy (XRF). Chemical structural analyses of two samples (one from each group) were made by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy. Degradation times of two samples (one from each group) by oxidative hydrolysis in hydrogen peroxide solution were recorded.Chemical structure of used and unused fixators did not differ in FTIR analysis. With increasing temperatures, unused and used fixators showed degradation with and without melt flow, respectively. In SEM analysis, inner sections of unused fixators were homogeneous, whereas those of the used ones exhibited crystals which were found to be sodium and potassium chloride salts in XRF analysis. The 1H-NMR spectrum of used and unused samples showed the normal pattern of lactic acid polymer. The unused and used fixators degraded in hydrogen peroxide solution in 10 days and 30 days, respectively.Both fixators had the same chemical structure in FTIR and NMR analyses. Formation of salt crystals seemed to be the most important cause of degradation failure, while changes in the physical properties of fixators were thought to be associated with delayed degradation.",

They are mostly seen in lower extremities, and the upper extremity is the second most common location for these lesions. There are only a few reports about the presence of an angioleiomyoma within a peripheral nerve in the upper extremity. Here we report a 56-year-old male patient who was referred to our clinic after an attempt was made for removal of a forearm mass at another institution. The lesion was encased within the median nerve and there was an unusual hypervascularity around the tumor with numerous vessels entering the lesion. Removal of the tumor without apparent damage to nerve fascicles was possible. Histopathological examination of the excision material revealed an intraneural angioleiomyoma. Following surgery, the patient was free of any functional deficits and no evidence of recurrence was observed at one year follow-up. There is no data regarding recurrence in intraneural lesions due to the lack of a large series. It would not be wrong to recommend spare grossly uninvolved fascicles if the nerve in question is not expendable.",

    "abstract": "Oxidized zirconium (OxiniumTM) prostheses, made up of a metallic alloy of zirconium with a ceramic surface formed by oxidizing the outer layer, were developed as an alternative bearing surface to reduce polyethylene wear and decrease failure of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We report a unique catastrophic failure of an Oxinium TKA with consequent accelerated wear and severe metallosis. Intraoperatively, we observed extensive wear grooving of the femoral component with exposure of the underlying silver layers and the complete wear of polyethylene on the medial side. Metallic debris had a peculiar arthrogram appearance, noted within the cut surface of the femur and tibia, indicative of the osteolysis that occurred, leading up to the failure of the implants. The histopathologic examination revealed a collection of macrophages with foreign-body reactions and black-pigmented metal-induced wear particles. Oxinium has clear benefits regarding superior wear properties; however, surgeons need to be aware that there is a risk of exposure to the underlying layers that may precede accelerated wear, deformation, and metallosis. Uncovering the deeper layers could result in the appearance of an arthrogram on plain radiographs. Early identification of polyethylene wear and prompt revision is crucial to avoid the rapid progression of subsequent metallosis and catastrophic implant failure, specifically when using oxidized zirconium components for TKA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report presenting a detailed histologic analysis to provide insight into the mechanisms of the failed Oxinium components.",

    "abstract": "Trigger finger causes pain and a persistent functional limitation of the hand, which can lead to permanent blockage of the flexor tendon. Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous release has been widely reported as a successful technique for trigger finger involving the A1 pulley. This article describes for the first time the use of this technique in an unusual location, the A3 pulley of the fifth finger. A 71-year-old patient presented with a 3-month history of pain and blockage in the fifth finger of the right hand and was diagnosed with a grade III trigger finger, according to the Froimson scale. We performed an ultrasonography-guided percutaneous release technique on the A3 pulley to release the flexor tendon of the fifth finger. Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous polectomy to treat trigger finger in the A1 pulley is an effective alternative treatment to surgery and even has certain advantages over it. The anatomical similarity between the A1 and A3 pulleys was the key factor that supported the use of this technique in this clinical case. Based on past experience in similar cases, we conclude that ultrasonography-guided percutaneous polectomy of the A3 pulley of the fifth finger was a surgical technique which could lead to a satisfactory outcome in the treatment of this condition.",

A diagnosis of CM can be difficult owing to the longtime span from the emergence of the original trauma to the onset of the symptoms of CM. This case report aimed to feature a case of a 55-year-old gentleman who presented with a progressive painful swelling in the anterolateral aspect of the right lower leg with the initial trauma arising 11 years ago. In the conservative treatment, a fluid-filled mass was formed. The histological examination of the biopsy suggested a diagnosis of CM. The patient underwent a complete debridement operation, after which vacuum sealing drainage was used to manage the space left. Three weeks later, direct wound closure was achieved. Five-year follow-ups showed an excellent outcome without recurrence. Complete surgical debridement combined with primary closure is recommended to manage CM.

A software was developed under a TÜBİTAK-funded project to aid in the disability assessment process. This tool, designed for Windows operating systems and developed in Visual Basic (VB.NET), was tested using archive data from 50 patients, focusing on upper extremity physical evaluations. Statistical analysis, including the Shapiro-Wilk and Independent t-test/Mann-Whitney U-tests, was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics to compare the app-assisted and manual assessment methods regarding time and rating'. Significant time-saving was observed with the app-assisted method, which was 328.3 seconds faster on average than the manual method. The average rating difference between the 2 methods was minor (0.40 points, 0.92% difference) and not statistically significant (P=.931). The app-assisted method showed efficiency in disability assessment with comparable accuracy to the manual methods. This application was developed for physicians who examine patients with musculoskeletal system disabilities in the upper extremities for the Health Board. Our results show that the application reduces the average evaluation time by 5 minutes while maintaining accuracy comparable to the manual method. It could be a helpful tool for physicians in a clinical setting. Level IV, Diagnostic Study.",

Methods K7M2 tumorigenic OS cell line was cultivated in vitro. The xenograft tumor model was formed by subcutaneously adding the tumor cells to athymic nude mice. Tumor was formed within 1 month. Then, mice were randomly assigned to five groups, each containing seven nude mice: control (group 1), wide resection (group 2), intralesional resection (group 3), intralesional resection + bone cement (group 4), and intralesional resection + cadmium embedded in bone cement (group 5). Tumor resection with 1 cm surgical margins was performed in the wide resection group. In intralesional resection groups, tumor tissue was resected with positive margins aiming to leave 15 mm3 of macroscopic tumor tissue. In group 3, the defect was left empty; groups 4 and 5 received bone cements prepared with saline and cadmium solutions, respectively. After the resection, mice were observed for 15 days and sacrificed. Next, surgical resection sites were evaluated histopathologically in each group. Results Recurrent tumor was formed in all mice in the wide resection group, and apparent progression of residual tumor was observed in groups 3 and 4. On the contrary, only a thin layer of residual tumor was observed around the bone cement in group 5. Histological evaluation revealed remarkable necrosis in group 5 and lowest viability compared to other groups. No systemic toxic effect related to cadmium was observed. Conclusion Our data suggest that local application of cadmium in bone cement has a significant potential to increase tumor necrosis and decrease the viability of residual OS cells.",

METHODS A total of 30 standard, same sized, biomechanically equivalent, left first metatarsal sawbones were included in this experimental study. They were divided equally into five groups for each of the planned osteotomy techniques: Myerson's modification of Ludloff, Mau, scarf, Offset V, and Baran-Unal modification of Mau osteotomy. The normal osteotomy for each sample was considered as the control, while the corrective osteotomy was the test. Computerized tomography scans and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction imaging were performed for objective and accurate measurements. The techniques of the osteotomy and post-corrective osteotomy bony contact surface areas were investigated by the two independent research assistants. RESULTS There was a statistically significant difference between the contact surface area changes of all pre- and post-corrective osteotomy groups (P<0.05). When the pre- and post-correction contact surface areas of any one group were compared with the other groups, the differences were or were not statistically significant. Mean differences between pre-correction and post-correction areas for Ludloff, Mau, scarf, Offset V, and Baran-Unal osteotomies were 180.7, 122.3, 226.2, 191.9, and 68.9 mm2, and the percentages of area loss were 22.9%, 15.5%, 28.6%, 24.3%, and 8.7%, respectively. The most bony contact area was found in the scarf osteotomy group (mean pre-correction area: 490.5 mm2 and mean post-correction area: 264.3 mm2), but the Baran-Unal modification group has significantly the highest post-correction bony contact area among the all other groups (mean pre-correction area: 413.3 mm2 and mean post-correction area: 344.4 mm2). CONCLUSION Metatarsal diaphyseal osteotomies for hallux valgus deformity have the potential not only for deformity correction, but also for contact surface area preservation. This study reaffirms the considerable potential of this new Baran-Unal modification to confer outstanding contact surface area values, even with the operative correction of hallux valgus deformity.",

Methods In this study, 15 male New Zealand rabbits aged 12 weeks and weighing 2.5 kg were used. Moreover, 3 rabbits were sacrificed for the anatomical and histological investigation of the relationship between the subscapularis tendon and GSL at baseline. The remaining 12 rabbits underwent the subscapularis tendon tenotomy from the lesser tuberosity using a standardized procedure. The GSL was cut on the left side and preserved on the right side. For histomorphometric analysis, 6 rabbits were first sacrificed at 6 weeks and then the remaining 6 rabbits at 12 weeks. Results In all the rabbits, GSL was identified, connecting the upper portion of glenoid and subscapularis muscle-tendon junction. The mean thickness of the middle portion of GSL was 1.1±0.2 mm; the mean length of GSL was 8.4±2.3 mm. The mean widths of the proximal and distal attachments were 2.4±0.3 and 4.2±0.5 mm, respectively. The mean size of the native subscapularis muscle fibers was 122.6±4.3 μm2. The mean size of the muscle fibers in shoulders with tenotomy alone was 112.6±6.2 and 102.6±4.8 μm2 at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. The mean size of the muscle fibers in shoulders with tenotomy plus GSL cut severing was 88.3±9.7 and 56.4±5.2 μm2 at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. The significant muscle atrophy was observed both at 6 and 12 weeks in the shoulders with tenotomy plus GSL cut compared with those with tenotomy alone as well as those with the native subscapularis. However, the muscle atrophy was not significantly different in the shoulders with tenotomy alone at different time points. Conclusion Because GSL may prevent the subscapularis retraction, the rabbit subscapularis tendon model may not be suitable for studying the human chronic rotator cuff pathology if GSL is neglected or preserved.",

Methods:In this retrospective study, 130 patients who underwent bone graft harvesting from the olecranon using either TB or COSM were included.Patients were then divided into two groups: the COSM group (48 patients; 36 men and 12 women; mean age=32 years; age range=18-52) and the TB group (82 patients; 61 men and 21 women; mean age=34 years; age range=20-62).The mean follow-up was 30 months (range=17-57) in the COSM group and 26.8 months (range=6-48 months) in the TB groups.The two groups were compared in terms of pain intensity, operating time, complication rate, elbow range of motion, and the scar sensitivity of the graft donor site.Pain intensity was measured using the visual analogous scale (VAS) on postoperative days 1 and 15.Other outcome measures were evaluated at the final follow-up.Results: In the TB group, the mean VAS score was 4±1.62 on postoperative day 1 and 1.6±0.76 on postoperative day 15.In the COSM group, the mean VAS score was 7.2±1.38 on postoperative day 1 and 3.1±1.34on postoperative day 15.The early VAS scores were significantly higher in the COSM group than in the TB group (p<0.05).The mean operating time was 7±1.99 minutes in the TB group and 20±4.51minutes in the COSM group.Hematoma occurred in one patient from each group, with an incidence of 2.1% in the COSM group and 1.2% in the TB group.There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding elbow range of motion at final follow-up p>0.05).No patient in the TB group showed sensitivity of the scar region, while scar sensitivity occurred in 3 of 48 patients (0.6%) in the COSM group. Conclusion:Compared with COSM, TB seems to be a safe technique with similar complication rates.TB can provide shorter operating time, less postoperative pain, and smaller and less sensitive scar compared with COSM.",

Construct validity was measured by examining the correlation of OKS, its functional and pain subscales with VAS and the subscales of SF-36.The Estonian version of OKS was assessed equivalent to the original and was satisfactorily accepted by patients on face validity testing. The Estonian OKS performed well on psychometric testing with good test-retest reliability (Spearman's rho 0.8887, P < 0.001, for the overall score) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha for the overall score 0.9353 and 0.9177 on the first and second assessment, respectively). It showed expected correlations with SF-36 subscales (strongest with the physical functioning and pain subscales and weakest with the emotional functioning subscale) and a strong correlation (Spearman's rho -0.8618 and -0.6967 on the first and second assessment respectively) with VAS for pain. A small proportion of patients demonstrated a ceiling value on both assessments, whereas a floor effect was not evident.The Estonian version of OKS is a reliable and valid instrument providing a standardized measure of patient-reported outcome for evaluating the results of TKR.Level IV, Prognostic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the adequacy of spine surgery fellowship training (SSFT) in Turkey and what is needed for further development by interviewing current fellows.Forty male orthopaedics and traumatology or neurosurgery specialists who had completed SSFT in three different spine centers in Turkey between 2010 and 2018 were asked to complete a survey with 29 questions about SSFT in Turkey. Thirty specialists responded, and the collected data were analyzed.Twenty-seven (90%) participants were orthopaedic and traumatology specialists and three (10%) were neurosurgery specialists, with a mean age of 39 (range = 35-53) years. Most participants received their residency training in the provinces where their fellowship training took place (11 (37%) in İstanbul and 7 (23%) in Ankara). The mean duration between residency training and the start of SSFT was 4 (range = 0-14) years, and the mean SSFT duration was 8 (range = 1-18) months. Seventy percent of participants had participated in spine surgery cases during their residency. Twenty-three (77%) participants reported that spine surgery training in their hospital during their residency was inadequate. Seventeen (57%) participants felt that they could not independently perform spine surgery cases before SSFT. All three centers (100%) participating in the study that offered SSFT were non-public institutions such as private hospitals and private university hospitals of medicine managed by a dedicated mentor with personal commitment, without any accreditation for SSFT. While 25 (83%) participants indicated that they felt competent enough to perform a standard spinal deformity surgery case independently at the end of SSFT, 5 (17%) indicated the opposite. This proportion, which was 43% at the end of residency, increased to 83% after SSFT.The results of this study have demonstrated the importance of SSFT in spine surgery as a specialty with a potentially high risk of complications that require prolonged case observation, challenging work-up, and adequate equipment. In this regard, there is a need for regulations on accreditation in government health facilities that provide ideal conditions. We propose to offer SSFT to all surgeons interested in spine surgery in Turkey by conducting further studies supported by an optimal health sector that ensures the appropriate requirements, in accordance with the declaration of TOTEK (The Turkish Orthopaedics and Traumatology Education Council), training workshops, and an accredited master's degree program in spine surgery or subspecialty.",

Postoperative information, such as time to radiographic union, time to regain walking ability, Knee Society Scores (KSS) postoperative score, and KSS functional score were collected. Radiographic images were examined for the measurement of leg length discrepancy and valgus deformity.The mean follow up was 34 (range = 24-50) months. The mean time to radiographic union was 12.3 (range = 10-16) weeks, and the mean time to regain walking ability was 11.8 (range = 11-13) weeks. Leg length discrepancies were all less than 0.8 cm, and valgus deformity was all limited in 10°. The mean KSS postoperative score was 97.5 (range = 93-100), and the mean KSS functional score was 97.1 (range = 90-100). None of the patients exhibited functional deficiency. Neither deep infection nor refracture was detected postoperatively.External fixation seems to be an acceptable alternative modality for treatingdisplaced supracondylar femoral fractures in children, with favorable clinical and radiological outcomes as well as a low complication rate.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the mid-term clinical outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the management of end-stage hemophilic arthropathy.Eleven patients (15 knees) undergoing TKA with stiff knees were retrospectively evaluated. TKA was performed in all patients without additional surgical interventions such as posterior capsular release, hamstring release, synovectomy, VY quadricepsplasty, or tibial tubercle osteotomy. All patients were evaluated for clinical and radiological results at follow-ups. Functional evaluation and pain status were assessed using the Knee Society Score and Visual Analogue Scale.The mean age at the time of operation was 40.8 ± 11.8 years (range=30-64 years). The mean follow-up was 51.2 ± 20.6 months (range=24-95). The mean flexion contracture significantly decreased from 17.6 ± 11.3 to 1.7 ± 2.8 degrees, and the mean maximum flexion increased dramatically from 55.6 ± 20.5 to 109.2 ± 16.2 degrees (P < 0.001). Statistical significant improvement in flexion and flexion contracture degrees continued up to the postoperatively 18 months. The mean Knee Society Score increased from 22.7 ± 2.4 points preoperatively to 87.8 ± 3.8 points at the last follow-up (P < 0.001). The mean cost of coagulation factor consumption and blood transfusion accounted for 78% of the total cost.This study has shown that TKA is an effective treatment for relieving pain and improving both ranges of motion and quality of life in managing end-stage hemophilic arthropathy of the knee joint.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

We report the case of a 14-year-old male rugby player with traumatic anterior shoulder instability, an extensively flapped lesion on the glenoid articular cartilage, and an osseous Bankart lesion. Arthroscopic findings revealed that the glenoid cartilage was flap-detached, extending from the anteroinferior to the center. Repair of the osseous Bankart lesion using suture anchors and resection of the unstable peripheral part of the cartilage was performed arthroscopically. The main region of the injured articular surface was left untouched. During postoperative follow-up, absorption of the glenoid articular surface near the suture anchor holes was identified. Arthroscopic examination three months post-surgery showed that the flap detached lesion of the residual cartilage was stable and appeared adapted on the glenoid surface. The resected area was covered by fibrous tissue. A follow-up computed tomography scan revealed that the osseous lesion was united. The patient returned to his previous sports capacity eight months following the operation. At the 2-year-follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the glenoid surface was remodeled to a flattened round shape with no signs of osteoarthritis, exhibiting proper conformity of the joint surfaces to the humeral head. Arthroscopic Bankart repair using suture anchors may cause bone resorption at the glenoid surface, leading to remodeling of the glenoid surface from the damaged glenoid cartilage lesion in young patients.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to establish a feasible conservative treatment algorithm for Legg-Calvè-Perthes Disease (LCPD), clarify its limitations, and evaluate the correlations between radiographical and clinical results.Patients diagnosed with LCPD and treated conservatively were evaluated retrospectively; 39 hips from 35 patients were included. The treatment protocol consisted of intermittent manual traction, range of motion exercises, activity limitation, bed rest, NSAID (ibuprofen 100mg/5mL), and ASA (100mg/day) during attack periods. The treatment protocol was standardized, and an algorithm was established for all the patients.The mean follow-up was 13.7 (range = 8-22) years. According to the Stulberg classification, 26 (67%) hips were good, 6 (15,3%) were fair, and 7 (17%) were poor. No activity-limiting pain was detected in any patient. The mean Harris score was 90.5 ± 5.3 for Stulberg type 1, 2, and 3 hips, but 84.2 ± 8.8 for Stulberg type 4 and 5 hips. When the patients were evaluated in terms of pain, activity, and func- tion, it was seen that pain and activity were not different, especially in the Stulberg 1, 2, 3, and 4 patients during the mid-term follow-up. The function was the main factor correlating with the Stulberg classification. Twenty-nine (82.8%) families defined the applicability of the treatment protocol as \"easy,\" 4 (10.3%) defined it as \"moderate,\" and 2 (6.2%) defined it as \"difficult.\"The present study demonstrated that the treatment protocol was successful and easily applicable to LCPD. Although lateral pillar classification was efficient to predict radiographic results, the Stulberg classification was not correlated with the clinical results for every subgroup.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

In the questionnaire, newly graduated orthopedic surgeons were asked whether they could do the 18 listed essential adult and 8 listed essential pediatric cases independently. They were asked about patient follow-up systems and who these were supervised by, the demo- graphic data of the city and about the institution they were trained in, and how many times they performed the listed surgeries during their training.74 (49%) of the participants received their training in training and research hospitals, 69 (45.7%) in state university hospitals, and 8 (5.3%) in foundation university hospitals. More than 80% of the participants answered, \"I can do it independently\" for 13 (81.6%) out of 16 adult cases and 7 (87.5%) out of 8 paediatric cases. The average self-efficacy score of the participants was 32.22 out of 36 for adult cases and 15.3 out of 16 for paediatric cases. The total average self-efficacy score was 47.52 out of 52.This study has shown us that newly graduated orthopedic surgeons have the self-confidence to handle many of the essential types of cases independently.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiographic results of three different pelvic fixation techniques, i.e., Galveston Rod, Iliac Screw, and Sacroiliac Screw, in managing neuromuscular scoliosis in nonambulatory children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP).This retrospective study included nonambulatory children aged < 18 years with neuromuscular scoliosis secondary to CP, undergoing a spinal fusion and pelvic fixation by either Galveston rod, iliac screw, or sacroiliac screw techniques. The primary outcome variable was to determine the stability of the major curve angle and pelvic obliquity over timeline intervals for each pelvic fixation tech nique. The two radiographic parameters were measured at five timeline intervals and were compared to define stability among the groups.One hundred and one patients (54 females [53%]) with spastic nonambulatory CP met the inclusion criteria; the mean age at sur gery was 13.5±3.1 years. Mean follow-up intervals were first-year (12.9±1.5) and second-year (25.8±2.5). Forty-one patients had minimum five-year (81.5±23 months) postoperative follow-up. Groups were based on pelvic fixation techniques: 25 patients with the Galveston rod, 24 with the iliac screw, and 52 with the sacroiliac screw. Of the 41 patients with a minimum five-year follow-up, 10 had the Galveston rod, 11 had an iliac screw, and 20 had sacroiliac screw fixation. Gross Motor Function Classification System level, medical comorbidities, intra thecal baclofen pump, and vitamin D level were compared with each pelvic fixation technique (P > .05). Major curve angle parameters were measured at the five timelines as 70.5°±21.1°, 15.7°±13°, 15.7°±12°, 17.5°±12.7°, and 15.1°±9.6°, and pelvic obliquity as 14.8°±10.4°, 4.9°±4.2°, 5.7°±4.6°, 5°±4.4°, and 7.2°±4.4°, respectively. After the surgery, corrected major curve angle and pelvic obliquity showed no sta tistically significant difference between pelvic fixation techniques (P > .05) and remained stable over timeline intervals (P > .05). Fifteen patients had complications requiring additional surgery. The iliac screw group (nine patients) had the highest rate of complications.All three pelvic fixation techniques can provide equivalent correction for major curve angle and pelvic obliquity in managing neuromuscular scoliosis in nonambulatory CP children. Pelvic obliquity after surgery may remain stable regardless of pelvic fixation type. A higher rate of postoperative complication can be encountered with the iliac screw.Level III, Retrospective Study.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the outcomes of Gamma3 nails fitted with U-blade lag screws in the management of combined neck and trochanter fracture of the femur. Two hundred-fifty patients with fractures in the proximal femur underwent treatment using Gamma3 nails integrated with U-blade lag screws from 2015 to 2022. Among these cases, 33 had combined neck and trochanteric fractures; 8 patients were excluded because of follow-up for <1 year. The remaining data of 25 patients (7 males and 18 females) were reviewed. Bone mineral density (BMD), body mass index (BMI), tip-apex distance (TAD), extent of lag screw migration, femoral neck-shaft angle, callus formation, fracture type, and treatment failure were analyzed. The mean patient age was 76.3 (range, 61-91) years, and the mean follow-up duration was 17.3 (range, 12.5-57.3) months. The mean BMD T-scores for the spine and femoral neck were -2.3 ± 1.0 and -2.8 ± 0.7, respectively; 18 patients had T-scores ≤-2.5, indicating osteoporosis. The mean BMI was 23.2 ± 3.8 kg/m2 , and the mean operative time was 69.8 (range, 45-90) minutes. Twenty-one patients experienced injuries from slipping, 2 sustained injuries from falling, and 2 from car traffic accidents. The mean TAD was 21.6 ± 5.9 mm, with 16 patients showing <25 mm. The mean extent of lag screw migration was 5.7 ± 5.1 mm. The mean femoral neck-shaft angle on plain radiographs was 125.1 ± 8.6 degrees immediately postoperatively and 120.3 ± 9.5 degrees at the final follow-up. During the follow-up period, the first callus formation was observed at 3.8 months (range, 1.4-7.3) on plain radiographs in the anteroposterior and axial views. Based on our fracture criteria, 4 patients had a two-part fracture type, 12 patients had three-part, and 9 patients had four-part. Out of 25 patients, 3 exhibited treatment failure. No significant differences were observed between the groups with and without bone union regarding age, BMD, BMI, operative time, TAD of the lag screw, extent of lag screw migration, and femoral neck-shaft angle. The bone union was achieved in 88% of patients who underwent treatment utilizing the U-blade Gamma3 nail for concomitant ipsilateral neck and trochanteric fractures. Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

Fractures adjacent to fusion blocks that extend into the lower lumbar spine pose a unique challenge as stabilization of such fractures might require an extension of instrumentation to L5 or the pelvis. We report a novel surgical technique where bilateral pedicle and cortical screws at L4 and supplementary rods that connect the cortical screws to the main rods via dominos were implemented for optimizing the distal anchorage for TSF stabilization following an L3 Chance fracture in an AIS patient who had undergone T4-L2 posterior spinal fusion.",

    "abstract": "A frequent problem for interlocking nailing that affects the treatment of the fracture is locking screw deformation. The aim of this study is to determine whether bending resistance is different between high, low, and unthreaded locking screws of interlocking femoral nails. Ninety screws were used in this experimental study, with 10 screws used in each of 9 groups. Three-point bending tests were performed on 6 groups of 5 mm screws (titanium, stainless steel, crossed with unthreaded, low threaded, and high threaded) and the same 3 thread types of 5.5 mm stainless steel screws in a 30-mm inner diameter steel tube, imitating the level of the lesser trochanter. An axial compressor was used to determine the yield points for permanent deformation in the locking screws by way of 3-point bending tests. The mean yield point value of the 3-point bending tests of 5-mm low threaded stainless steel locking screws was 2071 N, 53% less than that of unthreaded screws (3169 N). The mean yield point value of 5-mm high threaded stainless steel locking screws was 556 N, 272% less than that of low threaded screws (2071 N). To avoid locking screw deformation, high threaded screws must not be used as locking screws. In cases of unreliable patients, 5-mm low threaded screws should not be used in the nailing of comminuted or oblique femur shaft fractures. All 5-mm unthreaded screws and 5.5-mm low threaded stainless steel screws can be used safely in full weight-bearing conditions of unreliable patients.",

The nails with single distal locking screw are advantageous for decreasing operation time and radiation exposure. We investigated which single distal screw nail is the best for interfragment rotational stability. We used a total of 30 composite femurs, ten for each group. We determined interfragment rotational displacement of composite femurs with three types of single distal screw nails (10 interlocking nails, 10 compression nails and 10 Mehmet anti-rotation nails compressed by tube) at 6-Nm external- 6 Nm internal and 10 Nm extern- 6 Nm internal torques, which imitating respectively the level walking and descending stairs, using an axial distraction testing machine and a custom designed rotation apparatus. Between 10 Nm external and 6 Nm internal torques with single distal locking screw, the interfragment rotational displacement in the Mehmet nail compressed by the 8 Nm torque wrench was mean 1.14 mm and 540% less than mean 7.31 mm in interlocking nails and 400% less than 5.72 mm in compression nails compressed by the 2.5 Nm torque wrench. The single distal screw Mehmet nail is superior than other single (or even some double) distal screw nails for maximum rotational stability, with no interfragment distraction gap, no superior nail migration, decreased operation time, and less radiation exposure in axially stable transverse and short oblique femur fractures in daily activities like stair descending or level walking.",

We evaluated if patients wished be counseled about this and its potential consequences preoperatively.Two hundred eighty-two primary cementless THAs were performed in 260 patients (124 males and 136 females), with a mean age 68.5 years. All patients completed a questionnaire. Minimum follow-up was 3 years. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate if patient variables influenced whether the patient experienced a noisy hip.Thirty-one (11%) of hips had an audible noise; 50% of these were 'squeaks.' The noise was mainly present upon standing up (74%) and walking (45%). None of the patients noted 'noise' on their consent forms. Fifty-five percent of the entire cohort would have preferred to have known about the possibility of a noisy hip before consenting, though no patients would have refused consent had they known about the noise preoperatively. No patients have sought financial compensation to date. There was no significant influence of gender (p=0.92), age (p=0.66), height (p=0.17), weight (p=0.99), or body mass index (p=0.29) on whether the patient experienced a noisy hip.No patient factor associated with noise could be identified. It is suggested that this issue be discussed preoperatively with all patients. In our cohort, this would satisfy the majority of patients' wishes and may additionally serve as important evidence in a malpractice claim. Therefore, it is suggested that the British Orthopaedic Association include 'the possibility of noise' in their consent form for THA.",

Each case was reviewed with regards to diagnosis, appropriateness of review time, and actual review time. Following this, the senior author performed a 1-hour teaching program in the ED utilizing a referral protocol. The study was then repeated in 63 patients to evaluate any improvement in patient treatment.Following the teaching program, a statistically significant improvement was found in interpretation of protocol (p=0.02), review time suggested (<0.00), and proportion of patients that actually receive an appropriate review time (p=0.004). No significant change was found with regards to grade of ED clinician referring the patient.The use of a simple education program and referral protocol may provide a significant improvement in appropriateness of patient referrals in the emergency department. This leads to a significant increase in patients referred with correct diagnoses, timeliness of review times, and subsequently improved patient care.",

We would like to thank the authors for their contribution, with a successfully designed and documented study. We believe that these findings will enlighten further studies regarding risk factors for the development of postoperative pain following total hip arthroplasty. Total hip arthroplasty is a common orthopedic procedure, and postoperative pain is one of the most common concerns of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.[2] As underlined by the authors, many risk factors may influence the severity of pain after total hip arthroplasty. However, we realized that 2 important factors are not included in the list as risk factors: 1. Anesthetic technique—The intensity of postoperative pain is found to be less severe following regional techniques like spinal or epidural blocks[3] when compared to general anesthetic technique.[4–6] 2. Intraoperative analgesic use—In particular, preemptive analgesia is found to be an effective method in terms of reducing postoperative pain.[7] To summarize, we believe that anesthetic technique and intraoperative use of analgesics should be included in the list of risk factors for the development of postoperative pain following total hip arthroplasty.

We sought to review the clinical and hisopathological features also chemotherapy regimens in this particular group of patients and to determine possible prognostic factors. Materials and Methods: We reviewed 287 patients of osteosarcoma treated between 1986 and 2010.Patients were considered eligible for the present study if they fulfilled the following criteria: primary OS, typical histological and radiographic features of OS, no prior history of cancer or treatments elsewhere, and no prior history of pre-existing bone abnormalities. Results: The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the entire group including 95% confidence limits at two and five years. The overall two- and five-year survival rates were 76.2% and 72.8%, respectively. Surgical margin was a significant factor affecting survival. Also pathological fracture was a significant factor affecting the survival. Discussion: The decreasing incidence of OS over the age of 40 years and the expectation that these elderly patients may not tolerate aggressive modern chemotherapy means that the patients with OS over the age of 40 years may must often excluded from current trials of treatment. Osteogenic sarcoma remains a challenging disease to treat. A multidisciplinary approach is the best method for treating OS in patients older than 40 years. The poor clinical outcome in elderly patients with primary OS reported previously is difficult to understand.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This study aims to investigate the anatomical relationships of the transmuscular portal to its surrounding structures in arthroscopic treatment of superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesions in a human cadaveric model. METHODS In this anatomic study, bilateral shoulder girdles of 12 adult formalin embalmed cadavers were used. All cadavers were male, and the mean age was 63.4±7.3 years. The portal entry point was determined as midway between the anterior and posterior borders of the acromion, approximately 1 cm lateral from the edge of the acromion. After a guidewire was placed in the glenoid cavity at the 12 o'clock position where the SLAP lesion typically occurs, a switching stick was inserted there. Each glenoid was then drilled with a 2.4 mm drill through an arthroscopic cannula. Subsequently, anatomical dissection was executed to assess the relationship of the transmuscular portal with the suprascapular nerve, axillary nerve, supraspinatus tendon, acromion, and biceps tendon. Lastly, the shortest distance between the aforementioned structures with the drill was measured by a sensitive caliper to determine whether there was a penetration of the structures. Differences between the right and left sides were analyzed. RESULTS The mean distance between the portal and the axillary nerve was 55.5 mm±6.0 mm, and the mean length of the suprascapular nerve was 61.2 mm±7.0 mm. The mean distance between the portal and the supraspinatus tendon was 2.8 mm±1.5 mm. No penetration of the axillary nerve, suprascapular nerve, and supraspinatus tendon was observed in any cadaver. No differences were detected for measured anatomical parameters between the right and left sides (p>0.05). CONCLUSION Findings from this cadaveric study revealed that the transmuscular portal may allow for a reliable anchor placement without any nerve or tendon penetration during arthroscopic SLAP repair.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the radiological and clinical results of intertrochanteric fractures treated with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) that were either intraoperatively compressed or non-compressed. Ninety-four patients (64 female, 30 male; mean age = 77.6 years; age range = 68-81) who underwent intraoperative fracture compression (IOFC) (94 hip joints, group A) and 88 patients (64 female, 24 male; mean age = 77.1 years; age range = 67- 80) who underwent postoperative impaction (POI) alone (88 hip joints, group B) from2012 to 2017 met the following six conditions were observed for over 2 years: AO Foundation/Orthopaedic Trauma Association 31-A1 and 31-A2 trochanteric fractures; Singh index grade ≥ 3; positive or neutral medial cortical support position with slightly valgus reduction; possible compression of more than one cortical bone in the anterior or medial region of the fracture site based on preoperative imaging test; blade position within the center-center; andtip-apex distance of < 25 mm. During the follow- up periods, changes of pain and time to fracture union were evaluated clinically, and the lateral extension distance (for screw back-up) was evaluated radiologically which measuredbetween the lateral end of the screw and lateral edge of the intramedullary nail. The mean follow-up was 38.4 (range = 24-48) months in Group A and 36.7 (24-48) months in Group B. The mean operation time was 68 (range = 40-100) min in group A and 71 (range = 40-105) min in Group B (P = 0.521). Intraoperative blood loss was 78 (range = 50-110) mL in Group A and 81 (range = 50-100) mL in Group B (p=0.715). The mean fluoroscopy time was 2.8 (range = 2.2-3.5) min in Group A and 2.6 (range = 2.1-3.5) min in Group B (P = 0.631). The acute phase pain scores measured by visual analog scale at postoperative 3 months were 35.5 in Group A and 37.6 in Group B (P = 0.073). The lateral extension of the PFNA blade showed significant difference at 24 months after surgery (Group A, 3.6±3.1 mm; group B, 7.8±3.7 mm, P = 0.017). Fracture gaps after surgery were 1.8 (range = 0.5-2.5)mmin Group A and 2.6 (range = 0.7-4.6)mmin Group B, showing significant difference (P = 0.001). The average fracture union time was 16.7 (range = 14-20) weeks in Group A) and 19.7 (range = 16-22) weeks in Group B (P = 0.065). The mean Harris Hip Scores at postoperative 24 months were 84.3 (range = 65-100) in Group A and 85.5 (range= 69-100) in Group B (P = 0.545).p Conclusion: If all the six conditions are met, IOFC seems to appropriate for AO/OTA 31-A1 and 31-A2 intertrochanteric fractures with the smaller postoperative fracture gap and lateral protrusion of the blade, which may contribute to the shortening of fracture union periods.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of Doppler ultrasound (DU) in predicting arterial injuries following the penetrating trauma of the forearm, by comparing preoperative diagnosis made by DU and that made by physical examination (PE) with the intraoperative diagnosis.In this retrospective study, 48 patients (44 men, 3 women; mean age = 30 ± 12.5 years) who underwent surgical treatment due to a suspected arterial injury following a penetrating trauma in the forearm from 2016 to 2018 were included. The DU examination was frequently done before an orthopedic examination. In the orthopedic PE, the knowledge as to whether an arterial injury occurred or (if present) which artery was injured was noted. Preoperative diagnoses by PE and DU were first compared with each other, and then with the intraoperative diagnoses. The specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive predictive values were calculated.While the DU findings from 24 patients (50%) matched their intraoperative results, the result from the remaining 24 patients (50%) did not. Nine (18.75%) were considered false-positive and 15 (31.25%) were false-negative. Whereas the PE findings from 30 patients (62.5%) matched their intraoperative results, the remaining 18 patients (37.5%) did not. Six (12.5%) were considered false-positive and 12 (25%) were false- negative. No significant difference was found between the diagnoses of DU and PE, and there was good agreement between the DU and PE findings (P = 0,065, κ = 0,504). While the DU findings were significantly different from the intraoperative findings (P = 0.004), the PE findings were not significantly different from the intraoperative findings (P = 0.302). Sensitivities of DU and PE were both 75% for the diagnosis of radial artery injury as well as 63.3% and 70% for the ulnar artery injury, respectively. Specificities of DU and PE were 83.3% and 91.66% for the diagnosis of radial artery injury as well as 77.77% and 72.22% for the ulnar artery injury, respectively.The PE seems more sensitive and useful than the DU in predicting arterial injuries following the penetrating trauma of the forearm.Level IV.",

All the patients were examined based on a standardized protocol, including age, Body-Mass Index (BMI), OAR, and presence of ankle fracture. As accuracy indicators, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of OAR were calculated.Of all patients, 790 (84.5%) were normal weighted, 107 (11.5%) were overweight, and 38 (4%) were obese. While OAR was negative in 58.8% of patients, 41.2% of patients met OAR. The sensitivity of OAR in the normal weighted population was significantly higher than obese and overweight groups (P < 0.01). The specificity of OAR in the normal weighted population was significantly lower than overweight and obese groups (P < 0.01). The accuracy of OAR in the overweight group was 82.7% and significantly higher compared with the normal weighted population (62.8%) (P < 0.01).We do not recommend OAR as a screening tool to be used safely in patients with higher BMI because of its lower sensitivity in this population. In this specific patient population, these rules should be implemented carefully, and radiography should be evaluated meticulously not to miss a fracture.Level IV, Cross Sectional Study.",

He had short little, index, and middle fingers, long ring fingers, and clinodactyly of the little finger. He also had symmetrical brachydactyly of both feet. There were no other skeletal anomalies and his family members were normal. Radiographic examination of the hand showed oblique articulation of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger with ulnar deviation, hyperphalangism of the middle finger, brachydactyly of the middle phalanx of the little finger, and long proximal phalanx of the ring finger. Foot radiography showed dysplastic middle phalanx of the middle toe, with the remaining lesser toes having only two phalanges. The two feet were radiographically similar except for a dysplastic middle phalanx in the second and third toes of the right foot. Since the patient was not physically challenged, no treatment was offered.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the effect of abductor hallucis (AH) tendon release on residual adductus deformity in the surgical treatment of congenital clubfoot.The study included 35 patients with congenital clubfoot. Thirteen patients (group 1, 21 feet) underwent classical complete subtalar release, while 22 patients (group 2, 31 feet) underwent the same treatment combined with AH muscle release by stripping it plantarward and transecting it distally. The mean age was 19.4 months (range 13 to 39 months) in group 1, and 13.5 months (range 11 to 25 months) in group 2. The mean follow-up period was 55.5 months (range 36 to 77 months) in group 1, and 24.7 months (range 10 to 37 months) in group 2. Radiographic assessments were made on preoperative, early postoperative, and final radiographs for the anteroposterior talo-first metatarsal angle and calcaneocuboid relationship, and for the anteroposterior naviculometatarsal angle and talonavicular relationship on final radiographs.Both groups showed significant improvement in the anteroposterior talo-first metatarsal angle in the early postoperative period (p<0.001); however, early and late postoperative talo-first metatarsal angle did not differ significantly both within groups and between groups (p>0.05). The anteroposterior naviculometatarsal angle was 95.3 degrees in group 1, and 96.7 degrees in group 2. The anteroposterior naviculometatarsal angle and talonavicular subluxation were similar in the two groups (p>0.05). The early and late postoperative calcaneocuboid relationship showed significant improvement in both groups, without a significant difference between the groups (p>0.05).It seems that release of the AH muscle does not affect the incidence of postsurgical residual adduction deformity in the surgical treatment of congenital clubfoot.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate early postoperative biomechanical changes in plicated joint capsules and to determine the effect of debridement to create a bleeding inner capsular surface on the healing process.Fifty-four mature New Zealand white rabbits were used. Plication was performed in unilateral medial knee joint capsules of 48 rabbits either alone (n=24) or following debridement (n=24) to create a bleeding inner capsular surface. Six rabbits remained untreated for the control group. The operated knee joints were immobilized in flexion postoperatively. The rabbits from the two study groups were sacrificed in groups of six immediately after operation, in the first, second, and third weeks, of which five were evaluated in tensile tests and one was evaluated histologically.Compared to the controls, tensile strengths were significantly higher in both study groups until the third week (p<0.01), after which the difference became insignificant (p>0.05). The strength of the plicated capsules was significantly higher in the first week in both study groups than those measured in subsequent weeks (p<0.01), whereas similar tensile strengths were recorded in the second and third weeks (p>0.05). Compared to its absence, the use of debridement was associated with a significantly lower strength in the first week (p<0.01), but this difference was not observed afterwards (p>0.05). Histological findings were similar in the two study groups and were characterized by healing with increased fibrosis starting from the first week.A plicated capsule would not be weaker than an intact one. Our findings do not favor debridement for a more rapid and better healing process. Rather, it might have adverse effects on the biomechanical properties of the capsule.",

    "abstract": "Cylindrical grafts are currently used to cover defected area in mosaicplasty. However, there are some difficulties with cylindrical grafts, such as potential dead space between grafts and insufficient coverage. Hexagonal graft (honeycomb model) was created and evaluated in this biomechanical study. Hypothesis was that harvesting grafts with hexagonal shape, which has the best volume geometry characteristics in nature, would be biomechanically advantageous and provide superior pull-out strength.Total of 24 fresh calf femurs were divided into 3 equal groups. In the first group, 1 cylindrical and 1 hexagonal graft were compared. Second group consisted of 3 cylindrical and 3 hexagonal grafts. Third group was designed to evaluate effect of graft depth; hexagonal graft implanted at 5 mm depth was compared with 20-mm-deep hexagonal graft. All specimens were subjected to pull-out test. Friction field and graft surface area were also evaluated.Pull-out strength comparison of 15-mm-deep triple cylindrical grafts and 15-mm-deep triple hexagonal grafts in second group revealed statistically significant difference in favor of hexagonal grafts (p < 0.05). Surface area of cylindrical graft with 9-mm diameter was calculated to be 50.27 mm2, while hexagonal graft surface area was 55.425 mm2. Volume ratio of cylindrical and hexagonal grafts was 753.98 mm3 and 831.375 mm3, respectively.This biomechanical study demonstrated that graft geometry, especially in multiple graft applications, is a factor that influences stability. Hexagonal grafts appear to be more stable than cylindrical grafts in multiple applications, and they may be used to cover a larger defected area.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of vitamin K2 on fracture healing.Twenty-four 6-week-old male Wistar albino rats that had open tibia fractures induced were included in this study. They were divided into 2 groups of 12, a group that had vitamin K2 administered over 30 consecutive days and a control group. After 30 days, the rats were sacrificed, and from each group, 6 tibiae were selected for biomechanical testing to examine the mechanical strength of the callus tissue using the Instron 3-point bending test and 6 tibiae were selected for histological analysis to examine the density and organization of callus tissue using Allen's grading system and Huo et al's grading system. Furthermore, weekly x-rays were taken to evaluate bone union described by Lane and Sandhu, and osteocalcin, procollagen I N-terminal propeptide, and procollagen I C-terminal propeptide were examined in blood samples taken by intracardiac puncture during sacrification.Breaking force (P = .047), breaking time (P = .019), stiffness (P = .039), fracture strength (P = .041), and Young's modulus (P = .032) showed a statistically significant increase in the K2 group. Procollagen I C-terminal propeptide (P = .024), procollagen I N-terminal propeptide (.047), and osteocalcin (.048) levels were significantly higher in the K2 group compared to the control group. Furthermore, 3rd-week x-rays showed higher bone union scores according to the Lane and Sandhu method in the K2 group (P = .014). However, the histological grading systems of Allen and Huo et al did not show statistically significant differences between groups (P = .086, P = .07, respectively).In light of these findings, it could be concluded that vitamin K2 has a significant positive effect on fracture healing.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to introduce a minimally invasive technique in correcting residual zigzag deformities after early treatment of thumb duplication followed by fixation with a cemented frame.Nineteen patients (14 males, 5 females; mean age, 12 years; age range, 8-14 years) with residual zigzag thumb deformities were treated with the minimally invasive technique from 2017 to 2019. The function and cosmesis of the thumbs were assessed using the Japanese Society for Surgery of the Hand.The mean period between the first and the second operations was 35 months (range, 12-84 months). There were Wassel types III (n=4), IV (n=13), and V (n=2) residual zigzag thumb deformities. Preoperatively, the mean alignment deformities of the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints were 23° (12-42°) and 18° (11-33°), respectively. The mean function and cosmesis of the thumbs were 12 points (range, 8-14 points). There were 1 fair and 18 poor scores. At the final follow-up (mean, 28 months; range, 24-33 months), the mean alignment deformities of the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints were 1° (0-4°) and 18° (0-4°), respectively. The mean function and cosmesis of the thumbs were 18 points (range, 16-20 points). There were 5 excellent results, 13 good results, and 1 fair result.Residual zigzag thumb deformities can be successfully corrected with the minimally invasive technique, resulting in good functional and cosmetic outcomes. The technique can be used as an alternative in selected cases.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "Nonunion of the femoral neck represents the main complication following fractures at this location. Few studies have documented the application of 3-dimensional printing technology for the surgical treatment of postoperative nonunion of femoral neck fractures. The present manuscript describes a case of a particular 3-dimensional printing technology method for designing a custom-made guide plate for revision surgery. A 46-year-old man suffered a nonunion of the femoral neck following an internal fracture fixation. Using 3-dimensional printing technology, we preoperatively printed a femur model and a custom-made guide plate. Using the model, we performed a simulated operation before the surgery, and the guide plate was used for accurate osteotomy during the operation. With this method, we achieved the desired results: the fracture healed, the operation time was shortened, and there was no femoral head necrosis. Our case suggests that 3-dimensional printing technology provides an effective aid in the treatment of patients with nonunion following a femoral neck fracture and recommends 3-dimensional printing technology for such cases.",

All radial neck fractures were Judet type IV, and there were 17 type C and 14 type D olecranon fractures. The follow-up time ranged from 26 to 56 months (average 35.8 months). The Boyd approach was used first to reduce olecranon fractures and fix them with Kirschner wires. Thereafter, radial neck fractures were reduced and fixed with absorbable rods. Patients' functional outcomes were assessed using the Mayo Elbow Performance Index score.Results were excellent in 19 patients, good in 8 patients, fair in 2 patients, and poor in 2 cases according to the Mayo Elbow Performance Index score. The rate of excellent and good outcomes was 87.1%. The average Mayo Elbow Performance Index score was 91.5 points. Three patients showed radial nerve injuries preoperatively, which were assessed intraoperatively. No nerve repair was required, and all nerve injuries recovered within 3 months.This study has shown us that using a Boyd approach for open reduction and fixation with absorbable rods and K-wires is feasible for olecranon and severely displaced radial neck fractures in pediatric patients.Level IV, Therapeutic study.",

Two surgeries were conducted 8 weeks apart, repairing 1 Achilles tendon in the first, repairing the contralateral tendon and harvesting specimens in the second. The repair times were recorded. In addition, biomechanical tests were conducted to determine mechanical strength.There was a statistically significant difference between the 3 groups in load-to-failure values for the strength after repair model, with the experiment group superior to the other 2 (P = .002; P < .05). Although there was a noticeable difference between the mean loadto- failure values of each group in the healing model, we could not demonstrate a statistically significant difference(P > .05). The new modification took significantly less time than the other 2 techniques (P = .001).Our new modification was biomechanically stronger and faster than the other 2 techniques.

    "abstract": "Variations of the popliteal artery are uncommon but often associated with popliteal artery injuries. Thus, in cases of popliteal artery injury, popliteal artery variations should be one of the primary differential diagnoses. Due to the poor prognosis that may result in amputation or mortality, such injuries are serious complications that can lead to medical malpractice cases. This report presents a case of a 77-year-old woman with bilateral knee osteoarthritis who sustained a popliteal artery injury during total knee arthroplasty due to the highly uncommon type II-C popliteal artery variation. In light of the current literature, the pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of this case of popliteal artery injury, as well as the necessary precautions, have been discussed. The terminal branching pattern of the popliteal artery is essential for surgical planning and the ability to treat accidental artery injuries. To reduce the risk of popliteal artery injury, it is important to discuss the need for preoperative arterial color Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging to reveal the branching pattern and structure (arteriosclerosis and obstruction) of the popliteal artery (arteriosclerosis and obstruction).",

    "abstract": "In traumatic and obstetric brachial plexus injuries, removal of the damaged nerve, repair with the nerve grafts, and nerve transfers are mostly preferred techniques. Success is directly proportional to surgical technique as it is known that end-to-end repair of the peripheral nerves gives better results. The greatest risk in end-to-end repair is the nerve rupture at the brachial plexus repair region and this cannot be detected by conventional radiological techniques.Brachial plexus injuries of obstetrical and traumatic patients were operated. If possible and at least one nerve was repaired end to end, follow-up of nerve continuity was done by titanium hemopclip insertion to both sides of the nerve repair area. A new technique nerve repair site marking was developed and end-to-end nerve repair continuity was followed simply by x-ray.This technique was used for end-to-end nerve coaptions of 38 obstetric and 40 traumatic brachial plexus injuries. Follow-up was done for 6 weeks. Every week patients sent the x-ray of the repair site. Only 3 patients had nerve repair site rupture, and revision surgery was done immediately.Nerve repair site marking technique and follow-up with only x-ray is a simple reliable, safe, and cheap method that can be applied to any end-to-end nerve repair. This technique has no morbidity or side effects. The aim of the study is to summarize or explain the nerve repair site marking technique used in the brachial plexus region.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to introduce a method to extract the 3-dimensional spatial position of the femoral head implant from 2-dimensional fluoroscopic projections, allowing surgeons to assess fixation much more accurately and prevent cut-out complications in proximal femoral nailing.To define a safety region for the tip in the femoral head, a novel 3-dimensional distance-based risk parameter called TSD3D was introduced. An intersection algorithm was developed that solely takes the fluoroscopic anteroposterior and lateral distances to reveal the 3-dimensional location of the screw or Kirschner wire tip, enabling the utilization of the 3-dimensional parameter. Orthogonal per- spectives of 6 femur proximal bone substitutes with randomly inserted Kirschner wires were imaged under fluoroscopy. The developed algorithm was used to calculate the implant tip location in 3-dimensional from 2-dimensional images for each case. Algorithm accuracy was validated with the computed tomography-obtained 3-dimensional models of the same femur substitutes.The newly introduced risk parameter successfully visualizes 3-dimensional safety regions. Utilizing the 2-dimensional fluoro- scopic distances as inputs to the algorithm, the 3-dimensional position of the implanted Kirschner wire tip is calculated with a maximum of 9.8% error for a single Cartesian-coordinate measurement comparison.By incorporating the newly introduced 3-dimensional risk parameter, surgeons can more precisely evaluate the position of the implant and avoid cut-out complications, instead of relying solely on misleading 2-dimensional fluoroscopic projections of the femoral head.",

    "abstract": "In this experimental animal study, a novel bilayered scaffold used in the treatment of osteochondral defects in rabbit knees was evaluated. This novel scaffold's upper (cartilage) layer consists of polyglycolic acid and hyaluronic acid, and the lower (bone) layer consists of β-tricalcium phosphate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of this novel scaffold, combined with or without mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in the treatment of osteochondral defects in rabbit knees.Osteochondral defects were created in the left femoral trochlea of 30 rabbits. In group A, defects were treated with scaffold combined with MSCs; in group B, defects were treated with cell-free scaffolds; and group C was a control group with defects left untreated. In the 12th week, animals were sacrificed for macroscopic evaluation.The mean International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) macroscopic scores were 4.95 for group A, 6.16 for group B, and 8.25 for group C. The mean Oswestry Arthroscopic Scores (OAS) were 1.65 for group A, 3.39 for group B, and 6.05 for group C. The macroscopic scores were significantly higher in group C than group A for ICRS scores and group A and group B for OAS (P < .001, P < .000, P < .022).In essence, our findings indicate that the newly developed osteochondral scaffold, when tested in a rabbit model, is not as effective as expected in repairing full-thickness osteochondral defects, with or without the supplementation of MSCs. Further investigation is required to enhance the effectiveness of this novel combination.",

Eight rabbits were designated as the control group and did not receive treatment. Rabbits in group 1 (G1) received 0.1 mg/kg Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intravenously and 40 mg/ kg methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MP) was administered intramuscularly for 3 days consecutively. Rabbits in group 2 (G2) were given 5 mg/kg tadalafil orally for 10 consecutive days. Starting on the eighth day, 0.1 mg/kg LPS was given, and following this 40 mg/kg MP injections were administered for 3 days. All animals were sacrificed 3 weeks after the final MP injection. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and bilateral femora were harvested. Half of the femoral head was stored for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) examination with Western blot analysis. The other half was examined microscopically for the presence of osteonecrosis.In G1, 15 out of 16 hips (93%) of the 8 rabbits had osteonecrosis compared to 8 out of 12 hips (67%) of 6 rabbits in G2 (P > .05). The VEGF expression in G2 was significantly higher than in the control group and G1 (P < .05 and P < .001, respectively). There was no significant difference in VEGF expression between the control group and G1 (P > .05).This study has shown us that femoral head osteonecrosis can be reliably induced with LPS and corticosteroid, as described in the literature. Prophylactic tadalafil use did not decrease the occurrence of osteonecrosis significantly. However, it significantly increased VEGF expression in the femoral head independent of the effects of steroids and LPS.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine whether a standard anesthetic protocol consisting of combined spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) in conjunction with controlled hypotensive anesthesia (CHA), which was used for conventional total knee arthroplasty (cTKA), could provide equally effective anesthetic conditions for robotic total knee arthroplasty (rTKA).Data were collected from the medical records of 113 patients (median age=67 years; age range=55-84) who underwent elective unilateral cTKA (n=52) or rTKA (n=61) without a tourniquet from 2021 to 2023. The primary outcome measure was the rate of patients whose anesthetic method did not provide adequate motor and sensory block during the surgery and had to be converted to general anesthesia. The secondary outcome measure was to compare perioperative variables, including pain scores, analgesic consumption, blood loss, transfusions, and complications.In 6 patients (11.5%) in group rTKA, it was required to convert CSEA to general anesthesia at 160-180 minutes due to the pain at the operative knee and/or to the movement of the operative leg during surgery compared to none / zero in group cTKA (P=.008). Motor and sensory blocks terminated earlier than the total surgery time in those patients. Mean total surgery time was significantly higher in group rTKA than in group cTKA (151.25 ± 24.51 (120-240) minutes vs. 116.72 ± 4.99 (105-125) minutes, P < .001). Total surgery times tended to decrease gradually in group rTKA after the 11th case, indicating a learning curve for surgical performance. Conversion to general anesthesia was required only in 1 patient after the 11th case compared to the previous 5 patients. Mean pain scores and rescue analgesic consumption were higher in group rTKA at postoperative 0 hour and between 0 and 4 hours (P < .05) but similar at the following time points (P > .05). Blood loss, transfusion, and complication rates were similar (P > .05). Hospital discharge times were higher in group rTKA (P < .05).Although our standard CSEA protocol failed due to the regression of motor and sensory block during surgery in 11.5% of patients in rTKA, the CSEA technique combined with controlled hypotensive anesthesia provided similar anesthetic conditions in the remaining patients in group rTKA as in group cTKA. The CSEA may be considered an effective and safe anesthetic method for rTKA if interventions are applied to extend the duration of the CSEA for this novel surgical technique.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "Disparity in size between femoral head and acetabulum could promote premature degeneration of the hip joint. The purpose of this study was to report the results of Kawamura's dome osteotomy for acetabular dysplasia due to sequelae of Perthes' disease.Fourteen patients (14 hips) operated between 1999 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. There were 9 males and 5 females with a mean age of 29 years (range, 15-54 years). Functional and radiological results were reviewed at mean follow-up of 9 years (range, 4-12 years).Pain relief was obtained in 13 of 14 (92.8%) patients postoperatively. Good to excellent functional outcome was obtained in 10 of 14 (71.4%) patients. Mean Harris hip score was improved from 63 to 84 (p < 0.05) at the final follow-up. Improvement of limping gait was observed in 10 of 14 (71.4%) patients. Center edge angle improved from mean 24° (11-36°) preoperatively to mean 35° (27-46°) postoperatively (p < 0.05), acetabular angle improved from mean 43° (36-49°) preoperatively to mean 37° (32-44°) postoperatively (p < 0.05), acetabular head index improved from mean 69% (50-83%) preoperatively to mean 85% (73-100%) postoperatively (p < 0.05). Progression of arthrosis stage occurred in 3 of 14 (21%) patients. None of the hip with preoperative Stulberg III, 2 of 9 hips with Stulberg IV and 2 of 2 hips with Stulberg V needed conversion to total hip arthroplasty during the follow-up.Dome osteotomy of the pelvis combined with trochanteric advancement could give a reasonable treatment outcome for acetabular dysplasia due to Perthes' disease at mid to long-term follow-up. Advanced stage of arthrosis, preoperative Stulberg V and no improvement of limping gait after the surgery possibly associated with poor outcome.Level IV, therapeutic study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate ErbB2 expression in osteochondroma and its relationship with clinicopathologic features of osteochondroma, so as to identify a new biomarker for the malignant transformation potential of osteochondroma.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to investigate the expression status of ErbB2 protein and gene in 30 osteochondroma tissues and 20 non-neoplastic bone tissues. The association of ErbB2 gene and protein expression with clinicopathological parameters of osteochondroma was analyzed by using the χ2 test and Fishers exact test.ErbB2 protein was found to be over-expressed in 4 of 30 (13.3%) osteochondromas and 1 of 20 (5%) non-neoplastic bone samples, which were not statistically significant (p=0.336). However, 13 of the 30 (43.3%) osteochondromas showed ErbB2 gene amplification, which was failed to be observed in any of the non-neoplastic bone tissue. ErbB2 gene amplification in osteochondroma was significantly higher compared with that in non-neoplastic bone tissue (p=0.001). In addition, the ErbB2 gene amplification was closely associated with clinical pathological parameters of osteochondroma, including high expression of cellularity (p=0.001), presence of binucleated cells (p=0.001), nuclear pleomorphism (p=0.003), calcification (p=0.002), nodularity (p=0.002), necrosis (p=0.009) and cartilage thickness (p=0.026). The association of the gene amplification with other clinicopathological parameters of osteochondroma, including permeation of trabecular bone, cystic/mucoid changes, mitosis, radiographic appearance, cap volume and subtype of osteochondroma was not observed. The over-expression of ErbB2 protein was not found to be associated with the above stated clinical pathological parameters of osteochondroma.ErbB2 gene amplification was associated with adverse clinicopathological status of osteochondroma and could serve as an index for malignant conversion of osteochondroma. Further research is required to verify the predictive values of ErbB2 for osteochondroma.Level IV, Diagnostic Study.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This study aimed to radiologically assess the relationship between the tilt angle of the bipolar radial head prostheses and radiocapitellar instability. METHODS In this radiological study, 28 consecutive patients (13 females and 15 males: mean age=47 years and age range=23-77 years) who underwent cemented bipolar radial head arthroplasty (Judet CRF II) because of comminuted radial head fracture with elbow instability were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS There was excellent intra- and interobserver reliability for the measurements of the tilt angle and the radiocapitellar distance. ICC for interobserver reliability of the tilt angle was 0.93, and ICC for intraobserver reliability for the 2 observers was 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. ICC for interobserver reliability of the radiocapitellar distance was 0.87, and ICC for intraobserver reliability for the 2 observers was 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. The mean tilt angle was 17.6° (range=1°-35°), and the mean radiocapitellar distance was 8 mm (range=1-17 mm). Pearson's correlation revealed a strong significant positive correlation between the tilt angle and the radiocapitellar distance (r=0.77 and p<0.001). CONCLUSION Evidence from this study has demonstrated a strong positive correlation between the tilt angle of bipolar radial head prostheses and radiocapitellar instability. The tilt angle can be used as an indicator of radiocapitellar joint instability following bipolar radial head prostheses. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV, Diagnostic study.",

The accompanying symptoms, blood loss, operation time , fracture healing time, and postoperative complications were observed and recorded. Patients were followed up retrospectively with routine post-operation visits for clinical and radiographic examination. The reduction quality was evaluated according to Matta criterion. Clinical and nerve function outcomes were evaluated by Majeed and Gibbons criterion.The mean follow-up time was 15 months (range = 12-21 months). The mean blood loss and operation time were 24.6 ± 6.7mL and 30.5 ± 3.47 mins, respectively. Patients experienced early weight-bearing ability and no fracture reduction loss. Due to Matta criterion for fracture reduction, the results were excellent in 16 cases, good in 9 cases, and fair in 1 case. Due to Majeed functional scoring at the last follow-up, the results were excellent in 17 cases, good in 9 cases. Of 3 patients in whom neurologic impairment was detected preoperatively, 2 achieved complete recovery, and 1 achieved partial improvement postoperatively.As a new surgical concept in the management of Tile B3 pelvic fractures, HTO seems to provide the following advantages: horizontal triangular fixation, minimally invasive incisions, less blood loss, and permitting early weight-bearing ability. However, there still exist several problems regarding the technique and the option of implants.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether bipolar radial head arthroplasty may transfer less load to the capitellum than monopolar radial head arthroplasty and native radial heads.Six human elbow joints were obtained from six fresh frozen cadavers (3 males, 3 females; mean age = 78 years, age range = 66-80). None of the elbow joints had a previous osseous injury, a chondral defect, osteoarthritis, or instability. In group 1, load transfer of the native radial head was measured in each specimen under 100 N of compression force using a custom-made load cell at 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° flexion of the elbow in supination, neutral rotation, and pronation, respectively. After excision of the radial heads, the same testing protocol was first applied for monopolar radial head arthroplasty (Group 2) and then for bipolar radial head arthroplasty (Group 3).The mean load transfer on the capitellum was significantly higher in each forearm rotation and all angles of the elbow flexion in the arthroplasty groups than the native radial head group. Mean load transfer values of bipolar prostheses were between the values of native radial heads and monopolar prostheses in all positions. Bipolar prostheses showed similar load transfer characteristics compared to those of the native radial head in supination at 60° flexion; in neutral rotation at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 120° flexion; and in pronation at 90° and 120° flexion.The results of this study have revealed that bipolar radial head arthroplasty transfers similar loading as the native radial head on the capitellum in certain forearm positions and at elbow flexion angles. No significant differences could be found between load transfer values of bipolar head design and monopolar head design except in the pronation at full extension.",

A total of 196 pediatric patients (41 females, 155 males) were retrospectively evaluated. The radiographs on admission were analyzed in terms of fracture type, location of the fracture, presence/location of the fibula fracture as well as initial angulation in both planes, translation, and the time of definitive cast. On radiographs taken after closed reduction and final casting, angulation in the coronal and sagittal planes, amount of translation (%), CI, GI, and TPI were measured. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors of re-displacement.Of 196 patients, 46 developed re-displacement (23%). Age (P : 0.029), initial translation (P : 0.006), post-reduction translation (P : 0.001), and post-reduction AP angulation (P : 0.002) were found statistically significant. Mean CI and GI were higher in re-displacement group (P : 0.033, 0.036, respectively). According to multivariate logistic regression analysis postreduction AP angulation, post-reduction translation, and cast index were found independent risk factors.One should carefully evaluate patients who underwent CRC due to tibia fracture with CI > 1.02, post-reduction AP angulation > 3.4°, and post-reduction translation > 24.3° in terms of occurrence of re-displacement.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

All patients underwent postoperative serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Demographic and operative characteristics were recorded. MRIs were evaluated for osseous cyst formation, and tunnel volume was measured. Statistical analyses were performed to detect differences in the serial MRI follow-up observation.A total of 39 ASAs were evaluated. Osseous cyst formation was found in two ASAs (5.1%) at the 6-month follow-up. Tunnel expansion was significantly observed in both 3- and 6-month postoperative MRI evaluations (P < 0.001). The mean tunnel volume significantly increased 1.95 times at the 3-month follow-up and 2.84 times at the 6-month follow-up (P < 0.001).Evidence from this study has revealed low rates of cyst formation but significant increases in tunnel volume at the early follow-up following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with ASAs.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate biomechanically the effects of onlay fibula grafts on Vancouver Type B1 Periprosthetic Femoral Fractures (PPFs).Vancouver Type B1 PFF models were created in 25 fourth-generation synthetic femurs and fixed with locking plates using bicortical, unicortical screws, and cables. While no graft was used in group 1, onlay fibula grafts were placed anteriorly in group 2 and medially in group 3. In group 4, the cortical strut allograft was placed on the medial femoral cortex, and a locking compression plate (LCP) was applied to the lateral femoral cortex. In group 5, the strut allograft was placed over the anterior cortex of the femur and fixed with the same technique as in group 4. All models were then subjected to rotational and axial cyclical stiffness tests and load to failure to measure and compare the mechanical strengths of the constructs.The mean stiffness values of group 4 with medial allograft, before and after cyclical loading, were higher than all other groups, under both rotational and axial forces. The mean stiffness values of fibula autografts (groups 2 and 3) were similar to that of anterior allografts (group 5) in each test except that the mean initial axial stiffness of group 5 was higher than group 2. Failure loads were also not different between the groups.Although the rigidity of Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic femur fractures is highest if allografts are placed medially, fibula autografts can also provide similar fixation strengths to allografts if locking plates with unicortical and bicortical screws and cables are used.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of 2-stage treatment of upper and lower extremity deformities in patients with thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome.Four patients (3 female, 1 male) with a mean age of 1.8 years (range 1-4) were included in the study. The patients were followed up for an average of 5.5 years. All 4 patients had bilateral radial longitudinal deficiency, whereas only 2 patients had bilateral fixed knee contractures. A 2-stage surgical procedure was implemented. The surgical procedure performed for radial longitudinal deficiency consisted of distraction with an Ilizarov frame in the first stage, followed by centralization performed in the second stage. Knee contractures were first treated using an Ilizarov frame, followed by a hamstring tendon transfer in the second procedure. Radiological evaluation of the radial longitudinal deficiency was done by measuring hand-forearm angle, hand-forearm position, and ulnar bowing preoperatively and at postoperative follow-ups. Knee contracture was evaluated by measuring the angle preoperatively and at postoperative follow-ups.The mean hand-forearm angle values of patients at preoperative assessment, early postoperative period, and at the last follow-ups were 82.60, 5,80, and 11.10, respectively (P < .001). The hand-forearm position values were -14.25 mm, +11, and +7.1 mm, respectively (P < .001). The ulnar bowing values were 7.3°, 4.5°, and 2.9°, respectively (P < .001). Recurrence of the radial longitudinal deficiency deformity requiring surgery occurred in 1 patient. In the other 3 patients, some deformity recurred but did not require surgical intervention. In addition, 1 patient with knee flexion contracture had a recurrence of the contracture that did not require surgical intervention. There was no circulatory disorder or skin necrosis in the lower or upper extremities of the patients.This study has shown us that two-stage treatment is a reliable method for lower and upper extremity deformities accompanying thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome. However, recurrence is still a major problem.Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

Six cups (5.2%) had a thin (less than 1 mm) radiolucentline without signs of loosening or clinical manifestation, but under close followup. The wear was not significative at the end of the follow up. The mean HarrisHip Score increased from 45.7 (range = 28 to 65) preoperatively to 89.8 (range= 87 to 96) at the final follow-up. Subjectiveevaluation showed excellent results in 82.6%, good in 8.6%, fair in 5.9%, andpoor in 2.9% of the cases. Eight patients, 3 stems, and 5 cups (5% of the series)were revised, the survival of the series was 95% when the failure was the needfor additional acetabular or femoral revision surgery for any reason. If wedefine failure as the need for an acetabular revision for some reason, thesurvival was (97.5%). When we evaluated survival only for aseptic loosening ofthe cup at 10 years of follow-up, 98.4% of the implants survived.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to present a novel pre-planned distal radius sliding rotational osteotomy that can address all deformities in dorsally angulated distal radius malunion through a volar approach using a locking plate. Four consecutive adult women with symptomatic dorsally angulated distal radius malunion were surgically treated with sliding rotational osteotomy. All the patients underwent preoperative Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores, a series of radiography, and a course of physiotherapy. The osteotomy was planned on 2 orthogonal radiographs, and the surgery was performed through a volar approach. A back slab was applied post-operatively for two weeks and changed to a removable splint for further four weeks. Gentle active movements out of splint were permitted at two weeks, and formal physiotherapy at six weeks post-operatively. Radiographs were taken immediately post-operatively, at three months, and with DASH scores at a mean final follow-up of 18 months. On radiographic evaluation, all the deformities were corrected within an acceptable range. The mean increase in radial inclination was 6.5 degrees. The mean gain in radial height was 2.95 mm. The mean improvement in ulnar variance was 4.25 mm. The mean change from dorsal to volar angulation was 23 degrees, and the mean improvement in the DASH score was 45.25 at a mean final follow-up of 16 months. All osteotomies achieved bony union within 3 months postoperatively. None of the patients required metalwork removal, and no complications were observed. Sliding rotational osteotomy appears to be a safe technique to correct deformity and improve function in patients with dorsally angulated, shortened, and radially deviated distal radius malunion.",

In this study, ten fresh-frozen cadaveric upper extremities from five donors with a mean age of 69 ± 12 years were used. Two cortical pins were inserted in the radius and the ulna. In a custom-made device, different forearm (30°, 60°, and 90° of pronation and supination) and elbow positions (full extension) were tested, using a fluoroscopic analysis. The degree of malrotation between the two pins was measured in these positions. At the last test sequence, the tendon of the brachioradialis muscle was released. A significant difference was found in concerns of the rotational angle between the distal fragment and the radial shaft at different degrees of pronation and supination if the elbow joint was in an extended and flexed position. The release of the brachioradialis tendon did not show any effect. The results of this study supported that rotational malpositions in distal radius fractures can be decreased if the forearm is in a neutral position. Accordingly, the forearm should be in a neutral position while initially immobilization in a plaster splint is performed.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological results of three different techniques (plate-screw, tension band, and intramedullary nail) in the fixation of olecranon osteotomy in patients with intercondylar fracture of the distal humerus surgically treated by the olecranon osteotomy approach.Between January 2010 and December 2018, the study was initiated with 52 patients who underwent an olecranon osteotomy approach for an AO Type C distal humerus fracture. Thirty-seven patients (19 male, 18 female) who had regular control data and a final control examination were included in the study. In osteotomy fixation, we used tension band (K wire cerclage + Screw cerclage) in 20 patients, plate-screw in eight patients, and intramedullary nail fixation in nine patients. The functional evaluation included a measurement of the range of joint motion (flexion, extension, supination, pronation); MAYO elbow performance score; disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score; and comparative grip strength measurement, and a subjective pain assessment was performed using the visual analogue scale.The mean duration of follow-up was 44 (12-84) months. The mean time to union was 14 (7-32) weeks in patients that achieved union. The mean DASH score was 22 (0-72.7), the meanMAYOelbow performance score was 84 (35-100), and the mean VAS score was 3 (1-7). The mean grip strength was 32 (8-64) kgw in the treated extremity and 37 (17-70) kgw in the intact extremity. No statistically significant difference was detected between olecranon osteotomy fixation methods (tension band, plate-screw osteosynthesis, and intramedullary nailing) in terms of union time, DASH score, MAYO scale score, VAS score, extension, supination, and pronation (P > 0.05). The average grip strength (kgw) was lower than that in the uninvolved extremity, and this ratio was statistically significant (P = 0.04).The results of this study have shown that successful and comparable radiological and functional outcomes can be obtained by all the three different olecranon osteotomy techniques in the surgical treatment of intercondylar fracture of the distal humerus.Level III, Therapeutic Study.",
