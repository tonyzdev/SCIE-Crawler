    "abstract": "Selective laser melting (SLM) is widely gaining popularity as an alternative manufacturing technique for complex and customized parts. SLM is a near net shape process with minimal post processing machining required dependent upon final application. The fact that SLM produces little waste and enables more optimal designs also raises opportunities for environmental advantages. The use of aluminium (Al) alloys in SLM is still quite limited due to difficulties in processing that result in parts with high degrees of porosity. However, Al alloys are favoured in many high-end applications for their exceptional strength and stiffness to weight ratio meaning that they are extensively used in the automotive and aerospace industries. This study investigates the windows of parameters required to produce high density parts from AlSi10Mg alloy using selective laser melting. A compromise between the different parameters and scan strategies was achieved and used to produce parts achieving a density of 99.8%.",

    "abstract": "Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a 3D printing technique which allows layer-by-layer build-up of a part by the deposition of thermoplastic material through a nozzle. The technique allows for complex shapes to be made with a degree of design freedom unachievable with traditional manufacturing methods. However, the mechanical properties of the thermoplastic materials used are low compared to common engineering materials. In this work, composite 3D printing feedstocks for FFF are investigated, wherein carbon fibres are embedded into a thermoplastic matrix to increase strength and stiffness. First, the key processing parameters for FFF are reviewed, showing how fibres alter the printing dynamics by changing the viscosity and the thermal profile of the printed material. The state-of-the-art in composite 3D printing is presented, showing a distinction between short fibre feedstocks versus continuous fibre feedstocks. An experimental study was performed to benchmark these two methods. It is found that printing of continuous carbon fibres using the MarkOne printer gives significant increases in performance over unreinforced thermoplastics, with mechanical properties in the same order of magnitude of typical unidirectional epoxy matrix composites. The method, however, is limited in design freedom as the brittle continuous carbon fibres cannot be deposited freely through small steering radii and sharp angles. Filaments with embedded short carbon microfibres (∼100 μm) show better print capabilities and are suitable for use with standard printing methods, but only offer a slight increase in mechanical properties over the pure thermoplastic properties. It is hypothesized that increasing the fibre length in short fibre filament is expected to lead to increased mechanical properties, potentially approaching those of continuous fibre composites, whilst keeping the high degree of design freedom of the FFF process.",

    "abstract": "In laser powder bed fusion, melt pool dynamics and stability are driven by the temperature field in the melt pool. If the temperature field is unfavourable defects are likely to form. The localised and rapid heating and cooling in the process presents a challenge for the experimental methods used to measure temperature. As a result, understanding of these process fundamentals is limited. In this paper a method is developed that uses coaxial imaging with high-speed cameras to give both the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to resolve the surface temperature of the melt pool. A two wavelength imaging setup is used to account for changes in emissivity. Temperature fields are captured at 100 kHz with a resolution of 20 μm during the processing of a simple Ti6Al4V component. Thermal gradients in the range 5–20 K/μm and cooling rates in range 1–40 K/μs are measured. The results presented give new insight into the effect of parameters, geometry and scan path on the melt pool temperature and cooling rates. The method developed here provides a new tool to assist in optimising scan strategies and parameters, identifying the causes of defect prone locations and controlling cooling rates for local microstructure development.",

However, the building components and 3D-printing processes need to be modeled appropriately. In this paper, the current state of AM in construction is reviewed. AM processes and systems as well as their application in research and construction projects are presented.

Key results include the characterisation of several failure modes in double gyroid lattices made of Al-Si10-Mg, the elimination of brittle fracture and low-strain failure by the application of a heat treatment, and the calculation of specific energy absorption under compressive deformation (16 × 106 J m−3 up to 50% strain). These results demonstrate the suitability of double gyroid lattices for energy absorbing applications, and will enable the design and manufacture of more efficient lightweight parts in the future.",

The proposed strategies are evaluated for mechanical performance and assessed for AM specific design related manufacturing considerations. From a manufacturing stand-point, support structure requirement decreases with increased extent of latticing, whereas the design-to-manufacture discrepancies and the processing efforts, both in terms of memory requirements and time, increase. Results from Finite Element (FE) analysis for the two loading scenarios considered: intended loading, and variability in loading, provide insight into the solution optimality and robustness of the design strategies. Lattice strategies that capitalised on TO results were found to be considerably (∼40–50%) superior in terms of specific stiffness when compared to the structures where this was not the case. The Graded strategy was found to be the most desirable from both the design and manufacturing perspective. The presented pros-and-cons for the various proposed design strategies aim to provide insight into their suitability in meeting the challenges faced by the AM design community.",

    "abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing, despite of offering unique capabilities e.g. unlimited design freedom, short manufacturing time, etc., suffers from raft of intrinsic defects. Porosity is of the defects which can badly deteriorate a part’s performance. In this respect, enabling one to observe and predict the porosity during this process is of high importance. To this end, in this work a combined numerical and experimental approach has been used to analyze the formation, evolution and disappearance of keyhole and keyhole-induced porosities along with their initiating mechanisms, during single track L-PBF of a Ti6Al4V alloy. In this respect, a high-fidelity numerical model based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and accomplished in the commercial software Flow-3D is developed. The model accounts for the major physics taking place during the laser-scanning step of the L-PBF process. To better simulate the actual laser-material interaction, multiple reflection with the ray-tracing method has been implemented along with the Fresnel absorption function. The results show that during the keyhole regime, the heating rises dramatically compared to the shallow-depth melt pool regime due to the large entrapment of laser rays in the keyhole cavities. Also a detailed parametric study is performed to investigate the effect of input power on thermal absorptivity, heat transfer and melt pool anatomy. Furthermore, an X-ray Computed Tomography (X-CT) analysis is carried out to visualize the pores formed during the L-PBF process. It is shown, that the predicted shape, size and depth of the pores are in very good agreement with those found by either X-CT or optical and 3D digital microscopic images.",

However, the absence of a clear link between the powder characteristics and the LPBF performances complicates the development, selection and quality control of LPBF powder feedstock. In this work, three Ti-6Al-4 V powder lots produced by two different techniques, namely, plasma atomization and gas atomization, were selected and characterized. Following the micro-computed tomography analysis of the powder particles' morphology, size and density, the flowability of these powder lots was concurrently evaluated using Hall and Gustavsson flowmeters and an FT4 powder rheometer. Using established rheology-based criteria, a figure of merit was proposed to quantify the overall powder suitability for the LPBF process. Next, the same three powder lots were used to 3D-print and post-process a series of testing specimens with different layer thicknesses and build orientations, in order to establish a correlation between the powder characteristics and the geometric and mechanical properties of a final product. This study demonstrates that the use of highly spherical powders with a limited amount of fine particles promotes their flowability and yields LPBF components with improved mechanical and geometric characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring a revolution due to its unique production paradigm. It offers the prospect of mass customization, flexible production, on-demand and decentralized manufacturing. However, a number of challenges stem from not only the complexity of manufacturing systems but the demand for increasingly complex and high-quality products, in terms of design principles, standardization and quality control. These challenges build up barriers to the widespread adoption of AM in the industry and the in-depth research of AM in academia. To tackle the challenges, machine learning (ML) technologies rise to play a critical role as they are able to provide effective ways to quality control, process optimization, modelling of complex systems, and energy management. Hence, this paper employs a systematic literature review method as it is a defined and methodical way of identifying, assessing, and analysing published literature. Then, a keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis are employed for analysing relevant literature. Several aspects of AM, including Design for AM (DfAM), material analytics, in situ monitoring and defect detection, property prediction and sustainability, have been clustered and summarized to present state-of-the-art research in the scope of ML for AM. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of ML for AM are uncovered and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Accurate detection, characterization, and prediction of defects has great potential for immediate impact in the production of fully-dense and defect free metal additive manufacturing (AM) builds. Accordingly, this paper presents Defect Structure Process Maps (DSPMs) as a means of quantifying the role of porosity as an exemplary defect structure in powder bed printed materials. Synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (μSXCT) was used to demonstrate that metal AM defects follow predictable trends within processing parameter space for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) materials. Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks were fabricated on an EOS M290 utilizing variations in laser power, scan velocity, and hatch spacing. In general, characteristic under-melting or lack-of-fusion defects were discovered in the low laser power, high scan velocity region of process space via μSXCT. These defects were associated with insufficient overlap between adjacent melt tracks and can be avoided through the application of a lack-of-fusion criterion using melt pool geometric modeling. Large-scale keyhole defects were also successfully mitigated for estimated melt pool morphologies associated with shallow keyhole front wall angles. Process variable selections resulting in deep keyholes, i.e., high laser power and low scan velocity, exhibit a substantial increase of spherical porosity as compared to the nominal (manufacturer recommended) processing parameters for Ti-6Al-4 V. Defects within fully-dense process space were also discovered, and are associated with gas porosity transfer to the AM test blocks during the laser-powder interaction. Overall, this work points to the fact that large-scale defects in LPBF materials can be successfully predicted and thus mitigated/minimized via appropriate selection of processing parameters.",

    "abstract": "Synthesis and manufacturing of polymers and their composites have been a topic of interest recently in research and development owing to their wide margin of superiority over traditionally employed industrial materials. Polymer composites provide a higher strengths, easily customizable product properties, flexible manufacturing processes, high resistance to corrosion or erosion, and lower cost. In addition, the additive manufacturing (AM) techniques for polymer composites offer numerous benefits, including higher accuracy, lesser cost, and complexity of fabricated parts. The recent progress in AM processes has paved the way for even a broader range of design flexibilities and materials selection for several industrial sectors, including mechanical, biomedical, filtration, and electrical. However, some challenges remain in additive manufacturing for polymer composites. Vat photopolymerization (VP) processes is an AM technique that provides a benefit of relatively lower cost and higher resolutions; therefore, a comparative review of VP processes for polymers and polymer composites and their applications is presented in this study. This study aims to provide researchers with an updated understanding of the underlying challenges and opportunities. It will also help the reader to systematically reveal the research problems, gaps and future directions related to polymer composite materials and VP processes.",

    "abstract": "The Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) system can print structures on the order of several meters at high extrusion rates, thereby having the potential to significantly impact automotive, aerospace and energy sectors. The functional use of such parts, however, may be limited by mechanical anisotropy, in which the strength of printed parts across successive layers in the build direction (z-direction) can be significantly lower than the corresponding in-plane strength (x-y directions). This has been primarily attributed to poor bonding between printed layers since the lower layers cool below the glass transition temperature (Tg) before the next layer is deposited. Therefore, the potential of using infrared heating is considered for increasing the surface temperature of the printed layer just prior to deposition of new material to improve the interlayer strength of the components. This study found significant improvements in bond strength for the deposition of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) reinforced with 20% chopped carbon fiber when the surface temperature of the substrate material was increased from below Tg to close to or above Tg using infrared heating.",

    "abstract": "Process monitoring and sensing is widely used across many industries for quality assurance, and for increasing machine uptime and reliability. Though still in the emergent stages, process monitoring is beginning to see strong adoption in the additive manufacturing community through the use of process sensors recording a wide range of optical, acoustic and thermal signals. The ability to acquire these signals in a holistic manner, coupled with intelligence-based machine control has the potential to make additive manufacturing a robust and competitive alternative to conventional fabrication techniques. This paper presents an overview of the state-of the art of in-situ process monitoring in laser powder bed fusion processes and highlights some current limitations and areas for advancement. Also presented is an overview of real-time process control requirements, which when combined with the emergent process monitoring tools, will eventually allow for in-depth process control of the powder bed fusion process, which is essential for wide-scale industrial credibility and adoption of this technology.",

In order to achieve this goal, obtaining a homogeneous microstructure and eliminating material defects within the fabricated parts are important research issues. The objective of this experimental study is to evaluate the effect of thermal post-processing of AlSi10Mg parts, using recycled powder, with the aim of improving the microstructure homogeneity of the as-built parts. This work is essential for the cost-effective additive manufacturing (AM) of metal optics and optomechanical systems. To achieve this goal, a full characterization of fresh and recycled powder was performed, in addition to a microstructure assessment of the as-built fabricated samples. Annealing, solution heat treatment (SHT) and T6 heat treatment (T6 HT) were applied under different processing conditions. The results demonstrated an improvement in microstructure homogeneity after thermal post-processing under specific conditions of SHT and T6 HT. A micro-hardness map was developed to assist in the selection of the optimized post-processing parameters in order to satisfy the design requirements of the part.",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulations have recently shown their potential as a robust, cheap and reliable tool for predicting the quality of components produced by metal additive manufacturing (MAM) processes.Despite the advantages of the MAM processes over conventional manufacturing methods, there is still a lack of thorough understanding on how different defects can form and originate during MAM processing.In that respect, advanced numerical techniques recently developed have the ability to predict the occurrence of such defects.These techniques have paved the way to efficiently obtain the optimal processing window for targeted mechanical properties to satisfy the end-use design requirements.The aim of this review paper is hence to present and classify numerical simulations of MAM, not solely based on their length-scale as often seen, but also based on the involved physics, as well as the modeling strategies at both the meso-scale and part-scale.The paper is arranged in the following way: First, literature describing purely conduction-based heat transfer simulations at meso-scale are presented.This is followed by a review of fluid-based simulations of increasing complexity based on the treatment of free surface of the melt pool at meso-scale.Finally, contributions based on different part-scale modeling approaches with a focus on thermo-mechanical behavior are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "This paper clarified a novel strategy to improve the tensile properties of the Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb alloys fabricated by electron beam melting (EBM), via the finding of the development of unique layered microstructure composed of duplex-like fine grains layers and coarser γ grains layers. It was clarified that the mechanical properties of the alloy fabricated by EBM can be controlled by varying an angle θ between EBM-building directions and stress loading direction. At room temperature, the yield strength exhibits high values more than 550 MPa at all the loading orientations investigated (θ = 0, 45 and 90°). In addition, the elongation at θ = 45° was surprisingly larger than 2%, owing to the development of this unique layered microstructure. The anisotropy of the yield strength decreased with increasing temperature. All the examined alloys exhibited a brittle-ductile transition temperature of approximately 750 °C and the yield strength and tensile elongation at 800 °C were over 350 MPa and 40%, respectively. By the detailed observation of the microstructure, the formation mechanism of the unique layered microstructure was found to be closely related to the repeated local heat treatment effect during the EBM process, and thus its control is further possible by the tuning-up of the process parameters. The results demonstrate that the EBM process enables not only the fabrication of TiAl products with complex shape but also the control of the tensile properties associated with the peculiar microstructure formed during the process.",

The location-specific flow patterns in different regions of the melt pool are revealed and quantified under both conduction-mode and depression-mode melting. The physical processes at different locations in the melt pool are identified. The full-field melt-flow mapping approach reported here opens the way to study the detailed melt-flow dynamics under real additive manufacturing conditions. The results obtained provide crucial insights into laser additive manufacturing processes and are critical for developing reliable high-fidelity computational models.",

    "abstract": "Despite its many benefits, Selective Laser Melting's (SLM) relatively low productivity compared to deposition-based additive manufacturing techniques is a major drawback. Increasing the laser beam diameter improves SLM's build rate, but causes loss of precision. The aim of this study is to investigate laser beam focus shift, or \"defocus\", using a dynamic focusing unit, in order to increase the laser spot size. When applied to the SLM process, focus shift can be integrated into a \"hull-core\" strategy. This involves scanning the core with a high productivity parameter set using defocus while enabling return to the focused smaller spot size position for hull scanning. To assess the process stability, single line scans were made from 316L stainless steel powder. The consolidated melt pool morphology was analyzed and correlated with the process parameters comprising laser power, scanning speed and defocus distance. In order to link the melt pool morphology with the heat input, Volumetric Energy Density, Normalized Enthalpy and Rosenthal equation were considered. The suitability of using the Normalized Enthalpy as a design parameter to predict the melt pool depth and Rosenthal equation to predict its width was highlighted. This study shows that within a single laser setup, implementing defocus can lead to a potential productivity increase by 840%, i.e. to 18.8 mm3/s.",

With the view of transferring WAAM to the industry and qualifying the manufacturing process for applications such as structural components, the quality of the produced parts needs to be assured. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to review the main NDT techniques and assess the capability of detecting WAAM defects, for inspection either in a monitoring, in-process or post-process scenario. Radiography and ultrasonic testing were experimentally tested on reference specimens in order to compare the techniques capabilities. Metallographic, hardness and electrical conductivity analysis were also applied to the same specimens for material characterization. Experimental outcomes prove that typical WAAM defects can be detected by the referred techniques. The electrical conductivity measurement may complement or substitute some destructive methods used in AM processing.",

Due to the laterally restrained geometry, application to thick walls and intersecting features required the development of a new ‘inverted profile’ roller. A larger radii roller increased the extent of the recrystallised area, providing a more uniform grain size, and higher loads increased the amount of refinement. Electron backscatter diffraction showed that the majority of the strain is generated toward the edges of the rolled groove, up to 3 mm below the rolled surface. These results will help facilitate future optimisation of the rolling process and industrialisation of WAAM for large-scale titanium components.",

    "abstract": "Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) of additively manufactured metals is a widely adopted and effective method to improve the density and microstructure homogeneity within geometrically-complex metal structures fabricated with laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The role of pores in the fatigue performance of additively manufactured metal parts is increasingly being recognized as a critical factor and HIP post-processing is now heralded as a method to eliminate pores, especially for high-criticality applications such as in the aerospace industry. Despite the widely reported positive influence on fatigue performance and high efficiency of pore closure, examples have been reported in which pores have not been entirely closed or have subsequently re-opened upon heat treatment. A variety of porosity distributions and types of pores may be present in parts produced by LBPF and the effectiveness of pore closure may differ depending on these pore characteristics. In this work, X-ray tomography was employed to provide insights into pore closure efficiency by HIP for an intentional and artificially-induced cavity as well as for a range of typical process-induced pores (lack of fusion, keyhole, contour pores, etc.) in coupon samples of Ti6Al4V. The same samples were imaged non-destructively before and after HIP and aligned carefully for side-by-side viewing. High pore closure efficiency is demonstrated for all types of cavities and pores investigated, but near-surface pores of all types are shown to be problematic to varying degrees, in some cases perforating the superficial surface and creating new external notches. Subsequent heat treatments (annealing after HIP) in some cases resulted in internal pore reopening for previously closed internal pores as well as a new “blistering” effect observed for some near-surface pores, which the authors believe is reported for the first time. Implications of these results for quality control and HIP processing of LPBF parts are discussed. Finally, the utility of using HIP to consolidate intentionally-unmelted powder in order to improve production rates of powder bed fusion has great potential and is preliminarily demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an attractive technology of manufacturing high-strength aluminium alloy parts for the aircraft and automobile industries, limited by poor processability of these alloys. This work was aimed at finding the process window for the LPBF manufacturing of defect-free components of AA7075 alloy. Optimization of the parameters was performed at each stage of the multi-stage research, i.e. for single tracks, thin walls and volumetric specimens. At each stage, the relation between LPBF parameters and defect formation with a focus on hot cracking was investigated and discussed. Due to the optimization of process parameters, the density of volumetric specimens above 99 % was reached and vaporization losses of the alloying elements were significantly reduced, but solidification cracks could not be eliminated. It was found that solidification cracks were formed by the liquid film rupture mode, mainly along columnar grain boundaries. The EDS microanalysis showed intergranular microsegregation, not only of the main alloying elements (Zn, Mg, Cu) but also of minor elements such as Si. Silicon may play a significant role in increasing susceptibility to cracking by increasing the stability of the liquid film. Reduction in the silicon impurity content in the AA7075 powder gives a chance to reduce susceptibility to cracking with no change of the alloy specification.",

    "abstract": "The high thermal gradients experienced during manufacture via selective laser melting commonly result in cracking of high γ/γ′ Nickel based superalloys. Such defects cannot be tolerated in applications where component integrity is of paramount importance. To overcome this, many industrial practitioners make use of hot isostatic pressing to ‘heal’ these defects. The possibility of such defects re-opening during the component life necessitates optimisation of SLM processing parameters in order to produce the highest bulk density and integrity in the as-built state. In this paper, novel fractal scanning strategies based upon mathematical fill curves, namely the Hilbert and Peano-Gosper curve, are explored in which the use of short vector length scans, in the order of 100 μm, is used as a method of reducing residual stresses. The effect on cracking observed in CM247LC superalloy samples was analysed using image processing, comparing the novel fractal scan strategies to more conventional ‘island’ scans. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilised to determine the cracking mechanisms. Results show that cracking occurs via two mechanisms, solidification and liquation, with a strong dependence on the laser scan vectors. Through the use of fractal scan strategies, bulk density can be increased by 2 ± 0.7% when compared to the ‘island’ scanning, demonstrating the potential of fractal scan strategies in the manufacture of typically ‘unweldable’ nickel superalloys.",

    "abstract": "Size and shape of a melt pool play a critical role in determining the microstructure in additively manufactured metals. However, it is very challenging to directly characterize the size and shape of the melt pool beneath the surface of the melt pool during the additive manufacturing process. Here, we report the direct observation and quantification of melt pool variation during the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process under constant input energy density by in-situ high-speed high-energy x-ray imaging. We show that the melt pool can undergo different melting regimes and both the melt pool dimension and melt pool volume can have orders-of-magnitude change under a constant input energy density. Our analysis shows that the significant melt pool variation cannot be solely explained by the energy dissipation rate. We found that energy absorption changes significantly under a constant input energy density, which is another important cause of melt pool variation. Our further analysis reveals that the significant change in energy absorption originates from the separate roles of laser power and scan speed in depression zone development. The results reported here are important for understanding the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process and guiding the development of better metrics for processing parameter design.",

    "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing (AM) enables the production of geometrically complex parts that are difficult to manufacture by other means. However, conventional CAD systems are limited in the representation of such parts. This issue is exacerbated when lattice structures are combined or embedded within a complex geometry. This paper presents a computationally efficient, voxel-based method of generating lattices comprised of practically any cell type that can conform to an arbitrary external geometry. The method of conforming involves the tessellation and trimming of unit cells that can leave 'hanging' struts at the surface, which is a possible point of weakness in the structure. A method of joining these struts to form an external two dimensional lattice, termed a 'net-skin' is also described. Traditional methods of manufacturing lattice structures generally do not allow variation of cell properties within a structure; however, additive manufacturing enables graded lattices to be generated that are potentially more optimal. A method of functionally grading lattices is, therefore, also described to take advantage of this manufacturing capability.",

    "abstract": "In metals additive manufacturing (AM), materials and components are concurrently made in a single process as layers of metal are fabricated on top of each other in the near-final topology required for the end-use product. Consequently, tens to hundreds of materials and part design degrees of freedom must be simultaneously controlled and understood; hence, metals AM is a highly interdisciplinary technology that requires synchronized consideration of physics, chemistry, materials science, physical metallurgy, computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. The use of modern machine learning approaches to model these degrees of freedom can reduce the time and cost to elucidate the science of metals AM and to optimize the engineering of these complex, multidisciplinary processes. New machine learning techniques are not needed for most metals AM development; those used in other sects of materials science will also work for AM. Most prolifically, the density functional theory (DFT) community has used many of them since the early 2000s for evaluating numerous combinations of elements and crystal structures to discover new materials. This materials technologies-focused review introduces the basic mathematics and terminology of machine learning through the lens of metals AM, and then examines potential uses of machine learning to advance metals AM, highlighting the many parallels to previous efforts in materials science and manufacturing while also discussing new challenges and adaptations specific to metals AM.",

Additionally, heat-treated samples still attached to the build plates vs. those removed were also documented for a standard heat treatment. The effects of the different resulting microstructures on room temperature strengths and elongations to failure is revealed. Knowledge derived from these process structure property relationships was used to engineer a super solvus solution anneal at 1020 degC for 15 minutes, followed by aging at 720 degC for 24 hours heat treatment for AM-IN718 that eliminates Laves and {\\delta} phases, preserves AM specific dislocation cells that are shown to be stabilized by MC carbide particles, and precipitates dense {\\gamma ^{\\prime} and {\\gamma ^{\\prime \\prime}} nanoparticle populations. This 'optimized for AM-IN718 heat treatment' results in superior properties relative to wrought/additively manufactured, then industry standard heat treated IN718: relative increases of 7/10 percent in yield strength, 2/7 percent in ultimate strength, and 23/57 percent in elongation to failure are realized, respectively, regardless of as-built vs. machined surface finishes.",

    "abstract": "Part defects and irregularities that influence the part quality is an especially large problem in additive manufacturing (AM) processes such as selective laser sintering (SLS). Destructive and non-destructive testing procedures are currently mostly used for quality control and defect detection of AM parts after production. In this context, machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly being used to enable computer-aided defect detection through automatic classification of manufacturing data. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on ML methods are widely used for this task. In this paper, complex transfer learning (TL) methods are presented, which enable the automatic classification of powder bed defects in the SLS process using very small datasets. The proposed methods use the VGG16 and the Xception CNN model with pretrained weights from the ImageNet dataset as initialization and an adapted classifier to classify good and defective image data recorded during part manufacturing. Known performance metrics were determined to evaluate and compare the performance of the models. The VGG16 model architecture achieved the best results for Accuracy (0.958), Precision (0.939), Recall (0.980), F1-Score (0.959) and AUC value (0.982). These results show the effectiveness of defect detection based on CNN and can offer an alternative method for non-destructive quality assurance and manufacturing documentation for additively manufactured parts.",

    "abstract": "Risk-averse areas such as the medical, aerospace and energy sectors have been somewhat slow towards accepting and applying Additive Manufacturing (AM) in many of their value chains. This is partly because there are still significant uncertainties concerning the quality of AM builds. This paper introduces a machine learning algorithm for the automatic detection of faults in AM products. The approach is semi-supervised in that, during training, it is able to use data from both builds where the resulting components were certified and builds where the quality of the resulting components is unknown. This makes the approach cost efficient, particularly in scenarios where part certification is costly and time consuming. The study specifically analyses Laser Powder-Bed Fusion (L-PBF) builds. Key features are extracted from large sets of photodiode data, obtained during the building of 49 tensile test bars. Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) tests were then used to categorise each bar as 'faulty' or 'acceptable'. Using a variety of approaches (Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and 2-fold cross-validation), it is shown that, despite utilising a fraction of the available certification data, the semi-supervised approach can achieve results comparable to a benchmark case where all data points are labelled. The results show that semi-supervised learning is a promising approach for the automatic certification of AM builds that can be implemented at a fraction of the cost currently required.",

    "abstract": "Any literature investigation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) manufacturing of metal parts would reveal that the development of internal stresses is a serious limitation in the application of this technology. Researchers have used a variety of different methods to quantify this stress and investigate scanning strategies aimed at reducing or distributing this stress more evenly in the part. The most common methods used to assess the levels of stress in parts are deflection based. These techniques provide a rapid method to give a quantitative comparison of scan strategies and parameters. Although studies have calculated the levels of stress relieved by the measured deflection, these studies often neglect the stresses that remain in the part after release. This study shows that these stresses can still be considerable. Non-destructive diffraction based methods can be used to calculate the profile of stress in a part but these are often prohibitively expensive or difficult to use on a large scale. This study presents a methodology which combines deflection based methods with either the hole drilling or contour methods. Results show that these experiments can be completed in a cost effective manner, with standard lab based equipment to generate a through thickness measurement of residual stress.",

Many of these anomalies, such as recoater blade impacts, binder deposition issues, spatter generation, and some porosities, are surface-visible at each layer of the building process. In this work, the authors present a novel Convolutional Neural Network architecture for pixel-wise localization (semantic segmentation) of layer-wise powder bed imaging data. Key advantages of the algorithm include its ability to return segmentation results at the native resolution of the imaging sensor, seamlessly transfer learned knowledge between different Additive Manufacturing machines, and provide real-time performance. The algorithm is demonstrated on six different machines spanning three technologies: laser fusion, binder jetting, and electron beam fusion. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is shown to be superior to that of previous algorithms presented by the authors with respect to localization, accuracy, computation time, and generalizability.",

    "abstract": "Powder spreading is a crucial step in the powder bed fusion process, which controls the quality of powder bed and consequently affects the quality of printed parts. To date, however, powder spreadability has received very little attention and substantial fundamental work is still needed, largely because of the lack of experimental studies. Therefore, the focus of the present study addresses the influences of powder morphology, spreading velocity and layer thickness on the powder bed topography uniformity. The experiments were conducted with a laser powder bed fusion printer and the powder layers were spread systematically and comprehensively assessed. In summary, it was found that particle sphericity and surface texture dictates the degree of impact that the spreader velocity and the layer thickness exert on the quality of powder bed topography in spread layers. The spreader velocity has substantial influence on powder bed uniformity, such that better uniformity is achieved with low spreading velocities, ≤ 80 mm/s. Powders with a wide particle distribution and containing large number of fine particles (< 25 µm) enabled formation of uniform and dense powder beds, however such powders were found to be more affected by segregation. In addition to these observed effects, for the first time, the major process related challenges to powder spreadability and powder bed quality are reported in this study.",

Fielded components need to endure fatigue loadings over long operational lifetimes. This work evaluates the ability of shot and laser peening to enhance the fatigue lifetime and strength of AM parts. As previously shown, peening processes induce beneficial microstructure and residual stress enhancement; this work takes a step to demonstrate the fatigue enhancement of peening including for the case of geometric stress risers as expected for fielded AM components. We present AM sample fatigue results with and without a stress riser using untreated baseline samples and shot and laser peening surface treatments. Laser peening is clearly shown to provide superior fatigue life and strength. We also investigated the ability of analysis to select laser peening parameters and coverage that can shape and/or correctively reshape AM components to a high degree of precision. We demonstrated this potential by shaping and shape correction using our finite element based predictive modeling and highly controlled laser peening.",

Processing of aluminium in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing is quite challenging, especially in terms of porosity. In the present work, pore behaviour in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing of AW4043/AlSi5(wt%) was investigated and a post-process monitoring approach was developed. It has been observed that as the shielding gas flow rate increases, the porosity in aluminium parts also increases due to the rapid solidification of the melt pool by forced convection. The higher convection rate seems to limit the escape of gas inclusions. Furthermore, gas inclusions escaping from the melt pool leave cavities on the surface of each deposited layer. Process camera imaging is used to monitor these cavities to acquire information about the porosity in the part. The observations were supported by Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations which show that the gas flow rate correlates with the porosity in aluminium parts manufactured by Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing. Since a lower gas flow rate leads to reduced convective cooling, the melt pool remains liquid for a longer period allowing pores to escape for a longer period and thus reducing porosity. Based on these investigations, a monitoring approach is presented.",

    "abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing is moving from rapid prototyping to on-demand manufacturing and even to serial production. Consistent part quality and development of a wider range of available materials are key for wider adoption. This requires control and optimization of various laser and scanning parameters. Therefore, process modeling has been extensively pursued to reduce experimental runs in the search for parameters that produce dense, high-quality parts for the given alloy. However, these optimal parameters remain machine-specific if conditions defined by the machine architecture are not considered. Previous studies have shown that shielding gas flow is one such parameter that affects porosity and mechanical properties of parts produced with laser powder bed fusion. However, a lack of consensus remains regarding which phenomena are responsible for the observed decrease in quality. In this study, the effect of shielding gas flow velocity on porosity and melt pool geometry in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing is studied. It is shown that decreasing the gas flow velocity leads to a drastic loss of penetration of single scan tracks, leading to increased lack-of-fusion porosity at the part level. This is attributed to the obstruction of the laser beam by the process-induced vapor plume emissions of the individual tracks being scanned. As the vapor plume, and how effectively it is removed by the shielding gas flow, have a significant effect on the melt pool geometry in laser powder bed fusion, models aiming at predicting the melt pool geometry and attempts to transfer process parameters from one machine to another should consider the effect of the shielding gas flow.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a new variant of wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) based on hot forging. During WAAM, the material is locally forged immediately after deposition, and in-situ viscoplastic deformation occurs at high temperatures. In the subsequent layer deposition, recrystallization of the previous solidification structure occurs that refines the microstructure. Because of its similarity with hot forging, this variant was named hot forging wire and arc additive manufacturing (HF-WAAM). A customized WAAM torch was developed, manufactured, and tested in the production of samples of AISI316L stainless steel. Forging forces of 17 N and 55 N were applied to plastically deform the material. The results showed that this new variant refines the solidification microstructure and reduce texture effects, as determined via high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments, without interrupting the additive manufacturing process. Mechanical characterization was performed and improvements on both yield strength and ultimate tensile strength were achieved. Furthermore, it was observed that HF-WAAM significantly affects porosity; pores formed during the process were closed by the hot forging process. Because deformation occurs at high temperatures, the forces involved are small, and the WAAM equipment does not have specific requirements with respect to stiffness, thereby allowing the incorporation of this new variant into conventional moving equipment such as multi-axis robots or 3-axis table used in WAAM.",

    "abstract": "Architected cellular structures based on triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) have attracted significant attention due to their lightweight, superior, and controllable mechanical properties. Such lattice structures can be potential candidates for high specific energy absorption (SEA) applications. In this study, five TPMS sheet-based structures (Gyroid, Primitive, IWP, Diamond and Fisher-Koch) were designed, fabricated, and tested under quasi­-static and dynamic loading conditions. Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is employed to facilitate the fabrication of these complex structures using stainless steel (SS316L) at three different relative densities. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro­ Computed Tomography (micro­CT) were utilized to assess the quality of the printed structures. The dynamic compressive behavior is investigated by conducting direct impact compression tests utilizing a Direct Impact Hopkinson Bar (DIHB) at a strain-rate of 2057 s−1. Quasi-­static tests are also performed at a strain-rate of 0.005 s−1. The quasi-static and dynamic mechanical responses are then compared to explore the changes in plateau stress and specific energy absorption values of the five TPMS lattices in these two loading regimes. Furthermore, the effects of changing both architecture and relative density on the properties of lattice structures are investigated. The results show that all five topologies exhibit an enhanced mechanical performance under dynamic loading. In fact, Diamond structure demonstrates the highest SEA value of 35.57 J/g under the high strain-rate loading condition, in comparison to 30.85 J/g in the quasi-static loading. This study suggests that TPMS structures could be potential candidates not only for quasi­-static, but also for dynamic applications related to a high strain-rate loading.",

    "abstract": "The proven ability of additive manufacturing (AM, also known as 3D printing) to fabricate complex components with substantial reductions in material wastage and reduced lead times has made it a key enabling technology for numerous important industrial applications. Of current AM processes, material jetting (MJ) is demonstrating considerable potential for producing multi-material, intricate, 3D components and systems with integrated functionality, with the additional benefit that the process can be easily integrated with other manufacturing procedures. However, material jetting of functional materials to produce advanced applications still poses numerous technological challenges which hinder its full industrial exploitation. These extend from the limited range of high-performance materials with consistent properties usable for MJ, through the need to enhance the process itself by optimizing the droplet formation process, tuning waveforms for specific processes, modification of substrate and substrate/jetted material interactions, the complexities of curing and post-processing procedures, and the challenge of characterizing the 3D printed parts. In this context, this article attempts to provide a comprehensive discussion of the principles and characteristics of the most recent material jetting technology and reviews the state-of-the-art research and development being conducted. This review identifies existing gaps with regards to high-performance UV-curable inks, printing behavior of non-Newtonian fluids, optimum jetting and curing strategies and effective measures for achieving high-precision MJ. Future work should bridge the aforementioned gaps in order to improve the performance of the technology, thereby making it more attractive for large-scale adoption by industry and increasing market acceptance and penetration of material jetting for advanced applications.",

This work used metal injection molding (MIM) raw material of 17–4 PH steel for additive manufacturing. The 3D printing, debinding, and sintering steps were thoroughly evaluated to achieve the highest sintered density. First, the 3DEP of the MIM feedstock was carried out using a screw-based extrusion system at optimum parameters to acquire the high green density and fine surface roughness. The solvent debinding step was carried out on 3D printed samples to remove water-soluble polymer by immersion method. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed to evaluate the decomposition temperature of the backbone material. Further, thermal debinding and sintering steps were conducted in a single step. The thermal debinding temperature was 500 ℃, and the sintering temperatures were chosen as 1100, 1200, 1300 and 1360 ℃. The highest density of ~95.6% was attained at a high sintering temperature. The micro-tomography evaluation was carried out on the 3D printed green and high-density sintered samples to evaluate the internal porosity. The mechanical properties and the microstructure were also evaluated for sintered samples. The work opens a way to fabricate metal complex-shaped parts at low cost using market available MIM feedstock.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) embedded within digital models of manufacturing processes can be used to improve process productivity and product quality significantly. The application of such advanced capabilities particularly to highly digitalized processes such as metal additive manufacturing (AM) is likely to make those processes commercially more attractive. AI capabilities will reside within Digital Twins (DTs) which are living virtual replicas of the physical processes. DTs will be empowered to operate autonomously in a diagnostic control capacity to supervise processes and can be interrogated by the practitioner to inform the optimal processing route for any given product. The utility of the information gained from the DTs would depend on the quality of the digital models and, more importantly, their faster-solving surrogates which dwell within DTs for consultation during rapid decision-making. In this article, we point out the exceptional value of DTs in AM and focus on the need to create high-fidelity multiscale-multiphysics models for AM processes to feed the AI capabilities. We identify technical hurdles for their development, including those arising from the multiscale and multiphysics characteristics of the models, the difficulties in linking models of the subprocesses across scales and physics, and the scarcity of experimental data. We discuss the need for creating surrogate models using machine learning approaches for real-time problem-solving. We further identify non-technical barriers, such as the need for standardization and difficulties in collaborating across different types of institutions. We offer potential solutions for all these challenges, after reflecting on and researching discussions held at an international symposium on the subject in 2019. We argue that a collaborative approach can not only help accelerate their development compared with disparate efforts, but also enhance the quality of the models by allowing modular development and linkages that account for interactions between the various sub-processes in AM. A high-level roadmap is suggested for starting such a collaboration.",

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a new class of printable magnetic hydrogels that can be successfully used for multimaterial direct ink printing (4D printing) of soft actuators. To date, most reports on magnetic actuation have not considered biocompatibility issues associated with magnetic materials and synthetic polymers. For this reason, in this study, considerable attention was given to developing bionanocomposites that exhibit noncytotoxicity and biocompatibility and hence may be used in biomedical applications. Three inks with various concentrations of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were used to print 3D objects, such as tubes (wheels), cubes, and cantilevers. The interactions between MNPs and hydrogel precursor network accounted for excellent shear thinning properties of the inks. Usually, hydrogel actuators move or change a shape upon anisotropic swelling and deswelling, possible only in an aqueous environment. Our study addresses this challenge by incorporating magnetic nanoparticles into the hydrogel, allowing for contactless in-air control of hydrogel motion. Because of the high structural integrity of the hydrogel, we can state that multimaterial direct ink printing is an excellent method for obtaining a 3D construct of high resolution, shape fidelity, tunable distribution of MNPs, and induced macroscopic anisotropy. The magnetic hydrogels are not only highly porous and noncytotoxic towards fibroblasts but also exhibit good mechanical stability and unique magnetic responsiveness. The simple approach allowed us to fabricate different magnetic actuators with various patterns, composed of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. The results demonstrate the interplay between magnetic and nonmagnetic hydrogels that influences the actuation performance of multimaterial objects, as illustrated by magnetically induced rolling, jumping, and bending. It was shown that programmable patterning of the hydrogels leads to the development of macroscopically anisotropic magnetic material. Our study confirmed that the intersection of 4D printing of magnetically responsive hydrogel materials and programmable patterning promises to fulfill future soft robotics' biocompatibility and functionality requirements.",

The addition of Ta significantly increased the phase transformation temperatures, leading to a room-temperature microstructure composed of both B19′ martensite and B2 austenite, and (Ti,Ta)2Ni precipitates distributed at the grain boundaries. Compared with the WAAM fabricated NiTi counterpart, the corrosion potential (Ecorr) of the NiTiTa material increased from − 0.55 to − 0.44 V, while the corrosion current density (Icorr) decreased from 1.90 × 10−6 to 4.2 × 10−7 A/cm2. The X-ray brightness increased from 19.6 to 56.4 %. These results indicate that the addition of Ta can enhance the corrosion resistance and X-ray visibility of NiTiTa parts. Furthermore, the WAAM fabricated NiTiTa material was able to retain a stable superelastic response under 10 loading-unloading cycles, highlighting the great potential application value in the biomedical field. Our work provides an innovative method for additively manufacturing NiTi-based multi-component SMAs through WAAM.",

In this work, we introduced a comprehensive framework for benchmarking ML for melt pool characterization. An extensive experimental dataset has been collected from more than 80 MAM articles containing MAM processing conditions, materials, melt pool dimensions, melt pool modes and flaw types. We introduced physics-aware MAM featurization, versatile ML models, and evaluation metrics to create a comprehensive learning framework for melt pool defect and geometry prediction. This benchmark can serve as a basis for melt pool control and process optimization. In addition, data-driven explicit models have been identified to estimate melt pool geometry from process parameters and material properties.

    "abstract": "Cemented carbides, known as the \"teeth of industry\", are widely used in aerospace, resource mining, equipment manufacturing, rail transit, and electronic information industries, among others. Additive manufacturing (AM) technology provides a new route for preparing geometrically complex cemented carbide parts. In this paper, we review the progress in respect of AM technology in WC-Co cemented carbides. We first introduce the two technology routes for AM of WC-Co cemented carbides: powder bed fusion (PBF), based on hot forming technology (e.g., selective laser sintering, selective laser melting, and selective electron beam melting), and forming–debinding–sintering (FDS), based on green-body cold forming along with debinding and sintering processes (e.g., binder jetting additive manufacturing–debinding–sintering, fused deposition modeling–debinding–sintering, and 3D gel printing–debinding–sintering). Furthermore, we analyze the key influencing factors in respect of the densification, metallurgical defects, microstructure evolution, and mechanical properties of WC-Co cemented carbides prepared using AM. We conclude that the critical problem in preparing WC-Co cemented carbides via PBF is the prevention of cracking and reducing porosity to improve the relative density, as well as avoiding the η phase. However, although FDS has shortcomings, including complex feedstock preparation (binder) and a long technological process, this technology shows promise for preparing high-performance WC-Co cemented carbides, because it sufficiently combines the advantages of AM and powder metallurgy. Finally, we identify and delineate the current research gaps and prospects of AM in respect of WC-Co cemented carbides from four aspects.",

A numerical model was constituted to imitate the compressive behaviour of these multi-material cellular structures under quasi-static loading. For the validation, samples were printed with Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technique and experimentally tested. A good correlation was captured between numerical and experimental analyses. This study found that deploying a multi-material approach enhanced the re-entrant cellular structures specific energy absorption, compressive strength and modulus values over the single Nylon structure of 60 %, 104 % and 201 %, respectively. A similar trend with lesser improvements of 15 %, 60 % and 127 % was monitored for hexagonal cellular structure, in the same sequence.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional (3D) printing and its extension four-dimensional (4D) printing technique show great promise for advanced additive manufacturing of functional and architected materials with engineered micro- and nanoscale features. The actual usage of additive manufacturing to produce 3D/4D structures is primarily dependent on the improvement of printable polymeric inks. Thermoresponsive polymers (TRPs) show broad application prospects in additive manufacturing since they enable changing the physicochemical properties of the system at a specific temperature. Continuing to progress in the understanding of TRP phenomena enable the design of new feedstocks and their compatibility with fabrication processes. Therefore, increasing the overlap between the fields of fundamental TRPs and application-based research efforts can be important to emerging the technology. In this review, we provide an overview of the functional design of the TRPs, the different classes of TRPs, and their application in 3D printing, ranging from biosensors via advanced self-assembly to a variety of biofabrication, biomedical, biotechnology, and food applications. Basic knowledge of imperative processes like gelation mechanisms of TRPs, bio-based adsorption on the surfaces and adhesion, and fabrication strategies using 3D printing is also provided. For diverse TRPs synthesis and the basic physical and chemical features are described and the mechanism of their TRPs behavior is highlighted. Fabrication methods of TRP surfaces have also been discussed describing several methods in detail.",

    "abstract": "Aiming to decouple the inherent relationship between mass transfer and heat transfer in traditional arc-based directed energy deposition, a novel heterogeneous multi-wire indirect arc directed energy deposition (DED) has been developed for in-situ synthesis of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy components. Multi-wires (Al-Cu and Al-Mg) with a bypassing Zn wire have been used to replace the traditional homogeneous twin-wires. The process, microstructure and mechanical properties of the deposited Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy components obtained by multi-wire indirect arc DED were investigated. The results indicate that the wire feeding speed, current and angle between the two wires have a significant influence on the multi-wire indirect arc DED process. When the current was 200 A, the different wire feeding speeds could be used for both wires and the angle between them was 90°. The resulting indirect arc presented a 'heart' shape and allowed to obtain an Al-5.7Zn-3.4Mg-1.6Cu (wt%) alloy with a high deposition rate of 5.1 kg/h. The Al-5.7Zn-3.4Mg-1.6Cu alloy is mainly composed of α-Al, S (Al2CuMg), η (Mg (Al, Zn, Cu)2) and η′ phases. The composition and phases are in accordance with the 7xxx series aluminum alloys. The microstructure is dominated by columnar and equiaxed grains, and it has obvious periodic distribution along the building direction, which is related to the process thermal cycle. Fine second phases η′ are observed to precipitate during the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the average hardness, ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the fabricated material are 98.6 HV, 243.9 MPa and 5.9%, respectively. These mechanical properties are higher than those of as-cast 7050 aluminum alloy, thus showing the potential of this new process variant to fabricate high strength Al alloys in the as-deposited state. The fracture morphology exhibit features mainly associated to a ductile-like fracture, accompanied by some transgranular and partial cleavage fracture characteristics. This novel multi-wire indirect arc DED provides a new choice for arc-based directed energy deposition of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys and shows great potential for the in-situ synthesis of other high-performance alloys.",

    "abstract": "Wire-arc directed energy deposition (DED), also known as wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), is a metal 3D printing technique that is recognised for its high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, flexibility in build scales and suitability for the construction sector. However, there remains a lack of fundamental data on the structural performance of WAAM elements, especially regarding their fatigue behaviour. A comprehensive experimental study into the fatigue behaviour of WAAM steel plates has therefore been undertaken and is reported herein. Following geometric, mechanical and microstructural characterisation, a series of WAAM coupons was tested under uniaxial high-cycle fatigue loading. A total of 75 fatigue tests on both as-built and machined coupons, covering various stress ranges and stress ratios (R = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4), have been conducted. The local stress concentrations in the as-built coupons induced by their surface undulations have also been studied by numerical simulations. The fatigue test results were analysed using constant life diagrams (CLDs) and S-N (stress-life) diagrams, based on both nominal and local stresses. The CLDs revealed that the fatigue strength of the as-built WAAM steel was relatively insensitive to the different stress ratios. The S-N diagrams showed that the surface undulations resulted in a reduction of about 35% in the fatigue endurance limit for the as-built WAAM material relative to the machined material, and a reduction of about 60% in fatigue life under the same load level. The as-built and machined WAAM coupons were shown to exhibit similar fatigue behaviour to conventional steel butt welds and S355 structural steel plates, respectively. Preliminary nominal stress-based and local stress-based S-N curves were also proposed for the WAAM steel.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) is one of the key mechanisms to design microstructures in additively manufactured metals. Nanoparticles are effective sites for heterogeneous nucleation during additive manufacturing (AM) of ferritic stainless steels promoting fine grain structures and influencing CET. However, the combined mechanisms of grain refinement, CET, and Zener pinning originating from these nanoparticles are not yet well understood. In this study, the process-structure relationship was quantitatively analysed for a Fe-18Cr steel containing TiN particles. A combined finite-element method (FEM) and multi-phase field method (PFM) approach was used to reveal the mechanisms that govern the microstructure evolution during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). TiN particles were considered implicitly through the seed-density model in the phase-field model, including their influence on heterogeneous nucleation as well as the Zener pinning effect. It was found that undercooling, required for particle activation as nucleus for solidification, was the dominant parameter for CET in the particle-inoculated Fe-18Cr steel. The undercooling was controlled by process parameters and particle properties. The process parameters during LPBF controlled the temperature gradient and solidification velocity across the melt-pool and influenced the respective undercooling. Concurrently, the particle properties that are controlled by the free growth criterion determined the undercooling required for activation of a particle as a nucleus during solidification. The reliability of the model was validated by experimental data from literature through the effect of process parameters and TiN particles on the CET and microstructure characteristics. The influence of the solidification behaviour as well as particle size, volume fraction, and distribution on the microstructure evolution during LPBF will be discussed based on activated nuclei density plots. This is the first PFM model of solidification during LPBF that considers the heterogeneous nucleation in inoculated alloys including the growth constraint without any rough approximations for the grain evolution during solidification.",

    "abstract": "In metal additive manufacturing (AM), the material microstructure and part geometry are formed incrementally. Consequently, the resulting part could be defect- and anomaly-free if sufficient care is taken to deposit each layer under optimal process conditions. Conventional closed-loop control (CLC) engineering solutions which sought to achieve this were deterministic and rule-based, thus resulting in limited success in the stochastic environment experienced in the highly dynamic AM process. On the other hand, emerging machine learning (ML) based strategies are better suited to providing the robustness, scope, flexibility, and scalability required for process control in an uncertain environment. Offline ML models that help optimise AM process parameters before a build begins and online ML models that efficiently processed in-situ sensory data to detect and diagnose flaws in real-time (or near-real-time) have been developed. However, ML models that enable a process to take evasive or corrective actions in relation to flaws via on the fly decision-making are only emerging. These models must possess prognostic capabilities to provide context-sensitive recommendations for in-situ process control based on real-time diagnostics. In this article, we pinpoint the shortcomings in traditional CLC strategies, and provide a framework for defect and anomaly control through ML-assisted CLC in AM. We discuss flaws in terms of their causes, in-situ detectability, and controllability, and examine their management under three scenarios: avoidance, mitigation, and repair. Then, we summarise the research into ML models developed for offline optimisation and in-situ diagnosis before initiating a detailed conversation on the implementation of ML-assisted in-situ process control. We found that researchers favoured reinforcement learning approaches or inverse ML models for making rapid, situation-aware control decisions. We also observed that, to-date, the defects addressed were those that may be quantified relatively easily autonomously, and that mitigation (rather than avoidance or repair) was the aim of ML-assisted in-situ control strategies. Additionally, we highlight the various technologies that must seamlessly combine to advance the field of autonomous in-situ control so that it becomes a reality in industrial settings. Finally, we raise awareness of seldom discussed, yet highly pertinent, topics relevant to adaptive control. Our work closes a significant gap in the current AM literature by broaching wide-ranging discussions on matters relevant to in-situ adaptive control in AM.",

    "abstract": "Vat photopolymerization (VP) 3D printing, a subset of additive manufacturing, is renowned for its capability to create intricate structures with high precision, particularly useful in optical applications. The process involves using photosensitive resins cured layer by layer through various light-curing technologies like Stereolithography (SLA), Digital Light Processing (DLP), Two-Photon Polymerization (TPP), Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP), and Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Each technique offers unique advantages in terms of speed, resolution, and material compatibility, with TPP providing the highest resolution. This review explores the diverse applications of VP 3D-printed optical components, including lenses, waveguides, optical gratings, resonators, metamaterials, sensors, and actuators, demonstrating their significant role in advancing optical technology and innovation. Challenges in material selection, post-processing requirements, size limitations, and support structures are discussed, alongside potential future research directions. These include developing advanced photopolymer materials with enhanced optical properties, hardware improvements for higher resolution and multi-material printing, and quality assurance measures for ensuring optical precision. Despite some limitations, VP 3D printing presents a promising avenue for the rapid prototyping and production of complex, multifunctional optical devices, marking a significant stride in optical manufacturing and technological development.",

However, conducting experiments to estimate mechanical properties in MAM processes can be laborious and expensive, and they are often limited to specific materials and processes. Machine learning (ML) methods offer a more flexible and cost-effective approach to predicting mechanical properties based on processing parameters and material properties. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive framework for benchmarking ML models for predicting mechanical properties. We compiled an extensive experimental dataset from over 90 MAM articles and data sheets from a diverse range of sources, encompassing 140 different MAM data sheets. This dataset includes information on MAM processing conditions, machines, materials, and resulting mechanical properties such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus, elongation, hardness, and surface roughness. Our framework incorporates physics-aware featurization specific to MAM, adjustable ML models, and tailored evaluation metrics to construct a comprehensive learning framework for predicting mechanical properties. Additionally, we explore the Explainable AI method, specifically SHAP analysis, to elucidate and interpret the predicted values of ML models for mechanical properties. Furthermore, data-driven explicit models were developed to estimate mechanical properties based on processing parameters and material properties, offering enhanced interpretability compared to conventional ML models.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a novel theoretical model of the void length probability distribution in 3D printed concrete is established based on a zigzag analog of the layer interface. A quasi-exponential distribution of void length is predicted and subsequently validated on both the zigzag analog and the actual 3D printed concrete, with different void ratios that determine the descending rate and node intervals that decide the horizontal scaling of the distribution. Moreover, the relationships between the interlayer strength, void ratio, and quantity of voids are also studied based on the theoretical model. It is found that the quantity of voids is symmetric about a void ratio of 0.5, and the decrease in the interlayer strength against the void ratio is non-linear which is approximated well by combined exponential and linear functions. This work is believed to reveal the nature of the interfacial void distributions and significantly advance the understanding of the layer interface in 3D printed concrete.

    "abstract": "Invar 36 is a renowned iron-nickel alloy with an ultra-low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), which is widely used in aerospace and precision instruments. Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) as a prevalent metal additive manufacturing technique could break through the limitations of traditional processes, such as low material utilization and difficulties in forming complex structures. In this work, Invar 36 alloy specimens were fabricated via LPBF process in 0° (H0 specimen), 45° (D45 specimen), and 90° (V90 specimen) build orientations. The microstructure, tensile properties, thermal expansion, and magnetic properties of the three orientations specimens were comprehensively investigated, and the anisotropy of microstructure, yield strength and CTE were analyzed. The V90 specimen exhibited the highest elongation (62.70%), while the D45 specimen owned the highest yield strength (496 MPa). The anisotropic mechanical properties can be attributed to variations in dislocation density, grain size, and intrinsic yield strength. The CTE of LPBF-fabricated Invar 36 alloy specimens were all lower than that of traditional manufacturing process at all temperature ranges. Since CTE is more related to magnetic properties, not sensitive to microstructure, the anisotropy of CTE is not significant in three build orientations. This study has significant implications to produce Invar 36 alloy devices with exceptional properties and 3D dimensional stability via the LPBF process.",

    "abstract": "3D concrete printing technology has advanced rapidly over the past decades, providing labor-saving benefits and the capability to achieve rapid construction of free-form structures. However, due to the involvement of robotic automation, the construction process in 3D concrete printing differs significantly from conventional concrete construction, especially in terms of concrete reinforcement. The current commonly used 3D printed concrete (3DPC) reinforcement techniques mainly include designing the 3DPC structure as predominantly compressed or prestressed components, or reinforcing it with auxiliary materials like steel rebars, fibers, or meshes. However, these methods either have limited application scenarios or do not fully utilize the mechanical performance of 3DPC materials. Building upon our previously proposed multi-material Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (multi-material BESO) method, this paper introduces a new 3DPC structural design approach in which 3DPC components are predominantly subjected to compression, requiring no additional reinforcement but working together with tensioned steel cables to form an efficient composite structural system. We applied this method to the design and construction of an experimental prototype named \"FloatArch\". Subsequent load tests and measurements confirmed the feasibility and efficiency of this 3DPC structure. We then designed and constructed the expanded structure \"FloatSlab\" to further demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed method. The features of prefabricated assembly, not requiring reinforcement or special equipment, and dry construction make this 3DPC structure easy to build and reassemble, providing new prospects for the sustainable use of 3DPC components. The generative design, construction, and validation of cable-supported structure prototypes presented in this paper demonstrate the immense potential of multi-material topology optimization technology for efficient 3DPC structural design, providing a new route to high-performance, innovative and sustainable structural design in additive manufacturing of concrete.",

    "abstract": "This work explores a spatial printing method to fabricate continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs), which can achieve exceptional mechanical performance. For models giving complex 3D stress distribution under loads, typical planar-layer based fiber placement usually fails to provide sufficient reinforcement due to their orientations being constrained to planes. The effectiveness of fiber reinforcement could be maximized by using multi-axis additive manufacturing (MAAM) to better control the orientation of continuous fibers in 3D-printed composites. Here, we propose a computational approach to generate 3D toolpaths that satisfy two major reinforcement objectives: (1) following the maximal stress directions in critical regions and (2) connecting multiple load-bearing regions by continuous fibers. Principal stress lines are first extracted in an input solid model to identify critical regions. Curved layers aligned with maximal stresses in these critical regions are generated by computing an optimized scalar field and extracting its iso-surfaces. Then, topological analysis and operations are applied to each curved layer to generate a computational domain that preserves fiber continuity between load-bearing regions. Lastly, continuous fiber toolpaths aligned with maximal stresses are generated on each surface layer by computing an optimized scalar field and extracting its iso-curves. A hardware system with dual robotic arms is employed to conduct the physical MAAM tasks depositing polymer or fiber reinforced polymer composite materials by applying a force normal to the extrusion plane to aid consolidation. When comparing to planar-layer based printing results in tension, up to 644% failure load and 240% stiffness are observed on shapes fabricated by our spatial printing method. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various complex load cases which demonstrate their successful implementation of continuous fiber printing in 3D.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic atomization is one of the promising technologies for producing metal powders for additive manufacturing, where precise control of particle size and morphology is essential. In this study, we coupled an ultrasonic transducer with a carbon fibre plate and atomized liquid droplets and films under different vibration amplitudes. Water, glycerol, and pure aluminium melt were used to study the atomization mechanism and the resulting droplet/powder characteristics, respectively. High-speed optical and ultrafast synchrotron X-ray imaging were used to study in situ the ultrasonic atomization dynamics, including pulsation and clustering of cavities inside the liquid layer/films, development of capillary waves, and formation of liquid droplets. For the first time, we observed and captured the occurrence of cavitation in the atomization of resting drops, films and impact droplets. The inertial cavitation events interfered with the capillary waves across the interphase boundary, puncturing and breaking the boundary to produce atomized mist. The in situ observation revealed the intricate dynamics of ultrasonic atomization and underscored the pivotal role of cavitation events throughout the entire atomization process. We also conducted experiments on ultrasonic atomization of liquid aluminium, producing particles of perfectly spherical shape. The particle size decreased as the vibration amplitude was decreased. Our work has demonstrated the important processing strategies on how to tailor the particle size while ensuring consistent particle shape and morphology, which is the key processing capability for producing high quality feedstock for additive manufacturing applications.",

    "abstract": "Isotropy is a desired characteristic in cellular structures for load bearing and energy absorption applications that must respond uniformly under external loads in all orientations. Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) cellular structures are attracting much attention for such applications due to their demonstrated high performance, tailorable properties, and open cell architecture. However, TPMS structures usually display stiffness anisotropy. In this work, new design strategies are presented for isotropic TPMS-based cellular structures, revealing a large available design space in terms of relative density and relative stiffness. The first design strategy arranges TPMS-based cells in a Simple-Cubic/Face-Centred Cubic inspired pattern, resulting in reduced elastic anisotropy. Two parametric optimisation approaches involving level-set mid-surface offsetting and the functional grading of relative density are then applied in a second step to eliminate any residual elastic anisotropy. Anisotropy is characterised through finite element analysis using the Zener ratio. Four families of cells are optimised, each based on a different TPMS unit cell, and then additively manufactured using the material extrusion process with polylactic acid. Finally, experimental quasi-static compressive tests are conducted to characterise stiffness, strength, and energy absorption properties. Optimised designs are tested in three crystal orientations ([001], [101] and [111]) and manufactured in three orthogonal print orientations. The Primitive TPMS-based design is the stiffest of the four designs reaching 64.4% of the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound of bulk modulus at 20% relative density. Experimental results validate all four optimised cell designs for elastic isotropy and indicate that all the cell designs are also isotropic in terms of crushing strength and energy absorption.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of 3D printed concrete (3DPC) technology, in particular the integration of reinforcement into the components, emphasizes the need for accurate prediction of structural performance in the hardened state. This pressing need is evidenced by the emerging development of numerical models to capture the anisotropic behavior of 3DPC components in recent years. This paper reviews the current state of the art, particularly focusing on existing modeling approaches for modeling the structural performance of hardened 3DPC elements. The models are categorized into three main groups: macro-scale phenomenological continuum models, that represent the anisotropic behavior in a smeared manner; macro-scale interface-based models, that explicitly account for the interfacial behavior between printed layers; and detailed meso-scale discrete models, that account for the inherent heterogeneity of concrete. The review provides a summary of the existing models within these groups and describes their main modeling hypotheses, constitutive assumptions, underlying phenomena, presented numerical applications, as well as their strengths and limitations. In addition, experimentally available test setups and the resulting material properties are summarized, that are crucial for the calibration and potential validation of these modeling approaches. Based on experimental observations reported in the literature in the context of 3DPC and the additive manufacturing process, this paper highlights the main key challenges and outlines the need for further research and improvements in modeling approaches for 3DPC. These insights are discussed in relation to the evolving developments in modeling conventional mold-cast concrete, offering a comprehensive perspective on the present state and future directions in the field.",

    "abstract": "Ni-based superalloy 718 fabricated via arc plasma direct energy deposition (IN718 AP-DED) exhibit a limited response to heat treatment due to its coarse primary microstructure and interdendritic segregation, which may prevent its use in high-integrity applications. Thus, dedicated heat treatments for IN718 AP-DED must possess a homogenization temperature as high as possible to significantly dissolve the eutectics and increase the γ′′-former elements in solid-solution. The present work proposed heat treatments for IN718 AP-DED (homogenization – 1050, 1100, 1142, and 1185 °C / 2 h – followed by aging – 718 °C / 8 h, cooling at 56 °C / h, and 621 °C / 8 h). The as-built IN718 AP-DED showed the typical coarse and oriented (cube texture) microstructure with eutectics (Laves and MC-typical carbides) in the interdendritic region, which were significantly dissolved during the homogenization, promoting a high-volume fraction of hardening phase (γ′′ and γ′) and outstanding quasi-static mechanical properties after the aging step. The present work showed that IN718 AP-DED mechanical properties can be optimized through dedicated heat treatments, meeting the ductility and yield strength requirements (room temperature) of AMS 5662. Furthermore, the heat treatments did not alter the grain morphology and texture aspect, inducing a lower Young's modulus compared to the non-oriented material.",

    "abstract": "Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (VAM) is an emerging 3D printing technology that operates by fabricating objects from all points within a medium's volume. This technique is capable of producing parts without supporting structures and is capable of overprinting around existing structures. Notably, the approach that VAM utilises to print is time efficient compared to traditional additive manufacturing methods with printing times being measured in seconds and minutes instead of hours. As this is an emerging technique there is little comparison or synthesis reported so far in the literature, thus the primary objective of this review is to address this issue by providing a comprehensive analysis of VAM, delving into its applications, the challenges it faces, and the research advancements made in the area. This review also investigates how new methods of VAM are investigated and reported on, within the literature. In order to achieve this goal a structured literature review was conducted to thoroughly examine the current state of VAM. This review found 30 research papers, which were used to categorise different VAM methods, explore its potential in various fields, and formulate a definition for VAM to differentiate it from other additive manufacturing technologies. A key finding of this review was that while VAM offers rapid fabrication capabilities, it currently faces several constraints. These include a limited availability of commercial VAM printers, complex printing methodologies, a restricted range of compatible materials, and the need for specialised equipment. Collectively, these factors could serve as potential barriers to the broader adoption of this technology. In addition, there is a lack of homogeneity in the parameters used to investigate and report VAM which makes it difficult to compare and contrast new research works against existing published literature. As the field progresses, addressing these challenges will be essential to unlock new applications and increase adoption of this technology. This review is one of the first to explicitly focus on and address the entirety of VAM, offering valuable insights into the present state of VAM and directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Laser metal additive manufacturing has the potential to revolutionize the production of complex geometries with high precision across various industrial applications. To optimize the reliability of the process, a detailed understanding of the melt pool dynamics during the process is essential, particularly in the nearly pore-free regimes. In this study, the melt pool dynamics across conduction mode to keyhole mode in laser powder bed fusion processing of stainless steel 316 L have been investigated by means of in-situ synchrotron X-ray imaging utilizing tungsten particles as tracers. The spatial distribution of the fluid flow in the melt pool has been quantified with a resolution of ∼10 µm through automatic tracing all moving particles in the melt pool. The results identified the influence of the interplay between laser power and scanning speed on melt flow velocities. The measurements also revealed a pronounced impact of the inward Marangoni convection on the conduction-keyhole threshold, offering a new degree of freedom to broaden the pore-free process window of laser-based additive manufacturing. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the melt pool dynamics during laser metal additive manufacturing and provide a valuable reference for calibrating high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics models.",

    "abstract": "Rapid melt pool formation and solidification during the metal powder bed process Selective Laser Melting (SLM) generates large thermal gradients that can in turn lead to increased residual stress formation within a component. Metal anchors or supports are required to be built in-situ and forcibly hold SLM structures in place and minimise geometric distortion/warpage as a result of this thermal residual stress. Anchors are often costly, difficult and time consuming to remove and limit the geometric freedom of this Additive Manufacturing (AM) process. A novel method known as Anchorless Selective Laser Melting (ASLM) maintains processed material within a stress relieved state throughout the duration of a build. As a result metal components formed using ASLM do not require support structures or anchors. ASLM locally melts two or more powdered materials that alloy under the action of the laser and can form into various combinations of eutectic/hypo/hyper eutectic alloys with a new lower solidification temperature. This new alloy is maintained in a semi-solid or stress reduced state throughout the build with the assistance of elevated powder bed pre-heating. In this paper the ASLM methodology is detailed and investigations into processing of a low temperature eutectic Al-Si binary casting alloy is explored. Two types of Al powders were compared; pre-alloyed AlSi12 and elemental mix Al + 12 wt% Si. The study established an understanding of the laser in-situ alloying process and confirmed successful alloy formation within the process. Differential thermal analysis, microscopy and X-Ray diffraction were used to further understand the nature of alloying within the process. Residual stress reduction was observed within ASLM processed elemental Al + Si12 and geometries produced without the requirement for anchors.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental study on the metallurgical issues associated with selective laser melting of Invar 36 and stainless steel 316 L and the resulting coefficient of thermal expansion. Invar 36 has been used in aircraft control systems, electronic devices, optical instruments, and medical instruments that are exposed to significant temperature changes. Stainless steel 316 L is commonly used for applications that require high corrosion resistance in the aerospace, medical, and nuclear industries. Both Invar 36 and stainless steel 316 L are weldable austenitic face-centered cubic crystal structures, but stainless steel 316 L may experience chromium evaporation and Invar 36 may experience weld cracking during the welding process. Various laser process parameters were tested based on a full factorial design of experiments. The microstructure, material composition, coefficient of thermal expansion, and magnetic dipole moment were measured for both materials. It was found that there exists a critical laser energy density for each material, EC, for which selective laser melting process is optimal for material properties. The critical laser energy density provides enough energy to induce stable melting, homogeneous microstructure and chemical composition, resulting in thermal expansion and magnetic properties in line with that expected for the wrought material. Below the critical energy, a lack of fusion due to insufficient melt tracks and discontinuous beads was observed. The melt track was also unstable above the critical energy due to vaporization and microsegregation of alloying elements. Both cases can generate stress risers and part flaws during manufacturing. These flaws could be avoided by finding the critical laser energy needed for each material. The critical laser energy density was determined to be 86.8 J/mm3 for Invar 36 and 104.2 J/mm3 for stainless steel 316 L.",

    "abstract": "Selective laser melting is already established as a commercial production technique. Some high-end users are, however, struggling with the complexity, consistency and cost associated with the qualification of high-end products built using the technique. In-situ process monitoring is a promising means to accommodate this issue, but quantitative correlations between monitoring signals and actual part defects have been lacking. In this paper, results are presented that have been obtained with an off-axis melt pool monitoring system on a 3D Systems ProX DMP 320 using Ti-6Al-4 V ELI. The focus is on the development of a method for predicting the presence and location of lack of fusion porosities as they can have a large impact on part quality and are not always easily detected post-build. The processed signals from the monitoring system are shown to have a high degree of correlation with the presence of lack of fusion porosities as measured by CT scans. A prediction sensitivity of 90% for lack of fusion events in the range of pores having a volume greater than 0.001 mm3, roughly equivalent to 160 μm in diameter, was obtained.",

A compositional gradient from Ti25Zr50Nb0Ta25 to Ti25Zr0Nb50Ta25 is obtained by incrementally substituting Zr powder with Nb powder. A suitable strategy was developed to process the powder blend despite several challenges such as the high melting points of the refractory elements and the large differences in melting points among them. The influence of the LMD process on the final chemical composition was analyzed in detail and the LMD process was optimized to obtain a well-defined compositional gradient. Microstructures, textures, chemical compositions and mechanical properties were characterized using SEM, EBSD, EDX, and microhardness testing, respectively. Compositions between Ti25Zr0Nb50Ta25 and Ti25Zr25Nb25Ta25 were found to be single-phase bcc solid solutions with a coarse grain microstructure. Increasing the Zr to Nb ratio beyond the equiatomic composition results in finer and harder multiphase microstructures. The results shown in the present study clearly show for the first time that LMD is a suitable processing tool to screen HEAs over a range of chemical compositions.",

    "abstract": "The ever-growing applications of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in the production of low volume- high value metal parts can be attributed to improving AM processing capabilities and complex design freedom. However, secondary post-processing using traditional processes such as machining, grinding, heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing, i.e., Hybrid Manufacturing, is required to achieve Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), surface finish and desired mechanical properties. It is often challenging for most traditional manufacturers to participate in the rapidly evolving supply chain of direct digital manufacturing (DDM) through in-house investments in cost prohibitive metal AM. This research investigates a system of strategically-located AM hubs which can integrate hybrid-AM with the capabilities and excess capacity in multiple traditional manufacturing facilities. Using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) data for machine shops in the U.S., an uncapacitated facility location model is used to determine the optimal locations for AM hub centers based on: (1) geographical data, (2) demand and (3) cost of hybrid-AM processing. Results from this study have identified: (a) candidate US counties to build AM hubs, (b) total cost (fixed, operational and transportation) and (c) capacity utilization of the AM hubs. It was found that uncapacitated facility location models identified demand centroid as the optimal location and was affected only by AM utilization rate whereas a constrained p-median model identified 22 AM hub locations as the initial sites for AM hubs which grows to 44 AM hubs as demand increases. It was also found that transportation cost was not a significant factor in the hybrid-AM supply chain. Findings from this study will help both AM companies and traditional manufacturers to determine location in the U.S and key factors to advance the metal hybrid-AM supply chain.",

    "abstract": "Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) method that relies on the thermal extrusion of a thermoplastic feedstock from a mobile deposition head. Conventional FFF constructs components from stacks of individual extruded layers using tool paths with fixed z-values in each individual layer. Consequently, the manufactured components often contain inherent weaknesses in the z-axis due to the relatively weak thermal fusion bonding that occurs between individual layers, as well as poor surface finish in shallow sloped contours. This study demonstrates the use of Curved Layer FFF (CLFFF) tool paths in tandem with a commercially available parallel, or delta, style FFF system to allow the deposition head to follow the topology of the component. By incorporating a delta robot and CLFFF tool paths in this way, improvements in the surface finish of the manufactured parts has been observed, and time costs associated with Cartesian robot based CLFFF manufacturing have been notably reduced. Furthermore, employing a delta robot provides additional flexibility to CLFFF manufacturing and increases the feasibility of its application for advanced manufacturing. The study has also demonstrated a viable approach to multi-material FFF by decoupling support structure and part manufacture into regions of CLFFF and static z tool pathing in an appropriate fashion.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) has broad application prospects due to its high fabrication accuracy and excellent performance, but the dynamic mechanical properties of LPBF components are relatively low due to defects of the melt track such as protrusions and depressions, whose generation mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we investigate the correlation between the ex situ melt track properties and the in situ high-speed, high-resolution characterization. We correlate the protrusion at the starting position of the melt track with the droplet ejection behaviour and backward surging melt. We also reveal that the inclination angles of the depression walls are consistent with the ejection angles of the backward-ejected spatter. Furthermore, we quantify the vapour recoil pressure by in situ characterization of the deflection of the typical forward-ejected spatter. Our results clarify the intrinsic correlation of the melt track properties, which is important for the stable LPBF formation with few defects.",

In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM, the microstructure can be locally tailored by manipulating the solidification conditions point to point. In this work, we demonstrate this capability by varying the laser scanning angle during LPBF to produce stainless steel samples with controlled crystallographic textures. The resulting microstructures range from strongly textured blocks of arbitrary thickness and shape to gradient crystallographic textures. This strategy paves the way to a new generation of additively manufactured metals with optimized, site-specific properties to suit a wide range of applications.",

    "abstract": "For a detailed numerical analysis of laser–material interactions and melt pool dynamics in selective laser melting (SLM), it is important to consider correct powder layer height and packing density in a single layer. Thus far, most experts assume that the powder layer height, which is equal to the leveling height of the build platform divided by the packing density of the powder bed, reaches a steady state after several layers. However, this assumption neglects the fact that a certain amount of powder is deposited (e.g., by spatter), and therefore, does not contribute to the molten powder layer height and that the packing density in a single layer is smaller than in “bulk.” To determine the actual powder layer height and packing density in a single layer, experiments are conducted using two different materials (SS 17-4 PH and Ti6Al4V) and layer heights (30 and 50 μm). The results reveal that the powder layer height is between 4 and 5.5 times the leveling height of the build platform and is, therefore, significantly larger than that assumed thus far. This is an important finding to consider when one investigates the details of the laser–material interaction and melting process in SLM, e.g., by numerical simulations. The measured packing density varied between 44% and 56%.",

    "abstract": "In nature, mesoscopic or microscopic cellular structures like trabecular bone, wood, shell, and sea urchin, can have high load-carrying capacity. These cellular structures with diverse shapes, forms and designs can be mainly classified into open and closed cell cellular structures. It is difficult to replicate these natural complex lattice structures with traditional manufacturing, but additive manufacturing (AM) technology development has allowed engineers and scientists to mimic these natural structures. Fabricating close cell lattice structures is still considered difficult due to the support structure within the lattices. This paper evaluates a novel way of fabricating a close cell lattice structure with a material extrusion process. The design eliminates the need for support structures and the subsequent post-processing required to remove them. A shell-shaped close cell lattice structure bio-mimicking a sea urchin shape was introduced for the load-bearing structure application. The mechanical properties of the proposed structure, including stiffness, deformation behavior and energy absorption, were compared with those of benchmarked honeycomb and open cell sea urchin (SU) lattice structures of the same density. SU lattice structures and honeycomb periodic lattice structures with varied sizes but the same morphology and fixed density were designed and printed in polylactic acid material (PLA). Their physical characteristics, deformation behavior, and compressive properties were investigated experimentally and via finite element analysis. The effect of the unit cell size on mechanical properties was studied and discussed, and the rankings of better performances were drawn. A possible application of the closed cell is for fabricating the load bearing structure; it can also be encapsulated within a fluid to impart strength and damping characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Selective laser melting is an increasingly attractive technology for the manufacture of complex and low volume/high value metal parts. However, the inevitable residual stresses that are generated can lead to defects or build failure. Due to the complexity of this process, efficient and accurate prediction of residual stress in large components remains challenging. For the development of predictive models of residual stress, knowledge on their generation is needed. This study investigates the geometrical effect of scan strategy on residual stress development. It was found that the arrangement of scan vectors due to geometry, heavily influenced the thermal history within a part, which in turn significantly affected the transverse residual stresses generated. However, irrespective of the choice of scanned geometry and the thermal history, the higher magnitude longitudinal stresses had consistent behaviour based on the scan vector length. It was shown that the laser scan strategy becomes less important for scan vector length beyond 3 mm. Together, these findings, provide a route towards optimising scan strategies at the meso-scale, and additionally, developing a model abstraction for predicting residual stress based on scan vectors alone.",

    "abstract": "Laser beam Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-LB) is an increasingly attractive technology due to its capability of manufacturing complex and customised metal parts. However, the build cycle time and resulting residual stress profiles are limiting a wider uptake of PBF-LB manufacturing. The incorporation of additional laser beams in a single build chamber, i.e. multi-laser beam Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-MLB) technology, has been proposed as the next generation of PBF-LB technology. A series of computational process simulations of PBF-MLB was carried out using a 3D coupled thermomechanical model to investigate optimum multi-laser scanning strategies. The influences of twelve different scanning strategies on temperature, the final residual stresses, the z- (build) direction deflections by dual Gaussian profile laser beams PBF-MLB were investigated. It was found that the 90° layer rotation is necessary to reduce the residual stress, and a 'dual-laser following but time-delayed' scanning strategy had the lowest final residual stress. Another scanning strategy (45° rotation approaching beam scanning) resulted in the lowest z-direction deflection for the dual laser beams PBF-MLB manufacturing. These findings provide insight and application of PBF-MLB finite element process simulation in improving industrial additive manufacturing of metal components.",

    "abstract": "The material aging in selective laser sintering SLS of polyamide 12 is one challenge, which has to be overcome for implementation of this technique in serial production. High temperatures and along going processing times lead to chemical and physical aging effects of the supporting partcake material. Resulting aging mechanisms are not understood up to now. The investigations in this study aims at the influence of processing time and temperature on molecular changes and thermal properties of polyamide 12 partcake material in selective laser sintering. The focus of the investigations lays on the global heat exposure of the of the bulk material und thus on global material changes. Gel permeation chromatography analysis was used to determine the molecular weight distribution and changes of polymer structure. The Mark-Houwink plot exhibits a linear chain growth, which is a hint for a resulting solid state polycondensation. With increasing build time and build chamber temperature the average molecular weight is rising, whereby the influence of build time is more significant. The rise of chain length leads to a reduction of crystallization temperature, which was detected by DSC.",

    "abstract": "The microstructure and tensile property of Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.3 high entropy alloy (HEA) processed by selective laser melting (SLM) have been studied in comparisons to that fabricated by traditional cast & wrought (C&W) route. The C&W samples were annealed and then aged at 750 ℃ for 50 h to promote precipitation strengthening of L12 structured phase in FCC matrix. By contrast, SLM samples were aged directly at 750 ℃ for 50 h from the as-built condition, which possessed sub-micron dendritic segregation, internal stress and nano oxides; the result was a microstructure with not only L12 particles dispersion, but also L21 phase was formed at subgrain boundaries, nano oxides and dislocations were present in the matrix. The tensile properties of this HEA were significantly enhanced by the SLM and direct ageing process; the room temperature yield strength (1235 MPa) and ultimate tensile strength (1550 MPa) achieved in this work are the highest to-date for HEAs subjected to laser additive manufacturing processes. Comparing to those of C&W samples, the SLM samples at room temperature and 500 °C exhibited additional yield strengths of 284 MPa and 229 MPa, and additional ultimate tensile strengths of 240 MPa and 275 MPa, respectively. The degree of L12 phase precipitation strengthening was similar for both SLM and C&W samples subjected to the same ageing treatment, interestingly, the additional microstructure features of SLM sample provided extra strengthening contributions; detailed analysis on microstructure evolution and strengthening factors are presented and discussed in this article.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is the most prominent additive manufacturing (AM) technology for metal part production. Among the high number of factors influencing part quality and mechanical properties, the inter layer time (ILT) between iterative melting of volume elements in subsequent layers is almost completely unappreciated in the relevant literature on L-PBF. This study investigates the effect of ILT with respect to build height and under distinct levels of volumetric energy density (VED) using the example of 316L stainless steel. In-situ thermography is used to gather information on cooling conditions during the process, which is followed by an extensive metallographic analysis. Significant effects of ILT and build height on heat accumulation, sub-grain sizes, melt pool geometries and hardness are presented. Furthermore, the rise of defect densities can be attributed to a mutual interplay of build height and ILT. Hence, ILT has been identified as a crucial factor for L-PBF of real part components especially for those with small cross sections.",

    "abstract": "Voxel-based multimaterial jetting additive manufacturing allows fabrication of digital materials (DMs) at the meso-scale (∼1 mm) by controlling the deposition patterns of soft elastomeric and rigid glassy polymers at the voxel-scale (∼90 μm). The digital materials can then be used to create heterogeneous functionally graded material (FGM) structures at the macro-scale (∼10 mm) programmed to behave in a predefined manner. This offers huge potential for design and fabrication of novel and complex bespoke mechanical structures. This paper presents a complete design and manufacturing workflow that simultaneously integrates material design, structural design, and product fabrication of FGM structures based on digital materials. This is enabled by a regression analysis of the experimental data on mechanical performance of the DMs i.e., Young's modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break. This allows us to express the material behavior simply as a function of the microstructural descriptors (in this case, just volume fraction) without having to understand the underlying microstructural mechanics while simultaneously connecting it to the process parameters. Our proposed design and manufacturing approach is then demonstrated and validated in two series of design exercises to devise complex FGM structures. First, we design, computationally predict and experimentally validate the behavior of prescribed designs of FGM tensile structures with different material gradients. Second, we present a design automation approach for optimal FGM structures. The comparison between the simulations and the experiments with the FGM structures shows that the presented design and fabrication workflow based on our modeling approach for DMs at meso-scale can be effectively used to design and predict the performance of FGMs at macro-scale.",

    "abstract": "The thermal conductivity of AlSi10Mg made by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), and its modification via heat treatment, has received little attention despite possible applications for heat exchangers and thermo-mechanical components. Here, we show that heat treatment can increase the thermal conductivity of LPBF AlSi10Mg to that of cast material. Our results indicate that post-manufacture annealing eliminates the thermal conductivity anisotropy present in the as-built condition, and enhances the conductivity by close to 30 % in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the LPBF build orientation). A solution heat treatment increases the thermal conductivity further still (36 % compared to the as-built condition), while a T6-like treatment provides the greatest increase (44 % compared to the as-built condition). These improvements are related to the evolution of the AlSi10Mg microstructure, especially the breakdown of the Si cellular structure. Additionally, the thermal conductivities of gyroid lattice structures were examined in the as-built and annealed conditions. Contrary to solid specimens, the lattice structures exhibited almost isotropic thermal conductivity in the as-built condition. Their thermal conductivities were increased by the annealing treatment in proportion to their volume fraction. Our findings contribute to the development of a general design-for-additive-manufacturing (DfAM) framework which will make the best possible use of AM materials and lattice structures for heat transfer components.",

This in turn, affects the microstructure and consequently, the mechanical behavior of material. This paper aims to evaluate the effect of the AM part's thickness and geometry on microstructure, surface roughness, and mechanical properties under quasi-static and fatigue loading conditions by performing experimental tests. A series of Ti-6Al-4V specimens with three different thicknesses and two different geometries were fabricated using electron beam melting (EBM). The results of microstructural analyses revealed that specimens with lower build thickness experience finer grain size, higher microhardness, and lower elongation at failure. Although the microstructure of the produced parts was strongly affected by the build thickness, different surface to volume ratios eliminated the effect of microstructural differences and governed the fatigue properties of the parts. The size effect on the microstructural features, geometrical appearance, mechanical properties of the AM parts should be considered for the design and failure analysis of complex structures.",

The microstructural transformation, defect behavior, and Vickers hardness of the material were each determined as a function of the discrete chemical composition of the FGM varied in steps of 10 wt% of the two materials across its length. In particular, for the specific compositions of 30 wt% Inconel 718/70 wt% SS 316L and 20 wt% Inconel 718/80 wt% SS 316L, critical pores and cracks (defects) initiated by ceramic oxides occurred due to the presence of intermetallic and carbide compounds. In addition, the results of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the FGM demonstrate that the thermal and residual stresses due to constitutional supercooling and columnar-to-equiaxial transition (CET) became concentrated at the grain boundaries, thereby further contributing to the formation of the defects. The measured Vickers hardness was inevitably found to be minimal near the defective compositional range regardless of laser parameter optimization due to the reduced generation of segregants in the inter-dendritic regions and the increased formation of precipitates at the grain boundaries. The results of microstructural and mechanical analyses indicate that deliberate and strategic removal of the defective compositional range helped obtain a robust FGM composed of Inconel 718 and SS 316L without noticeable defects.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the additive manufacturing technique of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) was used to build up X30Mn21 austenitic advanced high strength steel (AHSS) samples. Different L-PBF process parameters were used to understand the correlation between process, microstructure, texture, and mechanical properties. The influence of build platform preheating (200 °C–800 °C), laser speed (550 mm/s - 950 mm/s) and scan strategy (bidirectional continuous and Mark&Sleep (M&S)) on grain size, grain morphology, size of solidification cells, dislocation density, and texture was studied. Local solidification parameters in the melt pool e.g. cooling rates, temperature gradients and solidification velocities were simulated by a FEM heat flow model and correlated with the solidification microstructure. By using SEM/EBSD analysis and tensile testing, the mechanical properties of the AHSS were assessed by considering microstructural aspects. It was found that AHSS, produced with higher laser speeds and an alternative M&S scan strategy, revealed a reduced grain size and texture intensity. This was attributed to a partial columnar to equiaxed transition (CET), as well as a significantly increased density of geometrically necessary dislocations. Preheating of the build platform promoted columnar grain growth with a more pronounced texture, low dislocation densities, and reduced yield strength. The influence of cooling rate, temperature gradient and solidification velocity on microstructural and textural evolution is discussed based on fundamental solidification theories.",

    "abstract": "17–4 PH (precipitation hardening) stainless steel is commonly used for the fabrication of complicated molds with conformal cooling channels using laser powder bed fusion process (L-PBF). However, their microstructure in the as-printed condition varies notably with the chemical composition of the feedstock powder, resulting in different age-hardening behavior. In the present investigation, 17–4 PH stainless steel components were fabricated by L-PBF from two different feedstock powders, and subsequently subjected to different combinations of post-process heat treatments. It was observed that the microstructure in as-printed conditions could be almost fully martensitic or ferritic, depending on the ratio of Creq/Nieq of the feedstock powder. Aging treatment at 480 °C improved the yield and ultimate tensile strengths of the as-printed components. However, specimens with martensitic structures exhibited accelerated age-hardening response compared with the ferritic specimens due to the higher lattice distortion and dislocation accumulation, resulting in the \"dislocation pipe diffusion mechanism\". It was also found that the martensitic structures were highly susceptible to the formation of reverted austenite during direct aging treatment, where 19.5% of austenite phase appeared in the microstructure after 15 h of direct aging. Higher fractions of reverted austenite activates the transformation induced plasticity and improves the ductility of heat treated specimens. The results of the present study can be used to tailor the microstructure of the L-PBF printed 17–4 PH stainless steel by post-process heat treatments to achieve a good combination of mechanical properties.",

Specimens were manufactured using varying laser parameters, 3 scan strategies (Contour, Points, Pulsing) and 4 materials. The materials investigated were two titanium alloys: commercially pure grade 2 (CP-Ti) and Ti6Al4V ELI, commercially pure tantalum (Ta) and a titanium-tantalum alloy (Ti-30Ta). The trends observed during fatigue testing for monolithic metals and statically for solid and porous AM materials were not always indicative of the high cycle fatigue behaviour of porous AM materials. Unlike their solid counterparts, porous tantalum and the titanium-tantalum alloy had the greatest fatigue strength for a given stiffness, 8% greater than CP-Ti and 19% greater than Ti6Al4V ELI. Optimisation of the laser parameters and scan strategies was found to also increase the fatigue strength for a given stiffness of porous AM materials by 7–8%.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the performance of a focus variation instrument for measurement of areal topography of metal additive surfaces was investigated. Samples were produced using both laser and electron beam powder bed fusion processes with some of the most common additive materials: Al-Si-10Mg, Inconel 718 and Ti-6Al-4V. Surfaces parallel and orthogonal to the build direction were investigated. Measurement performance was qualified by visually inspecting the topographic models obtained from measurement and quantified by computing the number of non-measured data points, by estimating local repeatability error in topography height determination and by computing the value of the areal field texture parameter Sa. Variations captured through such indicators were investigated as focus variation-specific measurement control parameters were varied. Changes in magnification, illumination type, vertical resolution and lateral resolution were investigated. The experimental campaign was created through full factorial design of experiments, and regression models were used to link the selected measurement process control parameters to the measured performance indicators. The results indicate that focus variation microscopy measurement of metal additive surfaces is robust to changes of the measurement control parameters when the Sa texture parameter is considered, with variations confined to sub-micrometre scales and within 5% of the average parameter value for the same surface and objective. The number of non-measured points and the local repeatability error were more affected by the choice of measurement control parameters. However, such changes could be predicted by the regression models, and proved consistent once material, type of additive process and orientation of the measured surface are set.",

    "abstract": "Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is the predominant metal additive manufacturing technique that benefits from a significant body of academic study and industrial investment given its ability to create complex geometry parts. Despite LPBF's widespread use, there still exists a need for process monitoring to ensure reliable part production and reduce post-build quality assessments. Towards this end, we develop and evaluate machine learning-based predictive models using height map-derived quality metrics for single tracks and the accompanying pyrometer and high-speed video camera data collected under a wide range of laser power and laser velocity settings. We extract physically intuitive low-level features representative of the meltpool dynamics from these sensing modalities and explore how these vary with the linear energy density. We find our Sequential Decision Analysis Neural Network (SeDANN) model – a scientific machine learning model that incorporates physical process insights – outperforms other purely data-driven black box models in both accuracy and speed. The general approach to data curation and adaptable nature of SeDANN's scientifically informed architecture should benefit LPBF systems with an evolving suite of sensing modalities and post-build quality measurements.",

Power was predicted with an accuracy of ±20% for a wide range of conditions for pulsed TIG and plasma deposition. Interesting differences in the power requirements were observed where a surface depression was produced with the plasma process due to differences in melting efficiency and/or convection effects.

    "abstract": "Modelling of wire-arc additive manufacturing process is an effective way for adapting the optimum parameters as well as understanding and managing the sequences of layer-by-layer deposition. Some of these parameters such as toolpath, deposition intervals and heat source power play important roles in improving the process viability and cost efficiency. In this article, we have studied Al-5Mg, Al-3Si alloys as demonstrators, from both experimental and modelling perspectives, to benchmark different deposition parameters and provided guidelines for optimising the process conditions. Physical values such as total distortion and residual stress were selected as indicators for the manufacturability of the structure. The simulations were performed by Simufact Welding software, that is outfitted with the MARC solver and the experiments were executed in a robotic cell. We have introduced a method for optimising the process parameters based on the heat source power modification and selection of unique parameters for each deposition layer. This was performed by monitoring the evolution of the molten pool size and geometry when building a wall structure. The results suggest that achieving an uninterrupted deposition process entails modification of the heat input for each layer. Thus, a simple analytical method was proposed to estimate the heat input reduction coefficient for a wall structure as a function of molten pool geometry and the height at which, a new layer is being deposited. It was also shown that a generic selection of parameters for aluminium alloys may impair the eventual quality for some of the alloys due to their inherent physical properties such as high temperature flowability.",

    "abstract": "Metallic cellular solids are a class of materials known for their high specific mechanical properties, being desirable in applications where a combination of high strength or stiffness and low density are important. These lightweight materials are often stochastic and manufactured by foaming or casting. If regular (periodic) lattice structures are desired, they may be manufactured by metallic additive manufacturing techniques. However, these have characteristic issues, such as un-melted powders, porosity and heterogeneous microstructures. This study reports a novel low-cost route for producing regular lattice structures by an additive manufacturing assisted investment casting technique. Fused filament fabrication is used to produce the lattice structure pattern which is infiltrated with plaster. The pattern is then burnt off and the aluminum is cast in vacuum. In this way we can manufacture non-stochastic metallic lattices having fine struts/ribs (0.6 mm cross-section using a 0.4 mm nozzle) and relative densities down to 0.036. X-ray micro computed tomography (μCT) showed that as-cast A356 Aluminium alloy frameworks have high dimensional tolerances and fine detail control. Frameworks based on units of six connected struts ranging from intruding (auxetic) to protruding (hexagonal) strut angles are studied. Vertical struts are finer than expected, reducing their moment of area which could impact their compressive strength. This new, low cost, route for producing high precision metallic cellular lattices offers an attractive alternative to other additive manufacturing techniques (e.g. selective laser and electron beam melting).",

    "abstract": "Laser-matter interactions in laser additive manufacturing (LAM) occur on short time scales (10−6–10−3 s) and have traditionally proven difficult to characterise. We investigate these interactions during LAM of stainless steel SS316L and 13-93 bioactive glass powders using a custom built LAM process replicator (LAMPR) with in situ and operando synchrotron X-ray real-time radiography. This reveals a wide range of melt track solidification phenomena as well as spatter and porosity formation. We hypothesise that the SS316L powder absorbs the laser energy at its surface while the trace elements in the 13-93 bioactive glass powder absorb and remit the infra-red radiation. Our results show that a low viscosity melt, e.g. 8 mPa s for SS316L, tends to generate spatter (diameter up to 250 μm and an average spatter velocity of 0.26 m s−1) and form a melt track by molten pool wetting. In contrast, a high viscosity melt, e.g. 2 Pa s for 13-93 bioactive glass, inhibits spatter formation by damping the Marangoni convection, forming a melt track via viscous flow. The viscous flow in 13-93 bioactive glass resists pore transport; combined with the reboil effect, this promotes pore growth during LAM, resulting in a pore size up to 600 times larger than that exhibited in the SS316L sample.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing technologies in general and laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) in particular have been on the rise in different applications, including biomedical implants. The effects of the various l-PBF process parameters on the microstructure and properties of Ti6Al4V lattice structures have been studied before. However, the relationship between the different modes of laser scanning and the resulting microstructure, internal imperfections, and surface morphology is still underexplored. In this study, the aforementioned parameters and their effect on the compressive mechanical properties and fatigue behaviour of lattice titanium have been studied for both continuous and pulsed laser scanning modes. Moreover, the influence of various combinations of post-processing treatments, such as hot isostatic pressing (HIP), sandblasting, and chemical etching, on the quasi-static mechanical properties and fatigue endurance of the resulting materials were investigated. It was found that continuous laser strategy results in fewer imperfections and higher fatigue resistance, while pulsed laser showed a more homogenous microstructure; likely leading to a more isotropic behaviour. Furthermore, the continuous mode showed larger prior β grains preferentially oriented in the building direction, while pulsed specimens exhibited finer equiaxed grains with no preferred orientations. The highest level of fatigue life was obtained by using an optimized combination of HIP, sandblasting, and chemical etching.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) technology is one of the additive manufacturing (AM) processes that uses metal powder to produce parts for various industry sectors such as medical, aerospace, automotive and oil & gas. As an 'additive' based process, the material is selectively melted by a focused laser. By this working principle material is added in a layer-by-layer approach only where is needed. Therefore, this technology enables a high reduction of waste by avoiding chips typically generated in 'subtractive' based processes such as milling and drilling. However, to ensure lower waste consumption the metal powder surrounding the solidified part must be reused in subsequent build jobs. Current knowledge on the effect of powder reuse on LPBF builds is mostly limited to titanium- and nickel- based alloys. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of powder reuse on Al–Mg–Sc–Zr, a high strength aluminium-based alloy, manufactured by LPBF. Here, powder properties such as morphology, composition, particle size distribution are studied of virgin (pristine) and reused Al–Mg–Sc–Zr powder. The mechanical properties of specimens made of virgin powder and after four build cycles are analysed and compared to assess the influence of a mixture of virgin and reused powder material on the consolidated material properties. In general, the powder does not present large differences in composition and morphology, only the reused powder presents coarser particle size distribution (PSD) as previously observed in other alloy compositions. The microstructure of the studied specimens is very similar unlike the porosity. The specimens built with reused powder show a few small micro-sized pores which do not show significant differences in the mechanical properties. In fact, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation to break of specimens, respectively built with virgin and reused powder are 565 MPa, 13% and 537 MPa, 11%. Based on the obtained results, it is concluded that it is feasible to reuse Al–Mg–Sc–Zr powder in four subsequent build jobs with proper powder sieving and a rejuvenation step mixing 40% of virgin powder.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the possibility of producing medium-to-large batches has increased the interest in polymer powder bed fusion technologies such as selective laser sintering (SLS) and multi jet fusion (MJF). Only scant data about the characterization of parts produced by MJF can be found in the literature, and fatigue behavior studies are absent. This study analyzes the material properties of Polyamide 12 (PA12) powders and printed specimens using both SLS and MJF technologies. The morphology, crystalline phases, density, porosity, dimensional accuracy, and roughness are measured and compared; tensile and fatigue tests are performed to assess the effect of the technologies on the mechanical behavior of the produced structures. In addition, lattice structure specimens obtained by different geometric modeling approaches are tested to understand the influence of modeling methods on the fatigue life. The PA12 powders printed by both SLS and MJF mainly show by X-Ray Diffraction γ-phase and a small shoulder of α-phase. The crystallinity decreases after printing the powders both in SLS and MJF technology. The printed parts fabricated using the two technologies present a total porosity of 7.95% for SLS and 6.75% for MJF. The roughness values are similar, Ra ≈ 11 µm along the building direction. During tensile tests, SLS samples appear to be stiffer, with a lower plastic deformation than MJF samples, that are tougher than SLS ones. Fatigue tests demonstrate higher dispersion for MJF specimens and an enhancement of fatigue life for both SLS and MJF printed lattice structures modeled with a novel geometric modeling approach that allows the creation of smoother surfaces at nodal points. Scanning electron microscopy on fracture surfaces shows a brittle failure for the SLS tensile specimens, a more ductile failure for the MJF tensile specimens, a crazing failure mechanism for the SLS fatigue tested samples, and a crack initiation and slow growth and propagation for the MJF fatigue tested samples.",

    "abstract": "The surface morphology of a product plays a crucial role under mechanical loading and chemical environment. Surfaces of Selective Laser Melting (SLM) products often contain high roughness, which varies in different planes as well. The authors have explored the surface characteristics of the SLM samples that are influenced by different combinations of laser processing parameters. The considered processing parameters were Energy Density (ED) and its technological parameters namely laser power, scanning speed and hatch spacing. Additionally, a comparison study has been executed by rescanning effects considering melting with low ED and, thereafter, rescanning by the best possible laser processing parameters. The results evidently showed that the surface morphologies differ significantly due to different laser processing parameters. Eventually, the thermal and physical behavior of materials, such as the viscosity of the melt pool, thermal and physical stability of the melt pool, solidification time, cooling time, shrinkage, capillary effect, surface tension, balling effect, and the amount of melting of a powder particle, influenced the surface properties of the samples, along with unpredictability. The results showed an interesting correlation between the processing parameters and the occurrence of microcracks on the vertical walls of the specimens caused by the partially melted adhered powder particles.",

    "abstract": "The hierarchical nature of additively manufactured materials necessitates a multimodal approach for quantifying microstructural features and corresponding chemical heterogeneities that ultimately impact their properties and performance. In laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) 316L stainless steel, corrosion behavior has been discussed in the context of chemical heterogeneities formed in the presence of these hierarchical microstructures. Here, we employ a suite of advanced synchrotron x-ray techniques and correlative transmission electron microscopy for the analysis of microstructure and chemical heterogeneities in L-PBF 316L as a function of printing speed. Our findings reveal an appreciable dislocation density consistent with the formation of a cellular dislocation microstructure in L-PBF 316L, which is correlated to spatial variations in the local Cr concentration and the formation of complex Mn7C3 nanoinclusions. Cyclic voltammetry experiments reveal that relative to wrought 316L, the printed samples exhibit either a comparable or marginally reduced susceptibility to uniform corrosion but with an increased affinity for pitting particularly in the samples printed at the highest speed with the largest dislocation density. Given the spatial correlations between regions of high dislocation density and the formation of chemical heterogeneities known to degrade corrosion performance, our findings demonstrate the impact of the microstructural defect state and its variation with printing speed on the resistance of L-PBF 316L to uniform and localized corrosion.",

    "abstract": "High residual stresses are typical in additively manufactured metals and can reach levels as high as the yield strength, leading to distortions and even cracks. Here, an in situ method for controlling residual stress during laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing was demonstrated. By illuminating the surface of a build with homogeneously intense, shaped light from a set of laser diodes, the thermal history was controlled thereby reducing the residual stress in as-built parts. 316L stainless steel bridge-shaped parts were built to characterize the effect of in situ annealing on the residual stress. A reduction in the overall residual stress value of up to 90% was realized without altering the as-built grain structure (no grain growth). Some annealing effects on the cellular-dendritic solidification structure (patterns of higher solute content) occurred in areas that experienced prolonged exposure to elevated temperature. A comparison of the in situ process to conventional post-build annealing demonstrated equivalent stress reduction compared to rule-of-thumb thermal treatments. Use of this method could reduce or remove the need for post processing to remove residual stresses.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy disclosed that the microstructure of SLM 420 consisted of colonies of 0.5–1 μm sized cells and submicron martensitic needles with 11 wt. % austenite. Tempering of as-built SLM 420 stainless steel at 400 °C resulted in ultra-high strength material with high ductility. Ultimate tensile strength of 1800 MPa and yield strength of 1400 MPa were recorded with an elongation of 25%. Phase transformation analysis was carried out using Rietveld refinement of XRD data and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), which showed the transformation of martensite to austenite, and resulted in austenite content of 36 wt. % in tempered SLM 420 stainless steel. Transformation induced plasticity (TRIP), austenite formation and fine cellular substructure along with sub-micron martensite needles resulted in stainless steel with high tensile strength and ductility. The advanced mechanical properties were compared with conventionally made ultra-high-strength steels, and the microstructure-properties relationships were disclosed.",

    "abstract": "This is the first comprehensive study on the development of a cubic crystallographic texture in pure chromium (Cr) manufactured using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) with different laser energy densities to alter its microstructure and high-temperature oxidation behavior. An increase in the laser energy density led to the formation of a strong crystallographic texture, which was preferentially oriented in the (100) plane, and there were microstructural improvements in the pure Cr. The grain size of the (100)-oriented Cr was larger than that of the randomly oriented Cr. In addition, the high-angle grain boundary and coincident site lattice (CSL) boundary characteristics were altered. The (100)-oriented Cr exhibited a decrease in the oxide thickness that was due to the decrease in the grain boundary density with a larger grain size and an increase in the CSL boundary ratio. In contrast, the Cr with a random texture showed higher oxidation kinetics and spallation of the oxide layer. The oxidation kinetics of the pure Cr manufactured using LPBF obeyed the parabolic rate law. However, the crystal orientation affected the oxidation of the Cr as the (100)-oriented pure Cr displayed a lower parabolic rate constant, indicating that the (100)-oriented Cr was oxidation-resistant. This is the first report to demonstrate the cubic crystallographic texture formation and the improvement of high-temperature oxidation resistance in Cr manufactured using LPBF.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we present the first results of a newly developed melt pool monitoring tool for selective laser melting, called DMP-meltpool. A manual data analysis method is given, and the events indicated by the analysis (DMP-meltpool events) are shown to correlate to the static tensile properties of the samples built. These events indicate the probability of material discontinuities (defects) in the metal additive manufacturing (AM) parts. In order to do so, cylindrical bars of Ti-6Al-4V ELI were built and monitored using DMP-meltpool. The tensile properties of the printed cylinders were correlated with the events detected by DMP-meltpool. An inverse relation between plastic elongation and the DMP-meltpool event density was observed. These results show that DMP-meltpool can be used to predict the quality of AM parts by detecting variations in the signals and tagging these events throughout the build as defects. Thus the technique can be employed for first stage in-line quality control of AM parts and for sorting out parts with potential defects non-destructively. The DMP-meltpool events could have significant correlations with other mechanical properties (like fatigue, hardness, fracture toughness, and crack propagation) since such properties are influenced by defects originating from the process instabilities.",

Experimental temperature measurements were utilised to predict microstructural evolution during successive addition of layers. Segregation of alloying elements as well as formation of Laves and δ phase was specifically modelled. The predicted elemental concentrations were then used in transformation kinetics to estimate changes in Continuous Cooling Transformation (CCT) and Time Temperature Transformation (TTT) diagrams for Alloy 718. Modelling results showed good agreement with experimentally observed phase evolution within the microstructure. The results indicate that the approach can be a valuable tool, both for improving process understanding and for process development including subsequent heat treatment.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a new approach is developed to integrate a particle-based (seed crystals) nucleation mechanism into the Cellular Automata (CA) simulation of powder-bed laser beam melting. The model aims to reflect two features observed in the microstructures of additively manufactured Al alloys: the fusion boundary nucleation which violates the principle of common bulk nucleation favored under high solidification rates and low thermal gradients, and the epitaxial growth at the melt-pool bottom as observed in the microstructure of AlSi10Mg alloy. Based on the proposed nucleation model, a CA cell will accommodate a nucleus after a few physics-based nomination and activation criteria have been passed. The fusion boundary nucleation can be reproduced by the model with a nomination criterion that restricts nucleation to the CA cells having a maximum experienced temperature below the particle dissolution temperature. However, the second observed feature needs an additional criterion to incorporate the nucleation incubation time. This is interpreted through the competition between the epitaxial growth and the nucleation which results in different behaviors at different melt-pool regions. Accordingly, the model offers high flexibility in calibration based on the growth and nucleation kinetics. The set of parameters used for AlSi10Mg are capable to deliver a similar microstructure and texture compared to the experiments. Moreover, a very high nucleation density along with a lower nucleation incubation time can lead to the bimodal grain structure observed in Sc-modified aluminum alloys.",

    "abstract": "Powder bed fusion is one of the most common types of additive manufacturing processes using granular materials. In this field, improvements in the processing of materials and process repeatability with desired part quality are needed to allow the implementation of powder bed fusion process at full scale across various industrial sectors. The microstructure and the thermo-mechanical properties of the components vary according to the process parameters adopted in the manufacturing process. Physically accurate modeling of the powder bed fusion process can play a vital role in the qualification of components and materials and also can help in predicting the experimental observations. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on the state of the art referred to numerical simulation of powder bed fusion, by covering both mesh based approaches such as finite element modeling, finite volume modeling and mesh free methods such as the discrete element modeling, the lattice Boltzmann method, the optimal transportation method and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics approach. Combined approaches of different methods are discussed as well. A case study comparing two different types of models for a similar type of problem has been provided. Moreover, means of experimental techniques used to validate the numerical models are briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Cementitious materials are widely used in construction. For their low ductility, they typically need to be reinforced by steel rebars, which cause potential corrosion problems. Polymeric reinforcement, which does not have corrosion problems, has been used to replace steel rebars. However, a relatively high reinforcing ratio is usually required for the cementitious composites reinforced by conventional polymeric reinforcement. Owing to the customizability of 3D printing technology, polymeric reinforcement with a functionally graded structure is able to be manufactured, which significantly reduces the reinforcing ratio of the reinforced cementitious composites meanwhile improves their mechanical properties. In this present study, 3D printed polymeric octet lattice structures were used as reinforcement to develop cementitious composites with enhanced ductility. Four-point bending experiments were performed on the plain mortar, and the reinforced specimens and a finite element model was used to simulate the experiments numerically. A good agreement between experiments and simulations was found: the reinforced specimens have a significantly increased flexural ductility comparing to plain mortar. Composites reinforced by vertically functionally graded lattice structures have a significantly lower reinforcing ratio while exhibiting obviously higher normalized ductility. In addition, the fracture behavior of the reinforced cementitious composites was evaluated using a fracture energy based analytical model. The analysis shows that, from the perspective of fracture energy release, the steady state cracking criteria were not satisfied by the cementitious composites developed in this study so that multiple cracking and strain hardening behavior was not obtained. However, according to numerical predictions, increasing strength of the printed reinforcement material by 40% would allow these behaviors to be potentially achieved. This work shows that additive manufacturing has great potential for developing reinforcement for cementitious materials to reduce the reinforcing ratio and enhance ductility.",

    "abstract": "Powder-based additive manufacturing techniques provide tools to construct intricate structures that are difficult to manufacture using conventional methods. In Laser Powder Bed Fusion, components are iteratively built by selectively melting specific areas of the powder bed to form the two-dimensional cross section of the specific part. However, the high occurrence of defects impact the adoption of this method for precision applications. Therefore, a control policy for dynamically altering process parameters to avoid phenomena that lead to defect occurrences is necessary. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework that derives a versatile control strategy for minimizing the likelihood of these defects is presented. The generated control policy alters either the velocity or power of the laser during the melting process to ensure the consistency of the melt pool and reduce overheating in the generated product. The control policy is trained and validated on efficient simulations of the continuum temperature distribution of the powder bed layer under various laser trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing has facilitated fabrication of complex and patient-specific metallic meta-biomaterials that offer an unprecedented collection of mechanical, mass transport, and biological properties as well as a fully interconnected porous structure. However, applying meta-biomaterials for addressing unmet clinical needs in orthopedic surgery requires additional surface functionalities that should be induced through tailor-made coatings. Here, we developed multi-functional layer-by-layer coatings to simultaneously prevent implant-associated infections and stimulate bone tissue regeneration. We applied multiple layers of gelatin- and chitosan-based coatings containing either bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 or vancomycin on the surface of selective laser melted porous structures made from commercial pure Titanium (CP Ti) and designed using a triply periodic minimal surface (i.e., sheet gyroid). The additive manufacturing process resulted in a porous structure and met the the design values comparatively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra confirmed the presence and composition of the coating layers. The release profiles showed a continued release of both vancomycin and BMP-2 for 2–3 weeks. Furthermore, the developed meta-biomaterials exhibited a very strong antibacterial behavior with up to 8 orders of magnitude reduction in both planktonic and implant-adherent bacteria and no signs of biofilm formation. The osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells was enhanced, as shown by two-fold increase in the alkaline phosphatase activity and up to four-fold increase in the mineralization of all experimental groups containing BMP-2. Eight-week subcutaneous implantation in vivo showed no signs of a foreign body response, while connective tissue ingrowth was promoted by the layer-by-layer coating. These results unequivocally confirm the superior multi-functional performance of the developed biomaterials.",

Avoidance of defects during L-PBF is crucial for the production of high quality Nitinol parts. In this study, analytical models predicting melt pool dimensions and defect formation criteria were synergistically used to develop processing maps demonstrating boundary conditions for the formation of such defects, as balling, keyhole-induced pores, and lack of fusion. Experimental validation has demonstrated that this method can provide an accurate estimation and guide manufacturability of defect-free Nitinol alloys. Moreover, the crack formation phenomena were experimentally analysed, which showed that a low linear energy density (El) should be chosen to avoid cracks in the optimized process windows. Based on model predictions and experimental calibrations, Nitinol samples with a relative density of more than 99% were successfully fabricated.",

    "abstract": "Drop-on-demand jetting of metals offers a fully digital manufacturing approach to surpass the limitations of the current generation powder-based additive manufacturing technologies. However, research on this topic has been restricted mainly to near-net shaping of relatively low melting temperature metals. Here it is proposed a novel approach to jet molten metals at high-temperatures (>1000 °C) to enable the direct digital additive fabrication of micro- to macro-scale objects. The technique used in our research – \"MetalJet\" - is discussed by studying the ejection and the deposition of two example metals, tin and silver. The applicability of this new technology to additive manufacturing is evaluated through the study of the interface formed between the droplets and the substrate, the inter-droplets bonding, the microstructure and the geometrical fidelity of the printed objects. The research shows that the integrity of the samples (in terms of density as well as metallurgy) varies dramatically in the two investigated materials due to the different conditions that are required to melt the interface of the stacked droplets. Nevertheless the research shows that by a careful choice of the jetting strategy and sintering treatments 3D structures of various complexity can be formed. This research paves the way towards the next generation metal additive manufacturing where various printing resolutions and multi-material capabilities could be used to obtain functional components for applications in printed electronics, medicine and the automotive sectors.",

An island of unmelted powder forms inside the melt pool, in the centre of the laser spot, which can be attributed to the highly focussed powder flow and the laser beam configuration used. On contact with the melt pool, the powder grains melt to join the melt pool, or they overcome surface tension and are engulfed by the melt. Powder grains can also incorporate into a mushy zone that may be present on the powder island. The powder island appears to rotate in the melt pool and incorporates relatively slowly. The speed of rotation is connected to the size of the island, which also depends on the energy density used. Spatter can form from the edges of the melt pool or from areas around the island when molten metal droplets burst. Frames from high-speed videos are presented and reasons for the various phenomena observed are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Residual stresses and deflections are two major issues in laser-based powder bed fusion (L-PBF) parts. One of the most efficient and reliable ways for predicting residual stresses and final distortions is via a calibrated numerical model. In this work, a part-scale finite element thermo-mechanical model for Ti6Al4V is developed in the commercial software Abaqus/CAE 2018. The flash heating (FH) method is used as the initial multi-scaling law to avoid time-consuming meso-scale simulations. The model has been verified by doing a mesh-independency analysis. To check the validity of the model, dedicated experiments involving samples with specific scanning strategies were performed. Experimental measurements were made by optical 3D scanning with the fringe projection technique. An in-house made Python script was written for the stripe-wise and layer-wise partitioning of the numerical model, along with material and boundary condition attributions. As expected, the results show that layer-wise FH is insensitive to the scanning pattern and will lead to an isotropic stress field. It is shown that the FH method overestimates the minimum deflection magnitude compared to the experiments by 46.2 %. Sequential FH (SFH) is then proposed to resolve this problem. Results show that by refining the stripe widths in SFH from 15 mm to 1.5 mm, the deviation between the predicted and measured deflection reduces from 35.7 % to 1.19 %. However, the required computational time increases from 9.3 h to 65 h.",

    "abstract": "Spatial control of microstructure within a three-dimensional component has been a dream of materials scientists for centuries. However, limitations in traditional manufacturing processes prevent detailed control over the distribution of microstructures in a single part. Here, we demonstrate the ability to control grain structure and crystallographic texture during metal additive manufacturing for arbitrary cross-sections of a practical size, with profound implications for the design and optimization of next-generation products. The key to this advance is a new geometry agnostic scan path algorithm that manipulates the spatial distribution of solidification conditions. Utilizing a fundamental understanding of solidification dynamics and a model of the heat transfer during processing, we have designed this algorithm to manipulate the natural competition between epitaxial dendrite growth and grain nucleation. With this algorithm, we successfully controlled the grain structure of Ni-based superalloy IN718 in the shape of the Mona Lisa.",

In addition, pronounced shape memory effect (SME) and pseudo-elasticity (PE), which exceed those measured for the conventionally fabricated Fe–17Mn–5Si–10Cr–4Ni-1(V,C) alloy containing VC precipitates, are achieved. The texture generated during the LPBF process brings to SME and PE highly dependent on the orientation of the loading direction with respect to the build direction. Improved strain recovery is observed when the loading direction is parallel to the build direction due to an increased amount of (101) orientated grains with high Schmid factor and low yield strength for phase transformation. Pronounced shape recovery is also obtained in more complex geometries successfully fabricated with the same manufacturing technique.",

    "abstract": "Polymer metallization via cold spray additive manufacturing is an emerging thermal spray approach for deposition of thick metallic coatings on polymers and fiber-reinforced composites that promises high productivity, ecofriendliness, and scalability of the coating process. In polymer metallization via cold spray, solid metallic powder is accelerated by a supersonic stream of preheated gas and propelled toward a polymer substrate, where it is built layer-by-layer via impact-induced heating and particle deformation. Since the pioneering study at Cambridge in 2006, nearly 50 experimental reports on polymer metallization via cold spray have been published, half of which have appeared within the past three years. This review distinguishes cold spray from other thermal spray methods, analyzes the peculiarities of cold spraying on polymers and fiber-reinforced composites, outlines the historical establishment of the field, and summarizes the available literature on polymer metallization via cold spray. The major focus here is on the influence of the cold spray process parameters on the deposition efficiency, adhesion strength, electrical conductivity and other properties of metallic coatings formed on polymers and fiber-reinforced composites. The promising applications of cold spray additive manufacturing in lightning strike protection, electroplating, osseointegration, antifouling, antivirus, e.g. anti-Covid-19 surfaces, and other surface functionalizations have been reviewed. Finally, recommendations were given on how to enhance the data reuse in future studies on polymer metallization via cold spray.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing of metals by 3D printing of polymeric filaments containing high loading of metal powder, subsequent debinding, and sintering offers a potent alternative to the widespread beam-based processes. The polymeric binder is the decisive component for a successful fabrication process. This study presents the development of a multi-component binder system for filament-based 3D printing of 316 L stainless steel in various optimization steps. The binder contains a polyethylene (PE) backbone, which ensures the structural integrity during solvent debinding. A soluble binder component consisting of a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) and a second PE is used, to reduce the polymer content via solvent extraction prior to thermal debinding. The TPE grants flexibility to the filaments, while the PE allows reduction of the viscosity and increase in stiffness and strength. This enables precise tuning of the rheological and mechanical properties of the filaments. The capabilities of the binder system developed, are demonstrated by the fabrication of 3D plate-lattices. The structures are printed, subjected to a two-step solvent – thermal debinding procedure, and finally sintered. In the compression tests the structures are able to undergo large plastic deformations without fracture, highlighting their potential for energy absorption applications. The main contribution of this work is the development and disclosure of a binder system with two types of soluble polymers. This allows the precise control of the mechanical and rheological properties, as well as the backbone fraction of the binder. Based on the characterization performed, the binder system can be easily modified to adapt for other solid loading materials and fractions, as parameters like stiffness, viscosity, or backbone content can be adjusted precisely.",

    "abstract": "The fabrication of large components using a high deposition rate, near-net shape process like Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a promising option for many industries, due to the potential for reduction in material wastage and shorter lead times in comparison to conventional methods. Specialist materials like nickel-base superalloys, which are typically used in high temperature and corrosive environments, are particularly attractive options due to their high raw material costs. Although nickel-base Alloy 718 seems well suited to the process due to its good weldability, process-induced defects can arise from unfavourable deposition conditions and elimination of these defects may not always be possible. In WAAM Alloy 718 deposited under such conditions, crack-like defects with planar morphology and hot cracking characteristics were observed. These defects were observable using conventional non-destructive testing techniques and displayed directionality relating to the deposition path. The fracture behaviour of WAAM Alloy 718 containing these defects was \"semi-stable\" – a mixture of fracture instability and stable crack extension. The apparent fracture toughness of WAAM Alloy 718 containing these defects was found to be anisotropic, which can be attributed to the interaction of the notched crack with pre-existing defects. WAAM Alloy 718 displayed an apparent fracture toughness comparable to that of wrought Alloy 718 when notched perpendicular to the defects; but only half that of wrought when notched parallel to the defects. Therefore, careful consideration of defect orientation and their effects on mechanical properties is important in assessing the fitness-for-service of WAAM Alloy 718.",

However, existing metamaterials are, with few exceptions, physically continuous throughout their volume, and thus cannot take advantage of multi-body behavior or contact interactions. Here we introduce the concept of multi-body interpenetrating lattices, where two or more lattices interlace through the same volume without any direct connection to each other. This new design freedom allows us to create architected interpenetrating structures where energy transfer is controlled by surface interactions. As a result, multifunctional or composite-like responses can be achieved even with only a single print material. While the geometry defining interpenetrating lattices has been studied since the days of Euclid, additive manufacturing allows us to turn these mathematical concepts into physical objects with programmable interface-dominated properties. In this first study on interpenetrating lattices, we reveal remarkable mechanical properties including improved toughness, multi-stable/negative stiffness behavior, and electromechanical coupling.",

Recent research on process monitoring focuses strongly on integrated optical measurement technology. Besides optical sensors, acoustic sensors also seem promising. Previous studies have shown the potential of analyzing structure-borne and air-borne acoustic emissions in laser welding. Only a few works evaluate the potential that lies in the usage during the L-PBF process. This work shows how the approach to structure-borne acoustic process monitoring can be elaborated by correlating acoustic signals to statistical values indicating part quality. Density measurements according to Archimedes' principle are used to label the layer-based acoustic data and to measure the quality. The data set is then treated as a classification problem while investigating the applicability of existing artificial neural network algorithms to match acoustic data with density measurements. Furthermore, this work investigates the transferability of the approach to more complex specimens.",

    "abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing (AM) technology is maturing. Although currently slower and less reliable than traditional production methods, AM systems shine when producing parts with unconventional topologies or in small quantities. Like countless other research communities, the electrical machine (EM) research community has shifted considerable efforts towards integrating AM systems into the EM production cycle to implement more powerful and efficient topology optimized (TO) next-generation EMs. In this paper, the state-of-the-art printing of soft magnetic, hard magnetic, and electrically conductive materials was investigated to evaluate the maturity of each material type for integration into EM construction. The highest maturity was identified for AM pure copper, showing characteristics equivalent to commercial high purity copper. In contrast, AM permanent magnets were the least mature: suffering from low power density and limited magnetization capacities. Printed soft magnetic steels were characterized as halfway in-between: on one side showing equivalent DC magnetic properties to conventional non-oriented steels, but on the other – suffering from high eddy current losses in AC applications. Based on the study's findings, it would appear that the emergence of additively manufactured EMs is only a matter of time. We predict a dramatic increase in the printing of prototype TO components within the next few years, focusing most likely on TO machine windings, heat exchangers, and synchronous rotors.",

    "abstract": "In metal additive manufacturing, crystallographic orientation control is a promising method for tailoring the functions of metallic parts. However, despite its importance in the fabrication of texture-controlled functional parts, the stability of the crystallographic texture is not widely discussed. Herein, the crystallographic texture stability under laser powder bed fusion was investigated. Two methodologies were employed. One is that a laser scanning strategy was alternately changed for a specific number of layers. The other is a \"seeding\" experiment in which single-crystalline substrates with controlled crystallographic orientations in the building (z-) direction and the xy-plane (perpendicular to the building direction) were used as the starting substrate. The transient zone width, where the crystallographic orientation was inherited from the layer beneath, was analyzed to evaluate the texture stability. The crystallographic direction of the seed within the xy-plane, rather than the building direction, determined the transient zone width, i.e., the texture stability. In particular, the texture in the newly deposited portion was stable when the laser scanning direction matched the <100> orientation in the underneath layer, otherwise the crystal orientation switched rapidly, such that the <100> orientation was parallel to the scanning direction. Interestingly, the crystallographic orientation along the building direction in the underneath layer hardly impacted the stability of the texture. Therefore, for the first time, it has been clarified that the <100> orientation in the scanning direction, rather than the building direction, was preferentially stabilized, whereas the orientation in the other directions secondary stabilized.",

However, the carbon fibre composites produced using current state-of-the-art AM approaches generally possess high porosity (18–25 %) compared to those produced by conventional manufacturing (1 %). An approach known as composite fibre additive manufacturing (CFAM) is presented, involving selectively printing a binder and polymer powder onto discontinuous carbon fibre sheets, which are then compressed, heated and post-processed to form net shape components. The results demonstrate a correlation between compaction pressure applied and porosity/fibre volume fraction within components. Composite components were produced containing porosity of 1.5 % and fibre volume content of 15 % with 97 MPa tensile strength and 8.9 GPa elastic modulus, presenting a new approach for production of discontinuous carbon fibre reinforced polymer parts with mechanical properties exceeding those of state-of-the-art AM.",

As with traditional solidification methods of material processing (e.g. casting and welding), microstructural properties are highly dependent on the solidification conditions involved. Additive manufacturing processes however, incorporate additional complexity such as remelting, and solid-state evolution caused by subsequent heat source passes and by holding the entire build at moderately high temperatures during a build. We present a three-dimensional model that simulates both solidification and solid-state evolution phenomena using stochastic Monte Carlo and Potts Monte Carlo methods. The model also incorporates a finite-difference based thermal conduction solver to create a fully integrated microstructural prediction tool. The three modeling methods and their coupling are described and demonstrated for a model study of laser powder-bed fusion of 300-series stainless steel. The investigation demonstrates a novel correlation between the mean number of remelting cycles experienced during a build, and the resulting columnar grain sizes.",

    "abstract": "The pervasive adoption of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) as an industrial manufacturing technique relies on the improvement of its repeatability, currently limited by the stochastic formation of flaws. Considering that large flaws can form randomly and despite the optimization of process parameters, an in-situ monitoring technique suitable for detecting deviations that originate these critical flaws is paramount. The redeposition of spatters on the build area has previously been identified as one of the factors responsible for the rise of internal flaws, but so far limited are the efforts towards their detection. This study aims to detect spatter redeposits via in-situ monitoring and to couple the detections to lack of fusion. For that, long-exposure near-infrared in-situ monitoring associated with image analysis is employed to determine the exact locations and quantify the incidence of spatter redeposits across three full builds performed at varying layer thicknesses. The existence and distribution of internal flaws is verified ex-situ by means of ultrasonic inspection and metallography. The formation of internal flaws is attributed to spatter redeposits after detailed characterization of size, particle and surface morphology of spatter and identification of particles with identical characteristics on the fracture surface in the adjacencies of lack of fusion. It is found that spatters preferentially redeposit on the adjacencies of the gas outlet, but that the affected portion of the build area and the prevalence of detections is heavily dependent on the powder layer thickness employed in the manufacturing process. The monitoring system setup preferentially acquires signal from spatters redeposited on print regions, making it particularly suitable for flaw detection.",

In this work, acoustic measurements recorded during laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) were used to detect the onset of keyhole pores induced by the lasing process. Post-build radiography was used to identify the locations of keyhole pores in the build. The pore locations were spatially and temporally registered with the recorded time-series of laser position and acoustic pressure to identify specific partitions of the acoustic signals which correspond to pore formation. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition, traditional Fourier decomposition, and statistical measures of the time-series and corresponding frequency spectra were used to extract feature vectors which correlate to keyhole pore formation. Sequential feature selection revealed that measures associated with the acoustic spectra were most useful for identifying pore formations in L-PBF. A subset of the most informative data features was used to train a support vector machine model to predict pore formation with up to 97% accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Both additively-manufactured and cast metals are known to exhibit stochastic mechanical properties at the macroscopic level. Using a robot-assisted mechanical testing system, more than 360 experiments are performed on flat specimens extracted from AlSi10Mg components that are either cast or made through laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), commonly known as selective laser melting (SLM). Aside from basic EBSD analysis of the respective microstructures, micro-computed tomography is performed revealing a significantly higher porosity and pore size for the cast material. The results from uniaxial tension experiments reveal a 10% higher yield strength (on average) and an about 20% higher ultimate tensile strength for the SLM made AlSi10Mg. The tracking of the specimen origin within the SLM component shows a clear location dependence of the observed hardening response on the build height. The shear and tension fracture experiments revealed a strong stress-state dependence and significantly higher fracture strains for the cast material as compared to its SLM-made counterpart. To facilitate the computer aided engineering of structures with additively-manufactured AlSiMg alloys, a build height dependent hardening model is proposed along with a probabilistic plasticity and fracture modeling framework.",

    "abstract": "Fully dense structures of high solids loaded polymer composites printed via material extrusion additive manufacturing are of interest across many applications, including biomedical scaffolds and energetic materials. It is common to observe defects such as interfilament voids in space-filling structures, particularly during material extrusion printing with high solids inks, which exit the nozzle in a circular structure and require applied forces to deform. An understanding of the impact of process parameters on the void volume and structure, which can ultimately affect material performance, is necessary. Here we examine the effects of four key process parameters, layer height, extrusion rate, print speed and nozzle diameter, on the filament geometry and interfilament void formation. The layer height, extrusion rate and print speed all impact the width of the printed lines, but the layer height plays the most significant role in the line aspect ratios and void formation in printed structures. We find that in material extrusion of high solids loaded inks there is a critical layer height; below the critical height, the ink will spread to fill in gaps between filaments, and above it the filament will maintain a rounded shape and lead to formation of interfilament voids. The results illuminate a pathway to control porosity of fully dense structures with high solids loaded inks using the layer height parameter while maintaining geometric accuracy in the printed design.",

    "abstract": "3D printing (3DP), or additive manufacturing, has been actively investigated as one of the enabling technologies for the impending era of personalized medicines. However, existing 3DP technologies do not afford the speeds required for on-demand production of medicines in fast-paced clinical settings. Volumetric printing is a novel 3DP technology that offers rapid printing speed and overcomes the geometric and surface quality limitations of layer-based vat photopolymerization techniques. Unlike previous vat photopolymerization 3DP technologies, volumetric printing cures the entire desired 3D geometry simultaneously by exploiting the threshold behavior in the photopolymerization process that arise due to oxygen-induced polymerization inhibition. In this work, for the first time, a volumetric printer was used to fabricate drug-loaded 3D printed tablets (Printlets™) within seconds. Six resin formulations were evaluated using this printer, each composed of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) as the crosslinking monomer, lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) as the photoinitiator, and paracetamol as the model drug. Water or PEG300 were included as diluents in varying concentrations to facilitate drug release. Paracetamol-loaded Printlets were successfully fabricated within 17 s. Drug release rates could be tuned by altering the monomer-to-diluent ratio of the photosensitive resin, with a lower ratio releasing drug faster. The present work confirms the suitability of volumetric 3DP for printing drug products in a matter of seconds. Upon further optimization, this novel technology can enable rapid, on-demand fabrication of medicines and medical devices.",

The application of blended powders in L-PBF enables to tailor the microstructures and obtain a mixture of α' + β phases. In this work, we demonstrate an effective method to engineer the phase fraction of an L-PBF manufactured Ti alloy using blended powders consisting of Ti-6Al-4V and 3 wt% Fe particles. By varying laser parameters, the as-built microstructures transit from α' dominated microstructure to a nearly complete β-dominant microstructure. High-speed operando X-ray diffraction during L-PBF processing combined with X-ray fluorescence and EBSD characterization allows for relating microstructure to the spatial distribution of the β-stabilizer Fe under the high cooling rates typical for L-PBF. The as-built microstructure containing large amounts of β phase achieves high strength and enhanced ductility without post-processing heat treatments.",

    "abstract": "To meet the urgent demand of large-scale parts fabrication in aerospace and energy fields, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing is developing towards multi-laser powder bed fusion (ML-PBF). However, defects such as the surface quality degradation and lack of fusion are more prone to appear at the overlap region of the deposit printed by multiple laser beams, which is detrimental to the consistency and uniformity of parts formed using ML-PBF. Here, based on a high-speed, high-resolution imaging technology and our ML-PBF equipment, the dual-beam laser-matter interaction at the overlap region in ML-PBF was investigated. At the overlap region, the collision and interaction between two molten pools influences the flow pattern of the liquid metal, accompanied by the large-sized droplet spatter expelling out. Moreover, the collision and accumulation of the liquid metal and spatter are responsible for the formation of the surface and internal structure defects of overlap samples. Furthermore, we reveal multiple transitions of the dominant mechanisms of the spatter formation in ML-PBF, which can be interchanged from the vapor-induced recoil pressure dominant stage to the vapor-induced entrainment dominant stage. We also propose the growth rate of spatter number rs, which can be well correlated with the transient transition of spatter formation mechanism. This work is expected to provide the scientific basis for ML-PBF to achieve consistency and uniformity.",

    "abstract": "Lattice structures are an important aspect of design for additive manufacturing (DfAM). They enable significant component light-weighting and the tailoring of a wide range of physical responses; mechanical, thermal, acoustic, etc. In turn, lattice design relies on fundamental research to uncover useful structure-property relationships, such as the influence of cell geometry and volume fraction. A number of commercial computer-aided-design (CAD) programs exist that offer lattice generation, but these tend to prioritise product design. This paper describes the FLatt Pack program (or Functional Lattice Package), which was created to address the paucity of research-focussed lattice design software. It possesses a number of features with this in mind, including; (i) it is free to use for research, (ii) it is standalone software with minimal, and also free, dependencies, and (iii) it undergoes frequent and rapid development based on state of the art lattice information and modelling methods. FLatt Pack includes twenty-three lattice cell types covering a broad range of pore connectivity, structural anisotropy, and surface area; a clear GUI presenting the lattice design stages in a sequential manner; and the option to export designs in appropriate formats for AM and finite element (FE) simulation. The program also features conformal lattice generation in arbitrary shapes, arbitrary volume fraction grading, and resource-efficient computation through an adaptive spatial resolution based on the user's design choices. The most recent version of FLatt Pack is freely available at: www.github.com/ian27ax/FLatt_Pack_dist.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) has changed the entire manufacturing enterprise by offering unique features for the fabrication of complex-shapes with superior mechanical properties. In the last decades, through an exponential advancement, AM has been promoted from a prototyping to a series and mass production platform. Like all conventional techniques, quality assurance procedures/tools are of the utmost importance in aiding manufacturers in quality management and certification. For this purpose, in-line melt pool monitoring devices, installed in laser-based AM systems, provide vital real-time information about process characteristics, implicitly or explicitly leading toward understanding the quality of printed parts. This research aims to develop a defect-detection platform using in-situ monitoring of light intensity emitted from the melt pool of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) to detect pores initiated from the lack of fusion phenomenon. This platform is driven by correlating disturbances in the light intensity emitted from the melt pool to actual pores identified through a post-processing micro-computed tomography (CT) scanning. Two sets of experiments were devised: one with embedded micro-voids to purposefully mimic the lack of fusion in printed parts composed on Hastelloy X to assess the sensor response and develop the analysis algorithm. The second set was included printed parts with stochastic/randomized distributions of pores to evaluate the proposed approach. The recorded data were extracted from an Absolute Limits algorithm and were analyzed offline through image processing. Next, the printed samples were CT scanned, and the data from both steps were analyzed by the segmentation method and confusion matrix to examine the correlation. The results of the intentionally seeded defects demonstrated that voids larger than 120 µm were detectable through the collected photo-diodes signals. The evaluation matrices to validate stochastic/randomized distributions of pores also showed that for two sets of process parameters with a high laser power of 200 W, hatching distance of 150 and 90 µm, and process speed of 1000 and 1500 mm/s, the sensor prediction from randomized defects is about 70.14 ± 2.24% and 72.82 ± 1.39%, respectively. However, for the low laser power cases with laser power of 100 W, hatching distance of 90 µm, and process speed of 1000 mm/s, the correlation was less than 30%.",

    "abstract": "Harnessing the full potential of the metal-based Laser Powder Bed Fusion process (LPBF) relies heavily on how effectively the overall reliability and stability of the manufactured part can be ensured. To this aim, the recent advances in sensorization and processing of the associated signals using Machine Learning (ML) techniques have made in situ monitoring a viable alternative to post-mortem techniques such as X-ray tomography or ultrasounds for the assessment of parts. Indeed, the primary advantage of in situ monitoring over post-mortem analysis is that the process can be stopped in case of discrepancies, saving resources. Additionally, mitigations to repair the discrepancies can also be performed. However, the in situ monitoring strategies based on classifying processing regimes reported in the literature so far operate on signals of fixed length in time, constraining the generalization of the trained ML model by not allowing monitoring processes with heterogeneous laser scanning strategies. As a part of this work, we try to bridge this gap by developing a hybrid Deep Learning (DL) model by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) that can operate over variable time-scales. The proposed hybrid DL model was trained on signals obtained from a heterogeneous time-synced sensing system consisting of four sensors, namely back reflection (BR), Visible, Infra-Red (IR), and structure-borne Acoustic Emission (AE). The signals captured different phenomena related to the LPBF process zone and were used to classify three regimes: Lack of Fusion (LoF), conduction mode and Keyhole. Specifically, these three regimes were induced by printing cubes out of austenitic Stainless steel (316 L) on a mini-LPBF device with operando high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging and signal acquisition with the developed heterogeneous sensing system. The operando X-ray imaging analysis ensured that the regimes correlated with the defined process parameters. During the validation procedure of the trained hybrid DL model, the model predicted three regimes with an accuracy of about 98% across various time scales, ranging from 0.5 ms to 4 ms. In addition to tracking the model performance, a sensitivity analysis of the trained hybrid model was conducted, which showed that the BR and AE sensors carried more relevant information to guide the decision-making process than the other two sensors used in this work.",

    "abstract": "Metal parts produced by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) are frequently used for demanding applications. To meet stringent safety and certification requirements, a better understanding of melt-pool behavior and stability during processing is desired. This work presents a novel, fast and economically feasible virtual sensing approach for accurate estimation of melt-pool depth and width during L-PBF of metals. In a first step, the melt-pool width is determined by GPU-based processing of images from a high-speed coaxial camera monitoring system. In a second step, a physics-based analytical model is used to calculate the melt-pool depth-to-width ratio from the processing conditions and material properties. In a third and last step, the results from the first two steps are combined to estimate the melt-pool depth. Experimental validation of these predicted melt-pool dimensions is performed on 316L SS single layer strips that are consecutively produced, cross-sectioned, polished and etched to reveal the actual melt-pool boundaries. The results indicate an average relative error on the predicted melt-pool depth of 9.9% and 2.8% for the full L-PBF parameter range and for the optimal parameter range respectively. This gives confidence in the predictive capabilities of a virtual sensing approach using coaxial camera images for the assessment of the melt-pool depth and process stability.",

    "abstract": "Down-facing surfaces are one of the most challenging features in metal parts produced by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). A combination of reasons, primary of which are residual stresses and overheating cause these features to have the worst surface finish and dimensional accuracy of all LPBF surfaces. In order to examine this phenomenon, a Design of Experiments (DoE) study is conducted for three different inclination angles, namely 45°, 35° and 25° and for two different layer thicknesses of 60 µm and 90 µm. The results from the DoE are used to establish quadratic regression equations that can be used to predict the quality marks of surface roughness and the relative dimensional error.This fundamental investigation helps to explain the reasons for the major defects in down-facing surfaces of parts produced with Ti-6AL-4 V material, namely the dross formation and attempts to improve the predictability of quality within the region. Further to the establishment of the quadratic equations, a discussion is conducted on the thermomechanical processes involved in the mechanism of dross formation and explanations are given on the reasons behind the observed physical phenomena. The trend of the propagation of (Root Mean Square) RMS Surface roughness (Sq) and the relative dimensional error with respect to the Volumetric Energy Density (VED) is discussed in detail. The respective quadratic equations are then tested by a second round of validation prints, and the results confirm the feasibility of the developed quadratic models to accurately predict process outcomes especially when operating near the suggested optimal printing zones. The high roughness of low VED printing is attributed to the formation of 'inverse mushroom' structures, and the low roughness of high VED surface is attributed to the formation of large flat regions formed as adjacent meltpools that can fuse together at various locations.",

    "abstract": "The post-yield mechanical behavior of additively manufactured lattice structures (AMLS) is governed by the interplay between intrinsic (microstructural) and extrinsic (structural topology) properties at different length scales. Herein, we introduce a novel design optimization approach that accounts for scale separation and size effects, which control deformation mechanisms, to achieve a certain targeted macroscopic mechanical response. The new topological designs are guided by finding a direct correlation between the distribution of local stresses within struts and the underlying microstructures. The local stresses are computed using a strut-level yield criterion that has been calibrated to strut-level tensile, compressive, and shear loading experiments. Therefore, the local response of the struts, including tension-compression asymmetry, build direction dependence, and size effects, are accounted for in the yield surface, enabling a more accurate representation of the local stress state. Accurate calculation of the stress state for a given microstructure and topology combination allows for optimizing the topology for the given strut-level microstructure. The interplay between the topology and microstructure is assessed by investigating the unit cell-level deformation mechanisms and quantifying their influence on the global stress-strain relationship via finite element simulations. Using these relationships, a new set of topologies is designed, built, and validated with experiments. On average, the new topologies demonstrate 40% and 72% improvement in energy absorption capacity and flow stress, respectively, compared to topologies that had been previously optimized using constitutive models, which are homogeneous throughout the unit cell. The goal of the presented article is to demonstrate that simultaneously considering the effects of topology and microstructure on the mechanical behavior of AMLS has the potential to substantially improve key performance metrics, including ultimate strength and energy dissipation. The distinguishing and novel feature of our approach is that the topological optimization is performed while accounting for the heterogeneous distribution of strut-level microstructural features and concomitant mechanical behavior, which leads to new insights relative to peak AMLS structural performance.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a data-informed toolpath-based design approach for 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) for the fabrication of architectural horizontal structures in one continuous printing process. 3DCP has inherent ad- vantages resulting from shaping concrete without formwork and from placing material only where functionally required. However, to date, only a few examples and applications of efficient design solutions through 3DCP exist at the construction scale. Building on the advantages of the technique, the presented work introduces a novel approach for reducing the amount of material employed in structural beams through a high-resolution stress- based optimisation of their material layout in the longitudinal section. The paper presents an innovative workflow for the design and fabrication of 3DCP structures which provides design flexibility by implementing a set of geometric optimisation routines tailored to the concrete extrusion process, and which integrates Finite Element (FE) analysis at multiple stages of the development, for the definition of the printing path, the optimisation of the layer design through speed variation, and the informed placement of the reinforcement bars. The workflow was verified through the design, fabrication and testing of three beam designs which progressively integrates the developed methods. The strength-to-weight ratio of the three designs shows the impact of the proposed workflow, which increases the performance to almost three times between a full beam and the lightest tested beam. The potential for material saving through a design workflow tailored for 3DCP opens to more carbon-efficient and environmental production processes and structures.",

    "abstract": "Detrimental subsurface tensile residual stresses occur in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) due to significant temperature gradients during the process.Besides heat treatments, laser shock peening (LSP) is a promising technology for tailoring residual stress profiles of additively manufactured components.A multi step process simulation is applied aiming at predicting the residual stress state after applying LSP to a cuboid shaped specimen manufactured by LPBF in two different building directions as well as comparing it with a postbuild heat treatment.The validity of the numerical simulation is evaluated based on comparisons of residual stresses determined by incremental hole drilling technique within different stages of the multi step process: in the as-build condition, after subsequent heat treatment as well as after applying LSP to the as-build and heat treated specimens, showing overall a good experimental-numerical agreement throughout each of the process stages.Applying a heat treatment to the as-build LPBF sample at 700 • C for 6 h showed not to be effective in eliminating the surface tensile stress entirely, reducing the tensile residual stresses by 40%.However, the application of LSP on LPBF components showed promising results: LSP was able even to convert the detrimental near surface tensile residual stresses in the LPBF component into compressive residual stresses next to the surface, which is known to be beneficial for the fatigue performance.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, adoption of different Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes has gained momentum in the manufacturing industry. One such emerging AM process is wire-based directed energy deposition. Environmental impacts and costs are important criteria for adoption of any manufacturing process. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the environmental and economic performance of Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) using Life Cycle assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) methodologies. In this paper, an integrated methodology to conduct a cradle-to-gate LCA based on the guidelines of ISO 14044 and LCC based on IEC 60300–3–3 standards is proposed. A case study of a single steel wall manufactured by WAAM was analysed. The environmental impacts and production costs for wire-based directed energy deposition process were compared to laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and Computer Numeric Control (CNC) milling processes. For the steel wall analysed, CNC milling was the most economical and ecological option followed by the wire-based directed energy deposition and LPBF. However, the performance of a process depends on product complexity and the manufacturing process's material efficiency. Raw material production and labour were identified as major environmental hotspot and cost driver, respectively, in wire-based directed energy deposition. The methodology used in this paper can be extended to other manufacturing processes. The results of this study can help manufacturers in selecting manufacturing processes based on environmental impacts and production costs",

However, poor control of defect formation during processing hampers its widespread industrial adoption. Many materials suffer from a high crack susceptibility during L-PBF, which results in degraded mechanical properties, and is an obstacle to the certification of critical parts. In order to unveil the mechanisms of crack formation in a prone-to-cracking nickel-based superalloy, we employ high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging in combination with a miniaturized L-PBF set-up that reproduces real processing conditions. This unique set-up provides operando imaging of crack formation during L-PBF. Complementary post-mortem inspection of crack morphology and thermal simulations supported by operando X-ray diffraction-based measurements of the temperature evolution allow to identify the cracking mechanism and to differentiate solidification cracking from liquation.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing has enabled the fabrication of lattice structures with controlled micro-architectures and mechanical properties. These structures are particularly attractive in the orthopaedic industry where their osseointegration capability and bone-matching mechanical properties are ideally suited for use in implants and bone scaffolds. The broad range of mechanical properties required for this application is a challenge – it typically requires a range of periodic lattice structures, each of which require separate characterisation. An alternative approach is to use a stochastic lattice structure, where a single relationship between the lattice design parameters (connectivity, strut density and strut thickness) and resulting mechanical properties should be possible. To investigate this, we manufactured stochastic lattices in pure Titanium with connectivity from 4 to 14, strut density from 3 to 7 [struts/mm3] and strut thickness of 230 and 300 µm. Specimens were compression tested in quasi-static and fatigue loading. In static loading, the low connectivity structures displayed bend-dominated deformation while the high connectivity structures displayed stretch-dominated deformation. The structures had a stiffness ranging from 0.1 to 8 GPa and different Gibson-Ashby stiffness/relative density relationships were required for high and low connectivity structures. A unified multivariable linear regression model was found to predict relative density from the connectivity, strut density and strut thickness of the structure. In fatigue loading, increasing the connectivity from 4 to 14 increased the fatigue strength by 60% for a fixed relative density. These findings provide important design information when creating structures using stochastic lattices to maximise strength for a desired relative density or stiffness. The single integrated model presented in this study can define a structure to achieve a broad range of design requirements, even as gradient within the same component. To achieve the same with periodic lattices would require different unit cell, with individual regression models for each unit cell used.",

    "abstract": "Defect-free three-dimensional (3D)-printed ceramics, such as alumina, zirconia, and titania, have been successfully fabricated by controlling the initial defect formation using a non-reactive diluent, namely, polypropylene glycol (PPG), as an additive in the photocurable resin. By crosslinking with uncured monomers in 3D-printed ceramic green bodies, PPG prevented them from evaporating early, which often results in defect formation at low temperatures (<325 °C). PPG also decomposed before the main resin components, thereby forming interconnected pores, which consequently enabled gases from resin decomposition to escape throughout the green body. The effects of PPG addition on defect formation were systematically studied during the debinding process of an alumina slurry. In addition, defect formation was analyzed through thermogravimetric analysis, computed tomography 3D scanning, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. When the 3D-printed, crack-free alumina was sintered at 1650 °C, a 99.2% relative density was achieved. PPG was also applied to zirconia and titania to verify the versatility of PPG in various types of ceramic stereolithography-printed materials. The results suggested that PPG has excellent potential for fabricating various complex and large-volume ceramics without defects through stereolithography.",

    "abstract": "Warp deformation is a common error encountered in additive manufacturing. It is typically caused by residual internal stresses in the manufactured part that arise as material cools. These errors are challenging to prevent or correct as they build over time and thus are only visible long after the actions that caused them. As a result, existing work in extrusion additive manufacturing has attempted warp detection but not correction or prevention. We report a hybrid approach combining deep learning, computer vision, and expert heuristics to correct or prevent warp. We train a deep convolutional neural network using diverse labelled images to recognise warp in real-time. We compute five metrics from detection candidates to predict the severity of warp deformation and proportionately update print settings. This enables the first demonstration of automated warp detection and correction both during printing and for future prints.",

    "abstract": "This research aims to study the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) processability, the microstructure and the tensile mechanical properties of an AlFeCr alloy at a wide range of temperatures. With this goal, Al-5Fe-6Cr (wt%) pre-alloyed powder was produced by casting and gas atomization. The microstructure of the as-atomized powders and the as-built specimens was characterized via scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Following a parameter optimization study, dense as-built specimens with a high relative density of 99.8% and a Vickers hardness at room temperature of 192 HV were fabricated. In addition, the newly developed AlFeCr alloy exhibits yield strength values of 273 ± 5 MPa and 179 ± 3 MPa at 300ºC and 400ºC, respectively. The exceptional strength of this alloy at high temperature is attributed to the homogeneous precipitation during processing of large density of nanoscale icosahedral (i-phase) and intermetallic phases, which are endowed with high thermal stability. These values are significantly higher than those corresponding to the conventional wrought Al7075 aluminum alloy in the T6 condition and to all Al alloys manufactured by L-PBF to date. The current research sheds guidelines for the design of high strength aluminum alloys containing transition alloying elements that are suitable to be processed by L-PBF for high temperature structural applications in a cost effective way.",

We detail the design and build of the motion system, print head (including heaters, extrusion system and high voltage power supply) and safety systems, and explain how these are integrated via a central control unit to provide pre-programmed dynamic control over printing variables allowing the fabrication of a range of advanced material designs with applications in the fields of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and beyond. We discuss the various approaches which may be used for each system within a custom MEW printer, providing an insight into how it may be designed depending on the specific requirements of the end user. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of this printer by producing tissue engineering scaffolds with various architectures. This work aims to make MEW technology more accessible by both informing others interested in developing similar custom devices, and additionally, by providing an insight into the inner workings of MEW technology for practitioners in the field.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is the evaluation of powder injection molding (PIM) binder compositions for the material extrusion (MEX) additive manufacturing of zirconia parts. Four commercial PIM binder compositions were selected and mixed with 45 vol% of yttria-stabilized zirconia powder. Due to the brittle characteristic of the obtained ceramic feedstocks, a screw based pellet printing head was used for printing dense zirconia structures. To compare 3D printing performance, additionally a commercially available zirconia filament was used in this study. Application of PIM binder compositions was limited either due to phase separation during processing, poor printing performance or delamination during solvent debinding. Only one of the PIM based feedstock compositions could be successfully printed, debound and sintered. A ring-on-ring setup was used to investigate the equibiaxial flexural strength after sintering for both pellet and filament printed disks. For benchmarking, cold isostatic pressed (CIP) ceramic discs were fabricated by commercial, ready-to-press, zirconia powder. The ring-on-ring results showed a low Weibull modulus (3 <m<5) for all samples, regardless of the manufacturing process. Fractography on selected samples demonstrated, that the origins of failures are close to the area of the loading ring which indicates an uneven stress distribution along the contact area between the setup and the sample. The pointwise stress concentration is the reason for the immature failure of the samples and the low Weibull modulus. The characteristic strength and 90% confidence intervals were used to compare the strength of ceramic samples produced via additive manufacturing and CIP. Almost similar mechanical properties were obtained for the CIP pressed (σ0 = 657 MPa) and filament printed (σ0 = 531 MPa) samples. However, a lower strength was obtained by the pellet printed samples based on commercial PIM Binder (σ0 = 203 MPa). Fractography analysis indicated poor fusion of printed layers for the samples produced with PIM binder composition as the main reason for poor mechanical performance.",

    "abstract": "An advantage of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of metals is that one can create topologically complex components with comparative ease. Most LPBF studies use commercial pre-alloyed powders and less attention has been given to new alloy design for LPBF. Physical mixing of powders with different chemistries can be an effective way to access new alloy compositions for LPBF without the need for custom pre-alloyed powders. In this work, a previously published model to describe the chemical distribution of LPBF material from mixed powders is extended to the process of remelting and is quantitatively compared with experiment. A mix of Ni and stainless steel powders is used to assess the effect of remelting on the chemical homogeneity and the model is shown to agree well with experiment once evaporation of selected species and changes in melt pool size during remelting are incorporated. Strategies to improve the chemical homogeneity of prints from mixed powders are discussed. Remelting is one approach but the chemical homogeneity improves only marginally after three remelts. The critical role of the melt pool size compared to the minority powder particle spacing is emphasised. Finally, an example of using spatially controlled chemical homogeneity to create architectured materials using LPBF is shown.",

    "abstract": "Optimization of the formulation and processability of 3D-printable ceramic polymer composites offers a solution to piezoelectric materials with high printability and piezoelectric responses. Our approach is based on both 3D-printable piezoelectric composite formulation and auxetic structural design. The optimal formulation exhibited strong interfacial adhesion, high dispersion stability, low viscosity, and a smooth surface, resulting in a high piezoelectricity. In addition, processing parameters, such as the intensity and application time of the UV laser, were optimized for processability. The simulated structures were designed to further enhance the piezoelectric response, and several auxetic structures were compared. A printed piezoelectric composite with an auxetic structure, including a functionalized piezoelectric ceramic powder and a dispersant, showed good flexibility, a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33), and an increased piezoelectric voltage output that was approximately three times larger than that of a typical flat structure. The proposed sensor based on the 3D-printed piezoelectric composite with the auxetic structure exhibited a high open-circuit voltage and can be used as a high-performance tactile position sensor. This work demonstrates that a 3D-printed piezoelectric composite can realize flexible and complicated structures with a high piezoelectric response and printability to enable flexible self-powered electronics and sensors.",

    "abstract": "Failure under cyclic loading in the presence of manufacturing defects is a substantial risk for additively manufactured (AM) metal components. This study aims to clarify the correlation between process-related defects (internal pores and surface roughness) and fatigue performance of AM 316 L stainless steel. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) has been employed to characterize process-related defects' features and their synergistic interaction to define the effective defect size parameter areaeff, leading to identifying potential sites for fatigue crack initiation before testing. Then, the defects' growth is monitored using XCT imaging under cyclic loading to provide further insight into the fatigue damage process of AM stainless steels. A novel characterization framework is developed for monitoring the fatigue crack initiation and propagation based on measuring the variation in specimen surface topography in the axial and circumferential directions. Moreover, a fracture-mechanics based analytical framework is developed for the fatigue life prediction of AM components while the progression of the aspect ratio of semi-elliptical surface crack during its growth is considered. It is found that a significant fraction of the fatigue life is consumed for crack initiation and the damage progression dominantly occurs at the predicted maximum equivalent defect size, which is detected before fatigue testing. Therefore, the critical equivalent defect size can be considered as an initial short crack in the critical defect-based fatigue crack growth model for AM components. The proposed single crack growth model, by applying an appropriate characterization approach to detect the initial semi-elliptic surface short crack based on defects' features and their interaction, demonstrates promise to be suited as an engineering approach for fatigue life prediction of AM components. This model shows a good correlation between XCT imaging and the predicted crack initiation and propagation phases for the tested AM 316 L stainless steel samples.",

    "abstract": "Hollow-strut metal lattices are an emerging class of cellular metallic materials. However, their mechanical properties at relative densities (ρRD) higher than 10% are largely unknown because conventional manufacturing methods are ill-equipped to fabricate them. In this study, face-centered cubic (FCC) and FCC with Z-struts (FCCZ) Ti‐6Al‐4V hollow-strut lattices with ρRD = 8–16% were fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM). Both lattice topologies exhibited yield strength (σ*) and elastic modulus (E*) at the upper empirical limits for solid-strut metal lattices with similar ρRD values. Furthermore, the difference in σ* or E* between hollow-strut FCC and FCCZ lattices is much smaller than that between solid-strut FCC and FCCZ lattices. The deformation behaviours and failure modes of the LPBF-manufactured Ti‐6Al‐4V hollow-strut FCC and FCCZ lattices were investigated by uniaxial compression and finite element modelling (FEM). In addition to the lattice topology, the fine (∼20 µm) prior-β grains in the Ti‐6Al‐4V hollow-strut thin walls contribute positively to the superior mechanical properties, compared with the coarse grains in Ti‐6Al‐4V solid-strut lattices. Finally, the manufacturability established in this work provides a reliable pathway for LPBF-AM of Ti‐6Al‐4V hollow-strut lattices. The findings of this work are expected to apply to other hollow-strut lattice topologies.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an experimental method to image melt pool temperature with a single commercial color camera and compare the results with multi-physics computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models. This approach leverages the principle of two-color (i.e., ratiometric) thermal imaging, which is advantageous because it negates the need for a priori knowledge of melt pool emissivity, plume transmissivity, and the camera's view factor. The color camera's ability to accurately measure temperature was validated with a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) blackbody source and tungsten filament lamp between temperatures of 1600 K and 2800 K. To demonstrate the technique, an off-axis high-speed color camera operating at 22,500 frames per second capturing a 2.8 mm × 2.8 mm area on the build plate was used to image both no-powder and powder single beads on a commercial laser powder bed fusion machine. Melt pool temperature fields for 316L stainless steel at varying processing conditions show peaks between 3300 K and 3700 K depending on the laser power and increased variability in the presence of powder. Measurements of nickel superalloy 718 and Ti-6Al-4V show comparable temperatures, with increased plume obstruction, especially in Ti-6Al-4V due to vaporization of aluminum. Multi-physics CFD models are used to simulate metal melt pools but some parameters such as the accommodation and Fresnel coefficients are not well characterized. Fitting a FLOW-3D® CFD model to ex-situ measurements of the melt pool cross-sectional geometry for 316L stainless steel identifies multiple combinations of Fresnel coefficient and accommodation coefficient that lead to geometric agreement. Only two of these combinations show agreement with the thermal images, motivating the need for thermal imaging as a means to advance validation of complex physics models. Our methodology can be applied to any color camera to better monitor and understand melt pools that yield high-quality parts.",

    "abstract": "Wire-arc directed energy deposition (DED) is suitable for depositing large-scale metallic components at high deposition rates. In order to further increase productivity and efficiency by reducing overall manufacturing time, higher deposition rates are desired. However, the conventional gas metal arc (GMA) based wire-arc DED, characterised by high energy input, normally results in high remelting and reheating at relatively high deposition rates, reducing the process efficiency and deteriorating the mechanical performance. In this study, a novel wire-arc DED process with the combination of a GMA and an external cold wire, namely cold wire-gas metal arc (CW-GMA), was proposed for achieving high deposition rate and low material remelting. The maximum deposition rates at different levels of energy input were investigated, with the highest deposition rate of 14 kg/h being achieved. An industrial-scale component weighing 280 kg was built with this process at a high deposition rate of around 10 kg/h, which demonstrated the capability of the process for high productivity application. It was also found that, due to the addition of the cold wire, the remelting was reduced significantly. The working envelope and geometric process model for the CW-GMA process was developed, which can be used to avoid defects in parameter selection and predict the geometry of single-pass wall structures. Moreover, the addition of the cold wire in the CW-GMA process reduced the specific energy density, leading to a reduction in both grain size and anisotropy, which improved the mechanical properties with increased strength and reduced anisotropy.",

This paper provides a comprehensive review on structural design, manufacturing techniques and unique properties that are crucial for sophisticated development of novel metamaterials.

The near-eutectic (liquid → α-Al(fcc) + Al6M) composition of Al–2.5Fe–2Mn (mass%) was designed to avoid the formation of coarse primary intermetallics (having a detrimental effect on the PBF processability for densification) based on non-equilibrium liquidus projection thermodynamic calculations. The designed Al–2.5Fe–2Mn alloy powder exhibited sufficient L-PBF processability, and fully dense centimeter-sized samples (relative densities of above 99%) were successfully prepared. The L-PBF Al–2.5Fe–2Mn alloy samples exhibited a significantly refined solidification microstructure consisting of Al6M and α-Al phases in the melt-pool regions. Fe and Mn alloying elements contributed to the formation of nanoscale Al6M-phase particles and a high solid solution concentration in the α-Al matrix. The strength of the L-PBF Al–2.5Fe–2Mn alloy was slightly reduced at higher temperatures, but remained above 240 MPa at an elevated temperature of 300 °C. This superior high-temperature mechanical performance was attributed to the high thermal stability of the refined α-Al/Al6M two-phase microstructure and the formation of nanosized Al6M-phase precipitates.",

    "abstract": "Prototyping three-dimensional (3D) printed electronics via material extrusion (MEX) has become popular in recent years with the increased availability of commercial conductive filaments. However, the current planar 3D printing method of layer upon layer construction shows clear challenges in extruding conductive traces for inclining surfaces. This inherent limitation of planar 3D printing restricts the design freedom of 3D printed electrically conductive objects with conductive filaments based on Polylactic Acid (PLA). To overcome this limitation of planar 3D printing, this paper describes a novel method of employing a multi-material 5-axis 3D printer to extrude conductive PLA in curved layers. The paper characterises changes in the resistivity of printed traces for angles of incline and curvatures using two commercial conductive PLA filaments. Conductive traces were printed via a custom-built desktop 5-axis 3D printer and a conventional multi-material MEX 3D printer. We found that 3D printing following a conformal approach can reduce the resistivity of the vertical conductive trace by more than 9 times. The paper concludes by successfully fabricating complex conductive patterns onto free-form doubly curved substrates.",

    "abstract": "To implement a circular economic life for thermoplastic waste, such as polylactic acid (PLA) waste from filament-based material extrusion (FME) printing and reduce the costs associated with producing filaments for the FME process, a granule-based material extrusion (GME) printer was developed by modifying a filament-based extrusion head with a granule-based extrusion head. However, concerns have been raised about the mechanical performance of parts printed using the GME method. Previous studies have reported mixed results, with some finding inferior mechanical performance of GME printed parts compared to FME counterparts, while others reported comparable or slightly better performance. Moreover, these studies were limited to tensile or flexural performance evaluations, lacked a clear explanation to support them. Therefore, to address this uncertainty and research gaps, a comprehensive mechanical performance comparison and analysis study was conducted among the specimens printed by these two types of material extrusion printers. Characterization tests were conducted, including tensile tests, impact tests, 3-point bending tests, and hardness tests, to reveal the comprehensive mechanical properties of the printed parts. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests, thermal imaging, rheological tests, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) tests were carried out to analyze and explain the results. The results indicated no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the mechanical properties of FME and GME printed parts in terms of tensile properties, flexural strength and modulus, and impact strength. However, there was a significant difference in shore D hardness and bending strain at break between the two methods, and the complex viscosity of GME printed samples was greater than that of FME counterparts. Remarkably, the average molecular weights of GME printed samples were higher than those of FME ones, which can be attributed to lower actual temperature of the GME extrusion chamber due to its different location among the heater, thermistor and melting chamber compared to the FME extrusion head.",

    "abstract": "Although additive manufacturing has offered substantially new opportunities and flexibility for fabricating 3D complex lattice structures, effective design of such sophisticated structures with desired multifunctional characteristics remains a demanding task. To tackle this challenge, we develop an inventive multiscale topology optimisation approach for additively manufactured lattices by leveraging a derivative-aware machine learning algorithm. Our objective is to optimise non-uniform unit cells for achieving an as uniform strain pattern as possible. The proposed approach exhibits great potential for biomedical applications, such as implantable devices mitigating strain and stress shielding. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we present two illustrative examples through the dedicated digital image correlation (DIC) tests on the optimised samples fabricated using a powder bed fusion (PBF) technique. Furthermore, we demonstrate a practical application of our approach through developing bone tissue scaffolds composed of optimised non-uniform iso-truss lattices for two typical musculoskeletal reconstruction cases. These optimised lattice-based scaffolds present a more uniform strain field in complex anatomical and physiological condition, thereby creating a favourable biomechanical environment for maximising bone formation effectively. The proposed approach is anticipated to make a significant step forward in design for additively manufactured multiscale lattice structures with desirable mechanical characteristics for a broad range of applications.",

The present paper describes a vat-photopolymerization technique using a high-resolution liquid crystal display (LCD), as a dynamic mask-generator, to manufacture TPMS constructs with porosities above 90%, pore sizes below 200 µm, and a minimum wall thickness of 38 µm. We systematically investigate the effects and mechanisms of processing variables, including refractive index and particle size distribution of powders on the cure depth of photosensitive slurries and dimensional accuracy prints made from hydroxyapatite and baghdadite (Ca6Zr2(Si2O7)2O4). Our results demonstrate that the difference between the refractive index of solid particles and the photosensitive resin is a critical factor in dictating print quality and dimensional accuracy. Additionally, we showed that irrespective of the bioceramic composition, reducing the particle size from 9.0 μm (d50) to 0.5 μm (d50), enhances the quality of the surface finish, while decreasing the smallest feature size that can be achieved. This study presents the LCD technique as a robust and effective alternative to conventional stereolithography techniques (i.e, digital light processing and scanning stereolithography) for 3D fabrication of bioceramic scaffolds and a manufacturing technique for the implementation of advanced topological optimizations of bone scaffolds and production of patient-specific implants.",

    "abstract": "Surface roughness controls the mechanical performance and durability (e.g., wear and corrosion resistance) of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) components. The evolution mechanisms of surface roughness during LPBF are not well understood due to a lack of in situ characterisation methods. Here, we quantified key processes and defect dynamics using synchrotron X-ray imaging and ex situ optical imaging and explained the evolution mechanisms of side-skin and top-skin roughness during multi-layer LPBF of Ti-6AI-4V (where down-skin roughness was out of the project scope). We found that the average surface roughness alone is not an accurate representation of surface topology of an LPBF component and that the surface topology is multimodal (e.g., containing both roughness and waviness) and multiscale (e.g., from 25 µm sintered powder features to 250 µm molten pool wavelength). Both roughness and topology are significantly affected by the formation of pre-layer humping, spatter, and rippling defects. We developed a surface topology matrix that accurately describes surface features by combining 8 different metrics: average roughness, root mean square roughness, maximum profile peak height, maximum profile valley height, mean height, mean width, skewness, and melt pool size ratio. This matrix provides a guide to determine the appropriate linear energy density to achieve the optimum surface finish of Ti-6AI-4V thin-wall builds. This work lays a foundation for surface texture control which is critical for build design, metrology, and performance in LPBF.",

However, increasingly complex morphologies raise the question of their integrity. Structural optimization can be a powerful design tool, but preserving biomimetic TPMS mesostructure remains a challenge, as conventional shape optimization techniques are limited to strut-based cell designs. Therefore, the present study focuses on shape optimization of promising TPMS based bone substitutes. Here, various load cases relevant to implant applications are numerically considered, including compression, compression-shear and shear. Optimized lattices are manufactured using laser powder bed fusion from the beta-type Ti-42Nb alloy and tested under compression. The results indicate significant potential for coupling TPMS lattices and shape optimization in the context of additive manufacturing. Specifically, stiffness increases of up to 80% and strength increases of up to 61% are experimentally demonstrated, while maintaining the inherent TPMS morphology. Therefore, the presented shape optimization procedure could be a key factor to exploit the combination of biocompatible Ti-42Nb alloy and TPMS based biomimetic design for future implant applications.",

    "abstract": "The influence of post-build processing on the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of additively manufactured (AM) 316L stainless steel fabricated using laser powder bed fusion was assessed at both room temperature and -50 °C via uniaxial tensile experiments. In the absence of hydrogen at ambient temperature, all four evaluated AM conditions (as-built (AB), annealed (ANN), hot isostatic pressed (HIP), and HIP plus cold worked (CW) to 30%) exhibit notably reduced ductility relative to conventionally manufactured (CM) 316L stainless steel. The AM material exhibits sensitivity to the build direction, both in the presence and absence of hydrogen, with a notable increase in yield strength in the X direction and enhanced ductility in the Z direction. Conversely, testing of non-charged specimens at -50 °C revealed similar ductility between the CM, AB, ANN, and HIP conditions. Upon hydrogen charging, the ductility of all four AM conditions was found to be similar to that of CM 316L at ambient temperature, with the HIP condition actually exceeding the CM material. Critically, testing of hydrogen-charged samples at -50 °C revealed that the ductility of the HIP AM 316L condition was nearly double that observed in the CM 316L. This improved performance persisted even after cold working, as the CW AM 316L exhibited comparable ductility to CM 316L at -50 °C after hydrogen charging, despite having a 2-fold higher yield strength. Feritscope measurements suggest this increased performance is related to the reduced propensity for AM 316L to form strain-induced martensite during deformation, even after significant post-processing treatments. These results demonstrate that AM 316L can be post-processed using typical procedures to exhibit similar to or even improved resistance to hydrogen embrittlement relative to CM 316L.",

A continuous transition from a single FCC structure to a major BCC+minor FCC dual-phase structure was achieved, benefiting from the remelting and reheating process during the deposition. In the FCC→BCC transition zone, the dendritic core region is identified as an FCC matrix decorated by AlNi-rich ordered B2 precipitates. The interdendritic area shows B2 precipitating in the FeCr-rich disordered A2 matrix. Additionally, the interface between the two regions shows that the A2 phase and ordered Cr3Fe intermetallic phase precipitate at the B2 phase. The mechanical properties show a tendency for higher strength and hardening rate but lower plasticity corresponding to the areas with higher Al content. Through quantitative estimation of different strengthening mechanisms, the contribution from precipitation strengthening became increasingly apparent as Al content increased. Other strengthening modes, including solid solution and dislocations, also contribute to the total strength. This investigation realises a novel additive manufacturing method combining powder bed and wire feeding, which can produce a more convenient and cost-effective gradient material with a complex composition.",

    "abstract": "Progress towards widespread adoption of additively manufactured (AM) components requires a strong understanding of the influence of pervasive pore defects on the material's fatigue life. In this work, we describe a robust methodology to determine process parameters to intentionally seed three distinct types of pore defect structures (i.e., lack of fusion, keyhole/trapped gas, and planar/linearly aligned defects) in AM builds, alongside control specimens with minimal porosity, through a design of experiments (DOE) study for alloy 718 (also known as IN718). Normalized enthalpy and melt pool overlap were considered to adequately populate the DOE space by varying laser power, scan speed, and hatch spacing, and porosity as a function of laser energy density was compared to the literature. Builds were characterized using optical microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), two computed tomography (CT) techniques with an order of magnitude difference in resolution, and strain-controlled low cycle fatigue (LCF) experiments. EBSD and cyclic straining revealed that the process parameters identified to seed different pore defects did not significantly affect the microstructure. LCF tests revealed a fatigue life delineation between baseline (i.e., minimal porosity) and seeded defect samples as described above. Common porosity metrics such as volume fraction and maximum defect size did not strongly correlate to fatigue resistance but did reveal the need to closely consider the CT (or other non-destructive evaluation technique) resolution to adequately characterize pore defects. The methodology established in this work will be vital in future modeling efforts to assess potential debits to fatigue resistance in the presence of pore defects.",

Numerical modelling of the PBF-LB process and the influence of the process parameters on the melt pool topology are presented in this study. A one-way coupled model using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) is adopted to model the particle distribution in the powder bed and the melt pool formation and dynamics due to laser irradiation during the PBF process. The DEM method is used to model the interaction between particles in the powder bed, and CFD is used to simulate the melt pool formation, flow and solidification. The Volume of Fluid (VoF) approach was used to model the three phases. The effects of surface tension, Marangoni convection and recoil pressure at the metal/gas interface were included in this model. The predicted melt pool dimensions for various process parameters are validated against the experimental data. The different pore-forming mechanisms in multi-track, multi-layer cases and the effect of actual layer thickness are investigated. The proposed modelling approach is shown to capture the dominant physical mechanisms of the PBF-LB processes, potentially being used as a tool to understand process-structure–property relationships and aid in process optimisation.",

    "abstract": "3D printing by two-photon polymerization (TPP) is a well-established manufacturing approach for realizing 3D polymer structures at the micro- and nanoscale. However, an important shortcoming of 3D printing by two-photon polymerization is that it is extremely challenging to print 3D objects with long overhanging features, which severely limits the application space of this technology. Here, we introduce a methodology for 3D printing by two-photon polymerization that allows the realization of 3D objects with long overhanging structures that cannot be printed using conventional printing strategies. Our methodology combines different printing approaches for realizing the overhanging structure, including locally adjusted printing block sizes and a mix of the Shell & Scaffold and Solid printing modes. As a result, objects with long overhanging parts can be printed without the need for added support structures. Using this approach, we demonstrate successful printing of overhanging cantilevers with a quadratic cross-section of 50 µm x 50 µm and lengths of up to 1000 µm. Thus, our printing modality substantially extends the capabilities and application space of 3D printing by two-photon polymerization and removes current design limitations regarding 3D printed objects with long overhanging structures.",

    "abstract": "Cold metal transfer (CMT)-based wire-arc directed energy deposition (waDED) is a high-speed deposition process capable of manufacturing Ti-alloys with high production rates and lower costs. However, CMT-processing of Ti-alloys with tailored properties for aerospace applications demands a fundamental understanding of the microstructural evolution. The complex thermal cycles during CMT-based waDED of Ti-6Al-4V affect the phase transformation pathways, leading to heterogeneous microstructures and property variations within builds. The current study aims to investigate the effect of a new CMT high deposition rate strategy (4.3 kg/h) on those heterogeneities using multiscale characterisation techniques. The process characteristics and thermal profile of the CMT process decreased the size and volume fraction of the α-phase along with the size and aspect ratio of the parent β grains with increasing build height. The CMT process is effective in stirring the melt pool and limiting epitaxial growth of the β-phase. Further, the imposed thermal cycles induce nucleation and refinement of β parent grains. Chemical solute partitioning and variations in the α-lath thickness in the characteristic colony and basketweave structures are observed. The developed microstructures are associated to local three-variant clusters and grain boundary α-variant selection mechanisms, promoted by the diffusional nature of Ti-6Al-4V CMT. The capability to remove epitaxially grown β grains and promote three-variant clusters over α-colonies improves mechanical strength and reduces anisotropy. Our work provides advanced understanding of the microstructure evolution and its implications during CMT compared to other AM processes. It showcases the potential of CMT to become a viable processing route for manufacturing larger engineering parts for future aerospace applications and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Lattice structures have attracted significant attention as novel energy-absorbing structures; however, regular lattice structures have anisotropic energy-absorbing properties. To make the energy absorption properties isotropic, the irregularization of the lattice structures may be effective. However, the irregularity effect on the energy absorption amount is unclear. Therefore, in this study, irregularities were introduced into the lattice structures comprising struts, and the irregularity effects on the isotropy of the compressive properties and amount of energy absorption were investigated. The lattice structures were designed using a three-dimensional Voronoi partitioning method, and the irregularities of the structures were controlled by the Voronoi seed point distribution. The designed lattice structures were fabricated by powder bed fusion with recycled PA12 powder. In the compressive deformation behavior of the lattice structures with small irregularities, steep stress drops were observed with the generation of failure bands. However, local strut rupture occurred continuously in the lattice structure with large irregularities, and the flow stress undulated gently. From these behavioral characteristics, energy absorption was calculated and discussed concerning the irregularities, redefined quantitatively using the coefficient of variation (CV) for the cell volume distribution. The energy absorption anisotropy decreases sharply for CV above 0.1, and such lattice structures can be considered almost isotropic. Thus, even if the structure is incompletely random, it is isotropic with a certain level of irregularity. In contrast, the average energy absorption between structures with equivalent CV decreases monotonically until CV below 0.35 and then saturating. The results indicate that irregular lattice structures with controlled CV are isotropic and absorb energy more efficiently than random lattice structures designed without planning. Thus, irregularity control is evidently important in designing lattice structures with higher isotropic energy absorption.",

    "abstract": "Advances in sensorization and identification of information embedded inside sensor signatures during manufacturing processes using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for better decision-making have become critical enablers in building data-driven monitoring systems. In the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process, data-driven-based process monitoring is gaining popularity since it allows for real-time component quality verification. Real-time qualification of the additively manufactured parts has a significant advantage as the cost of conventional post-manufacturing inspection methods can be reduced. Also, corrective actions or build termination could be done to save machine time and resources. However, despite the successful development in addressing monitoring needs in LPBF processes, less research has been paid to the ML model's robustness in decision-making when dealing with variations in data distribution from the laser-material interaction owing to different process spaces. Inspired by the idea of domain adaptation in ML, in this work, we propose a deep learning-based unsupervised domain adaptation technique to tackle shifts in data distribution owing to different process parameter spaces. The temporal waveforms of acoustic emissions from the LPBF process zone corresponding to three regimes, namely Lack of Fusion, conduction, and keyhole, were acquired on two different 316 L stainless steel powder distributions (> 45 µm and < 45 µm) with two different parameter sets. Temporal and spectral analysis of the acoustic waveforms corresponding to the powder distributions treated with different laser parameters showed the presence of offset in the data distribution, which was subsequently treated with the proposed unsupervised domain adaptation technique to have an ML model that could be generalized. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy of the proposed methodology between the two distributions showed the feasibility of adapting to the newer environment unsupervisedly and improving the ML model's generalizability.",

    "abstract": "Solute segregation significantly affects material properties and is a critical issue in the laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM) of Ni-based superalloys. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a computational thermal-fluid dynamics (CtFD) simulation coupled multi-phase-field (MPF) simulation with a multicomponent-composition model of Ni-based superalloy to predict solute segregation under solidification conditions in LPBF. The MPF simulation of the Hastelloy-X superalloy reproduced the experimentally observed submicron-sized cell structure. Significant solute segregations were formed within interdendritic regions during solidification at high cooling rates of up to 108 K s-1, a characteristic feature of LPBF. Solute segregation caused a decrease in the solidus temperature (TS), with a reduction of up to 30.4 K, which increases the risk of liquation cracks during LPBF. In addition, the segregation triggers the formation of carbide phases, which increases the susceptibility to ductility dip cracking. Conversely, we found that the decrease in TS is suppressed at the melt-pool boundary regions, where re-remelting occurs during the stacking of the layer above. Controlling the re-remelting behavior is deemed to be crucial for designing crack-free alloys. Thus, we demonstrated that solute segregation at the various interfacial regions of Ni-based multicomponent alloys can be predicted by the conventional MPF simulation. The design of crack-free Ni-based superalloys can be expedited by MPF simulations of a broad range of element combinations and their concentrations in multicomponent Ni-based superalloys.",

Various treatments, encompassing single-step processes like sand blasting (SB), conventional shot peening (CSP), severe shot peening (SSP), gradient severe shot peening (GSSP), ultrasonic shot peening (USP), severe vibratory peening (SVP), ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM), laser shock peening (LSP), laser polishing (LP), tumble finishing (TF), chemical polishing (CP), electro-chemical polishing (ECP), and machining (M), as well as hybrid treatments, were systematically investigated for their impact on the fatigue behavior of hourglass laser powder based fused (LB-PBF) AlSi10Mg specimens. A comprehensive series of experimental tests were carried out, covering surface texture analyses, microstructural characterizations, porosity measurements, hardness, residual stresses (RS), monotonic tensile tests, and rotating bending fatigue tests at four stress levels. Following the experimental investigations, the acquired data were leveraged to develop a machine learning (ML)-based model to correlate the fatigue life with the influencing factors and conduct parametric and sensitivity analyses. The model utilized a deep learning approach to predict the fatigue response of LB-PBF AlSi10Mg, incorporating various artificial neural networks (ANNs) and considering input parameters such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elongation to fracture, porosity, depth of pore closure, surface hardness, depth of hardness variation, surface RS, maximum compressive residual stresses (CRS), depth of the CRS field, top surface grain size, surface layer mean grain size, surface roughness, and stress amplitude. Depending on the life regime, the factors influencing fatigue behavior can vary significantly. In higher stresses, dominated by plastic strains, surface residual stress emerges as the primary factor. Conversely, in lower stresses, dominated by elastic strains, the significance of surface roughness becomes more pronounced, followed by surface residual stress, surface hardness and other factors. These findings underscore the contextual importance of different influencing factors for enhancing fatigue resistance based on varying loading conditions.",

The study then comparatively analyzed the microstructural characterization, mechanical properties, and corrosion behaviors of the overlap region between adjacent passes and the substrate (NAB layer). The results revealed that the grain size of the previous deposited layer in the overlap region was smaller than that of the post deposited layer and that the precipitated phase was mainly a lamellar κIII phase. Based on the microstructural differences, the strength of the overlap region was approximately 100 MPa less than that of the substrate. However, following double-layer deposition, the strength of the overlap region increased significantly and was nearly equivalent to that of the substrate, reaching 730 MPa. The corrosion of the multi-pass wire-arc DED of the NAB alloy was divided into two stages. Initially, because of the small grain size and the presence of the eutectic organization κIII and α-Cu phases, the corrosion susceptibility in the overlap region was higher than that of the substrate. After the corrosion product film was formed, the strength and bonding force with the alloy of the corrosion product film on the overlap region were better than those on the substrate, and the corrosive resistance of the overlap region was greater than that of the substrate.",

    "abstract": "Process-structure-property (PSP) relationships are critical to the optimization of manufacturing processes, but establishing these relationships typically involves time- and cost- consuming experiments, especially for additive manufacturing (AM) due to the large number of process parameters involved. In this study, we develop a novel and interpretable machine learning approach for predicting, optimizing, and expanding the process window of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) while simultaneously establishing PSP relationships, using AlSi10Mg as an example. Our iterative, error-targeted method substantially decreases the amount of experimentation required. Gaussian process regression (GPR) was employed as the predictive model, incorporating multiple input variables (e.g., process parameters, relative density, melt pool morphology, cellular structure, and grain structure), for predicting three mechanical properties (i.e., yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and % elongation). A comparison of model predictions and experimental data outside the training scope reveals that the prediction accuracy can be improved with higher dimensional inputs and further enhanced by a multi-output model that accounts for correlations between the different mechanical properties. Additionally, the GPR kernel's hyperparameter for each input enables feature selection and model interpretability. The proposed approach can assist with finding the most critical variables affecting mechanical performance, establishing the PSP relationships of AM fabricated alloys, and providing guidance for tailoring the final properties. The methodology presented in this study can be applied to various AM techniques and materials to broaden the process window to achieve previously unattainable mechanical properties, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of the PSP relationships.",

    "abstract": "In additive manufacturing, intrinsic heat treatments take place during deposition that affect the properties of AM-structures. In this work, the influence of thermal cycling on the local microstructure and mechanical properties of nickel-based superalloy in wire-based electron beam directed energy deposition (EB-DED) was investigated. Structures were fabricated using a continuous deposition strategy (CDS) and discontinuous interpass cooling strategy (ICS) revealing changes in thermal profiles, time-temperature history, and microstructure. An altered morphology along the build-up height and interdendritic zones enriched in Nb are formed. Nb and Mo did not show a clear trend of segregation along the build-up height. Lower fractions of the Laves phase and MCs are found for both configurations. Differences between deposition strategies and locations within AM-structures are found for the γ\" and δ phase. The higher Nb content in the interdendritic zone promotes the precipitation of γ\" and δ phase by shortening the aging times compared to wrought materials. The longer deposition times of ICS favour the precipitation of fine γ\" in the interdendritic zone throughout the deposition height. In contrast, the short deposition time of CDS leads to an increase in temperature and a heterogeneous distribution of γ\" along the height, i.e. coarsening of the γ\" followed by a dissolution along the built-up height. The microstructural changes correlate with the mechanical properties. Structures fabricated with ICS exhibit homogeneous mechanical properties throughout, while the graded microstructure of CDS results in graded mechanical properties and decreasing strength throughout.",

    "abstract": "Duplex stainless steels (DSSs) possess desirable combinations of mechanical properties and excellent corrosion resistance due to their composition and equilibrium microstructure of roughly equivalent fractions of ferrite and austenite. They are used in harsh environments such as marine infrastructures, oil & gas, and paper & pulp industries. Components with complex geometries are often required for these applications. Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques such as laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) can be harnessed to fabricate components with greatest complexity. However, AM fabrication is well-known to promote non-equilibrium microstructures with high dislocation densities and Cr2N precipitates, resulting in inferior ductility. This is generally regarded as a challenge, however, short heat treatments of such as-built microstructures have been shown to attain refined duplex equilibrium microstructures. Recently, annealed LPBF DSS 2205 has been reported to possess strength higher than wrought counterparts and ductility properties better than the as-built state. However, the microstructural phenomena and deformation mechanisms behind these attractive properties remain poorly understood. Through multi-scale microstructural characterization, we show that the improved strength results not only from the hard ferrite phase, but also fine austenite grain size and nanoscale oxide dispersion strengthening. The enhanced ductility may be attributed to a combination of deformation mechanisms including dislocation slip, stacking fault formation, deformation twinning, and a deformation-induced martensitic transformation. We discuss how the level of microstructural complexity and solid-state phase transformations during LPBF and annealing can unlock multiple strengthening mechanisms during tensile deformation. Such fundamental understanding is crucial for designing AM parts with reproducible and optimised mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "Powder bed fusion (PBF) is an additive manufacturing technique capable of fabricating highly complex, individualised, and lightweight polymer components. However, to maximise the potential of PBF, in terms of both economic efficiency and environmental sustainability, a successful powder re-use strategy is essential. During a build, ageing and degradation processes affect the re-usability of un-sintered powder, so used powder is usually refreshed with virgin material before re-use. This study considers the effectiveness of using a 70:30 refresh ratio in a specific PBF technique: laser sintering (LS). Across a total of seven printing cycles, polyamide-12 (PA-12) powder refreshed with 30% virgin material after each build, revealed a 4.5°C increase in melting temperature. There was also a 20% reduction in particle flowability, which may be related to the presence of fine satellite particles and considerable particle cracking. This deterioration in powder quality resulted in a 5.8% increase in total part porosity, and an 11% reduction in the ultimate tensile strength of fabricated parts, over the seven build cycles. A Pearson correlation test quantified that the reduction in powder flowability was the most significant (p-value of 0.005) cause for the loss of part strength; emphasising that the revolution powder analyser could be a useful complimentary technique for determining the quality of used powder within laser sintering. Nonetheless, compared to previous studies which re-used 100% aged PA-12 powder, without refreshing with any virgin material, the observed reduction in part strength is relatively modest. This suggests that a 70:30 refresh ratio offers a good compromise between maintaining part performance, particularly for non-critical applications, without having to add an unnecessary amount of virgin powder. Therefore, this study reveals the relationship between the deterioration of powder properties and reductions in part strength; yet highlights the benefits of operating with a 70:30 refresh ratio when re-using PA-12 powder across multiple build cycles.",

This research characterises the relationship between the manufactured inclination angle, surface roughness and associated fatigue performance of LB-PBF Ti-6Al-4V. Unique to this research is the quantified difference in fatigue performance due to either or upward or downward-facing surface roughness; an outcome made possible by isolating the as-manufactured surface roughness of upward and downward-facing surfaces of inclined specimens prior to fatigue testing. Experimental results confirm the criticality of downward-facing surface roughness, and for the first time characterises the impact of surface orientation (upward and downward) on observed fatigue life.

    "abstract": "Cryogenic tensile behaviors of carbon-doped CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy (C-HEA) printed by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) were systematically explored. The LPBFed C-HEA exhibits excellent cryogenic tensile properties with not only high yield strength but also largely extended elongation as compared to those under room temperature deformation. In particular, the elongation of the C-HEA is twice as high at 77 K compared to 298 K. The strain hardening rate of LPBFed C-HEA under cryogenic deformation is much higher than that under plastic deformation at the room temperature, which contributes to the dramatic enhancement of uniform elongation by delaying plastic instability. Because the flow stress of C-HEA is significantly increased by temperature decrease, it can exceed the critical twinning stress at the early-stage deformation at 77 K. Deformation twins and nano-carbides synergistically contribute to the high back stress evolution of the C-HEA under cryogenic tensile deformation. This study can provide a new perspective on developing high-performance alloys for use in additive manufacturing in cryogenic applications.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) cemented carbide is primarily challenged by critical issues of difficult-to-eliminate pores, cracks, deleterious phases, and non-uniform microstructure, which result in poor mechanical properties. This study utilizes material extrusion (MEX) AM technology to prepare a WC-9Co cemented carbide. The results show that green body printing and solvent debinding process significantly affect its stacked voids, interlayer bonding defects, and debound cracks. These green body defects are eliminated through liquid phase flow and WC particles flow-rearrangement during sintering, resulting in Co-rich regions or Co pools, abnormal growth of WC grains, and residual pores. A green body free of visible defects is prepared using a feedstock with a powder loading of 54 vol.%, a printing temperature of 150 ℃, a microfilament overlap ratio of 30%, and a printing-layer thickness of 0.1 mm. Followed by a two-step solvent debinding and continuous thermal debinding-vacuum-pressure sintering, a nearly fully dense WC-9Co cemented carbide is fabricated, with a uniform microstructure of two phases and free of pores, cracks, and Co pools. Its Vickers hardness, transverse rupture strength, and fracture toughness reach 1525±3 HV30, 3492±45 MPa, and 20.4±0.5 MPa·m1/2, respectively, which are significantly better than those of similar reports and could be comparable to similar cemented carbides prepared by powder metallurgy. This study could provide a new technological path for developing high-performance cemented carbide complex-structured components.",

    "abstract": "Controlling and optimizing surface roughness remain a significant challenge in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Surface roughness affects printed part quality, particularly fatigue life, leading to costly post-processing. Nevertheless, tailored roughness can be beneficial to specific fields in engineering and medicine, such as cooling or osteointegration. Consequently, the importance of quality assurance, in-situ monitoring, and automatic anomaly detection has been elevated among the users of the LPBF process. In-situ surface roughness detection remains a less explored area within all in-situ defect detection. Additionally, existing studies primarily employ camera-based methods, which come with inherent limitations, including sensitivity to ambient light conditions, compromises between resolution and field of view, and the requirement for additional equipment such as adaptive optical filters. This study pioneers using a photodiode sensor, offering faster response times for real-time surface roughness prediction. Integrating this sensor with machine learning (ML) algorithms establishes a robust framework for surface roughness prediction. The methodology involves analyzing the captured light intensity from the melt pool by an on-axial photodiode and incorporating additional process variables into ML models to predict surface roughness within each small area of the printed part (690 µm × 510 µm), even at edges and corners. Multiple ML algorithms are trained and rigorously validated with unseen data. This comprehensive analysis encompasses the impact of process parameter variations on a wide range of surface roughness values, affirming the efficiency of the proposed methodology.",

    "abstract": "Current experimental and numerical quantification methods are limited in their ability to full-field mapping of the unpredictable distribution of all residual stress and permanent plastic strain components in additive manufacturing parts with discontinuous processing properties. To address this limitation, a tomographic eigenstrain (inherent strain) reconstruction method, that merges eigenstrain reconstruction with diffraction strain tomography for mapping volumetric distribution of all components of eigenstrains and corresponding elastic deformations like residual stresses non-destructively using minimum amount of tomographic scans is presented through numerical experiments, and then applied to the analysis of a CM 247 LC superalloy additive manufacturing part using diffraction strain tomography data. The method reconstructs all eigenstrain and corresponding residual stress components, parallel to the build direction, aligned with the experimental data component accurately, demonstrating its potential in optimizing the performance and reliability of parts designed for high-tech industries such as aerospace. Subsequent validations using the X-ray diffraction sin2ψ and neutron diffraction strain scanning techniques confirm the method's reliability in reconstructing residual stress components parallel to the plane of powder bed that are different from the experimental data component. Furthermore, the novel findings of this study reveal a characteristic residual stress distribution pattern within additive manufacturing parts particularly those featuring rectangular shapes. Microstructural analysis also validates eigenstrain distribution in accordance with the findings on the characteristic distribution of residual stresses, highlighting the significance of this method in advancing materials research and development.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the thermal and fluid flow fields in laser-based directed energy deposition (DED-LB) is crucial for understanding process behavior and ensuring part quality. However, existing models often fail to accurately predict these fields due to simplifying assumptions, particularly regarding powder particle-induced attenuation in laser power and energy density distribution, and the variable material properties and process parameters. The present work introduces a high-fidelity multi-phase thermal-fluid model driven by a combination of the discrete element method (DEM) and the finite volume method (FVM). Incorporating an enhanced attenuation model for laser energy enables a more precise approximation of powder particle-induced attenuation effects in the laser power and energy density distribution. The study focuses on the influence of laser beam intensity profiles during DED-LB of austenitic stainless steel (AISI 316 L), with model validation conducted through experimental measurements of deposited track dimensions for different beam shapes. The results of numerical simulations demonstrate the critical impact of powder-induced attenuation on the laser power and intensity profiles. Neglecting laser energy attenuation, a common assumption in numerical simulations of DED-LB, leads to overestimations of the absorbed energy of the laser beam, affecting thermal and fluid flow fields, and melt pool dimensions. The present study unravels the complex relationship between the attenuation coefficient (due to the powder stream) and powder stream characteristics, describing the variations of the attenuation coefficient with changes in the powder mass flow rate and powder stream incidence angle. The findings show the critical effects of laser beam shaping on melt pool behavior in DED-LB, with square beams inducing larger melt pool volumes and circular beams creating smaller but deeper melt pools. The proposed enhanced thermal-fluid modeling framework offers a robust approach for optimizing laser-based additive manufacturing across diverse materials and laser systems.",

    "abstract": "Tailoring part strength and ductility in additive manufacturing or repair is vital to successful applications. Therefore, applying cold spray as a deposition technique must be tuned for maximum amounts of well-bonded internal interfaces and sufficient softening of the highly work-hardened deposit. With its low melting temperature, Zinc is an ideal model system for studying phenomena associated with high strain rate deformation and local temperature rise effect, both in single impacts and thick deposits. Despite the low temperatures, Zn single splats already show recrystallization at internal interfaces. The respective amounts scale with increasing process gas temperatures. At higher process temperatures, deposits are almost fully recrystallized. The recrystallization obviously improves bonding at internal and at deposit-substrate interfaces. Under optimum conditions, an ultimate deposit strength of up to 135 MPa and an elongation to failure of 18.4 % are reached, comparable to that of laser-manufactured Zn parts. However, the presence of defects in the form of a high density of high-angle grain boundaries and a certain amount of nonbonded splats interfaces results in a lower ductility than that of bulk Zn. This demonstrates a well-tuned interplay between the minimization of defect densities and softening by recrystallization that would allow for deriving bulk-like properties of cold sprayed material without additional post-treatments. Correlations between simulation and experimental results of microstructures, mechanical properties, and fracture mechanisms supply information about the prerequisites for reaching high ductility.",

In this paper we report on the development of all inkjet-printed UV-curable electromagnetic responsive inks in a single process, and the electromagnetic characterization of the developed structure. The ink consists of iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (nominal particle size 50–100 nm) suspended within a UV curable matrix resin. The viscosity and surface tension of the inks were tuned to sit within the inkjet printability range. Multiple layers of the electromagnetic active ink were printed alongside passive UV-curable ink in a single manufacturing process to form a multi-material waffle shape. The real permittivity of the cured passive ink, active ink and waffle structure at a frequency of 8–12 GHz were 2.25, 2.73 and 2.65 F/m, respectively. This shows the potential of additive manufacturing (AM) to form multi-material structures with tunable electromagnetic properties.",

Its open-architecture design was originally determined to enable access for x-rays to the melt pool, but it also provides access to the build area for a range of other in-situ measurement techniques. The system is sufficiently automated to enable single tracks and high-density, multiple layer components to be built. It is easily transportable to enable measurements at different measurement facilities and its modular design enables straightforward modification for the specific measurements being made. We demonstrate that the system produces components with >99% density. Hence the build conditions are representative to observe process fundamentals and to develop process control strategies.",

Our results include two findings of high relevance to the designers of lattice structures: (i) network and matrix phase gyroid lattice structures develop bandgaps below 15 kHz while network diamond and matrix diamond lattices do not, and (ii) the bandwidth of a bandgap in the network phase gyroid lattice can be tuned by adjusting its volume fraction and cell size.",

    "abstract": "High density components of an AlCoCrFeNi alloy, often described as a high-entropy alloy, were manufactured by binder jetting followed by sintering. Thermodynamic calculations using the CALPHAD approach show that the high-entropy alloy is only stable as a single phase in a narrow temperature range below the melting point. At all other temperatures, the alloy will form a mixture of phases, including a sigma phase, which can strongly influence the mechanical properties. The phase stabilities in built AlCoCrFeNi components were investigated by comparing the as-sintered samples with the post-sintering annealed samples at temperatures between 900 °C and 1300 °C. The as-sintered material shows a dominant B2/bcc structure with additional fcc phase in the grain boundaries and sigma phase precipitating in the grain interior. Annealing experiments between 1000 °C and 1100 °C inhibit the sigma phase and only a B2/bcc phase with a fcc phase is observed. Increasing the temperature further suppresses the fcc phase in favor for the B2/bcc phases. The mechanical properties are, as expected, dependent on the annealing temperature, with the higher annealing temperature giving an increase in yield strength from 1203 MPa to 1461 MPa and fracture strength from 1996 MPa to 2272 MPa. This can be explained by a hierarchical microstructure with nano-sized precipitates at higher annealing temperatures. The results enlighten the importance of microstructure control, which can be utilized in order to tune the mechanical properties of these alloys. Furthermore, an excellent oxidation resistance was observed with oxide layers with a thickness of less than 5 μm after 20 h annealing at 1200 °C, which would be of great importance for industrial applications.",

Although the wire + arc additive manufactured Ti-6Al-4 V builds are typically fully dense, occurrences of isolated pores may not be completely avoided due to feedstock contamination. This study used contaminated wires to build the gauge section of fatigue specimens to purposely introduce spherical gas pores in the size range of 120–250 micrometres. Changes in the defect morphology were monitored via interrupted fatigue testing with periodic X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning. Prior to specimen failure, the near surface pores grew by approximately a factor of 2 and tortuous fatigue cracks were initiated and propagated towards the nearest free surface. Elastic-plastic finite element analysis showed cyclic plastic deformation at the pore root as a result of stress concentration; consequently for an applied tension-tension cyclic stress (stress ratio 0.1), the local stress at the pore root became a tension-compression nature (local stress ratio −1.0). Fatigue life was predicted using the notch fatigue approach and validated with experimental test results.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) or Selective Laser Melting (SLM) manufacturing of high conductivity metals such as copper and refractory metals. SLM manufacturing of high thermal conductivity metals is particularly difficult. In case of refractory metals, the difficulty is amplified because of their high melting point and brittle behaviour. Rapid process development strategies are essential to identify suitable process parameters for achieving minimum porosities in these alloys, yet current strategies suffer from several limitations. We propose a simple approach for rapid process development using normalized process maps. Using plots of normalized energy density vs. normalized hatch spacing, we identify a wide processability window. This is further refined using analytical heat transfer models to predict melt pool size. Final optimization of the parameters is achieved by experiments based on statistical Design of Experiments concepts. In this article we demonstrate the use of our proposed approach for development of process parameters (hatch spacing, layer thickness, exposure time and point distance) for SLM manufacturing of molybdenum and aluminium. Relative densities of 97.4% and 99.7% are achieved using 200 W pulsed laser and 400 W continuous laser respectively, for molybdenum and aluminium, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for SLM processing of high conductivity materials.",

    "abstract": "Selective Laser Melting (SLM) or Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) is the most studied laser-based additive manufacturing process for metals and alloys. One important issue in SLM is the time-consuming identification of a process window leading to quasi fully dense parts (> 99.8%), usually based on trials and errors. As some metal powders may be very expensive, and therefore not suitable for a whole battery of tests, a method to infer optimal parameters from one material to another would be highly beneficial. In this study, we use bronze as a test material for optimizing SLM parameters, before translating these parameters to red gold and 316 L steel. The concept of normalized enthalpy is used to take into account the differences in thermal and optical properties among the different materials. A translation rule is derived for the prediction of optimal processing conditions, based on the ones found for the test material. One important input for this translation rule is the powder absorptivity, which is measured at the appropriate laser wavelength and at room temperature. This approach eventually leads to the highest reported density for an additive manufactured 18-carat gold alloy (99.81% relative density), to the authors' knowledge. Finite element (FEM) simulations justify the translation rule formulation by showing the importance of the laser/powder interactions during the SLM process, leading to a finite penetration depth of the laser in the powder bed due to multiple reflections. The FEM calculations indicate that a significant part of the laser energy is directly absorbed by the powder during the manufacturing process when operating in near-optimal conditions.",

    "abstract": "The opportunity to improve the quality of metal castings by enabling fabrication of complex gating systems via 3D Sand-Printing (3DSP) has been recently established. Among the different components of a gating system (often called rigging), sprue design offers a major opportunity to exploit the unlimited geometric freedom offered by 3DSP process. In this study, conventional principles of casting hydrodynamics is advanced by validated novel numerical models for novel sprue designs to improve melt flow control. Computational flow simulations demonstrate that conical-helix sprue satisfy the critical velocity condition by reducing the ingate velocity below 0.5 m/s. Multiple approaches to integrate 3DSP into conventional manufacturing to fabricate complex gating systems through \"Hybrid Molding\" are presented. 3DSP molds featuring two optimized sprue profiles and a benchmark straight sprue are fabricated to pour 17-4 stainless steel. Computed tomography scans (CT) shows that parabolic sprue casting (PSC) and conical-helix sprue casting (CHSC) reduced overall casting defects by 56% and 99.5% respectively when compared to straight sprue casting (SSC). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirms the presence of globular oxide inclusions and that PSC and CHSC exhibits 21% and 35% reduced inclusion when compared to the SSC. Three point flexural testing reveals that CHSC and PSC exhibits an increase of 8.4% and 4.1% respectively in average ultimate flexural strength than SSC. The findings from this study demonstrate that numerically optimized gating systems that can only be fabricated via 3DSP have the potential to significantly improve both mechanical and metallurgical performance of sand castings.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in additive manufacturing (AM) have motivated researchers to consider this fabrication technique as a solution for challenges in patient-specific orthopaedic needs. Although there is an increasing trend in the applications of AM in medical fields, there is a critical need to understand the biomechanical performance of AM implants. In particular, design opportunities, anisotropic material properties and resulting stability of AM implant constructs for large bone defects such as osteosarcoma, comminuted fractures and infections are unexplored. This study aims to evaluate metal AM for complex fracture fixation using both computational and experimental methods. In addition, this research highlights the role of AM in the entire workflow to fabricate metal AM fixation plates for treatment of comminuted proximal humerus fractures. A new AM-centric patient-specific implant design for reducing common postoperative complications such as varus collapse and screw cutout is investigated. Biocompatible 316L stainless steel specimens processed in laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is subjected to tensile testing and post-hoc microhardness to obtain orthotropic material properties of the AM implants. Subsequently, risk of screw cut-out is evaluated using finite element modelling (FEM) of AM implant-bone constructs. Parallel experiments included synthetic bones that are evaluated using a 3D motion capture system. The biomechanical tests are analyzed to quantify the medial fracture gap displacement among study groups subject to different loading conditions. The outcomes of this study suggest that the proposed AM-centric fixation plate design reduces average varus collapse (i.e. medial fracture gap displacement) by 47.2 % and risk of screw cut-out by 14.6 % when compared to the conventional plate design. Findings from this study can be extended to other patient anatomy, loading conditions, and AM processes.",

The standard test samples exhibited relatively small differences with regards to printing directions when PA12 was used alone. Their tensile strengths (σm) were approx. 75%–80% of the injection-moulded sample. The addition of carbon fibres significantly enhanced the tensile strengths, namely 50% greater for the vertically printed test sample and more than 100% greater for the horizontally printed samples, compared to the respective objects consisting of PA12 alone. The strong difference in printing directions can be attributed to the orientation of the carbon fibres. Mechanical tests on the SLS printed tubes confirmed the trends that were found in the standard test samples. Porosity and pore structure inside the SLS printed tubes were studied by combining optical microscopy and X-ray microtomography with image analysis. It was found that porosity was a general phenomenon inside the SLS printed samples. Nevertheless, there were significant differences in porosity, which probably depended on the properties of the materials used, both with and without carbon fibres, thus causing significant differences in light absorption and heat conductivity. The printed samples made of PA12 alone possessed quite a high level of porosity (4.7%), of which the size of the biggest pore was hundreds of microns. The twenty biggest pores with an average size of 75*104 μ m3 accounted for 43% of the total porosity. However, the porosity of the printed samples made from PA12 + CF was only 0.68%, with the biggest pore being only tens of microns. The corresponding average pore size of the 20 biggest pores was 72*103 μ m3, which was one order of magnitude smaller than the printed samples made from PA12 alone. Pores inside the SLS printed samples were probably responsible for a spread in the mechanical properties measured, e.g. tensile strengths, tensile (Young's) modulus, strain at break, etc. The ratios of their standard deviations to their corresponding mean values in the standard test samples could probably be used as an indicator of porosity, i.e. the bigger the ratio, the higher the porosity.",

    "abstract": "3D printing allows rapid fabrication of complex objects from digital designs. One 3D-printing process, direct laser writing, polymerises a light-sensitive material by steering a focused laser beam through the shape of the object to be created. The highest-resolution direct laser writing systems use a femtosecond laser, steered using mechanised stages or galvanometer-controlled mirrors, to effect two-photon polymerisation. Here we report a new high-resolution direct laser writing system that employs a resonant mirror scanner to achieve a significant increase in printing speed over current methods while maintaining resolution on the order of a micron. This printer is based on a software modification to a commercially available resonant-scanning two-photon microscope. We demonstrate the complete process chain from hardware configuration and control software to the printing of objects of approximately 400 × 400 × 350 μm, and validate performance with objective benchmarks. Released under an open-source license, this work makes micron-scale 3D printing available at little or no cost to the large community of two-photon microscope users, and paves the way toward widespread availability of precision-printed devices.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing of ceramics has been actively investigated with the objective of fabricating complex structures that compete in terms of material performance with traditionally manufactured ceramics but with the benefit of increased geometric freedom. More specifically, zirconia provides high fracture toughness and thermal stability. In addition, its dielectric permittivity may be the highest among materials available for 3D printing, and may enable the next generation of complex electromagnetic structures. NanoParticle Jetting™ is a new material jetting process for selectively depositing nanoparticles and is capable of printing zirconia. Dense, fine-featured parts can be manufactured with layer thicknesses as small as 10 μm and jetting resolution of 20 μm after a final sintering step. For this study, 3D printed zirconia using NanoParticle Jetting™ was characterized in terms of chemistry, density, crystallography, sintering shrinkage and dielectric properties as a foundation for developing high performance radio frequency (RF) components. The experimental results indicate a yttria-stabilized ZrO2 structure exhibiting a bulk relative permittivity of 23 and a loss tangent of 0.0013 at microwave frequencies. A simple zirconia dielectric resonator antenna is measured, confirming the measured dielectric properties and illustrating a practical application of this material.",

    "abstract": "We present the results of 3D modeling of the laser and electron beam powder bed fusion process at the mesoscale with an in-house developed advanced multiphysical numerical tool. The hydrodynamics and thermal conductivity core of the tool is based on the lattice Boltzmann method. The numerical tool takes into account the random distributions of powder particles by size in a layer and the propagation of the laser (electron beam) with a full ray tracing (Monte Carlo) model that includes multiple reflections, phase transitions, thermal conductivity, and detailed liquid dynamics of the molten metal, influenced by evaporation of the metal and the recoil pressure. The model has been validated by a number of physical tests. We numerically demonstrate a strong dependence of the net energy absorption of the incoming heat source beam by the powder bed and melt pool on the beam power. We show the ability of our model to predict the measurable properties of a single track on a bare substrate as well as on a powder layer. We obtain good agreement with experimental data for the depth, width and shape of a track for a number of materials and a wide range of energy source parameters. We further apply our model to the simulation of the entire layer formation and demonstrate the strong dependence of the resulting layer morphology on the hatch spacing. The presented model could be very helpful for optimizing the additive process without carrying out a large number of experiments in a common trial-and-error method, developing process parameters for new materials, and assessing novel modalities of powder bed fusion additive manufacturing.",

Material packing densities were measured to establish a relationship between powder packing and track formation. The results showed that the track height when using water atomized powder was 15% lower than the value achieved for the gas atomized powder. High-speed imaging was utilized to observe the material behavior and analyze the powder particle movement under laser irradiation. It was found that water atomized powder has less particle entrainment due to its tendency towards mechanical interlocking. The occurrence of powder spattering and melt pool instabilities was also studied. More frequent spatter ejection is believed to be due to the higher amount of oxygen in the water atomized powder.",

    "abstract": "The cost-effectiveness of metal powder bed fusion (PBF) systems in high-throughput production are dominated by the high cost of metallic powder materials. Metal PBF technologies become more competitive in production scenarios when Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) is integrated to embed functionality through shape complexity, weight, and material reduction through topology optimization and lattice structures. This study investigates the value of DfAM in terms of unit cost and manufacturing time reduction. Input design parameters, such as lattice design-type, part size, volume fraction, material type and production volumes are included in a Design-of-Experiment to model their impact. The performance variables for cost and manufacturing time were assessed for two scenarios: (i) outsourcing scenario using an online quotation system, and (ii) in-house scenario utilizing a decision support system (DSS) for metal PBF. The results indicate that the size of the part and the lattice volume fraction are the most significant parameters that contribute to time and cost savings. This study shows that full utilization of build platforms by volume-optimized parts, high production volumes, and reduction of volume fraction lead to substantial benefits for metal PBF industrialization. Integration of DfAM and lattice designs for lightweight part production can decrease the unit cost of production down to 70.6% and manufacturing time can be reduced significantly down to 71.7% depending on the manufacturing scenarios and design constraints when comparing to solid infill designs. The study also provides a case example of a bracket design whose cost is reduced by 53.7%, manufacturing time is reduced by 54.3 %, and the overall weight is reduced significantly with the use of lattices structures and topology optimization.",

    "abstract": "An energy balance that describes the transfer of energy is proposed for the laser-based directed energy deposition process. The partitioning of laser energy was experimentally measured and accurately validated using a special process calorimeter for Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 625™ alloys. The total energy provided by the laser was partitioned as: the energy directly absorbed by the substrate, the energy absorbed by the powder stream and deposited onto the substrate, the energy reflected from the substrate surface, and the energy reflected or absorbed and lost from the powder stream. Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V showed higher overall or bulk absorption than the Inconel 625™ alloy. Processing with powder resulted in lower laser energy absorption within the substrate than without powder, due to the \"shadowing\" effect of the powder stream within the beam and loss of energy representing unfused powder. During processing at a laser power of approximately 1 kW the total energy absorbed during the deposition process was found to be 42% for the Ti-6Al-4V alloy and 37% for the Inconel 625™ alloy. Under these conditions 14% of the total energy was lost by the Ti-6Al-4V unfused powder; whereas only 11% was lost by the Inconel 625™ powder.",

We refer to the homogenously dispersed Si(Mg) nanoparticles and the presence of interconnected amorphous phases in the coral-like eutectic Si network and their evolution upon in-situ heating in scanning transmission electron microscope. The in-situ heating experiments showed as first phenomenon at lower temperatures the crystallization of the eventually present amorphous silicon, while at temperatures above 240 °C coarsening into spherical crystalline particles and network breakage prevail. In addition, the Si nanoparticles evolved, mainly changing their shape and coherence with the matrix. These findings correlate with results from macroscopic investigations (DSC, in-situ XRD), where they further contribute to explain the retrieved exothermic signals by linking them to the respective crystallization of the amorphous Si network, the coarsening of the finely dispersed Si nanocrystals and network breakage.",

This honeycomb is based on a modified triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) equation with reduced periodicity. Using the numerical homogenisation method, the anisotropy of the gyroid lattice types was found to differ greatly, as was the dependence of this anisotropy on the volume fraction. From compression testing of laser sintered polyamide PA2200 specimens, the honeycomb gyroid was found to possess extremely high anisotropy, with Emax*/Emin*, the ratio of the highest to the lowest direction-dependent modulus, ∼250 at low volume fraction. The stiffness and anisotropy of the honeycomb gyroid are compared to equivalent results from the square honeycomb, the closest analogue in the set of conventional honeycomb types. The honeycomb gyroid lattice exhibited novel deformation and post-yield stiffening under in-plane loading; it underwent reorientation into a second, stiffer geometry following plastic bending and contact of its cell walls. The unique deformation behaviour and extremely high anisotropy of the honeycomb gyroid provide strong motivation for further investigations into this new family of reduced periodicity TPMS-based honeycombs.",

    "abstract": "Due to the limited wear and corrosion properties of the austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 L, some applications require the benefits of nitriding. The aim of this work was to investigate whether the same positive effect of nitriding could be obtained for 316 L that was additive manufactured using the laser powder-bed fusion process and further solution treated at 1060 °C for 30 min, low-temperature plasma nitrided at 430 °C or both. This study was designed to better understand the additive-manufactured and solution-treated microstructures as well as developing a nitride and a diffusion layer. The comparison of the wear and corrosion resistance, the microhardness and the microstructure changes of the additive-manufactured steel in different post-treated conditions with a commercial steel was carried out. It was found that the post-treated low-temperature plasma nitriding improves the wear and corrosion resistance of the additive-manufactured samples. The obtained values are similar to the values of conventionally fabricated and nitrided 316 L. The solution treating itself (without further nitriding) did not have any significant impact on these properties. It was possible to explain the microstructure at the nano level as well as correlating the wear and corrosion properties.",

    "abstract": "Laser Powder Bed Fusion is today used for the serial production of parts, e.g. in the medical and aerospace markets. One of the major limitations is the comparatively low build rate of the process, which leads to low productivity and high costs when compared to conventional processes. Current approaches such as the use of multi-laser systems help increasing the build rate but come at higher investment costs. Overall, the low productivity limits the number of business cases for Laser Powder Bed Fusion and hinders the market uptake in more cost-sensitive industries. This paper suggests a combined approach of Laser Powder Bed Fusion and subsequent Hot Isostatic Pressing as a method to improve productivity. Hot Isostatic Pressing is often used as a post-process to eliminate any remnant porosity. It is shown that the process, however, is able to densify specimens that come out of Laser Powder Bed Fusion with an as-build density as low as 95 %. This opens up a larger process window for the initial Laser Powder Bed Fusion step. Experimental investigations are presented using two commercial Laser Powder Bed Fusion systems with the widely used titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. Instead of optimizing the process for the highest possible density, the parameters were optimized to yield the highest possible speed while maintaining a density above 95 %. A scan speed increase of 67 % was achieved and the specimens were then successfully compacted to above 99.8 % density in the Hot Isostatic Processing step. The high-speed parameter set was then applied to a demonstrator build job, where it leads to an overall saving of 26 % of build time.

    "abstract": "The quality and uniformity of the powder layer have a direct impact on the performance of parts produced via powder bed fusion (PBF). Because powder layer properties depend on many powder- and recoating-specific variables, it is difficult to accurately predict powder bed quality across the variety of PBF processes and powders currently available. In this work, we propose a method to assess powder bed quality as a function of both powder conditions and recoating strategies. Our method relies on the powder bed scanner technology, which provides particle-level resolution images of the entire powder layer as it is recoated. Through numerical analysis of the acquired images, we define three new metrics to assess powder bed quality, namely the powder layer thickness uniformity, surface area roughness, and surface particle density. We demonstrate the efficacy of these metrics in capturing differences in powder layers across a matrix of recoating experiments using different batches of stainless steel 316 L powder. Our results clearly show how powders with different particle surface conditions, morphology, and moisture content respond to various recoating velocities and recoater blade types, resulting in layers with different quality. Owing to the high measurement throughput and versatility, our method offers the opportunity to perform systematic spreadability studies of different powdered materials to optimize PBF processes, as well as provide in situ powder bed quality assessment during part production.",

    "abstract": "Microdefects sometimes form in workpieces fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). It is difficult to understand the mechanism of generation of microdefects because the occurrence time during processing cannot be easily identified by conventional monitoring methods. We have therefore developed a convenient method for real-time monitoring of microdefects generation during SLM by using proprietary battery-powered equipment capable of continuous recording and wireless transmission of acoustic emission (AE) waveforms. To clarify the detection capabilities of the proposed method and to evaluate the factors that cause microcrack generation, AE monitoring was conducted for single-layer modeling tests with single-track or multi-track. We could successfully detect AE signals during the tests. The times of occurrence and locations of AE events were identified, and the results were compared with observations of the specimen cross-sections by the X-ray computed tomography (CT). At first in single-track tests, burst type AE events were detected during processing and their origin was confirmed to be pores and microcracks in the specimen. Then in multi-track tests, defects slightly after laser irradiation and defects due to the turning back of the irradiation were detected. The effectiveness and potential of our novel AE monitoring technique for the SLM process have been demonstrated.",

In an important improvement over conventional approaches, the specifications and operating principles of the instruments that would be used to measure the manufactured artefact were taken into account during its design process. With the design-for-metrology methodology, we aim to improve and facilitate measurements on parts produced using additive manufacturing. The benchmarking artefact has a number of geometrical features, including sphericity, cylindricity, coaxiality and minimum feature size, all of which are measured using contact, optical and X-ray computed tomography coordinate measuring systems. The results highlight the differences between the measuring methods, and the need to establish a specification standards and guidance for the dimensional assessment of additive manufacturing parts.",

    "abstract": "Biofunctionalization of Ti6Al4V alloy with metallic agents like Ag or Cu is a promising approach to add antibacterial properties and thus to reduce the risk of implant failure. This research investigates the in-situ alloying of Ti6Al4V(ELI) with 3 at.% Cu powders using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The morphology and geometrical characteristics of the single tracks and layers were studied. Laser powers of 170 W and 340 W, and scanning speeds ranging from 0.4 to 1.4 m/s and 0.8–2.8 m/s were implemented. Single track results showed balling effect and humping at high scanning speeds, 1.4 m/s and 1.6 m/s, for each laser powder respectively. Conversely, keyhole formation occurred at lower scanning speeds of 0.4–0.6 m/s for 170 W laser power, and below and 0.8 m/s for 340 W laser power. For both laser powers, single layers resulted in smoother surfaces at lower scanning speeds. These results were used for the development of optimal process parameters for 3D cubes with 99.9 % density. Optimal process parameters were found for 170 W and 340 W laser powders at 0.7−0.9 and 1.0–1.2 m/s scanning speeds, respectively. In-situ alloying by L-PBF was challenging and a homogeneous distribution of Cu within the alloy was hard to achieve. The increase in laser power from 170 to 340 W resulted in small increase in homogenization. Microstructural analyses after stress-relieving treatment showed the presence of α' and β phases, as well as CuTi2 intermetallic precipitates. The finer microstructure together with CuTi2 intermetallic precipitates resulted in an increase in hardness. This study demonstrates the potential for printing in-situ alloyed Ti6Al4V(ELI)- 3 at.% Cu for biomedical applications. However, further studies are required to determine the effectiveness of antibacterial properties.",

    "abstract": "With additive manufacturing being rapidly integrated into mainstream manufacturing, there is a need to predict and eliminate any distortions in the manufactured parts. Simulation software tools can be helpful in achieving this aim efficiently and economically. This case study objectively compares the capabilities of five different simulation tools available commercially and benchmarks them through test geometries developed to recreate the distortions caused by residual stress in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) for metals. The software tools were assessed by printing the compensated geometries suggested by them for many types of distortions seen in Laser Powder Bed Fusion. The effectiveness of these compensations was then assessed using a 3D (3-Dimensional) scanner to compare the compensated part with the original CAD (Computer Aided Design) of the parts. This case study of some of the available software tools at the time of study from ANSYS, Autodesk, MSC, Additive Works, and Atlas3D also focuses on the features of these software and suggests improvements based on these tests. Information about the features of different simulation software stated in this study are based on the versions available at the time of study which is from 6/11/18 till 12/05/18 and is an objective account by the authors on the software capabilities. The experimental approach provided an in-depth understanding of the comparative strengths and weaknesses of these software.",

Characterizing these mechanical and morphological changes would help explain macro-scale lattice behavior. Individual stainless steel (SS316L) and titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) laser PBF struts were built at 20°, 40°, 70° and 90° to the build platform, with 3 designed diameters and tested in uniaxial tension (n = 5). Micro-CT was used to quantify changes in surface roughness, eccentricity and cross-section. Average elastic modulus was 61.5 GPa and 37.5 GPa for SS316L and Ti6Al4V respectively, less than the bulk material. Yield strength was uniform over build angle for SS316L, but for Ti6Al4V varied from 40% to 98% of the bulk value from 20° to 90° build angles. All lower angle struts had worse morphology, with higher roughness and less circular cross-sections. These data should help inform micro-lattice design, especially in safety critical applications where lower mechanical performance must be compensated for.",

    "abstract": "Electron beam powder bed fusion (E-PBF) can produce nickel-based superalloy components with minimal cracking and post-processing. This is due to the reduced thermal gradients and high print temperatures accessible through innovative beam scanning strategies compared to other AM processes. However, variations in thermal signature along the build direction inherent in alloys printed using E-PBF can drive significant changes in the microstructure and associated mechanical properties. In this work, through complementary local property measurements we observed a 127 – 145% increase in mean elastic modulus and 7–9% increase in mean hardness, as a function of build height, of an as-fabricated non-weldable Ni-based superalloy, Inconel 738. These properties were attributed primarily to variations in the γ′ character with build height, revealed through a multi-scale microstructural characterisation. The results highlight the influence of the thermal signatures on the microstructural-property relationships of E-PBF Inconel 738.",

In the present work, oxidation effects in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing of the aluminium alloy AW4043/AlSi5(wt%) were investigated. Two main oxidation effects, the surface oxidation on aluminium parts and the oxidation anomalies in aluminium parts were observed and analysed. The surface oxidation on aluminium parts changed its colour during Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing from transparent to white. In the present work, it was shown by high-speed imaging that this change in the surface oxidation took place in the process zone, which was covered by inert gas. Since the white surface oxidation formed in an inert gas atmosphere, it was found that the arc interacts with the existing amorphous oxide layer of the previously deposited layer and turns it into a white duplex (crystalline and amorphous) oxide layer. In addition to the analysis of the white surface oxidation, oxidation anomalies, which occur at low shielding from the environment, were investigated. It was shown by physical experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, that these oxidation anomalies occur at inadequate gas flow rates, too big nozzle-to-work distances, process modes with too high heat input, or too high wire feed rates. Finally, a monitoring method based on light emission spectroscopy was used to detect oxidation anomalies as they create peaks in the spectral emission when they occur.",

    "abstract": "A unique and efficient semi-analytic method is presented for quickly predicting the three-dimensional thermal field produced by conduction from a heat source moving along an arbitrary path. A Green's function approach is used to decouple the solution at each time step into the analytical source contribution and a conduction contribution. The latter is solved numerically using efficient Gaussian convolution algorithms. This decoupling allows for boundary conditions on side boundaries to be satisfied numerically and lowers computational expenses by allowing calculations to be localized around the heat source. The thermal field resulting from arbitrary scan paths is constructed using analytical solutions for elementary linear segments. With focus on efficiency, a novel approach is used to store the calculated analytical line solutions for reuse on multiple other path segments. The results of various scan patterns are presented and successfully verified against finite element simulations. The computational times of predictions are shown to be faster than the corresponding finite element simulation by an order of magnitude with less than 1% average error. Given its ability to quickly predict the thermal history and changes in melt pool geometry due to arbitrary scan paths, this method provides a potentially powerful tool for exploration and optimization of laser powder bed fusion processes.",

Rheological properties and the ability of ceramic feedstocks to be processed into filaments and shaped by the fused deposition modeling/filament (FDM/FFF) technique were investigated. The addition of stearic acid affects the viscosity as a function of shear rate in a complex way. Analysis with rheological models shows that while using a small amount of stearic acid, a viscosity plateau at low shear rate (cross model) can be observed. At high stearic acid content, a yield point (Herschel-Bulkley model) occurs, as the stearic acid content surpasses the amount needed to cover the powder surface. The stearic acid also influences the properties of the solidified filament, making it more brittle and less flexible. Thin wall structures were printed, debinded and sintered to demonstrate the shape stability and fusion between the layers. Ring-on-ring bending tests of sintered discs show that the printing defects are the primary concerns that determine the strength of sintered samples.",

Three different laser heat sources are considered: a simple ellipsoid, a double ellipsoid, and a cylindrical source with a parabolic penetration curve. The comparison between simulated and experimental results allows to verify the role of radiation loss and symmetric/asymmetric enhanced thermal conductivity on the cooling evolution.

Geometric features incorporated include but are not limited to X- and Y-distances; varying angle walls; horizontal holes; and vertical features including round holes, concentric hollow cylinders, protruding cylinders, square channels, thin wall thicknesses, freeform surface, and slots. Select features are based on standardized ISO/ASTM test artifact geometry. Additional features were included that are of interest for various aerospace or industrial applications and to understand practical limitations of various machine configurations. All the features are designed and located to be visually and geometrically accessible for inspection without removal from the base plate and to have high probability for successful printing among L-PBF platforms. Features from each of the 16 build plates were measured using optical and mechanical measurement methods and data compiled for a detailed evaluation of each feature.

The mechanical properties of WAAM components are greatly dependent on the solidification behavior and microstructure. In this paper, a model composed of a macroscopic finite element (FE) model combined with a microscopic phase field (PF) model was constructed to investigate the Al alloy microstructure evolution during WAAM. First, the FE model was implemented to calculate the temperature gradient and solidification speed under different processing parameters. These results were then fed into the PF model to simulate the microstructure and concentration field of chemical compositions. The simulated results indicate that the moving speed of the substrate has a pronounced impact on the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS), which grew significantly as the moving speed increased, while the PDAS decreased slightly upon increasing the electric current. Furthermore, the solute distribution analysis showed that micro-segregation formed during the solidification process, and that current and substrate speed had evident impact on the micro-segregation ratio. Finally, metallographic experiments, energy-dispersive spectrometer analysis for element distribution, and miniature tensile tests were conducted on the specimens to validate the PF simulated results and obtain the relationship between process parameters and mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "Damping mechanisms are a crucial factor for influencing the vibration behavior of dynamic systems. In many applications vibrations are undesirable and need to be reduced by appropriate measures. For instance, vibrations in vehicles can reduce driving comfort or in civil engineering resonance damage can occur in constructions. An interesting and cost-effective way of increasing damping is particle damping. In modern processes of additive manufacturing, like laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), unmelted powder can be left inside a structure on purpose after making and thus producing integrated particle dampers already. Additively manufactured particle damping has not yet reached the industrial level because there are no detailed specifications for the design process. This includes the modeling of (non-linear) dynamic properties, based on numerous design parameters. The state of the art reveals that the effect of particle damping has been convincingly demonstrated, but transferability of the obtained information is still limited. In this paper the effect of particle damping is investigated experimentally with LPBF manufactured beam structures made of AlSi10Mg. Particle damping is evaluated in terms of performance curves for different beam parameter sets. The aim is to help the designer, who needs to keep amplitudes in certain range to estimate the damping of the potential particle damper via the given performance curves. Damping is determined via experimental modal analysis by impulse excitation. The response is evaluated in the frequency domain using the Circle-Fit method with a focus on the beams first bending mode of vibration. Beyond that, a significantly increased damping could be verified up to the seventh bending mode covering a frequency range between 600 Hz and 18k Hz. Damping through particle-filled cavities shows up to 20 times higher damping compared to the same component with fused powder.",

Computed Axial Lithography (CAL) is a photopolymerization-based tomographic VAM process which constructs objects by projecting systematic illumination patterns into a container of photosensitive prepolymer as it rotates. This technique is used to demonstrate the manufacturing of parts that faithfully adhere to respective target geometries. A principled optimization approach is used to generate the illumination patterns by penalizing 3D dose constraint violations and is demonstrated to achieve better performance than a heuristic dose matching technique. 3D objects are experimentally fabricated using CAL, and excellent fidelity to target design is demonstrated on diverse exemplary geometries. Imperfections between design and resulting print are experimentally characterized using laser scanning measurements. Deviations below 1.05 mm are achieved (max standard deviation = 0.22 mm, absolute max mean deviation = 0.15 mm) on complex objects with extent of 20–40 mm that are all fabricated volumetrically in minutes.",

    "abstract": "Binder jetting additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising process to print hydroxyapatite (HA) powder into bone tissue implants. However, one challenge remaining is the poor reactivity between HA powder with standard water-based ink. This study investigated different water-soluble adhesives to increase the 3D printability of HA powder. Maltodextrin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) with low and high molecular weight (MW) were blended with HA from 10 to 30 wt%. Powder characterisation and evaluation of the compressive properties and geometrical accuracy of the 3D printed scaffolds were performed to identify the optimal adhesive powder. This study adopted an image registration technique to quantify the geometrical accuracy of the final 3D printed scaffold in a more comprehensive and representative way than conventionally dimensional measurement. With these approaches, a highly promising binder jetting formulation has been developed via mixing HA powder with 30 wt% PVOH (high MW). Samples manufactured from this formulation successfully achieved a geometrical accuracy greater than 85% and an excellent green compressive strength of 5.63 ± 0.27 MPa, which was 500% higher than the commercial binder jetting powder. This is the first study to demonstrate a high level of printability when using a formulation containing ≥ 70 wt% HA powder and a water-based binder in the binder jetting AM process. Using the optimal powder composition developed in this study could potentially improve the structural, mechanical, and biological performances of HA-based 3D scaffolds manufactured using the binder jetting AM process for bone tissue engineering applications.",

In this study, casting solidification condition was mimicked, and in situ recrystallization was promoted in EB-PBF to facilitate columnar-to-equiaxed grain structure transition in Alloy 718. This is achieved via a unique linear melting strategy coupled with a specific selection of process parameters in EB-PBF. It was found that site-specific melting using line order number (LON) function affected the cooling rate and temperature gradient, which controlled grain morphology and texture. A high LON resulted in a large equiaxed grain zone with a random texture, whereas a fixed LON with a high areal energy density led to a strong texture. The main driving force in the formation of cracks and shrinkage defects during the transition was investigated. A high LON at a fixed areal energy density reduced the average total shrinkage defects and crack length. The hardness was decreased through the transition, which was linked to the reduction in the size of the γ″ precipitates.",

    "abstract": "Depending on the application, establishing a strategy for selecting the type of powder bed fusion technology—from electron beam (EB-PBF) or laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF)—is important. In this study, we focused on the β-type Ti–15Mo–5Zr–3Al alloy (expected for hard-tissue implant applications) as a model material, and we examined the variations in the microstructure, crystallographic texture, and resultant mechanical properties of specimens fabricated by L-PBF and EB-PBF. Because the melting mode transforms from the conduction mode to the keyhole mode with an increase in the energy density in L-PBF, the relative density of the L-PBF-built specimen decreases at higher energy densities, unlike that of the EB-PBF-built specimen. Although both EB-PBF and L-PBF can obtain cubic crystallographic textures via bidirectional scanning with a 90° rotation in each layer, the formation mechanisms of the textures were found to be different. The <100> texture in the build direction is mainly derived from the vertically grown columnar cells in EB-PBF, whereas it is derived from the vertically and horizontally grown columnar cells in L-PBF. Consequently, different textures were developed via bidirectional scanning without rotation in each layer: the <110> and <100> aligned textures along the build direction in L-PBF and EB-PBF, respectively. The L-PBF-built specimen exhibited considerably better ductility, but slightly lower strength than the EB-PBF-built specimen, under the conditions of the same crystallographic texture and relative density. We attributed this to the variation in the microstructures of the specimens; the formation of the α-phase was completely absent in the L-PBF-built specimen. The results demonstrate the importance of properly selecting the two technologies according to the material and its application.",

In this present study, the effects of hot isostatic pressing, as well as heat treatment on the microstructure, phase configuration and mechanical properties of laser powder bed fused (LPBF) IN718 superalloy were systematically investigated. Three different post-processes were studied such as hot isostatic pressing (HIP), heat treatment (HT), and HIP followed by HT (HIP+HT). The HIP process effectively eliminated the Laves phase remained in the as-built microstructure and brought uniformly distributed super fine γ″ precipitates in nano-meter size. In the heat-treated microstructure, larger γ″ precipitates were promoted directly from the as-built material. In comparison the HIP+HT process caused a moderate growth of γ″. In the latter two cases, the developed γ″ significantly strengthened the material. Yield strength of IN718 was increased from 738 MPa in as-built condition to 1015 MPa and 1184 MPa after HT and HIP+HT, respectively. On the contrary the ductility in the as-built IN718 condition was reduced by more than 40% after HT and HIP+HT. This can be compared to an increase in the ductility by almost 30% when subjected the as-built specimens to only HIPping. Finally, the correlation between microstructure evolution and mechanical properties is discussed in detail.",

The aim of this study was to compare the crystallisation kinetics, morphology, and mechanical properties of two different PAEK polymers used in fused filament fabrication (FFF), i.e. the fast crystallising PEEK151 (poly ether ether ketone) grade originally designed for injection moulding and the slow crystallising AM 200 grade tailored specifically for FFF. The crystallisation kinetics of both grades were examined across a wide temperature range. A method to select annealing temperatures and annealing times based on the intrinsic crystallisation behaviour of each polymer was proposed. The dual-Avrami model highlighted a different crystallite growth for AM 200 in comparison with PEEK151 with a higher rate of secondary crystallisation. Lamellar thicknesses were measured by SAXS and calculated via the Thomson-Gibbs equation. The lamellar thicknesses of primary and secondary crystallisation for AM 200 showed a stronger temperature dependence with steeper slopes when increasing the isothermal temperature. The benefit of using a slow crystallising PAEK polymer over the conventional fast crystallising grades is evidenced by the improvement in Z strength which enhances the overall isotropy of printed parts.",

Its additive nature has made it possible to create interlocking parts in a single production step. This creates opportunities for new ways of designing and producing mechanisms, which do not need to be assembled after production, called non-assembly mechanisms. Non-assembly mechanisms are different from traditional mechanisms, since they show an unprecedented integration between geometry, material and structure. In this review, by means of a systematic literature search the current state-of-the-art of non-assembly mechanisms is reviewed and analyzed based on the challenges encountered in their design and production. The found examples were categorized according to types of mechanism that have similar production considerations. Per category is discussed what the challenges and opportunities are for the design of non-assembly mechanisms. This review aims to provide a helpful overview of best-practice examples that can be used as inspiration for further development of innovative non-assembly mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "IN718 is the most common Ni-based superalloy for manufacturing aircraft engine parts via thermo-mechanical treatments. The evolution of nanoscale strengthening phases is well researched, enabling optimization of strength, fatigue, and creep properties. Recently, IN718 has shown great viability for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing of aerospace parts. However, the detailed microstructure-property relationships during thermal profiles typical to LPBF are not yet well understood. Previous works reported interdendritic precipitation of Laves phase. These detrimental particles can be dissolved by heat treatments, however, the detailed nanoscale phase evolution remains unknown. Using atom probe microscopy, we report on the detailed morphological and chemical evolution of phases in IN718 after LPBF with chessboard versus meander scanning strategies, and direct ageing versus homogenization and ageing treatments. Due to differences in scanning vector length, up to 3.6 times larger dendritic structures, double volume fractions of Laves particles, and Al clusters are found in the chessboard strategy. Coarser matrix grains and a higher dislocation density are detected in the meander strategy. The precise chemical composition and morphology evolution of the matrix, Laves, MC, γ′, and γ′′ phases are obtained and correlated to hardness. Retained Laves phase after direct ageing causes precipitation of 4% volume fraction of γ′′, with additional coarsened precipitates formed along dislocations. Direct ageing leads to an increase in hardness corresponding to roughly 190 HV. Due to Laves phase dissolution, a volume fraction of 16% of compositionally stable, larger γ′′ precipitates is found after homogenization and ageing, also causing partial matrix recrystallization.",

    "abstract": "To elucidate the possibility of controlling the microstructure and mechanical properties of Al–Si alloys additive-manufactured by laser powder bed fusion (L–PBF), the relationship among the laser conditions, microstructural characteristics (crystal grain, cellular microstructure, and solute Si in α-Al matrix), and tensile properties of L–PBF manufactured AlSi12 alloy samples was investigated. The crystal grain size and fraction of <001> oriented α-Al crystal grains toward the building direction increased as the laser power became higher and scanning velocity became slower. The width of cellular microstructure (sub–cell size) where the primary α-Al phase was surrounded by α-Al/Si eutectic microstructure increased as the laser power became higher and scanning velocity became slower. The refinement of microstructure was attributed to the solidification under high cooling rate, which was achieved by low laser power and high scanning velocity. The area fraction of Si phase analyzed from FE–SEM images tended to decrease as the laser power became higher and scanning velocity became slower, suggesting the possibility of solute Si concentration in α-Al matrix controlled by laser conditions. The STEM/EDS analysis revealed high concentration of solute Si in the α-Al matrix (above a solubility limit of 1.5 mol% in the Al–Si binary system) of L–PBF manufactured AlSi12 alloy samples and its concentration became higher in the sample manufactured using a higher laser power. The tensile tests of as–built AlSi12 specimens fabricated under various laser conditions were also performed. High strength and high ductility tended to be achieved when high power laser was applied in slow laser scanning velocity. The 0.2% proof stress was relatively higher when the laser scanning velocity was faster. The mechanical properties correlated with crystal grain size and sub–cell size rather than solute Si in the α-Al matrix. These results provide new insights to control mechanical performance of AlSi12 alloy via L–PBF processing parameters.",

    "abstract": "The demand for optical components such as microlenses has been growing at a rapid rate in recent years. While conventional methods for manufacturing these components are well known, they are often time-consuming, detrimental for the environment and unable to keep up with the increasing demand. To overcome these issues, the technique of three-dimensional (3D) inkjet printing has attracted much attention. The aim of this review was to investigate the 3D inkjet printing process as a technique for the fabrication of microlenses and identify the key components and methodologies which can be used to control the properties of the resultant microlenses. 3D Inkjet printing was identified as a viable alternative for the production of microlenses owing to its high flexibility, scalability and efficiency as well as its ability to produce good quality products. Substrate modification was shown as a key method by which the geometric and optical properties of microlenses can be controlled. Organic materials such as acrylates and epoxies, and hybrid materials such as siloxanes were shown to be the most common base materials in photo-crosslinkable inkjet formulations and the effects of incorporation of organic compounds and inorganic nanoparticles on the material refractive index were studied.",

    "abstract": "When tungsten is processed by laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, the combination of high residual stresses and tungsten's inherent ductile-to-brittle transition leads to a network of microcracks. While preheating is widely accepted as the most efficient way to reduce residual stresses in additively manufactured parts, thus far it has proven ineffective in completely eliminating microcracking in tungsten. In addition to preheating, changing the alloy composition is an increasingly popular approach to circumvent cracking. This work utilizes in situ high-speed optical imaging combined with thermomechanical modeling to elucidate the effect of preheating and alloying with 2 wt% rare earth oxides on the cracking behavior in powderless single track and hatch strategy laser scans. Optical imaging reveals two distinct cracking mechanisms in the fusion zone and the heat affected zone, both of which are eliminated by substrate preheating temperatures of 773–873 K. Due to the lower melting point of the rare earth oxide inclusions, the melt behavior becomes more turbulent and processing parameters need to be adjusted accordingly, but the cracking characteristics remained the same. The response to preheating was similar for both pure tungsten and the alloys tested in this study; there was no beneficial effect of the alloy additions. This work shows that the fundamental metallurgical cause of microcracking in tungsten can be circumvented, in a step towards structural applications of additively manufactured tungsten.",

    "abstract": "Dross formation is a phenomenon that is observed while printing metallic components using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) and occurring primarily at down-facing surfaces that are unsupported and suffer inadequate heat removal. Naturally, dross formation causes dimensional inaccuracy, high surface roughness and also adversely affects the mechanical properties of printed components. Through simulation and experimentation, this study fundamentally elucidates the driving phenomenon behind dross formation. The simulation results, in terms of the degree of generated dross domain, well agree with the ones observed in the printed samples and the behaviour of the melt pool while moving from bulk material to the powder domain is clearly depicted in this study. The simulations show that due to the low thermal conductivity of loose powder and the inability to conduct heat away, the quasi steady state melt pool collapses while entering the powder domain and transitions to a keyhole-like melt mode which causes a pronounced drilling effect. This causes excessive melting known as dross that is seen both in the simulation and the experimental parts. This work also shows through simulation and experimentation the reasoning behind the production of larger and smaller dross domains while printing with high and low laser energy densities respectively. Additionally, through SEM imagery this study also explains the observed deep internal grooves and near-surface porosity that are present within this dross domain which can further affect mechanical properties such as density, fatigue strength etc",

The effects of the pulse duration as well as the pulse energy on the melt pool size, solidification morphology and material properties have been investigated. The experiments have been carried out with a mode-locked fiber laser system delivering pulses from 500 fs up to 800 ps at a wavelength of 1030 nm. Comparative investigations have been performed using a continuous wave Yb-fiber laser operating at 1070 nm. The results show that the melt pool width is reduced at shorter pulse durations and higher repetition rates while maintaining the same average power. Additionally, keyhole melting is achieved in pulsed operation after exceeding the threshold fluence for single pulse ablation. In comparison to continuous wave radiation, powder bed fusion using ultra-short laser pulses leads to a more uniform melt pool shape with refined primary Si and eutectic structure that is accompanied with an improvement of the mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research work was to study the effect of the build direction and heat treatment on the anti-wear properties of maraging steel produced by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and how these properties correlate with the resulting mechanical properties. The investigation involved a commercial EOS laser power bed fusion system which included horizontal, vertical and inclined (45°) build directions. After the additive manufacturing the specimens were subjected to aging or solution treatment and aging, after which the wear and mechanical properties were evaluated in different build directions. The results show that even after aging build direction of AM maraging steel parts plays an important role in terms of mechanical and wear properties. After aging the interfacial features between the laser tracks tend to disappear, with the cellular sub-structures being broken into particles. However, although broken and diminished, the cellular sub-structure, defects, nano-segregations and a weak texture in the build direction are still present after aging. This results in lower strength and elastic properties as well as reduced resistance to crack initiation for vertical printing direction. On the other hand, it still provides superior resistance to crack propagation. Best combination of abrasive and adhesive wear is obtained for horizontal direction and in-plane sliding, while sliding across the layers is the most detrimental. Inclined printing bypasses anisotropy and provides good combination of high strength and toughness. However, it is inferior in terms of wear resistance. Properties anisotropy can also be eliminated by a solution treatment, which homogenizes the microstructure and improves toughness, but may also result in reduced strength and wear resistance.",

In this study, EB-DED of a near-α titanium alloy (Ti–6Al–2Zr–1Mo–1V) was conducted, and the effect of post-deposition single annealing treatment on the microstructure, texture, and anisotropy of the tensile properties was investigated. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy were employed to study the microstructure and texture characteristics. The tensile properties along the vertical (Z axis) and horizontal (Y axis) directions were evaluated at both room temperature and 500 °C. The results indicated that the prior β grains had a strong < 001 >β texture along the grain growth direction. Although the α variant selection occurred in some micro-regions, the overall α phase texture was weak. In terms of tensile properties, the vertical specimens exhibited lower strength but higher ductility than the horizontal specimens at both room and elevated temperatures. The anisotropic elongation results from the directional columnar prior β grains and continuous grain boundary α phase, which facilitated the intergranular cracking. The tensile strength and ductility were simultaneously enhanced by annealing at 950 °C for 2 h to meet the standard requirements for wrought counterparts. Moreover, the anisotropy of the tensile properties was decreased significantly. The enhanced and isotropic mechanical properties can be attributed to the combined effect of the bi-lamellar microstructure, discontinuous grain boundary α phase, and the weak α texture.",

    "abstract": "The laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the powder layer, including its thickness and thermal transport properties. This paper investigates in-situ characterization of the powder layer using thermographic inspection. A thermal camera monitors the temperature history of the powder surface immediately after a layer of new powder is deposited by the recoating system. During this process, thermal energy diffuses from the underlying solid part, eventually raising the temperature of the above powder layer. Guided by 1D modeling of this heat-up process, experiments show how the parameterized thermal history can be correlated with powder layer thickness and its thermal conductivity. A neural network, based on the parameterized thermal history, further improves the correlation after training. It is used to predict the part distortion for an unsupported structure. This method detects serious part distortion several layers before the part breaks through the powder layer and interacts with the recoater. This approach can be automated to prevent catastrophic recoater crashes or abrasion of soft wipers and has the potential to monitor local properties of the powder layer in-situ.",

    "abstract": "This work compares the mechanical and corrosion properties of 316L steel manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and post treated by Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) to wrought 316L. HIP is often used by default on LPBF components to reduce porosity and obtain the best mechanical properties, however, if the HIP temperatures are too high, there is a risk of reducing mechanical strength and corrosion resistance. The purpose of this work was to investigate the HIP parameters and understand the trade-off in properties. By choosing various HIP temperatures (700 °C, 1125 °C, 1200 °C), pressures (100 MPa, 137 MPa and 200 MPa) and hold times, optimal cycles were investigated based on the most favourable mechanical properties (density, hardness, tensile and low-cycle fatigue), and pitting corrosion resistance. Microstructural features associated with LPBF such as melt pools, melt pool boundaries and sub granular cells were observed. These features were found to disappear with longer and higher temperature treatments, accompanied by increased grain sizes. Low and mid temperature point HIP treatments resulted in higher ultimate tensile strength but lower fracture elongation. The decreasing hardness and tensile strength trends were consistent with decreased grain boundary strengthening and decreased dislocation strengthening (with disappearing sub grain boundary and granular cells). Only one HIP condition, consisting of a low temperature and medium pressure, produced samples that achieved runout under low cycle fatigue testing for both the lower and higher stresses. Despite this, most higher temperature HIP cycles reduced the fatigue resistance. This was again attributed to the coarsening of the microstructure at the higher temperature treatments. The spread of the pitting potentials of HIP treated samples was reduced by 52.46 % compared to the as-built material, although none were better overall compared to the wrought material. Of all the properties, porosity appears to play the most influential role on pitting corrosion, and to this extent, despite having a larger variation in results, some of the treated parts demonstrated improved pitting resistance and some demonstrated improved repassivation potentials compared to wrought 316L.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a powerful tool for additive manufacturing (AM) of metal components. However, fabricating components with overhanging features using LPBF remains a challenge. Overhangs suffer from dimensional inaccuracies, high surface roughness, and agglomerated material or dross. These parts often do not meet engineering requirements and are discarded and reprinted until requirements are met, or redesigned to avoid overhangs. Printing a flat overhang is especially challenging due to the long, unsupported powder bed that fosters material agglomeration and inhibits heat flux. Commercial LPBF machines use distinct laser parameters for the downskin layers in overhang regions. Downskin parameters for a given material are often selected by trial and error: printing many parts, changing the laser power and velocity parameters, as well as the number of layers to apply them. The impact of changing the laser parameters on the thermal history of a given layer and multiple layers is not well characterized or understood. This research uses thermal simulations, infrared (IR) imaging, and high-speed optical imaging to study the fabrication of flat overhang structures in 316L stainless steel. The thermal evolution of different downskin strategies on multiple layers is simulated with high fidelity thermal simulations and experimentally measured as the part is printed with carefully calibrated forward looking infrared (FLIR) imaging. Emissivity measurements are performed in a custom chamber under a range of conditions to accurately convert FLIR measurements to temperatures. The layer construction is also recorded with high-speed video to observe the powder bed, melt pool formation, and effects of material agglomeration. Parameter strategies that minimize layer-to-layer variations of the peak temperature, heating rate, and cooling rate are investigated to inform print conditions for overhang features.",

    "abstract": "High-cycle fatigue (R=0.1, room temperature) induced microstructural evolution in a laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additively manufactured quaternary CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) was studied. The as-built material exhibited a combined < 001 > and < 110 > texture and high proportion of low-angle boundaries. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that deformation twinning occurred under the high-cycle fatigue of σmax= 450 MPa (Nf=1.06 ×105), but not for the stress level of 300 MPa and 200 MPa. The deformation twins led to the cyclic softening, as manifested by the continuous increase of maximum strain under the stress-controlled fatigue, and the hardness increased by ∼80 HV0.2 in the post-fatigued condition. EBSD revealed that both the < 001 > and < 110 > orientations were favorable for the twin formation. Given that the size of grains with the < 001 > and < 110 > orientations was twice larger than those of the other orientations, the grain size effect on twin formation could play a certain role. High-resolution TEM revealed that the full dislocations, lattice distortion, stacking faults, and partial dislocations were associated with the twin, cellular and labyrinth wall-like dislocation structures. The underlying mechanism for the formation of nano-twins during high-stress fatigue involved the dissociation of 1/2 < 110 > full dislocations to 1/6 < 112 > partial ones. Moreover, the dislocation cell structure as observed in the as-built condition evolved into sub-grains after the high-cycle fatigue loading, with the immensely dense dislocations at the sub-grain boundary.",

    "abstract": "The rational design of bone-substituting biomaterials is relatively complex because they should meet a long list of requirements for optimal performance. Meta-biomaterials are micro-architected materials that hold great promise for meeting those requirements as they offer a unique combination of mechanical, mass-transport, and biological properties. There are, however, inherent couplings between the different types of properties of many such materials that make it impossible to simultaneously achieve all the design criteria. An example of such a coupling exists between the mechanical properties and the surface area. Strut-based, metallic meta-biomaterials are known to offer bone-mimicking mechanical properties, but they have limited surface area for cell adherence. Increasing the surface generally results in an undesirable increase in the mechanical properties that could lead to stress shielding. Here, we combine strut-based lattices with minimal surfaces to decouple these two properties. We added minimal surface patches to the designs of both auxetic and non-auxetic meta-biomaterials while minimizing their contribution to the mechanical properties of the resulting meta-biomaterials through the rational application of cuts or \"slits\". All designs were additively manufactured using selective laser melting and mechanically tested to obtain their quasi-static mechanical properties, including their Poisson's ratio, in two configurations. A finite element-based computational homogenization code was used to compute the elastic moduli and anisotropy of the structures. The results show that the minimal surface patches substantially increase the available surface area without significantly affecting the mechanical properties. Without the slits, the surfaces significantly affected the elastic modulus and deformation behavior of the meta-biomaterials. A similar strategy could be used to tune the biodegradation rate of biodegradable metals and the permeability of meta-biomaterials in general.",

    "abstract": "Drop-on-demand metal jetting is a promising additive manufacturing (AM) technology that is gaining interest due to its capability to directly print complex single and multi-material components at high resolutions. It also has key advantages over other metal AM techniques, such as avoiding powder handling and extensive post-processing. In this method, parts are built via spatially controlled deposition of individual molten droplets onto a substrate. Therefore, the success of the process entirely depends on the behaviour of these single droplets from deposition to solidification including their interactions with the substrate, which is scarcely investigated to date. To fill this research gap, the in-house MetalJet platform was used to investigate the spreading and solidification of metallic micro-droplets at low Weber numbers. This was undertaken onto various substrates using a range of jetting and substrate temperatures through an integrated experimental, analytical, and computational approach. This study reports that increasing the substrate temperature enhanced the diffusion between the droplet and substrate, hence improving the bonding. Moreover, ripples forming on a droplet's periphery during solidification disappeared at elevated substrate temperatures, resulting in improved inter-droplet bonding. Furthermore, the significant role of the substrate wettability and thermal properties, which control the droplet's dynamics and solidification behaviour, respectively, is elucidated. This highlights the importance of substrate material selection using this technology. The results presented in this article underpin the optimal process conditions under which the 3D structures produced with this technology can exhibit reliable integrity and consistency. This represents a step forward in the direct metal printing of high resolution functional multi-material components.",

    "abstract": "Beyond near-net shape manufacturing of parts with complex geometry, additive manufacturing (AM) makes it possible to fabricate materials with distinct, site-specific microstructures. This ability is unique to AM and enables the design of architected materials that were previously unattainable. Here, we leverage this strategy to encode data into metal parts using the microstructure as the medium to store information. We use a novel laser scanning technique to control the local solidification conditions during laser powder bed fusion and embed a linear barcode and Quick Response (QR) code into stainless steel 316 L. The codes use blocks of different crystallographic texture–i.e., regions in which the crystal lattice of most grains is aligned towards a preferred orientation–as the data “bits”. The data may be retrieved by analytical techniques that are sensitive to local microstructure variations. As a demonstration, we decode the barcodes by measuring the scattering of optical light from their etched surface using a technique called directional reflectance microscopy. The resulting texture maps are readable by conventional barcode scanners, such as those found on mobile phones. The ability to embed data has significant potential in fields such as law enforcement, biomedicine, and transportation, where permanent, damage-resistant tracking is essential.",

    "abstract": "The microstructure of products manufactured by selective laser sintering (SLS) is known to be highly dependent on various process and material parameters. The latter thus also affect the final part properties. While most work has focused on ex-situ characterization of the printed parts, little is known about the time-dependent microstructure development during sintering. In this work, we present direct observations of the microstructural evolution during laser sintering of polyamide 12 (PA12) particle doublets by in-situ synchrotron wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), using our in-house developed laser sintering setup. Simultaneously, the neck growth between the particles and the temperature are captured via optical and infrared microscopy. We show that isothermal crystallization experiments under quiescent conditions are not sufficient to describe crystallization in a non-isothermal process like SLS. The enhanced crystallization kinetics in small particles suggests that both temperature and flow play a role. This finding was corroborated by the critical Weissenberg numbers estimated from rheological reptation and Rouse time scales. Furthermore, a microstructure survey has been carried out by microtoming thin slices of the sintered doublets. Both optical and atomic force microscopy reveal significant differences in the crystalline structure of the laser-affected zone as compared to the un-sintered region.",

In the present work, we tune the austenite reversion and nanoscale precipitation during post heat treatment and achieve an excellent combination of strength and ductility (ultimate tensile strength ~1340 MPa and uniform elongation ~10.5 %). The structural evolution is studied through computational thermodynamics, electron microscopy, in situ small-angle neutron scattering, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The as-built microstructure is composed of mainly martensite and retained austenite (~30 vol%) together with a minor fraction of δ-ferrite, M23C6, Nb(C, N), spherical and ellipsoidal Cu precipitates and some inclusions. The presence of these phases cannot be fully predicted by the Scheil-Gulliver model due to the complicated thermal history and non-homogenous elemental distribution. The reverted austenite formed during the post heat treatments has high stability and fine grain size (~1 µm), which contributes to the excellent ductility, while the nanoscale precipitation hardening contributes to the achieved high strength.",

    "abstract": "Producing lightweight structures with high weight-specific strength and stiffness, self-healing abilities, and recyclability, is highly attractive for engineering applications such as aerospace, biomedical devices, and smart robots. Most self-healing polymer systems used to date for mechanical components lack 3D printability and satisfactory load-bearing capacity. Here, we report a new self-healable polymer composite for Digital Light Processing 3D Printing, by combining two monomers with distinct mechanical characteristics. It shows a desirable and superior combination of properties among 3D printable self-healing polymers, with tensile strength and elastic modulus up to 49 MPa and 810 MPa, respectively. Benefiting from dual dynamic bonds between the linear chains, a healing efficiency of above 80% is achieved after heating at a mild temperature of 60 °C without additional solvents. Printed objects are also endowed with multi-materials assembly and recycling capabilities, allowing robotic components to be easily reassembled or recycled after failure. Mechanical properties and deformation behaviour of printed composites and lattices can be tuned significantly to suit various practical applications by altering formulation. Lattice structures with three different architectures were printed and tested in compression: honeycomb, re-entrant, and chiral. They can regain their structural integrity and stiffness after damage, which is of great value for robotic applications. This study extends the performance space of composites, providing a pathway to design printable architected materials with simultaneous mechanical robustness/healability, efficient recoverability, and recyclability.",

    "abstract": "High energy input additive manufacturing (AM) such as wire-based directed energy deposition technologies are capable of high deposition rates but can result in coarse microstructures along with potentially large defects such as gas porosity. The presence of defects and the adverse effect on mechanical properties is further exacerbated when low-quality or contaminated feedstock materials are used. This work demonstrates a pathway for producing high-quality additively manufactured products with low-quality feedstock materials that ordinarily would be considered unsuitable for use and relegated to scrap. A large number of macropores up to and exceeding 2 mm in diameter are intentionally introduced using a contaminated wire feedstock in a novel metastable β-Ti alloy (Ti-22V-4Al). Following super transus hot isostatic pressing (HIPing), it was found that porosity free parts with reduced texture, refined grain size and excellent ductility (exceeding 32% elongation to failure) can be obtained. Such improvement is achieved by eliminating pore defects while forming fine equiaxed grains through dynamic recrystallisation within the pore region. This approach to producing AM products with desirable microstructures and mechanical properties from low-quality feedstock materials is applicable to a wide variety of metallic alloys produced by other AM techniques and can be used to engineer completely homogenous equiaxed grain microstructures.",

    "abstract": "Since its introduction in the 1980s, 3D printing has advanced as a versatile and reliable tool with applications in different fields. Among the available 3D printing techniques, two-photon polymerization is regarded as one of the most promising technologies for microscale printing due to its ability to combine a high printing fidelity down to submicron scale with free-form structure design. Recently, the technology has been enhanced through the implementation of faster laser scanning strategies, as well as the development of new photoresists. This paves the way for a wide range of applications, which has resulted in an increasing number of available commercial systems. This work aims to provide an overview of the technology capability by comparing three commercial systems in a round-robin test. To cover a wide range of applications, six test structures with distinct features were designed, covering various aspects of interest, from single material objects with sub-micron feature sizes up to multi-material millimeter-sized objects. Application-specific structures were printed to evaluate surface roughness and the stitching capability of the printers. Moreover, the ability to generate free-hanging structures and complex surfaces required for cell scaffolds and microfluidic platform fabrication was quantitatively investigated. Finally, the influence of the numerical aperture of the fabrication objective on the printing quality was assessed. All three printers successfully fabricated samples comprising various three-dimensional features and achieved submicron resolution and feature sizes, demonstrating the versatility and precision of two-photon polymerization direct laser writing. Our study will facilitate the understanding of the technology maturity level, while highlighting specific aspects that characterize each of the investigated systems.",

    "abstract": "The Laser Power Bed Fusion (LPBF) process is of high interest to many industries, such as motors and vehicles, robotics, biomedical applications, aerospace, and others. LPBF workpieces can indeed achieve near full density and high resistance. However, a large amount of pore formation, in conjunction with the probabilistic nature of defect formation, results in a lack of process repeatability and reproducibility. This limits the range of industrial applications requiring high quality and defect free workpieces. To overcome this issue, we developed an acoustic monitoring system able to classify with high confidence three processing regimes ( lack of fusion pores, conduction mode, keyhole pores) using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) . For the first time, we infer the processing regime based on AE waves produced during the LPBF process for conditions that are new and not part of the training database (>96%). The choice of processing conditions used in the database (training sets) is discussed in details, looking at the influence of their number, relative normalized distance, and position in the processing map on the classification accuracy. We found that the higher the number of processing conditions in the database, the higher the classification accuracies. Moreover, the higher the relative normalized \"distance\" between training and testing sets (measured in terms of laser speed and power), the lower the classification accuracies. Finally, the threshold defining the minimum number of training processing conditions is identified as eight to obtain a robust model able to identify the processing regimes for new laser parameters within the processing map. This number can be lowered to six if the training sets are in the surrounding region of the testing set. When one process parameter (speed, power, or normalized enthalpy) is constant between all the training and the testing sets, only four parameter sets allow a high classification accuracy (>88%). These results demonstrate the potential of in situ acoustic emission for monitoring the additive manufacturing process, in particular when the process conditions may deviate from the conduction mode. Finally, for a well-chosen set of training conditions, the model is able to construct a full processing map without additional experiments.",

    "abstract": "Melt electrowriting (MEW) is a distinct class of additive manufacturing technologies that generates fibrous and porous macrostructures with microscale resolution from an electrically charged molten polymer. The high-resolution scaffolds produced by MEW have been primarily used for tissue engineering, cancer research, biofabrication and biomaterials. Unfortunately, the commercial MEW device's prohibitive affordability and lack of standardization of custom devices, represent obstacles to further research. Built on the achievements and affordability of material extrusion 3D printers, we convert an open-source Voron 0.1 printer into a highly capable MEW device, termed as MEWron. To guarantee availability, the use of commercial and affordable components is prioritized, while in the cases where this has not been possible, 3D printed, and easy-to-machine components have been employed. Two main approaches have been followed, the first one focused on the existing material extrusion configuration (i.e., filament-based feeding system and material input) while the second one focuses on a conventional MEW pneumatic feeding system and syringe reservoir. When not including the high voltage supply, both approaches have a final budget below $1000. The manuscript describes all required steps and components to modify a Voron 0.1 printer and provides the computer-aided design (CAD) for required custom components reproduction. Moreover, the MEWron devices' reliability is demonstrated, as well as their potential to extend the MEW field boundaries. We believe that the open-source MEWron device will facilitate unprecedented MEW technology accessibility using a well-established and modifiable platform.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) can be potentially used for producing patient-specific biomedical devices based on micro struts such as cardiovascular stents. NiTi alloys are an appealing choice for their superelastic behaviour, while their processing with PBF-LB poses several challenges. The final component is expected to have the correct transition temperature and mechanical properties along with an acceptable surface finish. All of these properties require a complete manufacturing cycle from PBF-LB for the production of the geometrical form, to the heat treatment for the adjustment of the mechanical properties, and finally to the chemical etching for the reduction of surface roughness. Therefore this work studies a complete manufacturing cycle composed of PBF-LB process parameters, heat treatment recipes, and chemical etching conditions for producing NiTi micro struts with superelastic behaviour. Transition temperature measurements and tensile tests were applied to verify the influence of each manufacturing process on the material properties using ad-hoc designed micro strut geometries. The results showed previously unreported tensile superelasticity with micro struts at the end of the manufacturing cycle, once the PBF-LB process parameters were correctly selected, followed by heat treatment and chemical etching stages. The determined additive manufacturing chain was then used to produce demonstrator stent mesh with variable diameter and 130 µm strut thickness.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the stability of deformable layers produced by material extrusion additive manufacturing. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is developed to predict the deposition flow of viscoplastic materials such as ceramic pastes, thermosets, and concrete. The viscoplastic materials are modelled with the Bingham rheological equations and implemented with a generalized Newtonian fluid model. The developed CFD model applies a scalar approach to differentiate the rheology of two layers in order to capture the deposition of a wet layer onto a semi solidified printed layer (i.e., wet-on-semisolid printing). The semi solidification is modelled by a yield stress buildup. The cross-sectional shapes of the deposited layers are predicted, and the relative deformation of the first layer is studied for different yield stress buildups and processing conditions such as printing- and extrusion-speed, layer height, and nozzle diameter. The results of the CFD model illustrate that the relative deformation of the first layer decreases non-linearly with an increase in yield stress, and that stable prints can be obtained when taking into account the semi solidification. Furthermore, it is found that the deformation is dependent on a non-trivial interplay between the extrusion pressure, the shape of the cross-section, and the contact area between the layers. Finally, the results highlight which process conditions can be changed with benefit in order to limit the requirement on the yield stress buildup and still provide stable prints.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that the strongly location-dependent microstructures observed in metal parts made using additive manufacturing (AM) processes differ from those found in components produced via traditional manufacturing processes. This is primarily because the microstructures in AM parts strongly depend on spatially-varying cooling rates that are caused by several factors including part geometry and proximity to the build plate. Consequently, it is necessary to take a fresh look into methods used for calculating resulting mechanical properties, as the increased spatial resolution that must be applied to the description of properties of AM parts calls for vast improvements in computational efficiency. Computational homogenization methods are employed for the calculation of these mechanical properties based on the polycrystalline microstructures typically encountered in metallic materials. Such calculations that enable the description of properties as a function of position increase the accuracy of a vital link in the structure–process–property–performance continuum that falls within the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) paradigm. In this work we describe and critically review six of these methods and their application to AM microstructures. We find that the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method and the Finite Element Method (FEM) are the optimal choices based on several factors including accuracy, efficiency, and applicability to polycrystalline microstructures. Provided the microstructure is amenable to the use of uniform grids and the assumption of periodic boundary conditions, the FFT method has greater computational efficiency. Where unstructured meshes, adaptive remeshing and/or non-periodic boundary conditions are desired, the FEM is the method of choice. Our recommendations are equally applicable to functionally graded AM parts where site-specific microstructures are engineered using multiple materials or different process parameters. They can also be utilized for other material systems and circumstances where increased accuracy is achieved by describing mechanical properties as a function of location.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work is the implementation of a novel non-planar slicing algorithm, capable of combining traditional planar layers with non-planar ones. The geometry to be reconstructed will consist of an inner volume made of planar layers, and an outer shell made of non-planar layers. Both planar and non-planar layers are in turn constituted by an outer region, the shell, and an inner region, the infill. The outer non-planar shell guarantees an enhancement in the aesthetic properties and electro-mechanical behaviour of the printed objects, as well as a better adhesion when directly built onto a complex geometry. The algorithm was tested on three different three-dimensional models usable for aerospace, electronics, and biomedical applications showing robust results. An experimental validation was carried out by using a 5-axis robotic printer equipped with an extrusion-based printing unit. Different structures combining planar and non-planar paths were printed onto complex substrates, as well as into a bone defect that was completely regenerated following the proposed approach. The comparison between our method and the existing non-planar slicing methods revealed several advantages such as the capacity to generate both top and bottom non-planar surfaces, the possibility to manage complex concave/undercut structures, as well as the option to directly register the planned printing path on the receiving substrate in the working environment. To ensure proper and easy use, a graphical user interface was also created.",

    "abstract": "In laser-based powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M), the laser beam shape significantly influences the temperature distribution and melt pool dimensions. Recent advances in beam shaping technology allow for more flexibility in changing the laser beam profile in time and space. For example, ring-shaped and top-hat beam profiles can improve the process efficiency and product quality compared to common Gaussian beam profiles, as they distribute the heat input over a larger area. Non-rotationally symmetric beam shapes are more interesting for homogeneous temperature fields to reduce effects such as spatter formation due to Marangoni flow. Developing new beam profiles by iterative adjustments and repeated experiments is costly, time-consuming, and often not feasible. The presented contribution automates this process using numerical optimization, complementing the experiments with computer simulations that are based on a thermal model with nonlinear material parameters. The optimization uses a gradient-based approach combined with the adjoint state method to compute the sensitivities. The presented inversion framework is verified by choosing the temperature field resulting from a Gaussian beam shape as an optimization target and it is demonstrated that it recovers the original Gaussian shape after only a few iterations. Then, an application of the method is demonstrated by computing an axisymmetric beam shape that corresponds to a melt pool in conduction mode. The model is validated by comparing the computed melt pool shapes to experimentally evaluated melt track cross-sections, where a good agreement is obtained. Finally, the flexibility of the optimization framework is demonstrated by showing optimized laser beam shapes without the axisymmetric constraint of the previous example.",

    "abstract": "Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an engineering material widely used in packaging and cosmetics, given its excellent mechanical properties, water resistance and recyclability. PET is typically manufactured by injection blow molding but its use in additive manufacturing (AM) is not spread enough due to its (semi)crystalline behavior, which makes it difficult to process by Material Extrusion (ME) technologies. Alternatively, polyethylene terephthalate glycol copolymer (PETG), a fully amorphous material, is used in these technologies. However, PETG has worse mechanical properties than PET. In this context, this work studies the viability of different commercial PET by ME for Large Format Additive Manufacturing (LFAM). While PET for general purposes (PET1 and PET2) could not be printed, a marketable PET for thick-walled products (PET3) allowed to manufacture different objects by ME-LFAM with good dimensional accuracy. DSC and XRD studies evidenced that its slow crystallizing behavior was key to obtaining a proper flow and a successful printing. Young's modulus and tensile strength of PET3 was significantly higher than those of PETG, both from this work and in previous reports found in the literature, since it remains semicrystalline after printing. This allows expanding the library of materials available for AM, positioning PET as a potential material for those industrial applications where PETG does not meet the necessary mechanical requirements.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) has experienced growing scientific and industrial interest in the last years, with a special focus on application relevant systems based on zirconium. The high cooling rates and the layer-wise build-up process allow overcoming size and geometry limitations typical for conventional casting routes. Yet, the novel production approach requires different alloy characteristics than casting processes. The present work reports for the first time on the PBF-LB/M-processing of three CuTi-based bulk metallic glass formers in the Vit101 system, allowing to exceed the mechanical performance of most additively formed Zr-based BMGs. Furthermore, the influence of alloy properties like thermal stability and toughness on the PBF-LB/M applicability are systematically studied. Thermal stability plays a minor role to produce amorphous specimen, while notch toughness is found to be a more crucial aspect to achieve parts with low defect density and resulting high mechanical performance. The results suggest fundamentally different alloy development strategies adapted to the needs of the PBF-LB/M-process, leaving classical casting-based optimization of glass forming ability behind and evolving towards a rather toughness-oriented optimization.",

When an external magnetic field is applied, it causes forces that alter the flow through the thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamic (TEMHD) effect, potentially altering the final microstructure. However, the extent of TEMHD forces and their underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. We trace the flow of tungsten particles using in situ high-speed synchrotron X-ray radiography and ex situ tomography to reveal the structure of TEMHD-induced flow during directed energy deposition AM (DED-AM). When no magnetic field is imposed, Marangoni convection dominates the flow, leading to a relatively even particle distribution. With a magnetic field parallel to the scan direction, TEMHD flow is induced, circulating in the cross-sectional plane, causing particle segregation to the bottom and side of the pool. Further, a downward magnetic field causes horizontal circulation, segregating particles to the other side. Our results demonstrate that TEMHD can disrupt melt pool flow during DED-AM.",

    "abstract": "The Friction Screw Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (FSEAM) process is a newly created process for additive manufacturing of low weight-high strength aluminum and magnesium alloys in the solid state which are unsuited for many fusion-based approaches. The process is based on a rotating threaded tool located within a stationary housing that is equipped with a feeding mechanism. The dimensions and shape of the deposited layers can be controlled through a dedicated printhead design. This work reports the results on the fabrication of rectangular structures composed of AA6060 T6 feedstock. The study mainly focused on the influence of the feed ratio on the quality, the microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated builds. The feed ratio, defined as the fraction of volume of material deposited per unit of time relative to the volume of material necessary per unit of time for a given cross sectional shape, was varied between 0.995 and 1.7. Solid builds free from macroscopic defects were fabricated at feed ratios of 1.3 and above. Tensile tests performed on samples from the interior of the structure in the build direction showed values for ultimate tensile strength and homogeneous elongation in excess of 100 MPa and 12.5 %, respectively. At feed ratios close to one, layers were formed with fabrication defects, such as macro voids and insufficiently bonded areas, that caused a significant reduction in the elongation values to typically below 5 %. The average grain size of the deposited layers was 3 – 4 micrometers for all builds. The hardness of the builds was reduced from 80 HV to about 40 HV which was ascribed to the thermo-mechanical processes taking place during transport of the feedstock material by the threaded tool and the subsequent deposition. The appearance of the builds and the occurrence of fabrication defects could be explained using a descriptive model by the way the feedstock material was distributed underneath the printhead during deposition. Lateral plastic deformation occurred both within the current layer being built and in the previously deposited layers. Further exploratory tests of the FSEAM process showed that the deposition speed can be increased to 490 mm/min at a favorable feed ratio of 1.3, corresponding to a build rate of about 400 cm3/hour, while maintaining good deposition without macroscopic defects demonstrating the future potential of the process.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) processing of tool steels has a high level of complexity due to the martensitic transformation and consequently tempering during the component manufacturing. The thermal history generated over the part is very complex and challenging to evaluate after the AM process. By using high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HEXRD), this work performs a series of in situ laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) experiments to reveal the phase transformation and lattice defect evolution at different parts of a printed thin wall made of X40CrMoV5–1 (AISI H13) steel. To complement and correlate the findings obtained during the AM process, ex situ characterizations of the wall are done by means of HEXRD scans, electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD), micro hardness, and optical microscopy. The results show that the intrinsic heat treatment (IHT) at any position of the wall can be represented by a combination and repetition of five different types of phase transformation cycles. Overtime, the heat accumulation on the wall causes a decrease in cooling rates, modifying the transformation kinetics of these phase transition. The martensite carbon content evolution shows that over the cycles, less carbon remains in solution due to stronger self-tempering effects and formation of precipitates. While dislocation density evolution in martensite also shows a decrease over time due to self-tempering effects, the density evolution in austenite shows an increase, indicating an accumulation of defects over time. The ex situ characterization of the manufactured wall confirm the microstructure heterogeneities seen during the in situ L-DED experiments. The IHT created high hardness quenched martensite at the very top while regions in the middle and bottom were subjected to different severities of tempering. Additionally, the chemical maps shows the expected microsegregation of C, Mo, Cr and V over the manufactured sample and the presence of oxides caused by contamination during the L-DED process.",

    "abstract": "The extensive study and development of additive manufacturing technologies have allowed not only increased customization of the final parts but especially of their complexity. From such perspectives, intricate and mechanically efficient lattices which maximize their strength-to-weight ratio could be printed. Nevertheless, the fabrication of regular lattices, like octet cells, has been proven to be particularly limited by the layer-by-layer construction process due to the introduction of additional interfaces and/or the requirement of supports. In this work, a hybrid extrusion–photopolymerization process is coupled with a 6-axis robotic arm to allow for the fabrication of layers-less lattices thanks to the use of a custom graphical user interface and control over the printing head orientation. A highly reactive resin is employed as the ink and loaded with silica particles in order to tailor its rheological properties. A good resemblance between the printed components and the digital model is achieved, while their mechanical properties are superior to the ones of the traditionally additive manufactured octets.",

    "abstract": "It has been documented that the hierarchical character of microstructure produced by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is the key to superior mechanical properties. Especially important is a fine cell microstructure possessing heterogeneous distribution of dislocation density and alloying elements. Despite multiple studies that have investigated the effect of such L-PBF structure on the stress-strain response during monotonic loading, just a few investigations were devoted to cyclic behaviour. The present study delivers an insight into the cyclic behaviour of L-PBF processed metastable austenitic stainless steel 304L and its relation to the observed microstructure evolution and strain-induced martensitic transformation (SIMT). The combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, and feritscope measurements enabled to follow the onset of strain-induced martensite (SIM) nucleation and underlying dislocation microstructure evolution. The cyclic behaviour consisted of initial cyclic softening regardless of subjected strain amplitude. Afterwards, milder cyclic softening or saturation stage followed until a final failure was characteristic for the tests held at low strain amplitudes (εa ≤ 0.5%). The third fatigue life stage, cyclic hardening, was recorded during fatigue tests held at εa > 0.5%. The excellent cyclic strength of stainless steel 304L is a direct consequence of cell microstructure containing high dislocation density walls and elemental microsegregation, which effectively inhibit dislocation motion. Cyclic softening was linked with cyclic strain localization into slip bands of decreased dislocation density and heavily altered dislocation cell walls. These bands have been observed for the first time in L-PBF-processed metals. This microstructural feature seems to be a variant of persistent slip bands (PSBs), a typical dislocation arrangement observed in conventionally produced materials subjected to cyclic loading. PSBs present the areas of intensive cyclic plasticity where the SIMT preferentially occurs upon further cycling. The increasing α´‐martensite volume fraction, accompanied by a formation of intermediate ε-martensite and deformation twinning, resulted in recorded cyclic hardening. The martensite nucleation sites are strongly determined by the underlying cell microstructure, in terms of cell walls dislocation density and chemical segregation, which is tightly related to utilized L-PBF process parameters. The present findings indicate a possible opportunity to control the magnitude of the SIMT susceptibility by fine-tuning of the L-PBF process parameters and consequently tailoring the cyclic behaviour.",

    "abstract": "To enable use of additively manufactured (AM) soft magnetic material in electric machines, large bulk cross-sections must be avoided as they allow large eddy currents, reducing efficiency. Fe-6.5 wt%Si is an excellent soft magnetic material, but is brittle. In this study we exploit this inherent characteristic of the material to develop crack networks within the AM material to inhibit parasitic eddy currents. By manipulating the laser parameters and scan strategy to purposefully induce cracking, the effective resistivity of the material can be increased to 206 µΩ·cm, 250% of the materials' already high resistivity of 82 µΩ·cm. Crack density is shown to increase with decreasing scan speed, and calculated electrical tortuosity shown to correlate with effective resistivity. Different scan strategies are shown to alter the orientation of the cracks, demonstrating that the crack orientation could be controlled in relation to the magnetic flux, providing high electrical resistance in the plane of the eddy currents, whilst maintaining magnetic properties. This method yields losses of 2.2 W/kg at 1 T, 50 Hz, similar to methods using air gaps, but with a much higher stacking factor of > 97%, outperforming other methods used in AM of soft magnetic material, showing promise for manufacturing stators of complex electric machines.",

    "abstract": "One of the remaining challenges in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) of metals is the control of the formation of keyhole pores, resulting from a local excessive energy input during processing. Such defects can lead to degraded mechanical properties and are typically detected and/or removed after the process through non-destructive quality-inspection procedures and porosity-removal treatments. Monitoring and controlling the formation of defects during the LPBF process can allow circumventing such time-consuming and costly post-process stages. This paper develops a new approach to perform in-situ healing of deep keyhole pores, using a positively defocused laser beam with finely tuned laser remelting process parameters. Synchrotron radiographic images of the process zone are acquired during laser remelting. The use of operando imaging enables the visualization of pore removal during processing, and unveils the effect of various remelting conditions on the healing efficiency. The acoustic signals generated during laser remelting are recorded using a high-sensitivity optical microphone, and analyzed in parallel with the X-ray images, allowing the acoustic signature of defect healing to be identified. The present paper demonstrates for the first time that an airborne acoustic sensor can be used to monitor the healing of keyhole pores during LPBF.",

    "abstract": "This work demonstrates an experimental technique to image melt pool temperature fields with a commercial color camera for laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) processes. The technique relies on two-color thermography to construct spatially-resolved temperature fields and is demonstrated on 316 L stainless steel (SS) melt pools from solidus to near-vaporization temperatures. This two-color thermal imaging system negates the need for a priori knowledge of melt pool emissivity or the camera's view factor and was validated with a calibrated tungsten filament lamp between temperatures of 1220 K and 2850 K. In-situ temperature measurements are combined with ex-situ cross-sectional geometry to determine the material's effective absorptivity and coefficient of temperature-dependent surface tension, which is responsible for Marangoni convection, in a multi-physics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Measured peak melt pool temperatures are important for understanding the molten convection within the melt pool, and measured cooling rates can be related to the resulting part microstructure. Peak temperatures from 1750 K to 3000 K show that below the boiling point, temperature increases with increasing laser power density and decreases less with increasing scanning velocity. Thermal images are used to estimate cooling rates in the melt pool tail, which seem to increase linearly with the ratio of scanning velocity to power. Our thermal imaging strategy will advance measurement science in L-DED processes by validating multi-physics CFD models, quantifying cooling rates, providing real-time feedback control, and allowing process mapping of critical melt pool behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The fabrication of near-net-shape products using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF, PBF-LB) is expected to bring benefits such as part consolidation and light-weighting to the aircraft industry. However, the challenge for practical application is to suppress microcracking in building parts during the process so that it is necessary to understand the effects of process parameters on the cracking behavior. Both time per layer and part geometry contribute to heat loss and thermal history through the process, resulting in changes in microstructure and material properties. The purpose of the current study is to understand their effects on microcracking behavior as well as thermal history, microstructure, and mechanical properties in Inconel 738 LC samples. A part-scale finite element thermal analysis confirmed that significant heat accumulation occurred during the process in the samples with constricted geometry with short time per layer. In the fabricated IN738LC samples with the heat accumulation, more coarse microstructure, greater hardness, and severe cracking size and density were observed. The cracking mechanism based on the RDG model with Rosenthal's analytical temperature field suggests that heat accumulation during the PBF-LB process should be avoided to fabricate crack-free IN738LC parts, and a sufficiently long time per layer is preferable.",

    "abstract": "With a growing demand for high-quality fabrication, the interest in real-time process and defect monitoring of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) has increased, leading manufacturers to incorporate a variety of online sensing methods including acoustic sensing, photodiode sensing, and high-speed imaging. However, real-time acquisition of high-resolution melt pool images in particular remains computationally demanding in practice due to the high variability of melt pool morphologies and the limitation of data caching and transfer, making it challenging to detect the local lack-of-fusion (LOF) defect occurrences. In this work, we propose a new acoustic and thermal information-based monitoring method that can robustly infer critical LPBF melt pool morphological features in image forms and detect spatially-dependent LOF defects within a short time period. We utilize wavelet scalogram matrices of acoustic and photodiode clip data to identify and predict highly time-resolved (within a 1.0 ms window) visual melt pool characteristics via a well-trained data-driven pipeline. With merely the acoustic and photodiode-collected thermal emission data as the input, the proposed pipeline enables data-driven inference and tracking of highly variable melt pool visual characteristics with R2≥0.8. We subsequently validate our proposed approach to infer local LOF defects between two adjacent scanlines, showing that our proposed approach can outperform our selected baseline theoretical model based on previous literature. Revealing the physical correlation between airborne acoustic emission, thermal emission, and melt pool morphology, our work demonstrates the feasibility of creating an efficient and cost-effective acoustic- and thermal-based approach to facilitate online visual melt pool characterization and LOF defect detection. We believe that our work can further contribute to the advances in quality control for LPBF.",

A geometric modeling approach utilizing Voronoi partitioning and a unique branch-stem-branch (BSB) structure, patterned according to 2D wallpaper symmetries, enables precise concurrent geometric and topological tuning of lattices across a continuous parameter space. Selected architectures are physically realized via material extrusion of polylactic acid (PLA) infused with carbon black (CB). Experimental characterizations, supported by Finite Element modeling, reveal the significant influence of BSB structure's design parameters on mechanical and piezoresistive performance under tensile loading, with a remarkable Poisson's ratio of -0.74, accompanied by a 15-fold increase in elastic stiffness and a 34-fold increase in strain sensitivity. Additionally, architecturally, and topologically tailored lattice structures exhibit tunable damage sensitivity, reflecting the rate of conductive network destruction within the lattice. This offers insights into the rapidity of cell wall failure, with a steeper slope of the piezoresistance curve in the inelastic regime indicating a faster breakdown and quicker onset of mechanical failure. Integration of Gaussian Process Regression enables accurate exploration of the design space beyond realized structures, highlighting the potential of these intelligent lattice structures for applications such as sensors and in situ health monitoring, marking a significant advancement in multifunctional materials.",

    "abstract": "The laser powder bed fusion technology is widely utilized for manufacturing intricate metallic components, overcoming design limitations inherent in traditional subtractive methods. Recent advancements in powder bed fusion have extended to the creation of metal multi-material structures, allowing for functionally graded and tailored properties within a single component. While functionally graded lattice structures are commonly achieved by spatially varying the relative density and/or topology of the lattice, multi-material lattices are rarely studied particularly via metal additive manufacturing where multi-material methods are a relatively recent development. This study applies an accessible enhancement to a standard powder bed fusion system for multi-material additive manufacturing, and investigates printed and heat-treated bi-metallic lattices containing regions of both 316L and 17–4PH stainless steel. The bi-material interface is examined in lattice and bulk samples, and the compression behaviour of bi-metallic lattices is investigated experimentally and computationally. The material interface is shown to be robust as built and under loading, and the bi-metallic lattices exhibit greater energy absorption than single-material samples. The inclusion of the ductile 316L in bi-metallic lattices also delays the propagation of local failure and shear bands initiated in the more brittle 17–4PH. Finite element analysis simulates the lattice compression which includes strut fracture and as-built diameters informed by computed tomography, enabling further investigation and analysis of multi-material lattice designs. This work demonstrates the benefit of multi-material additive manufacturing by providing improved performance over single-material designs.",

This paper studies the warping formation of an overhang structure through in-situ experimental measurements and thermomechanical finite element modeling. For the former, a laser profilometer was utilized for layer-by-layer mapping of the top surface profile of overhang during printing. For the latter, a computationally efficient approach simulating a scaled-down geometry printed with actual laser parameters and scanning patterns was utilized for part-scale moving heat source calculation. The predicted results were validated against the experimental data for various heat inputs. Through analyzing the calculated results of temperature and stress evolutions, it is found that the overhang warping distortion is rooted in bending caused by the non-uniform shrinkage force through the thickness direction and the low structural rigidity of overhang. Additionally, a scanning pause-based method was evaluated, and it is able to suppress the warping at the overhang tip by 30% when employing a scanning pause duration of 5 ms. However, further increasing the scanning pause duration, while decreasing the overhang overheating, does not result in additional reduction in warping distortion.",

    "abstract": "Achieving precise control in laser-based powder bed fusion of polymers is crucial for ensuring the structural integrity of aerospace and automotive components. Closed-loop feedback control systems using process monitoring techniques, such as infrared thermography, have the potential to provide reliable production by controlling the temperature of the melt. However, challenges arise from complex interactions among variables, such as part geometry, scan strategy, and laser parameters, affecting the melted polymer's temperatures and subsequent particle fusion. Thus, the correlation between thermal signals and resulting part density still needs to be clarified. In this work, a machine learning algorithm is trained to predict local porosity or, rather, solidity based on thermal and temporal features extracted from the melt's temperature-time profile. This enables statistical techniques to assess the contribution of the melt's thermal and temporal features in the decision-making process for evaluating porosity, along with the influence of voxel size and configuration. The in-situ process signature is measured using infrared thermography, and the porosity is analyzed by X-ray micro-computed tomography. The 2D thermal data is first converted into voxel information and then stitched with the 3D mircoCT data in a second step. The resulting 3D thermal features and porosity matrices are downsampled and utilized to train a machine learning algorithm (lightGBM). Models with high prediction accuracy are achieved using a small voxel size to avoid over-homogenizing features and by utilizing thermal signals from adjacent voxels to determine porosity in a volume element. The highest predictor for resulting porosity is the peak temperature of the melt during laser exposure. Interlayer effects, such as sufficient reheating of subsurface layers, are the second-highest indicator for dense parts. Furthermore, the model's performance is also affected by intra-layer effects, including the peak temperature of adjacent voxels and the cooling behavior after laser exposure. This research has several implications for industry, as it enables the detection of process defects based on in-situ process monitoring data without post-process material testing. Moreover, identifying thermal signal ranges that lead to the highest porosity can reduce the number of experiments needed for material qualification processes.",

    "abstract": "Material extrusion (MEX) of thermoplastic filaments represents one of the most widely adopted additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Unlike vat photopolymerization and powder-bed fusion methods that require high energy sources such as UV light and lasers, this fabrication method can be adapted for the fabrication of ceramics by using ceramic loaded filaments as feedstock, yet still employing relatively cheap equipment meant for polymeric materials with little adaptation of the process parameters; this potentially enables a broader diffusion of AM ceramic components. In this work, composite filaments with various weight fractions (60 – 80 wt.%) of BaTiO3 were fabricated and characterized by electron microscopy, compressive mechanical testing, rheometry and thermogravimetric analysis to ensure a smooth and reliable printing process. After optimizing the printing parameters, the dense and porous printed samples were carefully debinded and sintered to obtain dense (~ 92%) and defect-free ceramic bodies. The sintered samples were characterized for phase development, microstructure, and pore size distribution. Careful observations reveal a particular range of pore size (0.1 – 5 µm), which originates from the binder burn out process. The dielectric and ferroelectric properties of the fabricated samples were in good agreement with those reported in previous literature. This work provides a foundation for rapid prototyping of functional electro ceramics into reliable products with desired functional properties.",

    "abstract": "The excellent properties of polyether ether ketone (PEEK) have made it applicable for high-performance components in aerospace, electrical, chemical, and biomedical industries. Material extrusion (MEX) additive manufacturing (AM) of PEEK using fused filament fabrication (FFF) predominantly uses modified PEEK filament. Fused granulate fabrication (FGF) systems conventionally employ injection moulding and extrusion grades which are not specifically formulated for MEX AM. There is a limited amount of research on the use of these grades for MEX AM using PEEK. This study evaluated different viscosity PEEK grades at various extruder temperatures to optimise interlayer strength and therefore determine the best grades of PEEK for FGF. Compression shear testing (CST) was used to study this property as it represents a mostly shear loading condition i.e., without bending, compared to other conventional shear testing methods, whilst also being easier to fabricate. PEEK crystallinity is corelated to the interlayer strength and was evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The highest interlayer strength of 17.70±0.58 MPa and the lowest crystallisation degree of 29.7±1.3% (Raman) was achieved by VESTAKEEP L4000G PEEK, printed at the highest extruder temperature (420°C). This grade had the highest viscosity or the lowest melt volume-flow rate (MVR). In contrast with lower MVR grades, the high MVR grade VESTAKEEP L2000G, achieved a higher increase in bond strength and crystallinity with higher extruder temperatures. At lower MVR, the crystallinity was found to decrease from 33% to 30% with increasing extruder temperatures, along with an increase in melting temperature. This behaviour was attributed to a change in crystalline morphology possibly caused by the long residence time and high processing temperature of FGF.",

    "abstract": "Extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) of polymer composites exhibits complex thermally driven phenomena that introduce severe discontinuities in the internal structure across length scales, especially voids or porosity. This study utilizes a high-throughput porosity characterization technique to analyze large datasets from numerous micro-computed tomography (μCT) scans to capture the influence of AM print parameters on the size, shape, and location of porosity across multiple print layers (up to a few cm) on fused granular fabrication (FGF) printers. The materials investigated include nanocomposite formulations based on commercially relevant nylon-12 and polyether ketone ketone materials (PEKK) comprising nano- or micro-sized fillers. The estimated global porosity follows an inverse linear correlation against the bulk density of the printed samples. Increasing the extrusion multiplier (EM) and the nozzle temperature while decreasing the print speeds reduces the global porosity. Outlier analyses (local porosity morphology) show that faster print speeds and higher extrusion rates result in long, slender inter-layer voids, while lower nozzle temperatures lead to large, symmetrical, inter-bead voids (at the bead junction). Lack of active chamber temperature increases inter-layer and intra-bead voids with a two-fold increase in global porosity. Overall, the micro filler-reinforced composites exhibit higher global porosity than nanofiller-reinforced composites, which is attributed to the increased mismatch in the thermal expansion coefficient between the filler and the polymers used in the study.",

    "abstract": "Unlike classical artificial neural networks, which require retraining for each new set of parametric inputs, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), a lately introduced deep learning framework, approximates linear and nonlinear solution operators by taking parametric functions (infinite-dimensional objects) as inputs and mapping them to complete solution fields. In this paper, two newly devised DeepONet formulations with sequential learning and Residual U-Net (ResUNet) architectures are trained for the first time to simultaneously predict complete thermal and mechanical solution fields under variable loading, loading histories, process parameters, and even variable geometries. Two real-world applications are demonstrated: 1- coupled thermo-mechanical analysis of steel continuous casting with multiple visco-plastic constitutive laws and 2- sequentially coupled direct energy deposition for additive manufacturing. Despite highly challenging spatially variable target distributions, DeepONets can infer reasonably accurate full-field temperature and stress solutions several orders of magnitude faster than traditional and highly optimized finite-element analysis (FEA), even when FEA simulations are run on the latest high-performance computing platforms. The proposed DeepONet model's ability to provide field predictions almost instantly for unseen input parameters opens the door for future preliminary evaluation and design optimization of these vital industrial processes.",

    "abstract": "Material Extrusion (MEX) is emerging as the leading manufacturing method for fabricating complex silicone structures and is demanded in different fields such as soft robotics, space exploration, and biomedicine. At the state-of-the-art level, the fabrication of small-scale silicone structures (low value of layer height parameter) remains challenging owing to the high printing forces involved. In this study, an innovative approach to considerably decrease the printing force while extruding at low layer heights is presented, thereby enabling the fabrication of thin-walled silicone structures. The proposed approach is based on leveraging silicone mixed with Fe3O4 magnetic nanopowder, which is extruded using a custom-made syringe equipped with 325 electrically charged (4.5 Ampere) copper coils. The electromagnetic force (FEM) generated by these coils pushes the magnetic ink from the syringe towards the build plate, thereby reducing the overall printing force (FT). Here, a maximum reduction of 21.08% is achieved when the layer height of 0.1 mm is set. Further, all the forces involved in the proposed electromagnetic-assisted manufacturing approach are numerically modeled and experimentally measured after equipping the 3D printing system with piezoresistive sensors: a model accuracy of 95.63% is obtained at low layer heights and flow rate values. Finally, small-scale self-transforming soft robots and bioinspired monolithic structures obtained by jointly extruding magnetic ink and stiff thermoplastic materials in the same manufacturing cycle are presented, thereby proving the potential of the proposed additive manufacturing approach.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing is one of the key technologies behind recent industrial revolutions. Mass customization requires production techniques that can meet current needs for human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency. Furthermore, for biomedical applications and personalized medicine, 3D printing demands advanced materials that can respond to the processing requirements of each technique but that are at the same time biocompatible, biofunctional and bioeliminable. Cyclodextrins (CDs) have only recently been explored as components of 3D printed objects despite the variety of functionalities they can offer. Considered safe for most administration routes, these macrocyclic oligosaccharides possess a unique capability to host a wide variety of substances, ranging from small drugs and biomarkers to large peptides and polymers, and can be versatilely functionalized at their numerous hydroxyl groups. Although still underexplored, these capabilities could be transferred to 3D printed structures. The aim of this review is to analyze the contribution of CDs to make 3D/4D printing more sustainable and provide printed objects with novel features. The information collected from the papers published in the last decade has been organized into three sections: CDs to improve drug biopharmaceutical properties and controlled release; CDs as structural agents of 3D printed objects; and CDs as responsive agents for 4D printing and wearable sensors. The obtained results confirm the suitability of CDs to be processed using a variety of 3D printing techniques and to provide new nano-scale tunable architectures, with permanent or stimuli-transient conformations. CDs can expand 3D printing to lipophilic compounds that form inclusion complexes during the preparation of water-based semisolid masses or the melting of filaments or powders. Furthermore, CDs offer several advantages as structural components by forming reversible supramolecular assemblies that exhibit self-healing properties and by facilitating photocross-linking reactions in aqueous environments acting as initiator solubilizer and building blocks. Additionally, CDs can provide 4D behavior through sensitivity to humidity, temperature, pH, ionic strength, and external forces. Overall, CDs can enable 3D printed objects to meet widely varying mechanical, electrical, and drug delivery demands.",

    "abstract": "Powder recycling refers to the reuse of unused powder feedstock in the laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) process. This approach is crucial for the economic viability and sustainability of PBF-LB/M, as powder accounts for a large proportion of the total production cost. However, through powder recycling, the physical and chemical properties of powder are liable to change. This variation in powder properties can subsequently lead to knock-on effects on the mechanical properties of a fully built component. This research has investigated the changes that occur to stainless steel 316L (SS316L) powder as a result of recycling. This includes changes to powder size distribution (PSD), flowability, chemistry and phase composition. Likewise, the impact that these changes have will also be assessed in PBF-LB/M SS316L components manufactured from powders after different levels of recycling and subjected to alternative post processing routes such as hot isostatic pressing (HIP). This comprehensive investigation involves a thorough examination of both macro- and microstructures, encompassing detailed analyses of chemical composition, microstructural features, and defects. The study aims to elucidate differences in mechanical behaviour through a series of experiments, including uniaxial tensile tests, Charpy impact assessments, and low cycle fatigue (LCF) experiments. Additionally, the investigation will be complemented by pitting potential tests, providing a holistic understanding of the material's performance and characteristics. Although moderate changes to powder were observed for both PSD and chemistry, this was found to be negligible and not enough to result in any adverse changes to part performance. In addition, the microstructure of SS316L remained stable across differing levels of powder recycling. Whereas the porosity content increased marginally as the fine particle content of powder was reduced, this was not found to be sufficient to affect the LCF performance of the material. After powder recycling, increases in ductility and Young's modulus were attributed to a reduction in oxides present in the microstructure, which were sources of localised damage and deformation.",

Typically, thermal images are produced at mid or long wavelengths of infrared radiation. Using the shorter wavelengths that silicon focal plane arrays are sensitive to allows the use of standard windows in the optical path. It also affords fewer modifications to the machine and enables us to make use of mature silicon camera technology. With this new instrument, in situ thermal imaging of the entire build area has been made possible at high speed, allowing defect detection and melt pool tracking. Melt pool tracking was used to implement an emissivity correction algorithm, which produced more accurate temperatures of the melted areas of the layer.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of the CT-STARR (CT-Surface Texture for Additive Round Robin) Stage 1 interlaboratory comparison. The study compared the results obtained for the extraction of areal surface texture data per ISO 25178-2 from five X-ray computed tomography (CT) volume measurements from each of four laboratories. Two Ti6Al4V ELI (extra-low interstitial) components were included in each of the CT acquisitions. The first component was an additively manufactured (AM) cube manufactured using an Arcam Q10 electron beam melting (EBM) machine. Surface texture data was extracted from CT scans of this part. The values of selected parameters per ISO 25178-2 are reported, including Sa, the arithmetic mean height, for which the values from the Nikon MCT 225 metrology CT measurements were all within 0.5% of the mean reference focus variation measurement. CT resolution requirements are discussed. The second component was a machined dimensional test artefact designed to facilitate independent analysis of CT global voxel scaling errors and surface determination errors. The results of mathematical global scaling and surface determination correction of the dimensional artefact data is reported. The dimensional test artefact errors for the XT H 225 commercial CT for length, outside diameter and inside diameter reduced from -0.27%, -0.83% and -0.54% respectively to less than 0.02% after performing mathematical correction. This work will assist the development of surface texture correction protocols, help define surface-from-CT measurement envelope limits and provide valuable information for an expanded Stage 2 interlaboratory comparison, which will include a more diverse range of CT systems and technologies, further expanding the surface-from-CT knowledge base.",

    "abstract": "Material extrusion additive manufacturing is widely used for porous scaffolds in which polymer filaments are extruded in the form of log-pile structures. These structures are typically designed with the assumption that filaments have a continuous cylindrical profile. However, as a filament is extruded, it interacts with previously printed filaments (e.g. on lower 3D printed layers) and its geometry varies from the cylindrical form. No models currently exist that can predict this critical variation, which impacts filament geometry, pore size and mechanical properties. Therefore, expensive time-consuming trial-and-error approaches to scaffold design are currently necessary. Multiphysics models for material extrusion are extremely computationally-demanding and not feasible for the size-scales involved in scaffold structures. This paper presents a new computationally-efficient method, called the VOLume COnserving model for 3D printing (VOLCO). The VOLCO model simulates material extrusion during manufacturing and generates a voxelised 3D-geometry-model of the predicted microarchitecture. The extrusion-deposition process is simulated in 3D as a filament that elongates in the direction that the print-head travels. For each simulation step in the model, a set volume of new material is simulated at the end of the filament. When previously 3D printed filaments obstruct the deposition of this new material, it is deposited into the nearest neighbouring voxels according to a minimum distance criterion. This leads to filament spreading and widening. Experimental validation demonstrates the ability of VOLCO to simulate the geometry of 3D printed filaments. In addition, finite element analysis (FEA) simulations utilising 3D-geometry-models generated by VOLCO demonstrate its value and applicability for predicting mechanical properties. The presented method enables structures to be validated and optimised prior to manufacture. Potential future adaptations of the model and integration into 3D printing software are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Selective laser sintering (LS) of thermoplastic powders allows for the construction of complex parts with higher mechanical properties and durability compared to other additive manufacturing methods. According to the current model of isothermal laser sintering, semi-crystalline thermoplastics need to be processed within a certain temperature range, resulting in the simultaneous presence of the material both in a molten and solid state, which is present during part building. Based on this process model, high cycle times ranging from hours to days are a thought to be a necessity to avoid warpage. In this paper, the limited validity of the model of isothermal laser sintering is shown by various experiments, as ongoing solidification could be detected a few layers below the powder bed surface. The results indicate that crystallization and material solidification is initiated at high temperatures and further progresses throughout part build-up in z-direction. Therefore, a process-adapted material characterization was performed to identify the isothermal crystallization kinetics at processing temperature and to track changes of the material state over time. A dual approach on measuring surface temperatures by infrared thermography and additional thermocouple measurements in z-direction was performed to identify further influences on the material solidification. A model experiment revealed that a few millimeters below the surface, components produced by LS are already solidified. Based on these results, the authors present an enhanced process model of isothermal laser sintering, which considers material solidification in z-direction during part build-up. In addition, a new processing strategy is derived to increase the efficiency of LS processes significantly.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the evolution of the tensile and structural properties of fused filament fabrication (FFF), formed polymers under gamma irradiation. Commercial off-the-shelf print filaments of Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), Chlorinated polyethylene elastomer (CPE), Nylon, Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and Polycarbonate (PC) were exposed to gamma-ray doses of up to 5.3 MGy. The suitability of FFF-formed components made from these materials for use in radiation environments is evaluated by considering their structural properties. We identify clear trends in the structural properties of all the materials tested and correlate them with changes in the chemical structure. We find that Nylon shows the best performance under these conditions, with no change in ultimate tensile strength and an increase in stiffness. However, some of our findings suggest that the effect of additives to this type of filament may result in potentially undesirable adhesive properties. The organic polymer PLA was notably more radiation-sensitive than the other materials tested, showing 50% decrease in Young's Modulus and ultimate tensile strength at order of magnitude lower radiation dose. A mechanism is proposed whereby FFF-processed components would have substantially different radiation tolerances than bulk material.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques provide significant advantages over conventional subtractive manufacturing techniques in terms of the wide range of part geometry that can be obtained. Powder delivery is a process that occurs thousands of times during the AM build process, consequently assessment of delivery quality would be advantageous in the process in order to provide feedback for process control. This paper presents an in-situ quantitative inspection technique for assessing the whole of the powder bed post raking, by using fringe projection profilometry. In order to increase accuracy and traceability of the inspection technique, an accepted fringe projection method, is enhanced using a novel surface fitting algorithm employed to reduce the influence of phase error and random noise during calibration. A simulation was conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed system calibration. The proposed in-situ inspection technique has been applied in an Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-EB) machine, also known as Electron Beam Melting (EBM). Some examples of melting edge swelling and excessive powder delivery due to rake damage during a real part build are used to demonstrate the system capability on the actual EBM machine. A build process with presented fringe projection system is reported in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that powder defects can be efficiently inspected and the results used as feedback information in a build process.",

Martensitic steels manufactured by laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) have been shown to have more retained austenite than when conventionally manufactured. The LPBF microstructure is characterised by small grains containing ultrafine solidification cells (<1 μm). This study shows that the solidification cells can fully suppress thermal martensite. The retained austenite is highly metastable, and will readily transform to deformation martensite either in-build from thermal strain or post-build from deformation. This raises concerns around sample preparation methods causing incorrect phase quantification in LPBF-built martensitic steels.",

In order to exploit the potential benefits of this emergent technology, new design, analysis and optimization methods are needed. This paper presents a method that enables in the optimization of a multifunctional part by coupling both the system and structural design aspects. This is achieved by incorporating the effects of a system, comprised of a number of connected functional components, on the structural response of a part within a structural topology optimization procedure. The potential of the proposed method is demonstrated by performing a coupled optimization on a cantilever plate with integrated components and circuitry. The results demonstrate that the method is capable of designing an optimized multifunctional part in which both the structural and system requirements are considered.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) has gone through major developments in the past decade, enabling the rapid manufacture of complex geometries from traditional engineering materials. This study aims to facilitate the development and additive manufacturing of a new generation of fast and simple digital components with integrated magnetic shape memory (MSM) alloy sections that can be actuated by an external magnetic field. Here, we employ a systematic design of experiments (DoE) approach for investigating laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of a Ni-Mn-Ga based MSM alloy. The effects of the applied process parameters on the chemical composition and relative density are determined, and detailed investigations are conducted on the microstructural properties of the as-deposited material obtained using optimized parameters. The results show that although the L-PBF of Ni-Mn-Ga is characterized by an ever-present loss of Mn, deposition of Ni-Mn-Ga with a high relative density of 98.3% and a minimal loss of Mn at ∼1.1 at.% is feasible. The material produced in this manner was compositionally near homogenous and, in as-deposited condition, consisted of a mixture of 14 M and non-modulated (NM) martensites. However, combined measurements by the low-field ac magnetic susceptibility method (LFMS) and DSC revealed that the phase transformation of the as-deposited material from martensite to austenite, and vice versa, was broad and occurred in a paramagnetic state. Inspection by SEM revealed a layered microstructure with a stripe-like surface relief that originated from the presence of martensitic twins within the sample. Additionally, AFM and MFM measurements showed that in as-deposited Ni-Mn-Ga, there exists a weak MFM contrast that can be attributed to the twinned martensite having magnetic anisotropy. Overall, L-PBF shows high potential for the production of functional Ni-Mn-Ga based MSM alloys.",

    "abstract": "Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), which is an additive manufacturing (AM) process that uses metal materials, has a higher fabricated volume per unit time but a lower fabricated shape accuracy compared with other methods. With this process, the surface roughness of fabricated objects is several hundred micrometers or more, and a finishing process is necessary. However, the fabricated objects after finishing can have uncut areas or can be overcut during the finishing process owing to the large difference between the target and actual fabricated shapes. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a cooperative system for WAAM and machining that includes a process that measures the shape of the fabricated object. First, the three-dimensional (3-D) shape of the fabricated object was measured by structure from motion (SfM) and compared with the 3-D computer-aided design (CAD) data. Second, the original design was modified, and the amount of material removed during finish cutting was optimized with the developed software. Finally, the fabricated hollow object was finished by milling to obtain a uniform wall thickness without any defects. A 3-D fabricated object was measured by SfM, and it was observed that the measurement accuracy was sufficiently high for the requirements of the system. In addition, a fabricated hollow quadrangular pyramid with a closed shape was machined with a computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool with the modification of the work origin. As a result, the amount of material removed during finish cutting was optimized, and the inclined wall thickness was uniform compared with that without modification. In addition, a hollow turbine blade with a freeform shape was successfully finished without any defects.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of Ni-based superalloys shows great potential for high temperature applications, for example, as a burner repair application for gas turbines where the thin-walled structure is important. It motivates this work to investigate the evolution of microstructure and the anisotropic mechanical behavior when plate-like specimens are built with a thickness from 4 mm down to 1 mm. By performing texture analysis using neutron diffraction, a clear transition in fiber texture from <011> to <001> is indicated when the specimen becomes thinner. The residual stress shows no thickness dependence, and at the subsurface the residual stress reaches the same level as the yield strength. Due to the rough as-built surface, a roughness compensation method for mechanical properties of thin-walled structures is outlined and demonstrated. Tensile tests from room temperature up to 700 °C have been carried out. Anisotropic mechanical behavior is found at all temperatures, which is strongly related to the anisotropic texture evolution. Stronger texture evolution and grain rotations are discovered when the tensile loading is applied along the building direction. The mechanical behavior has been compared to a wrought material, where the high dislocation density and the subgrain structure of the LPBF material result in a higher yield strength. Combining the statistical texture analysis by neutron diffraction with mechanical testing, EBSD grain orientation mapping and the investigation of dislocation structures using transmission electron microscopy, this work illustrates the significance of texture for the thin-wall effect and anisotropic mechanical behavior of LPBF materials.",

    "abstract": "Large bone defects due to trauma or disease present a significant clinical challenge with limited efficacy of current therapies. A key aim is to develop biomimetic scaffolds that reflect the native tissue structure with 3D printing being an important enabling technology. However, the incorporation of multiple length scales and anisotropic features, mimicking the native architecture, is difficult with current processes. In this study, we propose a simple and versatile hybrid printing process using a screw-assisted additive manufacturing technique combined with rotational electrospinning to fabricate dual-scale anisotropic scaffolds. 3D microscale porous polycaprolactone (PCL) structures with highly aligned nanoscale fibres were successfully produced layer-by-layer. The scaffolds were morphological, mechanical and biological characterised. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) were seeded on the hybrid scaffold to evaluate the effects of structural and anisotropic topographic cues on cell attachment, proliferation and osteogenesis differentiation. Results show that the 3D printed microscale structures have uniform and well-defined geometries and the alignment of nanoscale electrospun fibres increases by increasing the electrospinning rotational velocity. Mechanical results show that there is no significant difference between 3D printed scaffolds with or without electrospun meshes. In vitro results show higher cell seeding efficiency and proliferation in dual-scale scaffolds with high density electrospun meshes. A more stretched and elongated cell morphology was observed in aligned nanofibre scaffolds showing higher anisotropic cytoskeletal organization than 3D printed PCL scaffolds without electrospun meshes. The dual-scale scaffolds present improved overall osteogenic markers expressions (COL-1, ALP and OCN). However, no statistical difference between normalised osteogenic marker expressions were observed between dual-scale scaffolds and 3D printed scaffolds. This might be attributed to the poor bioactivity of the substrate material, PCL, suggesting topographical cues might not be sufficient to stimulate cell fate towards to an osteogenic linage. The results suggest that the proposed fabrication strategy is a promising approach for the design of novel bone scaffolds to modulate cell fates by integrating the topographic cue reported in this paper with biochemical cues associated to the use of more bioactive materials.",

    "abstract": "Manufacturing of functional (ready to use) parts with the powder bed fusion method has seen an increase in recent times in the field of aerospace and in the medical sector. Residual stresses (RS) induced due to the process itself can lead to defects like cracks and delamination in the part leading to the inferior quality of the part. These RS are one of the main reasons preventing the process from being adopted widely. The powder bed methods have several processing parameters that can be optimized for improving the quality of the component, among which, build orientation is one. In this current study, influence of the build orientation on the residual stress distribution for the Ni-based super-alloy Inconel 718 fabricated by laser-based powder bed fusion method is studied by non- destructive technique of neutron diffraction at selected cross-sections. Further, RS generated in the entire part was predicted using a simplified layer by layer approach using a finite element (FE) based thermo-mechanical numerical model. From the experiment, the part printed in horizontal orientation has shown the least amount of stress in all three directions and a general tendency of compressive RS at the center of the part and tensile RS near the surface was observed in all the samples. The build with vertical orientation has shown the highest amount of RS in both compression and tension. Simplified simulations results are in good agreement with the experimental value of the stresses.",

Samples were printed in Flat, Edge, and Vertical orientations, while the raster angle was altered from 0, to 45, to 90° with successive layers being either perpendicular or parallel. Monotonic testing revealed the mechanical strength of ESD-PEKK outperformed Ultem 9085 in flat (68.8 vs. 64.2 MPa), edge (95.7 vs. 76.1 MPa), and vertical (49.6 vs. 40.0 MPa) print orientations with a 45° perpendicular infill. The variation of raster angle and pattern was almost always detrimental to the mechanical properties compared to Edge print orientations with 45° perpendicular infill. Fatigue testing was also performed on all three orientations with a 45° perpendicular infill. The fatigue strength for the worst-case, vertically printed samples, was 3.5x higher for ESD-PEKK compared to Ultem (16 MPa vs. 4 MPa). All samples tested could be fitted with a power-law relationship, and each material showed low variability within their power-law exponents. This article discusses the performance of ESD-PEKK and Ultem 9085 and their potential use as aerospace and defense-grade polymers.",

    "abstract": "Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a semi-crystalline polymer that has remarkable properties of high mechanical properties, excellent wear resistance, low friction and chemical resistance, and it is found in many applications such sporting goods, medical artificial joints, bullet proof jackets and armours, ropes and fishing lines [1]. UHMWPE parts cannot be produced easily by many conventional processes because of its very high melt viscosity resulting from its very long chains [2]. Additive Manufacturing (AM) is moving from being an industrial rapid prototyping process to becoming a mainstream manufacturing process in a wide range of applications. Laser sintering of polymers is one of the AM techniques that is most promising process owing to its ability to produce parts with complex geometries, accurate dimensions, and good mechanical strength [3]. This paper reports attempts to laser-sinter UHMWPE and assesses the effects of laser energy density on the flexural properties of the sintered parts. The properties of the UHMWPE sintered parts were evaluated by performing flexural three point bending tests and were compared in terms of flexural strength, flexural modulus and ductility (deflection). Part dimensions and relative density were evaluated in order to optimise the laser sintering parameters. Thermal analysis of samples was made by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for the virgin powder. Results show that flexural strength, modulus and ductility are influenced by laser energy density and flexural strength and modulus of 1.37 MPa and 32.12 MPa respectively are still achievable at a lower laser energy density of 0.016 J/mm2 (Laser power of 6 W). Part dimensions and bulk density are also influenced by laser energy density.",

    "abstract": "Particle properties play a key role in determining the flowability of cohesive fine powders and consequently the quality of parts fabricated by additive manufacturing. However, how the characteristics of a spread powder layer are linked to particle properties remains not well understood, largely due to the limitations of available numerical models and characterisation approaches. This study thus established an efficient discrete element modelling framework to address these issues, combining GPU computing with a novel methodology for particle stiffness scaling. The validity of the DEM model was verified on both packing and spreading of cohesive fine powders. The effect of particle cohesion on the characteristics of a spread powder layer was systematically analysed for non-cohesive and weakly to strongly cohesive powders. The structure of spread powder layer was qualitatively illustrated and quantitatively evaluated by not only commonly used metrics, such as coordination number, packing density and surface profiles but also particle clustering and pore characteristics. While reducing particle cohesion leads to an enhanced powder flowability, different regimes were identified in the relationship between layer characteristics and particle cohesion. The results showed that powder spreadability has a complicated dependence on the strength of particle cohesion, where the underlying mechanisms can be understood in part via a dimensionless inertial length. These findings not only provide valuable metrics to quantitatively evaluate the quality of a spread powder layer, but also enable a better understanding of the physics underlying the spreading of cohesive fine powders.",

    "abstract": "The metallization of local areas of 3D-printed plastic structures has attracted a significant amount of attention. However, metal and plastic additive manufacturing technologies are incompatible with each other due to the significant difference in their associated process temperatures. This paper proposes and demonstrates a plastic 3D printing technology that adopts electroless plating, a form of chemical metal deposition. The technology is capable of metalizing selected areas of 3D-printed plastic structures made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Because electroless plating is triggered by a palladium (Pd) catalyst, this study designed and custom-fabricated an ABS filament that contains palladium chloride (PdCl2) as a catalyst precursor, which can be used in a fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printer. The 3D printer has two nozzles. One produces the main component of the ABS 3D structure using a regular filament (i.e., pure ABS without PdCl2), and the other deposits a PdCl2-loaded ABS layer onto a selected area of interest using the custom filament. Then, the 3D-printed structure is directly immersed in a nickel (Ni) electroless plating bath. The Ni coats the selected area with strong adhesion. The proposed plastic 3D printing technology coupled with electroless plating does not require any etching (which often uses chromic acid, a very toxic chemical) or roughening of the ABS structure, which are necessary for conventional electroless plating on plastic structures for strong adhesion. Overall, the proposed 3D printing technology has several advantages, namely area-selective metallization, compatibility with regular FFF 3D printing, no damage to the printed structure, and environmental friendliness.",

    "abstract": "Selective laser melting (SLM) is a widely used additive manufacturing method for building metal parts in a layer-by-layer manner thereby imposing almost no limitations on the geometrical layout of the part. The SLM process has a crucial impact on the microstructure, strength, surface quality and even the shape of the part, all of which depend on the thermal history of material points within the part. In this paper, we present a computationally tractable thermal model for the SLM process which accounts for individual laser scanning vectors. First, a closed form solution of a line heat source is calculated to represent the laser scanning vectors in a semi-infinite space. The thermal boundary conditions are accounted for by a complimentary correction field, which is computed numerically. The total temperature field is obtained by the superposition of the two. The proposed semi-analytical model can be used to simulate manufacturing geometrically complex parts and allows spatial discretisation to be much coarser than the characteristic length scale of the process: laser spot size, except in the vicinity of boundaries. The underlying assumption of linearity of the heat equation in the proposed model is justified by comparisons with a fully non-linear model and experiments. The accuracy of the proposed boundary correction scheme is demonstrated by a dedicated numerical example on a simple cubic part. The influence of the part design and scanning strategy on the temperature transients are subsequently analysed on a geometrically complex part. The results show that overhanging features of a part obstruct the heat flow towards the base-plate thereby creating local overheating which in turn decrease local cooling rate. Finally, a real SLM process for a part with an overhanging feature is modelled for validation of the proposed model. Reasonable agreement between the model predictions and the experimentally measured values can be observed.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing and laser welding are powerful metal processing techniques with broad applications in advanced sectors such as the biomedical and aerospace industries. One common process variable that can tune laser-material interaction dynamics in these two techniques is adjustment of the composition and pressure of the atmosphere in which the process is conducted. While some of the physical mechanisms that are governed by the ambient pressure are well known from the welding literature, it remains unclear how these mechanisms extend to the distinct process conditions of LPBF. In situ studies of the differences in subsurface structure and behavior are essential for understanding the effects of gas pressure and composition on the LPBF processes. This article reports the use of in situ X-ray imaging to directly probe the morphological evolution of the liquid-vapor interface during laser melting as a function of ambient pressure and oxygen partial pressure under LPBF conditions in 316 L steel, Ti-64, aluminum 6061, and Nickel 400. We observe significant changes in melt pool morphology as a function of pressure. Furthermore, similar changes in morphology occur due to an increase in oxygen partial pressure in the process atmosphere.

    "abstract": "In this study, a novel strategy for strengthening additively manufactured cold spray deposits is proposed, based on a rather under-explored niche of the processing parameters space. We have shown that a combination of two factors (a wide particle size distribution of the feedstock powder and low processing parameters) triggered a successful implementation of this strategy. At such conditions, a significant proportion of the particles (particularly those with a large size) fail to deposit and rebound after their impact instead, initiating the in-process densification effect: by accepting a small price increase trade-off (the wide range powders are inexpensive), the rebounds result in a severe accumulative plastic deformation of the deposited particles and further reduction in porosity. These, in turn, lead to mechanical properties comparable to those produced under high processing parameters (i.e., using N2 gas at high temperatures or using expensive and unsustainable He as the propulsive gas). As a welcome benefit, the detrimental thermal effects encountered in cold spraying using high-temperature processing gas (such as oxidation, nitridation and phase changes) can be effectively minimized using the new low parameters strategy. Overall, the aim of this study is to propose a new manufacturing strategy to fabricate high-performance cold sprayed deposits without the use of expensive and unsustainable He gas.",

    "abstract": "If additively manufactured metal parts are to be used as performance critical components in the aerospace and other high-value industries, then non-destructive methods for measuring the porosity of these parts are required; X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is a promising instrument for this measurement task. One disadvantage of using XCT for this purpose is the presence of artefacts in XCT data of high-density materials (aluminium, titanium, steel and Inconel). These artefacts are problematic for segmentation algorithms that are required for porosity measurement. In this work we propose an adaptive thresholding algorithm for segmenting XCT data. The algorithm is specifically designed to overcome the influence of beam hardening (cupping) artefacts that are typically observed when XCT scanning high-density metal parts. The algorithm is also designed to have as few as possible user-defined settings in order to minimise the influence the user has on the segmentation result. The results show that the algorithm is able to segment small voids in low contrast-to-noise ratio XCT data and that the algorithm is robust to cupping artefacts. The accuracy of the method is evaluated for a set of Inconel cubes approximately 10 mm × 10 mm × 10 mm in size (H × W × D), reference porosity measurements are made using Archimedes' principle. The mean error and standard deviation of the XCT percentage porosity measurements evaluated by four different users are found to be: −0.38 ± 0.09%, 0.09 ± 0.09% and −0.23 ± 0.22% for samples with bulk porosities of 0.23 ± 0.28%, 1.42 ± 0.28% and 3.00 ± 0.28%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "3D printing metals via material extrusion utilizes a metal particle reinforced polymer matrix composite (PMC) as the filament which is typically made with gas-atomized powders as fillers. Its rheological behavior limits the maximum metal content of the printed green composite which, consequently, hinders further reductions to part porosity and shrinkage. In this paper, the scaling of the dynamic viscosity of melt-extruded PMC filaments made of PLA and Ni-Cu gas-atomized powders is studied as a function of the metal’s volumetric content and feedstock pre-mixing strategies and correlated to its extrudability performance. Extrudable and uniform filaments with the highest metal content of 63.4 vol% were produced by employing solution-mixing of the PMC feedstock and compared to physical mixing which only reached 54 vol%. After sintering, the improved metal content of 3D printed parts from solution-mixing reduced linear shrinkage by 76% in comparison to physical mixing, resulting in an absolute shrinkage value of 0.49%. By characterizing the PMC feedstock via flow-sweep rheology tests, a distinct extension of the shear-thinning zone towards high shear rates (i.e. 100 s−1) at high metal content was observed for the case of solution-mixed feedstock – a result that is attributed to the improved adhesion of the PMCs to the walls of the rheometer. PMCs with such characteristics correlated well to favorable extrudability and windability test outcomes (i.e. no particle jamming or metal accumulation at the die). The Krieger-Dougherty analytical model was employed to predict the zero-shear rate viscosity as a function of the metal content in the PMCs, however, the latter property is not necessarily correlated to the viscosity at high shear rates (10–1000 s−1) due to a complex shear thinning response. Since PMCs experience high shear rates in the die orifice, additional theoretical models are needed to predict shear-thinning at high metal content in PMCs and, thus, improve our prediction of PMC’s rheology, its design, and extrudability to maximize its metal content.",

    "abstract": "In metal additive manufacturing, the microstructures and associated mechanical properties of metal specimens can be controlled over a wide range. Although process parameters are considered important in the fabrication of functional parts, the effect of atmospheric gas has not been comprehensively documented. In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), gas flow is used to eliminate fumes generated by laser irradiation. Simultaneously, the gas removes heat from the laser-irradiated part, which is exposed to high temperature. In this study, we investigated the capacity of helium as an alternative to argon, which is conventionally used as the LPBF atmosphere gas. He has a higher thermal conductivity and lower gas density than Ar, which may result in enhanced heat removal from the Ti-6Al-4V alloy during fabrication. Numerical simulations suggest a greater cooling rate under He flow. Further, the material built under He flow contained finer α' martensite grains and showed improved mechanical properties compared to those fabricated under Ar flow, despite the identical laser irradiation conditions. Thus, He gas is advantageous in LPBF for fabricating products with superior mechanical performance through microstructural refinement, and this is a result of its capacity for cooling and fume generation inhibition. Therefore, this study reveals the importance of the choice of atmospheric gas because of its effects on the characteristics of metallic specimens fabricated using LPBF.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the potential of selective laser melting (SLM) of stainless steel CL 20ES powder was investigated with a focus on controlled fabrication of porous structures with strongly reduced pore sizes, i.e. feature sizes significantly below conventional minimum SLM feature sizes. By controlling laser scan properties interacting with the powder bed directly, porous structures can be generated by selectively sintering powder particles. A wide range of porous samples was manufactured following this strategy, aiming to increase porosity while keeping pore sizes low. The effect of process parameters, including laser power and focal point positioning, was evaluated for a fibre laser operated in pulsed wave (PW) emission mode. The first part of this study focuses on characterization of key porous structure properties, i.e., porosity, average mass density, average pore sizes and structures at microscopic scales. The second part deals with the influence of porosity and pore sizes on thermal and fluid properties, i.e., the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) and wettability. We have quantified the directional dependence (build direction plane and scan direction plane) off the structural and thermophysical properties of porous structures. For a range of porosities and pore sizes, we have observed that porosity and surface morphology influence the thermal properties and contact angle of droplets on the printed surface. Thermal conductivity was measured and the associated analysis was compared with available models and correlations in literature. The average thermal conductivity of fabricated porous structures was determined between 6−14 W/m K and found to be a function of porosity. Furthermore, the capillary wicking performance of additively manufactured stainless steel porous structures having an average pore radius from 9 to 23 μm was determined.",

In fact, it can provide useful information for the validation of the global level assumptions that numerical models of structures have to make, but are hard to validate as large-scale tests are very expensive. To this end, this paper suggests the use of a Binder Jet printer to manufacture small-scale masonry models. The first step for such a validation procedure is the determination of the mechanical properties of the bulk material printed with a Binder Jet printer. Compression and bending tests on a sand based printer that uses furan binder shows that the bulk material presents anisotropy in compression, but to a lesser degree than other powder based printers. In tension, the anisotropy is found to be statistically insignificant – in stark contrast with values reported in the literature for powder based printers. Aging is found to be crucial for the mechanical properties: They are found to reach a plateau after 15 days of curing time. No scale phenomena were observed for length scales between 50 and 100 mm.",

    "abstract": "The auxetic cellular structures with two different chiral geometries (tetrachiral and hexachiral) were fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technology from two different materials (aluminium alloy AlSi10Mg and stainless steel AISI 316L). The specimen's microstructure, porosity and surface texture were observed by X-ray diffraction, optical and electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography. The mechanical properties of all specimens were determined experimentally with a simple tensile test. The results show that hexachiral and tetrachiral auxetic structures have similar initial stiffness, whereas the former provides a more ductile response with more than four times larger failure strain. The AISI316L steel provides for a much more ductile response than AlSi10Mg at comparable normalised load-carrying capability. The samples' deformation behaviour was analysed with the digital image correlation and tracking method, where it was shown that hexachiral samples exhibit a lower Poisson's ratio. The experimental results were used to validate the corresponding computational models, providing a more detailed analysis of deformation behaviour. They allow for cost-effective parametric studies and the development of new optimised chiral geometries.",

    "abstract": "The unrivalled design freedom of additive manufacturing makes it a valuable technology for the automotive and biomedical industry, where the advanced design- and optimization-driven aspiration of ideal lightweight components often leads to complex thin-walled structures that are, if at all, hardly feasible with conventional production methods. In selective laser sintering, however, the variability of mechanical properties that depends on a multitude of factors still complicates the technology's extensive implementation for the production of structural parts. Recently, build orientation and wall thickness were shown to affect the mechanical properties of laser sintered PA12 considerably. The material behavior arising from the interaction of these two factors remains unclear. To gain a more complete understanding in this matter, mechanical properties were evaluated via tensile testing for coupons in four thicknesses and build orientations. Additionally, porosity characteristics including spatial distributions and pore morphology were analyzed by means of X-ray micro-computed tomography in order to investigate their influence on the mechanical material behavior. Investigations disclosed distinct losses in Young's modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break with decreasing wall thicknesses for all build orientations. Moreover, results revealed that the degree of anisotropy in the mechanical properties changes with decreasing wall thickness. Microstructural porosity analysis delivered valuable insights into the origins of the peculiar macroscopic structural response and yielded a better understanding of the material as well as potential for improvement of the laser sintering process.",

We describe the design considerations, details on the setup and the implementation at two different beamlines of the Swiss Light Source. Its capabilities are demonstrated by ex situ printing of complex shapes and operando X-ray diffraction experiments using Ti-6Al-4V powder. It is shown that the beamline characteristics have an important influence on the X-ray footprints of the microstructural evolution during 3D printing. From the intensity of the diffraction peaks, the evolution of the different phases can be followed during printing. Furthermore, the diffuse scattering signal provides information on the precise location of the laser beam on the sample and the scanning head settling time.",

Herein, we present the fabrication of ceramic microstructures (< 200 × 200 × 200 μm3) with sub-micrometer resolution based on two-photon polymerization (TPP). 3D structuring of a preceramic resin by photopolymerization produces a so-called green body. The final ceramic part is obtained after pyrolysis of the green body. The high-resolution 3D shaped structures that we demonstrated could be employed as tools or components for microdevices. We report a lower linear shrinkage of 30% of TPP green bodies from a polysiloxane precursor with low porosity, no cracks and no significant shape distortion after pyrolysis, which implies the potential for highly controllable manufacturing of micro-ceramic parts based on commercially available chemical compounds. The protocol for preparing, fabricating and developing the resin is detailed.",

The devices comprise an emitting electrode with a monolithic array of emitters and an extractor electrode that triggers the electrohydrodynamic emission of ions from the emitter tips. The emitters are solid cones coated with a nanoporous, hydrothermally grown ZnONW forest that transports ionic liquid to the emitter tips. The emitting electrodes are 3D-printed using either SS 316L via binder jetting or FunToDo Industrial Blend resin via vat polymerization. The extractor electrode is 3D-printed using SS 316L via binder jetting. Experimental characterization of the devices in vacuum using an external collector electrode and the ionic liquid EMI-BF4 shows bipolar pure-ion emission with maximum per-emitter current on the order of microamperes, maximum per-emitter thrust on the order of a fraction of a micronewton, and an average of ~95% beam transmission, resulting in 100% polydispersive efficiency and a significantly higher specific impulse for a given bias voltage compared to state-of-the-art devices. This development is of great interest for miniaturized spacecraft propulsion and focused ion beam applications.",

    "abstract": "When designing parts for additive manufacturing (AM), users must consider manufacturing restrictions specific to the chosen AM production technology. For material extrusion or laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), users need to follow design rules such as avoiding geometries with critical overhangs. If users create the 3D part geometry manually using computer-aided design (CAD), the consideration of design rules can be challenging and time-consuming. Especially for complex-shaped parts, novice designers may need multiple loops to analyze and modify CAD features for manufacturability. This manual process prevents users to quickly transfer the layout design of a part into the corresponding production-ready 3D part geometry. Therefore, it is highly desirable to automate the manual CAD process, including the consideration of AM restrictions. This work aims to automate the CAD-based design of AM parts with fluid flow channels. For this purpose, the work presents automated procedures that generate and modify design features such that they automatically comply with the AM overhang constraint. The procedures focus on flow components such as hydraulic manifolds and include design features such as support-free flow channels, integrated and sacrificial supports, and other features such as boreholes, interfaces, ribs, and channel branches. To enforce the overhang constraint in the generation of features, users define the part orientation to the build direction, and values for the minimum build angle and maximum allowed diameter of horizontally oriented circular cross-sections. As a benchmark, the work demonstrates the procedures by revisiting an earlier AM hydraulic manifold. Given restrictions of L-PBF of stainless steel, the study uses the procedures to generate manufacturable 3D manifold designs for different part orientations. One of the manifold variants is fabricated to show the manufacturability of the generated 3D part designs. The work finishes by discussing the benefits of the procedures, their transferability, and enhancements to generate manufacturable and functionally optimized designs.",

In this study we investigate the correlation between printing parameters, resin composition and the final properties of 2PP structures fabricated with different monomers and initiators. The link between 2PP process and final material properties is validated by morphological studies, vibrational spectroscopy and advanced mass spectrometry, ToF-SIMS, imaging. We establish empirical relationships between printing parameters and mechanical properties, and achieve controlled deposition of different monomers with high precision and uniform composition. The approaches developed here are successfully used to demonstrate multi-material 2PP and produce complex 3D architectures incorporating three polymers. The 2PP structures produced can be transferred into solution or onto different substrates, in addition to direct fabrication on flexible substrates. This work advances the understanding of the 2PP process, which enable rational design and manufacture of complex geometries and additive manufacturing of nanoscale multi-material structures.",

In this study, ultra-high-speed x-ray radiography experiments enable the observation and characterization of bundles of hot-cracks that form in monobloc AA6061 substrate. The crack bundles are related to meltpool characteristics and pore formation. Crack propagation rate is also presented for the case of a crack that initiates from a pore. Two types of relevant pore formation are also described, namely keyhole porosity and crack-remelting porosity. The results of this study are expected to facilitate the validation of theoretical and numerical models of solidification cracking.",

    "abstract": "The PBF-LB/M (laser-based powder bed fusion of metals) process is associated with high as-built surface roughness and surface texturing caused by a variety of process inherent effects. It is well known that surface roughness is influenced by the applied processing parameters and correlates with porosity. In terms of reactive materials like Ti-6Al-4V, also the powder recycling grade and especially the residual oxygen content within the processing atmosphere play important roles regarding process stability, reproducibility and part properties. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of the residual oxygen content on porosity and surface roughness for virgin as well as recycled powder by employing DoE techniques. Within the examined range, unlike for the roughness, no significant influence of residual oxygen content and powder constitution on porosity could be detected. It could be shown that the reproducibility of relative density mainly depends on the processing parameter combination. Furthermore, powder recycling led to higher top and side surface roughness and a dependence of surface texture on processing parameters could be demonstrated.",

The existing approaches related to digital twins of AM mainly focus on the process, machine, and factory levels to monitor and optimize the process and system performance of AM. This study aims at the machine level and adopts augmented reality (AR) to develop a digital twin for a material extrusion printer. To provide a digital representation of the printing process of a component, this study has proposed an approach using cumulated small cylinders to approximate the geometry of the component, which is called \"Volume Approximation by Cumulated Cylinders (VACCY)\". To monitor the economic and environmental performance, this study has modeled four process indicators (electricity use, manufacturing cost, greenhouse gas emission, and primary energy consumption) and integrated them in the AR-based digital twin. Through the test of the developed digital twin for printing three components, the feasibility and performance of the developed digital twin are well demonstrated.",

This paper reports strategies to use sacrificial molds 3D printed by fused deposition modeling (FDM) from PVA or digital light processing (DLP) from water soluble resin. Usage of sacrificial molds allows injection molding of complex geometries, which are not accessible for simple two-part molds. Ceramic heating elements in diverse geometries were injection molded using a composite feedstock containing MoSi2, Al2O3 and feldspar. More parts with various geometries were produced from Al2O3 feedstock. A comparison revealed that DLP printed molds are better suited for parts with very small structural features due to the higher resolution of the DLP process as compared to FDM. Finally, ceramic heaters were fabricated using two-component ceramic injection molding and successfully tested.",

MetalJet, the Océ developed technique used in this study, has the capacity to produce molten micro-droplets (60–80 µm) at temperatures up to 2000 °C to form single and multi-material objects. Applications for this technology include flexible circuits, advanced electronic components and biotechnologies. However, full exploitation of this technology is impeded by a lack of understanding of various aspects of the process, including droplet bonding and interface formation, residual stress development and the evolution of microstructure. This paper uses an integrated numerical and experimental approach to provide insights into these research questions. Thermal models were used to investigate droplet-to-substrate adhesion and explain the experimentally-observed morphology of droplets. Thermo-mechanical modelling was used to investigate residual stress development and its role in the observed droplet warping and delamination. The knowledge obtained from this study can be used to underpin the development of functional multi-material printing.",

    "abstract": "Strut-based lattice structures produced by powder bed fusion are prone to characteristic manufacturing defects that alter both their form and surface texture. Most studies in the literature focus on a subset of commonly observed defects, typically radius variation and strut waviness; surface defects remain relatively unexplored. Furthermore, there remains a need for the development of a general finite element modelling framework that can implement a range of defects into any strut-based lattice design. This paper presents a modelling framework for implementing a range of both form and surface defects into finite element meshes of strut-based lattices. A signed distance function forms the foundation for this framework, upon which surface meshes can be modified and converted into tetrahedral meshes via open-source software. The paper demonstrates how radius variation, strut waviness, elliptical cross sections and surface defects can be modelled in lattice struts, for which intuitive mathematical definitions are provided. A parametric study is performed to assess the sensitivity of the compressive Young's modulus of BCCZ and octet-truss lattices to upskin and downskin surface defects. The results showed higher sensitivity in the octet-truss than in the BCCZ; both designs were more sensitive to downskin defects than upskin defects.",

Pure argon and helium, as well as a mixture of those (30% helium), were employed to establish process atmospheres with a low residual oxygen content of 100 ppm O2. The results highlight that the subsurface residual stresses measured by X-ray diffraction were significantly lower in the thin samples (220 MPa) than in the cuboid samples (645 MPa). This difference was attributed to the shorter laser vector length, resulting in heat accumulation and thus in-situ stress relief. The addition of helium to the process gas did not introduce additional subsurface residual stresses in the simple geometries, even for the increased scanning speed. Finally, larger deflection was found in the cantilever built under helium (after removal from the baseplate), than in those produced under argon and an argon-helium mixture. This result demonstrates that complex designs involving large scanned areas could be subjected to higher residual stress when manufactured under helium due to the gas's high thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and thermal diffusivity.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) enables fine control over the architecture and mechanical properties of porous lattice structures. Typical periodic unit cells used in porous structures are inherently anisotropic, may not be suitable for multi-axial applications and cannot reliably create features or struts with low build angle. This study used laser powder bed fusion (PBF) to create isotropic stochastic porous structures in stainless steel (SS316L) and titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), with modifications that aimed to overcome PBF manufacturing limitations of build angles. The structures were tested in uniaxial compression (n = 5) in 10 load orientations relative to the structure, including the three orthogonal axes. The testing verified that no hidden peaks in elastic modulus existed in the stochastic structure. Modification to the structure reduced the standard deviation of the 10 elastic modulus values from 249 MPa to 101 MPa when made in SS316L and from 95.9 MPa to 52.5 MPa for Ti6Al4V, indicating the structures were more isotropic. These modified stochastic structures have improved stiffness isotropy and could be used for lightweighting and biomaterial applications, reducing the dependence of performance on build orientation, and allowing more flexibility for component orientation on the build platform.",

    "abstract": "Titanium-aluminide (TiAl) alloys are very promising substitutes for Ni-based superalloys, and additive manufacturing, which is a disruptive technology, is a promising way to fabricate them. Ti-(37−52) at% Al walls were successfully synthesized in situ using dual-wire electron beam freeform fabrication (EBF3), and the solidification behavior was characterized according to their chemical composition, phase identification, microstructure and orientation. The Ti-37 at% Al wall was composed of α2 grains with an average size of 100 µm and a random orientation distribution, indicating that the primary phase was the β phase and that the solid-state β→α transformation occurred. The orientation relationships, namely (0001)α//{111}γ and <112¯0>α//<11¯0]γ, were found in the lamellar structure of the Ti-42 at% Al walls, and the α2 phase and γ grains presented < 0001 > and < 111 > orientations in the deposition direction, respectively. This suggests that the formation of a lamellar structure was the result of the solid-state α → α2 + γ transformation, where the α phase was the primary phase. The solid-state α →γ lamellae and α →γ massive transformations in the Ti-49 at% Al wall caused the massive γ phases to have a random orientation and the lamellar γ phases to be oriented along the < 012 > and < 010 > directions in the building direction. The γ dendritic structure, a characteristic solidification structure, indicated that the solidification path of the Ti-52 at% Al wall was L→γ. Solidification during the EBF3 process deviated from the thermodynamic equilibrium state, and the metastable phase formed in the liquid phase as the primary phase. The solidification conditions, including the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions and cooling rate, were analyzed. The results indicate that the primary phases were selected by undercooling, and the microstructure of Ti-xAl (x = the actual Al content in at%) alloys during the EBF3 process was determined to correspond to an estimated undercooling temperature of 240–247 K. However, the cooling rate during solidification was 214.36 K/s, which was not enough to produce such a high undercooling temperature. The high undercooling temperature was the result of melt superheating and electron beam oscillation. A novel solidification process with a low cooling rate and a high undercooling temperature occurred during EBF3.",

    "abstract": "Fabricating parts using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is of growing interest to many fields, ranging from medical to aerospace, but this process is often plagued with residual stresses that can reach magnitudes as high as the yield strength of the material. Previous work has demonstrated the ability to reduce residual stress during LPBF by over 90% using an in situ annealing method that makes use of large area, shaped light illumination from a set of laser diodes. In this work, an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of this in situ residual stress reduction technique is presented. A custom LPBF system was used to fabricate 316L stainless steel parts, and the stresses of these parts were analyzed using the contour method and neutron diffraction on various planes within the samples. These spatial measurements revealed stress reductions near the edges and base of the samples in each of the three measured orthogonal stress directions, in addition to an overall reduction in stress owing to in situ application of laser diode heating. The experimental results were found to be in excellent agreement with numerical thermomechanical simulations that captured the effects of various processing parameters. Furthermore, in cases where the annealing was only performed once every 5 layers, the residual stress was similarly reduced, which indicates that further optimization might be achieved to limit additional processing time during the builds while still relieving equivalent amounts of stress.",

Parts to be additive manufactured of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS Terluran GP 35) with mechanical properties close to the data sheet specification of injection molded parts are in the focus of this study. An in-house process chain from the plastic pellets to the finished additive manufactured product is developed to monitor and to define the process parameters for each individual processing step using the terpolymer. By varying the parameters extrusion nozzle diameter and layer height, the production-related internal part structure and the surface topography of the additive manufactured tensile test specimens are improved in such a way that the mechanical property yield strength rises from 55% to 75% of the data sheet specification for injection molded ABS parts. The elongation at break increases from 42% up to 70% of the specified data. The smallest extrusion nozzle diameter in connection with the smallest layer height provide the densest internal part structure, the lowest surface roughness and the best mechanical properties. Especially the ductility was controlled by the manufacturing parameters since the number of pores introduced in the internal part structure determine the number of crazes. Apart from ductility, even with low layer height but larger extrusion nozzle diameter, the resistance to failure of the material extrusion manufactured parts improves significantly and saves manufacturing time by a factor of 10.",

    "abstract": "As an evolution from foam structures, latticed structures have demonstrated incredible potential for fabricating components with tunable characteristics. Due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattice structures are promising for lightweight, high-strength structures. Recently, there has been growing attention in studying architected structures as their geometrical parameters can be tailored to control the performance both mechanically and thermally. These findings in the literature raised the attention that a combination of two or more lattice topologies can realise a more advanced performance. In the present work, we present an integrated numerical-experimental investigation into the performance of two surface-based lattice structures - AlSi10Mg primitive and Schoen's I-graph-wrapped package (I-WP), with different cell sizes and strut thicknesses manufactured by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). Quasi-static compression tests with digital image correlation were performed to evaluate their mechanical performance. Based on their respective response to loading, the two topologies were hybridized for a bespoke engineered mechanical performance. Finite element analysis was conducted based on data extracted from standard tensile tests on solid samples to develop a model that can be utilized to design a lattice with the desired performance. Microscopy and X-ray micro-computed tomography (XCT) were deployed to assess surface and internal defects in the printed lattices, which were then correlated to the failure mechanisms under loading. Despite observing a significant difference in the strength exhibited by the two designs, both behaved in a brittle manner. Hybridising the two distinctive designs into one lattice structure successfully yielded an intermediate mechanical behaviour, showing the approach as a good candidate for engineering failure modes in structural applications.",

    "abstract": "Interest in multi-axis additive manufacturing has grown significantly in recent years due to associated benefits that range from improved quality to support for greater geometric complexity. A method of 5-axis Laser Hot-Wire Directed Energy Deposition is developed and demonstrated in this study using an 8-axis industrial robot, comprised of a 6-axis serial link robot and a 2 degree‐of‐freedom positioner. Coordinated 5-axis motion is used to print Ti-6Al-4V objects predominantly through build plate rotation. Methods of slicing and toolpath generation are presented, including the use of an alternating toolpath direction philosophy and the manipulation of the CAD model surface normal vectors for determining the required build plate tilt angles for maintaining consistent deposition orientations relative to gravity. Another objective of the study was to determine the limits of conventional slicing and layer height control techniques for printing geometries with significant unsupported overhangs. A comparison is made between the behavior of normal and conformal bead alignment in this regard, and the performance of the layer height controller is reported as it relates to process stability and the limits of printing overhang geometries. Unsupported overhangs were successfully printed at 35° without build plate tilt and 45° with build plate tilt. Toolpath velocity and net-shape printing performance are reported as well, with 3D scans of the printed surfaces used for net-shape characterization. In all, the printing of three geometries is presented, including the overhang geometry, a 5-axis toolpath geometry, and a large-scale, multi-bead demonstrator part, which exceeded 500 mm in height and weighed 44 kg (97 lbs).",

    "abstract": "Filament extrusion-based additive manufacturing of metals offers an alternative to the widespread beam-based counterparts. The microstructure obtained from extrusion-based techniques differs greatly from the ones obtained by beam-based additive manufacturing, as a sintering process is used, in contrast to the rapid solidification of a melt pool. In this study, the microstructure of 316L stainless steel fabricated by filament extrusion is investigated as a function of debinding and sintering conditions. High-speed nanoindentation correlated with energy-dispersive X-ray mapping is employed for microstructural characterization. High sintering temperatures of 1350 °C, an atmosphere of pure H2, and a cooling rate of 60 K/m are found to result in the optimal microstructure. High densities are obtained due to accelerated densification, enabled by the introduction of diffusion paths due to δ-ferrite formation. At the same time, hard phases like oxides or σ-precipitates with detrimental effects on the mechanical properties can be avoided. It is shown that the porosity can be quantified by analysis of hardness and modulus data from nanoindentation mapping. The values obtained are in good agreement with optical and Archimedes immersion method measurements. Tensile tests of 3D-printed and sintered specimens show excellent ductility and strength in comparison to literature. We demonstrate that 3D printing of 316L filaments and sintering with the optimized conditions results in material properties comparable to bulk values.",

Wire-based AM processes meet these demands but suffer from higher heat inputs that can lead to thermal distortion and large heat-affected zones neighboring the melt pools. Here, the tensile deformation response of an Al 4043 (Al-Si) alloy deposited on an Al 6061-T6 substrate using a laser hot-wire AM process was investigated. Digital image correlation during tensile testing was combined with optical microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction data to understand the deformation mechanisms that occurred in samples from a deposited wall in the as-built condition. During tensile testing, localized deformation was observed at the melt pool boundary regions that correlated with serrations on the stress-strain curve. The primary aluminum dendrites in regions adjacent to the melt pool boundary regions were coarser than in bulk deposited material, leading to localized deformation of the coarser microstructure. EBSD post-test analysis confirmed that the accumulated strains had occurred in the melt pool boundary regions. Analysis of the thermal and solidification conditions in the melt pool indicated that the coarsened region was associated with partial remelting of the eutectic phase. This understanding of deformation mechanisms associated with the inhomogeneities at melt pool boundaries can enable AM-specific considerations for improved process and alloy design, particularly for eutectic alloys.",

The additive manufacturing process can produce such materials with excellent energy-harvesting performance and various required properties, including mechanical properties—by optimizing the lattice structure of the material. This study optimized the manufacturing parameters of a laser powder bed fusion process to produce a magnetostrictive Fe52–Co48 alloy. We evaluated the energy-harvesting performance of a Fe52–Co48 alloy plate with a honeycomb structure subjected to vibrations and impacts. We compared the results with a fully dense structure and found that the honeycomb structure resulted in a lower resonant frequency. In addition, the honeycomb structure exhibited a power density 4.7 times higher than that of the fully dense structure in a vibration test and 4.9 times higher than that in an impact test. The honeycomb structure is thus an attractive structure for obtaining power efficiently. Furthermore, honeycomb structures and other designs can reduce the weight of a Fe52–Co48 alloy plate and improve its sensitivity for use as a particulate-matter sensor.",

This paper presents a novel fabrication process called Automated Robotic Concrete Spraying (ARCS) by which glass fibre reinforced concrete (GFRC) is sprayed onto a curved formwork to create thin shell components of variable thickness. The trajectory planning and generation algorithm developed and implemented in ARCS to create such components is presented. Two sets of prototype shells were fabricated: one which forms the segments of a larger structural floor demonstrator and another consisting of a single component with deep ribs on a thin shell. The sequencing used to generate the spray paths for each component is outlined, with each prototype using two different strategies to add ribs onto the fabricated shells. While the fabrication process has been used in conjunction with a pin-bed mould actuating flexible formwork to create the spraying surface, the trajectory planning approach is adaptable enough such that any formwork can be utilised. Combined with the output speed of material deposition, ARCS offers the potential to enable mass production and customisation of doubly-curved ribbed structural concrete shells of variable thickness as an industrial process at an architectural scale. • A new fabrication process to create curved concrete shells with ribs is presented. • A robotic trajectory planning algorithm leveraging isolines of geodesics was formulated. • Two sets of ribbed concrete shell prototypes were fabricated using the process developed. • The high throughput of the fabrication process lends itself to offsite mass production.",

A crucial step to consolidate 3D-printed ceramic parts is \"sintering\", a time and energy (temperature) intensive densification process. Here we present a strategy for rapid sintering (∼ 300–450 °C/min) of lithography-based additively manufactured alumina ceramics enabling consolidation of ceramic components of complex shapes within minutes. Highly dense, fine-grained microstructures were achieved by controlling densification and limiting grain growth through rapid radiation heat transfer. The high mechanical strength and toughness measured in additively manufactured alumina (∼ 810 MPa and ∼ 4.3 MPa m1/2) sintered at 1600 °C within 2 min was superior to that of conventionally sintered reference parts. This study opens the path for rapid sintering of complex shaped ceramic architectures of high density with tailored microstructure and properties.",

    "abstract": "Powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) is the most commonly used additive manufacturing process for the layerwise production of metal parts. Although the technology has developed rapidly in recent years, manufactured parts still lack consistent quality primarily owing to process-inherent variability, and the lack of effective sensing technologies enabling the ability to control the process during part production. Thus, there are high costs caused by rigorous post-process part inspection steps required to provide compliant part certificates. In contrast to typically deployed in-situ sensing technologies, eddy current testing (ECT) is a standardized nondestructive testing (NDT) technique able to provide compliant part certificates during post-process inspection according to existing standards. This study investigates the potential of ECT as an in-situ process monitoring technology for PBF-LB/M. Parts made from AlSi10Mg were manufactured on a PBF-LB/M machine using different process parameters yielding different relative densities ranging from 99%– 99.7%. During the build cycle, the parts were measured layer-by-layer with an ECT system mounted on the machine recoater. Signal analysis methods were developed which effectively separate and calibrate the electrical conductivity component (relative electrical conductivity) and the distance component (lift-off) of the ECT signals. The relative electrical conductivity was then compared to X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) measurement data demonstrating that layer-to-layer differences in relative density of about 0.1% can be successfully detected via ECT. In addition, the lift-off was used to monitor the thickness of the consolidated layers and the layer-to-layer part height. The results show that ECT is an effective technology for in-situ monitoring of the relative part density paving the way for deploying ECT for in-situ NDT of PBF-LB/M-manufactured parts.",

    "abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing processes can create intricate components that are difficult to form with conventional processing methods; however, the as-printed materials often have fine grain structures that result in poor high-temperature creep properties, especially compared to directionally solidified materials. Here, we address this limitation in an exemplary additively manufactured Ni-base superalloy, AM IN738LC, by converting the fine as-printed grain structure to a coarse columnar one via directional recrystallization. The directional recrystallization behaviors of AM IN738LC were characterized through a parameter study in which the peak temperature and draw rate were each independently varied. Recrystallization began when the peak temperature was higher than the γ′ solvus of 1183 °C. Varying the draw rate from 1 to 100 mm/hr while maintaining a fixed peak temperature of 1235 °C and a thermal gradient of order 105 °C/m ahead of the hot zone showed that a draw rate of 2.5 mm/hr maximized the grain size, giving a mean longitudinal grain size of 650 µm. Specimens processed under these optimal conditions also inherited the 〈100〉 fiber texture of the as-printed material. Close inspection of a quenched specimen revealed Zener pinning of the longitudinal grain boundaries by MC carbides and a discrete primary recrystallization front whose position followed the γ′ solvus isotherm. The present results demonstrate for the first time how directional recrystallization of additively manufactured Ni-base superalloys can achieve large columnar grains, manipulate crystallographic texture to minimize thermal stresses expected in service, and functionally grade the grain structure to selectively enhance fatigue or creep performance.",

    "abstract": "A Single laser scan was performed on a sintered WC/Co composite and the process conditions were optimized to realize a WC/Co two-phase microstructure in a WC/Co composite fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). Laser irradiation on the sintered WC/Co composites generated two different microstructural regions. One is composed of WC and Co phases (WC/Co two-phase region), and the other includes W2C and W3Co3C phases (WC decomposition region). In the L-PBF-fabricated WC/Co composites, these two microstructural regions are distributed in a complex manner and their fractions varies depending on the laser parameters. Using a convolutional neural network model that is trained with the micrographs of single-laser-scanned WC/Co composites, the fractions of the two microstructural regions in the WC/Co composites fabricated by the L-PBF under various laser conditions were quantified. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the laser power and spot size contribute more than the scan speed, which has been verified by numerical analysis based on the moving heat source model. A support vector machine (SVM) suggested that low laser power and low scan speed are required for suppressing the WC decomposition in the consolidated samples. The WC decomposition has been successfully suppressed in the samples fabricated under SVM-recommended conditions.",

    "abstract": "Within coating applications, cold-spray is nowadays an extended technique commonly used in environments such as the additive manufacturing or repair industries. The differential factor that leads this approach to be chosen over others is its low deposition temperature. The need for ensuring the resistance and durability of the free-standing components has led to the development of models that can predict the kinetic energy of the particles, which is the main driving parameter affecting the deposit performance. In this study, an optimisation theoretical model, previously developed by the authors, is validated with the experimental exit particle velocity data taken from commercial geometries and using Fluent simulations available in literature. The aim of this work is to relate fundamental parameters in the cold-spray process such as the stagnation conditions, nozzle geometry, powder size or particle velocity. This objective is achieved by creating novel interdependent maps connecting these pivotal data by virtue of the model presented. Several graphs describing the final particle velocity depending on the stagnation pressure and temperature are obtained along with the optimal geometry for a wide range of materials (aluminium, titanium, steel, Inconel 625 and copper). In addition, the analytical model is able to hand over a deposition window of particle sizes and velocities that can be achieved using a specific cold-spray equipment. Both set of maps combined together can be a powerful tool which users and manufacturers can benefit from on the grounds that they do not only provide information about whether a deposition can be achieved or not with a cold-spray equipment but also about the stagnation conditions needed. The results obtained with this methodology reflect the limitations of low and medium-pressure equipment in terms of the maximum particle diameter that can be deposited and constitute a novel advance in the state of art of cold-spray. Moreover, the fundamental parameter regarding the geometry, namely the ratio between the nozzle exit and the nozzle throat diameters, is represented as a function of the above-mentioned parameters.",

    "abstract": "Lattice structures offer desirable functionality for engineering design such as having a high strength-to-weight ratio and efficient heat exchange. Lattice parameters can be adjusted to achieve specific benchmarks such as porosity, surface area, weight, or mechanical performance. One of the biggest challenges of creating components with lattice structures is that they are difficult to fabricate with conventional methods due to their complex, highly periodic shape. Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques such as stereolithography (SLA) vat photopolymerization (VPP) have emerged as manufacturing methods for successfully creating these structures. However, a seamless characterization and subsequent understanding of the relationship between base material properties and lattice geometry across a wide range of porosity has not been fully investigated. In this study, SLA VPP was used to print structures from two distinctly different lattices, specifically the TPMS (triply periodic minimal surface) gyroid and strut-based diamond lattices, five unique photopolymer materials with varying stiffness and strength, and twenty-six levels of porosity ranging from 34% to 84%. The broad porosity sweep provides a more continuous understanding of the impact of porosity on mechanical behavior. Analysis of mechanical and volumetric properties yielded several discoveries, including substantial effects of photopolymer resin viscosity and porous volume fraction on volumetric accuracy, printability, and defects. Based on the experimental data we propose a model for predicting mechanical properties as a function of porosity that outperformed the traditional Gibson-Ashby model. The discoveries and methods included in this work provide a foundation for future analysis of mechanical and volumetric properties of 3D printed lattices across an expansive range of structural porosities and materials.",

Our method is composed of two phases, which are the TO-based subdivision and the TO-based simplification. Starting from a lattice structure with self-supporting lattice unit cells in a coarse resolution, a subdivision method is proposed to adaptively generate the lattice structure based on the density-based topology optimization framework. The subdivision operators are well-designed to preserve self-supporting property on struts, and a filtering approach is proposed to avoid overhanging nodes. To remove redundant struts on the lattice structures generated by subdivision, a simplification method is developed to satisfy the required volume while a self-supporting constraint is incorporated to ensure the manufacturability of the resultant structures. Our method has been tested on both 2D and 3D examples. Experimental tests demonstrate that our method can effectively generate self-supporting lattice structures with stronger mechanical strength.",

To satisfy these requirements, we develop a new algorithm to search a continuous path on G's dual graph, the corresponding path on which G minimizes the total energy of tuning angles and can visit all edges of G at least once and at most twice. With the help of a post-processing algorithm, a path determined on the dual graph can be converted into an overlap-reduced toolpath for printing continuous carbon fiber. Physical tests were conducted to demonstrate the advantage of printing paths generated by our algorithm. Up to 46% enhancement on the breaking force is observed during the tensile tests when using a similar amount of fibers.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing allows for the production of intricate geometries with reduced material waste. However, due to the complex thermal gyrations that are linked to the processing parameters and geometry, inconsistencies in microstructures and mechanical properties occur from build to build. These inconsistencies are exemplified in multi-phase alloys such as 17-4 precipitation hardened (PH) stainless steel where the formation of ferrite, austenite, and martensite is sensitive to the powder composition and thermal conditions. The work presented here investigates a concentric scan strategy's impact on thermal conditions within laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) processed 17-4 PH stainless steel, and the resulting phase formation and morphologies that occur. Through the combined use of computational materials science and experimental characterization, complex phase transformation routes were identified as being dependent on the site-specific thermal gyrations within the builds. Within the outer regions of the builds, a primarily δ-ferrite solidification microstructure was identified with two notable morphologies of austenite detected, allotriomorphic and Widmanstätten austenite. Within the center of the sample, however, a primarily austenite microstructure that nucleated from the prior δ-ferrite was identified. Small fractions of α-ferrite and/or martensite were potentially identified within the austenite grains. These results are rationalized using computational thermodynamics and kinetics in conjunction with proposals for pathways towards site-specific control of phase formation and morphology in PBF-LB/M stainless steels.",

    "abstract": "Material extrusion with a thermoplastic polymer enables the simultaneous fabrication and poling of piezoelectric sensors; however successful implementation of electromagnetic interference (EMI) protection has yet to be achieved. This research addresses key challenges such as encapsulating the sensor in a limited space without affecting the poling process, the high resistance of the conductive filaments causing low-pass charge filtering, and the need for electrical contact with EMI-protected measurement devices. The presented design principles enable the fabrication of a fully 3D-printed piezoelectric sensor in a single process that includes a piezoelectric sensing element, wire, and a connector interface, all EMI-shielded. Strategies such as inter-trace extrusion filling and electrode ironing are introduced to avoid electrode short circuits and electric poling issues. In addition, the 3D-printed interface allows direct connection to commercially available connectors and measurement devices. As a force sensor, the fully 3D-printed piezoelectric sensor with full EMI shielding has an excellent signal-to-noise ratio of 27dB and reduces noise for more than two orders of magnitude if compared to the partially shielded sensor. This research is an important step forward in fabricating and embedding piezoelectric sensors in a single process that offers a wide range of applications in fields such as structural health monitoring, robotics, and biomedical engineering, where a high degree of customization is required.",

    "abstract": "In situ monitoring is critical to the increasing adoption of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and laser welding by industry for manufacture of complex metallic components. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an interferometric imaging technique adapted from medical applications, is now widely used for operando monitoring of morphology during high-power laser material processing. However, even in stable processing regimes, some OCT depth measurements from the keyhole (vapor cavity formed at laser beam spot) appear too shallow or too deep when compared to ex situ measurements of weld depth. It has remained unclear whether these outliers are due to imaging artifacts, multiple scattering of the imaging beam within the keyhole, or real changes in keyhole depth, making it difficult to accurately extract weld depth and determine error bounds. To provide a definitive explanation, we combine inline coherent imaging (ICI), a type of OCT, with synchrotron X-ray imaging for simultaneous, operando monitoring of the full 2-dimensional keyhole profile at high-speed (280 kHz and 140 kHz, respectively). Even in a highly turbulent pore-generation mode, the depth measured with ICI closely follows the keyhole depth extracted from radiography (>80% within ±14 µm). Ray-tracing simulations are used to confirm that the outliers in ICI depth measurements (that significantly disagree with radiography) primarily result from multiple reflections of the imaging light (57%). Synchrotron X-ray imaging also enables tracking of bubble and pore formation events. Pores are generated during laser welding when the sidewalls of the keyhole rapidly (>10 m/s) collapse inwards, pinching off a bubble from the keyhole root and resulting in a rapid decrease in keyhole depth. Evidence of bubble formation can be found in ICI depth profiles alone, as rapid depth changes exhibit moderate correlation with bubble formation events (0.26). This work moves closer to accurate, localized defect detection during laser welding and LPBF using ICI.",

    "abstract": "The development of three-dimensional (3D) printed sensors attracts high interest from the smart electronic industry owing to the significant geometric freedom allowed by the printing process and the potential for bespoke composite feedstocks being imbued with specific material properties. In particular, feedstock for material extrusion (MEX) additive manufacturing by fused filament fabrication can be provided with piezoelectricity and electrical conductivity. However, piezoelectricity often requires electrical poling for activation. In this study, a candidate material containing thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and carbon black (CB) with conductive and flexible properties is incorporated with piezoelectric elements like polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) to assess its suitability for sensor applications without electrical poling. Texturing the surface of BaTiO3 particles and adding tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (TPPC) to the composite are evaluated as non-poling treatments to improve the sensor response. It was found that TPU and PVDF produced segregated domain structures within the printed sensors that aligned along the printing direction. Due to the effect of this preferential orientation combined with the presence of raster-raster interfaces, printed sensors exhibited significant electrical anisotropy registering greater electrical waveforms when the electrodes aligned parallel to the raster direction. An improvement of current baseline from 0.4 µA to 12 µA in the parallel direction was observed in sensors functionalised with both treatments. Similarly, when the waveform responses were measured under a standardised impact force, current amplitudes in both orientations registered a twofold increase for any impact force when both treatments were applied to the feedstock material. The results achieved within this study elucidate how composite formulations can enhance the sensor response prior to conducting electrical poling.",

    "abstract": "As-built Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) Ti-6Al-4V typically exhibits a fully acicular α′-martensite microstructure, and requires post-process heat treatment in order to decompose the martensite and achieve sufficient ductility. In the present study, we demonstrate a simple concept based on in-situ Selective Laser Heat Treatment (SLHT) that can effectively alter the microstructure and activate the decomposition of the α′-martensite into a lamellar α+β microstructure within a short time scale (~30 s). SLHT consists of multiple rescanning of the printed part, with low energy density, triggering solid-state phase transformations. Operando X-ray diffraction has been performed on cuboid and thin wall geometries, and was augmented by thermal finite element simulations. Upon SLHT, a gradual formation of the β phase as well as an α/α′peak narrowing trend have been evidenced through X-ray diffraction, as an indication of the diffusional nature of α′-martensite decomposition. Moreover, through fine tuning of the process parameters at the final stage of SLHT, a controlled temperature evolution during cooling was achieved, leading to preservation of the β phase, a product of the decomposition, down to room temperature. Complementary microstructural characterizations via EBSD, SEM, and TEM confirm the presence of a lamellar α+β microstructure after SLHT. Our results evidence, for the first time, the fast kinetics of α′-martensite decomposition under in-situ SLHT. The approach is meant to be implemented at selected locations during the LPBF process, avoiding time-consuming post processing steps, and leading to composite-like, architected microstructures.",

However, the lack of experimental data related to blast-resistant lattice structures poses challenges in developing and validating theoretical and numerical models. This study aims to design blast-resistant lattice structures that can improve protection efficiency at wider applicability in high-strain rate loadings. For that, hybrid-layered Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS) lattice structures were systematically designed using a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach and manufactured using additive manufacturing (AM). The Blast Hopkinson Pressure Bar (BHPB) rig was used to compare the influence of different lattice topologies and relative densities on energy absorption when specimens were subjected to compressive blast loading. High-speed imaging was utilised to measure transient deformation in addition to the load transferred through the specimens. The experimental results indicated that the BHPB rig could appropriately measure the energy absorption of compressive structures subjected to shockwave loading. Additionally, the results demonstrated that TPMS topology and relative density changes substantially affect its performance. The DoE approach was utilised to predict the performance improvements of layered-hybrid lattice structures, providing valuable data for blast protection specialists and engineers designing AM lattice structures to resist blast loading.",

    "abstract": "Directed energy deposition via electric arc (DED-Arc) and wire-feed system can offer a low-cost, high deposition rate method to produce large-scale, near-net-shape structural components from Inconel 718 (IN718). In this work, DED-Arc with cold metal transfer (CMT) has been compared with pulsed-spray droplet transfer (GMAW-P) using different build strategies by correlating the local cyclic thermal histories and the position of deposition interruptions to the resulting tensile properties. The measured heat input (0.18 – 0.59 kJ/mm) and inter-pass temperature (80 – 650 °C) affected the thermal field and residence times in the 900 – 600 °C temperature range, where γ'/γ\" phases are more likely to form, thereby impacting the yield strength along the build direction (370 – 460 MPa). Furthermore, CMT deposition with a lower travel speed (0.4 m/min vs. 1.0 m/min) prevented the onset of solidification defects, contributing to more consistent tensile ductility. Tensile properties of material surrounding build interruptions developed strain localisation and failed prematurely as compared to regions without, due to localised cracking and transient thermal fields generated once the deposition resumed.

    "abstract": "The incorporation of pyrolyzed biomass, i.e., biochar, in polymers can be viewed as a sustainable approach that reduces bio-waste in a smart way. Herein, various biochar concentrations were integrated into the biobased polyamide 11 (PA11) matrix via in situ polymerization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs demonstrated the homogeneous dispersion of up to 50 wt.% biochar within the PA11 matrix, free from any phase separation, particle agglomeration, or crack formation. Consequently, there was a remarkable enhancement in mechanical and thermal properties. Notably, tensile strength and modulus increased by 35% and 72%, respectively, while the thermal decomposition process was significantly delayed with the incorporation of biochar particles. Furthermore, the viscoelastic performance of the PA11 matrix exhibited substantial improvement upon the addition of the filler particles. These impressive results verified the excellent interfacial compatibility achieved between the PA11 matrix and biochar, owing to the utilization of in situ polymerization. To demonstrate the potential application of these composites in additive manufacturing, a filament with a uniform diameter was fabricated from a composite comprising 50 wt.% biochar. It was successfully employed in material extrusion to print a complex object. The resulting structure exhibited high shape fidelity, precise dimensions, and no noticeable defects. This groundbreaking strategy not only highlights the utilization of biochar as a sustainable filler but also underscores the efficacy of in situ polymerization in fabricating high-performance PA11/biochar composites for various demanding applications, including filament production for additive manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Sodium polyacrylate is a superabsorbent polymer, capable of absorbing hundreds of times its own mass in water. This property, and the swelling behaviour during absorption, has seen application in diverse areas, including as anti-flood measures, water-retentive soil modifiers and recently soft actuators. However, this material is typically used in granular form or in simple cast shapes, which limits the scope of application. The ability to 3D print this material would widen its applicability, but previous demonstrations of sodium polyacrylate printing have shown a significantly reduced degree of swelling when compared to the typical material. In this work, we demonstrate material extrusion of a sodium polyacrylate-based ink, with a total swelling factor of over 200 being retained in the printed material. The rheological properties of this ink are modified with Carbopol, an acrylic acid based polymer, and are determined to show that the ink is strongly shear-thinning (with flow behaviour index under 0.14) and indicating desirable response for this type of printing. We further demonstrate the printability through a range of empirical tests. This new approach to sodium polyacrylate printing significantly widens the scope of application of this reactive hydrogel, while introducing the potential for application in novel soft actuators which harness the high degree of swelling and the shape changing/4D behaviour of the material as it swells.",

    "abstract": "A supersaturated γ phase microstructure is produced in Ni-based superalloys using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) – the cooling rate arising from the process is shown to suppress the solid-state precipitation of the γ′ phase. The response of the material to a heat treatment therefore requires new understanding at the fundamental level, since the first population of γ′ precipitate forms upon heating, in contrast to cooling from homogenisation above the γ′ solvus. Here, we have interrogated two new nickel-based superalloys designed for the L-PBF technology, both in situ and ex situ, at multiple length scales using advanced characterisation methods. First, we conducted in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction during various heat treatments to trace the evolution of the γ′ volume fraction with temperature. The first structural changes were detected at an unexpectedly low temperature of ∼445 °C. Second, the temperature for γ′ nucleation and its sensitivity to heating rate was studied using an electrical resistivity method. Then, the γ′ composition upon heating, isothermal holding and cooling is analysed using atom probe tomography (APT), the result is rationalised by further scanning-transmission electron microscopy and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectroscopy. Finally, static recrystallisation during isothermal exposure was investigated, which occurs within minutes. This work sheds light on a new strategy of tailoring microstructure for additively manufactured superalloys by manipulation of the γ′ precipitate distribution upon heating.",

    "abstract": "Volumetric additive manufacturing has a number of advantages as compared to conventional additive manufacturing methods, but it can still suffer from premature sedimentation in which the part sinks down during the printing process - especially in the final seconds- affecting the method’s geometric fidelity, resolution, and limits its applicability only to high-viscosity resins. In this study, a numerical model has been developed to investigate the effect of different material properties and process parameters on the sedimentation of the printed part. After a qualitative validation of the model, the role of the resin viscosity in the sedimentation phenomenon is elucidated, and it is shown how a rise in the cross-section ratio of the printed geometry to the container can reduce the sedimentation, while an increase in the curing time and the container’s rotation velocity can escalate the sinking of the part. Furthermore, it is found that raising the final density and viscosity of the curing material at the end of the print will worsen and mitigate the sinking effect, respectively. Finally, the effect of the orientation of the printed part on the sedimentation ratio is explored. The model developed herein illuminates a new avenue for better understanding the physics taking place during volumetric additive manufacturing, which is essential to further improve the applicability of the technology.",

    "abstract": "3D printing of yield stress fluids (i.e., materials able to flow like liquids only beyond a critical stress) is opening new doors in the fields of construction, food or medicine. The usual printing technique consists to extrude and then deposit a filament of yield stress fluid onto the previous layer. One major difficulty is that, during the deposition process, some instabilities may appear and have a catastrophic impact on the final 3D structure. Here we show that these instabilities can be predicted as a function of the material properties and/or the printing parameters. More generally, we study the deposit of a filament from systematic tests with a model yield stress fluid, varying the material yield stress value, the distance between the nozzle and the substrate, the extrusion velocity, the nozzle diameter, and the nozzle displacement velocity. We show that a diversity of patterns arises: drops, discontinuous lines, straight lines, meanders, alternating loops or translated loops. Then, we demonstrate that the transitions (frontier curves) between pattern regions can be predicted by theoretical arguments. Finally, we present a generic diagram predicting the patterns observed as a function of dimensionless numbers function of the various characteristics of the system. This provides a reference scheme for optimizing practical processes or devising specific deposit patterns, valid for a wide range of conditions and yield stress fluids.",

Its anatase form is characterized by excellent photocatalytic properties in presence of UV light, which justify its use for pollutants degradation or for the realization of self-cleaning surfaces. The potential of titania can be further valorized by integrating its unique properties in 3D printed parts and the most promising technology to do this, in consideration of its high resolution and flexibility, is vat photopolymerization. In the present work, titania/polymer composites are 3D printed using this technology and the resulting materials, containing nominal titania amounts up to 10% wt., are characterized from the morphological, microstructural and mechanical point of view. In addition, their photocatalytic activity is evaluated by performing Rhodamine B degradation tests under UV light. The composites showed remarkable activity levels, with a rate constant higher than 0.25 h-1 for the composite containing 10% wt. titania. Activity was increased by a local enrichment of TiO2 in correspondence of the surface, resulting from the 3D printing process, and by a partial degradation of the polymer present between the titania particles in proximity of the surface.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid manufacturing integrates additive manufacturing (AM) and subtractive manufacturing in the same machine. The integration of the two processes enables the creation of complex geometry, further reduces material waste, and decreases lead time. Moreover, this in-envelop method enables an interleaved printing strategy in which the part is partially AM printed and then machined repeatedly. This method is not available in either traditional manufacturing or AM technologies. Nevertheless, measuring and controlling of distortion and residual stress are still challenging due to highly varying process conditions and limited access to the machine during hybrid additive/subtractive manufacturing processes. Moreover, the residual stress measurement is ex-situ process, so it only gives information at the final stage of stress evolution. Therefore, it's nearly impossible to know the AM induced residual stress distribution before the machining process in hybrid additive/subtractive process. In this prospective, numerical modeling can be an effective tools to overcome those challenges. However, the modelling/simulation methods for fully-coupled additive and subtractive operation has not reported to the best of our knowledge. In this work, we developed a comprehensive simulation method using finite element method (FEM) for fully-coupled additive and subtractive manufacturing process. The results were validated with strain measurements by neutron diffraction in two different machining conditions: hot-machining and cold-machining. The validated model was used to investigate how machining affects part distortion and evolution of residual strain/stress during fabrication. Alternating tensile-compression longitudinal (ε11, x-direction) strains and stresses along the build direction showed the physical interaction of additive and subtractive steps in the interleaved strategy. The alternating pattern was found in both the model and neutron diffraction measurements. This work's findings can be used to develop strategies to control of part distortion and residual stresses in the hybrid additive/subtractive manufacturing process.",

    "abstract": "Many studies highlight the significance of three-dimensional surface topography characterization in assessing its effect on the mechanical or functional properties of materials. This is especially obvious for parts made by additive manufacturing (AM), known for their complex shape and surface topographies. However, a vast majority of 3D characterizations have constraints regarding the macroscopic geometry of the parts they can probe. At the microscale, they are also unable to account for hidden surface features, e.g. notches hidden by unmelted powder particles. Even with the use of X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) - a tool with the potential to circumvent these issues - data is often reduced to 2D or 2.5D formats for easier analysis, but this leads to a loss of information. This underscores the need for XCT data post-treatment tools to perform thorough 3D surface characterizations. Herein, we introduce a methodology for local roughness and curvature characterization of surfaces of complex shapes using XCT. This method has been designed to be user-friendly, especially for those without extensive data analysis expertise. It provides a comprehensive 3D characterization and efficiently tackles the issues caused by hidden features. After a detailed description of our methodology, we give a first illustrative example based on architected structures fabricated by Electron Powder Bed Fusion (E-PBF). By integrating roughness and curvature metrics, we also derive a parameter indicative of the stress concentrations caused by surface irregularities.",

    "abstract": "Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures have been extensively studied for their exceptional mechanical characteristics. However, numerical analysis of their fracture behaviour remains insufficient due to the complexity of the fracture mechanisms. This study aims to utilise a new phase field model to predict the mechanical responses and analyse the fracture mechanism of TPMS gyroid and primitive structures. Firstly, the gyroid (G) and primitive (P) structures were additively manufactured using Ti-6Al-4V titanium and tested under both axial and oblique compression. Secondly, an explicit phase field model was developed by incorporating the Bao-Wierzbicki fracture model to capture damage initiations. It was found that the explicit phase field enables accurate reproduction of experimental force-displacement responses, deformation modes, crack initiations and propagations for G and P structures under both loading conditions. It is noted that medium stress triaxiality tension was the dominant stress state to trigger material damage, regardless of structure and loading conditions. Thirdly, compared with axial compression, it is found that oblique loading introduced a more non-proportional loading history, leading damage initiation points to being far away from the fracture locus. Further, in comparison with the G structure, the P structure involved more medium and high stress triaxiality tension induced fracture initiations, resulting in more damaged material points. This study offers valuable insight into the fracture mechanism of triply periodic minimal surface structures, which is beneficial to improving the design of those structures.",

By combining microstructural analysis, thermodynamic calculations, and an adapted precipitation model, we examine how precipitates change during solidification, in-situ heat treatment (IHT), and post-heat treatment (PHT). We establish a comprehensive classification system for primary and secondary Sc-rich precipitates based on their origin, location, morphology, composition, interaction with other precipitates, and size. Notably, primary precipitates are observed within the fine-grained (FG) zone, and their characteristics suggest further modification during IHT and PHT. The developed precipitation model, coupled with multi-scale thermal simulations, accurately predicts the formation of small homogeneous secondary L12-Al3Sc precipitates during PBF and PHT, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for optimizing PBF processes for components with complex geometries and different thermal conditions. Our findings reveal that while the employed IHT conditions did not induce secondary precipitation, subsequent PHT at 400°C for 1 hour led to the formation of secondary precipitates via both continuous and discontinuous mechanisms. Addressing limitations in understanding primary precipitate formation during PBF and incorporating both homogeneous and heterogeneous mechanisms in future models are crucial for a deeper understanding of Scalmalloy® precipitation behavior and PBF process optimization.",

    "abstract": "Because of their enormous potential in biofabrication, adsorption, catalysis, and energy conversion applications, there has been substantial attention to fabricating 4D printed hierarchically porous structures from the molecular level to the macroscopic dimensions. To this end, an understanding of the structure-feature relationship of smart materials in 4D printing is necessary to design innovative constructs, which are not limited to any specific degree of freedom. Here, we report on the fabrication of thermo-responsive macroporous polymerized-high internal phase emulsions (poly-HIPEs) through 3D printing of Pickering-type HIPEs. The oil-in-water Pickering-HIPE-based inks contained methylcellulose/kappa-carrageenan blend (non-crosslinked) as a continuous phase, which was colloidally stabilized by a hybrid of cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibers. The Pickering-HIPE-based inks showed a non-linear and time-dependent oscillatory response with excellent viscoelastic interfacial properties. The poly-Pickering-HIPEs were readily fabricated by in-situ crosslinking of Pickering-HIPEs during hot-melt extrusion-based printing, which produced a series of 3D printed thermo-responsive hierarchical macroporous structures. The 4D printed objects presented a highly interconnected open-cell porous structure, which was thermo-responsive in nature. Moreover, these 4D structures showed high mechanical strength with outstanding self-recovery performance. Our results offer the prospect of developing a thermo-responsive macroporous construct having shape memory features at different temperatures by regulating emulsion formulation.",

    "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing (AM), and especially Material-Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MEAM), can provide light structures with high mechanical performances for aerospace applications using fiber reinforced high-temperature resistant thermoplastics (HTRT). Non-planar AM allows to manufacture curved parts with a better approximation of their curvature than cartesian AM. In this paper, we additively manufactured a proof of concept of multi-functional non-planar sandwich panel for aircraft casing using a 6-degree of freedom (6-DOF) robotic platform in a custom heating enclosure, using 30 wt.% carbon-reinforced polyetheretherketone (PEEK). Curved beams manufactured using planar and non-planar deposition techniques were manufactured using a custom heating enclosure and reinforced HTRT. The measured surface deviation of the non-planar curved beam (NPCB) was 31% lower than the planar curved beam (PCB). Due to the non-planar deposition that led to a better alignment of the layers along the specimen, the effective stiffness measured during 3-point bending tests was also increased by ~28% compared to PCB, showing the importance of a non-planar deposition. Additively manufactured non-planar sandwich panels containing an acoustic core and two types of microscaffolds (30% infill microscaffold and 78% infill walled microscaffold) were characterized through optical microscopy and 3-dimension (3D) scanner measurements. The 6-DOF robotic platform, combined to the heating enclosure, allowed to print a portion of a non-planar carbon fiber reinforced PEEK sandwich panel to present the versatility of the structures that could be printed with this setup. The use of non-planar reinforced HTRT structures could find applications in the aerospace field for aircraft noise reduction structures, but also in the biomedical domain for the manufacturing of biocompatible PEEK scaffolds.",

    "abstract": "The optimal design seeks the best possible solution(s) for a mechanical structure, device, or system, satisfying a series of requirements and leading to the best performance. In this work, optimized nozzle shapes have been designed for a wide range of polymer melts to be used in extrusion-based additive manufacturing, which aims to minimize pressure drop and allow greater flow control at large extrusion velocities. This is achieved with a twofold approach, combining a global optimization algorithm with computational fluid dynamics for optimizing a contraction geometry for viscoelastic fluids and validating these geometries experimentally. In the optimization process, variable coordinates for the nozzle's contraction section are defined, the objective function is selected, and the optimization algorithm is guided within manufacturing constraints. Comparisons of flow-type and streamline plots reveal that the nozzle shape significantly influences flow patterns. Depending on the rheological properties, the optimized solution either promotes shear or extensional flow, enhancing the material flow rate. Finally, experimental validation of the nozzle performance assessed the actual printing flow, the extrusion force and the overall print control. It is shown that optimizing the nozzle can significantly reduce backflow-related pressure drop, positively impacting total pressure drop (up to 41 %) and reducing backflow effects. This work has real-world implications for the additive manufacturing industry, offering opportunities for increased printing speeds, enhanced productivity.",

    "abstract": "Thermal debinding of 3D-printed ceramics that include a large fraction of polymeric binders, can take several days to perform, and often includes a long thermal pre-conditioning step. In addition, means to reduce the manufacturing time are limited. This applies for thermal debinding of dense ceramics, such as dental restorations, that have been printed using vat photopolymerization (VPP) based technologies. The thermal debinding of such ceramics can be made faster, more economical, and more ecological by extracting selected slurry components prior to thermal debinding. Thus, creating flow channels for pyrolysis gases originating from the remaining binder polymers to exit the material. Here, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) extraction was used to create such gas flow channels and to study which slurry components can be dissolved from VPP printed polymeric and ceramic/polymeric parts without significant delamination, cracking, or part deformation. The scCO2 extraction resulted in the creation of significant 33 vol.% of nanosized porosity in a pure polymeric as-built print, and 21 vol.% of nanosized porosity in a ceramic/polymeric composite print, where the ceramic powder remains in the part. These gas flow channels may allow faster thermal debinding while avoiding the creation of other defects. In the process, 90 wt.-% of the dissolvable resin fraction was extracted from the ceramic/polymeric prints already in 2 h without significant delamination, while 70 wt.-% of the dissolvable resin fraction was extracted in 2 h from the pure polymeric prints as a reference. This presents a novel, successful demonstration of a chemistry that allows both VPP printing and scCO2 extraction.",

The use of the promising near-infrared laser wavelength in laser powder bed fusion of polymers is limited by the need for absorption-enhancing (nano-) additives and insufficient knowledge of the (nano-) particulate impact on the material and process behavior. The presented study lays the groundwork for an improved understanding of the laser-material interaction at different states of matter in laser powder bed fusion by means of thermo-optical measurements with a double integrating sphere setup. The authors characterize polyamide 12 and its nanocomposite powder surface-coated with carbon black nanoparticles by two different additivation methods. The attenuation coefficient and penetration depth of each material were calculated based on the measured transmittance and reflectance in all relevant states of matter. The effects of the feedstock particle size, the nano-additivation method, and the nanoparticle quantity were evaluated. The optical results of resolidified samples were validated using a commercially available spectrophotometer. Finally, the authors were able to qualitatively correlate the thermo-optical results with the depth of fusion of specimens processed at 808 nm.",

Understanding the porosity knowledge accessible to micro-CT technologies relies on quantifying the spatial and morphological characteristics of porosity instances. So far, machine learning-based semantic segmentation techniques and threshold-based image analysis methods have been employed for this purpose. However, the reliability of these methods is compromised by their limitations in segmentation accuracy and delineating connected pores. This work proposed a porosity investigation strategy involving a deep learning-based instance segmentation process on micro-CT slices followed by a 3D reconstruction process to reliably examine the spatial and morphological data of 3D porosities, cased studied by a wire arc directed energy deposited Ti-22 V-4Al alloy. Systematic data analysis captured new insights of pore defects in terms of pore formation tendency, the relationship between pore size and pore sphericity, pore evolution, and the discovery of pore-free zones. The proposed workflows are transferrable for the porosity investigation of other additively manufactured components. The new insights may also guide future advancements in porosity elimination and manipulation techniques to fabricate mechanically robust complex structured components.",

    "abstract": "3D ice lithography (3DIL) is an emerging method for fabricating polymeric 3D objects with submicrometer patterns. However, there are no studies on 3DIL using metal-containing precursors. In addition, unlike numerous post-processing studies of two-photon polymerization (2PP) and focused electron beam-induced deposition (FEBID), there are no 3DIL post-processing investigations. Here, we present a 3DIL process using an organometallic precursor (gold dimethyl acetylacetonate, Au(acac)Me2), and its first post-processing study. We investigated 3D processing parameters and post-processing using Ar-, air annealing, and O2 plasma. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used for materials analysis. Our results show (i) 3DIL processed materials exhibit thermoset properties, as they decompose rather than melt at elevated temperatures; (ii) free metal atoms diffuse and form clusters, here, gold nanoparticles with a diameter of around 10 nm were formed; (iii) oxygen treatments remove carbon-based ligands while leaving noble metals behind. Also, Ar annealing leads to less material loss than air annealing, while O2 plasma generates oxidized Au states and efficiently removes carbon ligands. Ar annealing at 600 °C reduces the carbon XPS signals significantly and increases the gold XPS signal by ten times, giving a good purification effect but with a high material removal of around 95 %. We printed large Au metalorganic 3D structures (>1000 times larger volume than FEBID), which suggests 3DIL bridges the gap between the capabilities of 2PP and FEBID. The unique capabilities of organometallic compounds to detect environmental changes can position 3DIL for sensing applications, and 3DIL is a safe and non-toxic technique to manufacture nanoparticle-containing 3D structures, which may have applications in many fields such as nanophotonics, drug delivery, and catalysis.",

    "abstract": "Unlike more established subtractive or constant volume manufacturing technologies, additive manufacturing methods suffer from a lack of in-situ monitoring methodologies which can provide information relating to process performance and the formation of defects. In-process evaluation for additive manufacturing is becoming increasingly important in order to assure the integrity of parts produced in this way. This paper addresses the generic performance of inspection methods suitable for additive manufacturing. Key process and measurement parameters are explored and the impacts these have upon production rates are defined. Essential working parameters are highlighted, within which the spatial opportunity and temporal penalty for measurement allow for comparison of the suitability of different nondestructive evaluation techniques. A new method of benchmarking in-situ inspection instruments and characterising their suitability for additive manufacturing processes is presented to act as a design tool to accommodate end user requirements. Two inspection examples are presented: spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography for scanning selective laser melting and selective laser sintering parts, respectively. Observations made from the analyses presented show that the spatial capability arising from scanning parameters affects the temporal penalty and hence impact upon production rates. A case study, created from simulated data, has been used to outline the spatial performance of a generic nondestructive evaluation method and to show how a decrease in data capture resolution reduces the accuracy of measurement.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (3D printing) enables the designing and producing of complex geometries in a layer-by-layer approach. The layered structure leads to anisotropic behaviour in the material. To accommodate anisotropic behaviour, geometrical optimization is needed so that the 3D printed object meets the pre-set strength and quality requirements. In this article a material description for polymer powder bed fused also or selective laser sintered (SLS) PA12 (Nylon-12), which is a common 3D printing plastic, was investigated, using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The Material Model parameters were obtained by matching them to the test results of multipurpose test specimens (dumb-bells or dog bones) and the model was then used to simulate/predict the mechanical performance of the SLS printed lower-leg prosthesis components, pylon and support. For verification purposes, two FEM designs for a support were SLS printed together with additional test specimens in order to validate the used Material Model. The SLS printed prosthesis pieces were tested according to ISO 10328 Standard. The FEM simulations, together with the Material Model, was found to give good estimations for the location of a failure and its load. It was also noted that there were significant variations among individual SLS printed test specimens, which impacted on the material parameters and the FEM simulations. Hence, to enable reliable FEM simulations for the designing of 3D printed products, better control of the SLS process with regards to porosity, pore morphology and pore distribution is needed.",

    "abstract": "Polyimides are a group of high performance thermal stable dielectric materials used in diverse applications. In this article, we synthesized and developed a high-performance polyimide precursor ink for a Material Jetting (MJ) process. The proposed ink formulation was shown to form a uniform and dense polyimide film through reactive MJ utilising real-time thermo-imidisation process. The printed polyimide film showed a permittivity of 3.41 and degradation temperature around 500 °C, both of which are comparable to commercially available polyimide films. Benefiting from the capability of being able to selectively deposit material through MJ, we propose the use of such a formulation to produce complex circuit board structures by the co-printing of conductive silver tracks and polyimide dielectric layers. By means of selectively depositing 4 μm thick patches at the cross-over points of two circuit patterns, a traditional double-sided printed circuit board (PCB) can be printed on one side, providing the user with higher design freedom to achieve a more compact high performance PCB structure.",

    "abstract": "Inkjet printing has been used as an Additive Manufacturing (AM) method to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) structures. However, a lack of materials suitable for inkjet printing poses one of the key challenges that impedes industry from fully adopting this technology. Consequently, many industry sectors are required to spend significant time and resources on formulating new materials for an AM process, instead of focusing on product development. To achieve the spatially controlled deposition of a printed voxel in a predictable and repeatable fashion, a combination of the physical properties of the 'ink' material, print head design, and processing parameters is associated. This study demonstrates the expedited formulation of new inks through the adoption of a high-throughput screening (HTS) approach. Use of a liquid handler containing multi-pipette heads, to rapidly prepare inkjet formulations in a micro-array format, and subsequently measure the viscosity and surface tension for each in a high-throughput manner is reported. This automatic approach is estimated to be 15 times more rapid than conventional methods. The throughput is 96 formulations per 13.1 working hours, including sample preparation and subsequent printability determination. The HTS technique was validated by comparison with conventional viscosity and surface tension measurements, as well as the observation of droplet ejection during inkjet printing processes. Using this approach, a library of 96 acrylate/methacrylate materials was screened to identify the printability of each formulation at different processing temperatures. The methodology and the material database established using this HTS technique will allow academic and industrial users to rapidly select the most ideal formulation to deliver printability and a predicted processing window for a chosen application.",

The distinct texture and microstructure distributions were characterised. In situ X-ray diffraction measurements show different lattice activities resulting from the different microstructure distributions. Spatially resolved mapping revealed manufacturing-induced crystallite-orientation distributions that determine the deformation mechanisms. We propose a self-consistent model to correlate the multi-scale characteristics, from the anisotropic-texture-distribution microstructure to the bulk mechanical properties. We determined that basal and pyramidal slip activities were activated by tension deformation. The underlying additive-manufacturing-induced crystal plasticity plays a major role. We find that the texture development of the columnar structures and the distribution of crystallite orientation achieved by different processing conditions during additive manufacturing have important effects on the mechanical properties. The dominant deformation mode for the anisotropic Ti-6Al-4V columnar structure is basal slip, and that for the isotropic Ti-6Al-4V columnar structure is pyramidal slip. The difference may be important for determining the fatigue behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the ferritic stainless steel SS441 was produced with excellent mechanical properties using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) compared to samples produced by conventional casting and hot-rolling. In addition, thermodynamic calculations were utilized to study the phase stability at elevated temperatures and to understand the solidification behavior. The hot-rolled sample showed a grain size up to several hundred μm with additional precipitates of TiN and Nb(C,N). In contrast, the as-built L-PBF samples displayed a grain size in the μm range. Spherical precipitates with a size of around 50 nm could be observed and were attributed to a corundum phase from the thermodynamic calculations. The printed material shows superior mechanical properties, with more than 30 times higher impact energy compared to the hot-rolled alloy (217 ± 5 J vs. 7 ± 0.5 J). Furthermore, the properties are anisotropic for the L-PBF produced alloy, with the highest tensile strength vertical to the build direction. The superior mechanical properties of the L-PBF produced sample can be attributed to a smaller grain size, giving a higher strength according to the Hall-Petch relationship. The anisotropy of the material can be eliminated by heat treatments at 900 °C followed by water quenching, but the absolute strength decreases slightly due to formation of intermetallic phases such as Nb(C,N) and the Fe2Nb Laves phase. The results clearly illustrates that L-PBF provides a promising manufacturing route for enhanced strength of ferritic stainless steels.",

    "abstract": "Test artifacts have been used to evaluate additive manufacturing (AM) systems since the early 1990s with over 65 artifacts published to date. Due to the system agnostic approach to artifact design, principally focused on geometric accuracy, there has yet to be a widely adopted artifact for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). To speed qualification of LPBF, a rapid method that quantifies impacts of process variables on part structure, properties, and performance is required. Using a list of design requirements developed from literature, build experience, and needs from several major roadmapping efforts, a test artifact was designed to evaluate geometry-specific microstructure, dimensional accuracy, residual stress, chemistry, surface integrity, powder removal, and distortion. The LPBF artifact includes: four sides for geometric feature accuracy and surface integrity analysis, indication marks for accurate sectioning for metallography, and additional features specifically designed to evaluate residual stress, powder removal, mechanical properties and distortion. The artifact is compact and designed to fit within a standard 50 mm metallographic mount with indication marks used to improve measurement repeatability and accuracy. Microstructure and anomaly population are quantifiable on features including overhangs, islands, thin features, channels, lattice structures and bulk areas representing different thermal histories. It is believed that this single test artifact can be used for many purposes, including optimization of LPBF input variables, qualification and more. Ongoing work is continuing to improve the artifact design, testing its implementation across LPBF platforms, and using the artifact to concretely define process sensitivity currently limiting standardization and adoption of LPBF due to costs associated with defining process windows in terms of qualification and certification. As part of this effort, the artifact described here forms the basis of the Global Test Artifact Data Exchange Program – a program designed and managed by the authors for the benefit of research to advance LPBF qualification efforts and help lead to more widespread adoption of LPBF (described in more detail at keck.utep.edu/GTADExP).",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) enables highly complex-shaped and functionally optimized parts. To leverage this potential the creation of part designs is necessary. However, as today's computer-aided design (CAD) tools are still based on low-level, geometric primitives, the modeling of complex geometries requires many repetitive, manual steps. As a consequence, the need for an automated design approach is emphasized and regarded as a key enabler to quickly create different concepts, allow iterative design changes, and customize parts at reduced effort. Topology optimization exists as a computational design approach but usually demands a manual interpretation and redesign of a CAD model and may not be applicable to problems such as the design of parts with multiple integrated flows. This work presents a computational design synthesis framework to automate the design of complex-shaped multi-flow nozzles. The framework provides AM users a toolbox with design elements, which are used as building blocks to generate finished 3D part geometries. The elements are organized in a hierarchical architecture and implemented using object-oriented programming. As the layout of the elements is defined with a visual interface, the process is accessible to non-experts. As a proof of concept, the framework is applied to successfully generate a variety of customized AM nozzles that are tested using co-extrusion of clay. Finally, the work discusses the framework's benefits and limitations, the impact on product development and novel AM applications, and the transferability to other domains.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing methods present opportunities for structures to have tailored mechanical anisotropy by integrating controlled lattice structures into their design. The ability to predict anisotropic mechanical properties of such lattice structures would help tailor anisotropy and ensure adequate off-axis strength at an early stage in the design process. A method is described for the development of a model to predict apparent modulus and strength based on structure density and fabric, taken from CAD data. The model utilises a tensorial form of well-founded power-law relationships for these variables and is fit to mechanical test data for properties in the principal directions of manufactured titanium stochastic lattices and nylon rhombic dodecahedron structures. The results are validated against mechanical testing across at least 7 additional off-axis directions. For stochastic structures, apparent modulus is predicted in 10 directions with a mean error of 13% and strength predicted with a mean error of 10%. For rhombic dodecahedron structures apparent modulus and strength are predicted in 15 directions with mean errors of 4.2% and 5.1% respectively. This model is the first to predict the anisotropic apparent modulus and strength of structures based on lattice density and fabric tensors and will be highly useful in the mechanical design of lattice structures.",

    "abstract": "The effect of the residual oxygen concentration in the process atmosphere during laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of Ti-6Al-4V was investigated, using an external oxygen monitoring system equipped with two types of oxygen sensors typically used in L-PBF hardware: a lambda probe and an electrochemical oxygen sensor. The recordings of the oxygen variations during L-PBF highlighted that the electrochemical sensor is more reliable than the lambda probe, whose signal showed a maximum deviation of about 700 ppm O2 after 7 h, attributed to its sensitivity to hydrogen present in the system. The study revealed that proper monitoring of the oxygen in the laboratory scale L-PBF system used is necessary to limit oxygen and nitrogen pick-ups by the built material. Concentrations as high as 2200 ppm O2 and 500 ppm N2 in the Ti-6Al-4V part built under standard conditions were measured, compared to maximum levels of 1800 ppm O2 and 250 ppm N2 with the external oxygen control. In addition, the findings underline the critical effect of the component design, such as the high aspect ratio columns or the lattice structures, on the heat accumulation in case of Ti-6Al-4V, leading to enhanced oxygen and nitrogen pick-up, as high as 600 ppm O2 and 150 ppm N2 difference between the bottom and top of the cylindrical samples of 70 mm height used in this study. The determination of tensile properties of samples built at different heights put in evidence the detrimental effect of the oxygen increase with build height on the ductility, which decreased from 12% to below 6% between the bottom and top positions. This work highlights that the possible presence of impurities in the L-PBF atmosphere can have harmful impact on the properties of Ti-6Al-4V components, which can be mitigated adjusting the oxygen control system.",

    "abstract": "As well as preventing oxidation, a cross-flow of inert gas over the powder bed extracts process by-products, making it critical for process repeatability and build quality during the additive manufacturing of metallic parts. In this study, high-magnification schlieren imaging was employed to visualise the interactions between the cross-flow, laser plume and individual powder particles for the first time. Novel 3D multiphysics simulations of the cross-flow, including the vapour jet and laser plume, were used to calculate energy, momentum and species transport over the processed area in order to understand and quantify the observed interactions. During processing, metallic fumes as well as a significant number of airborne powder particles and agglomerates were observed to remain close to the powder bed, over the scanned area. These particles interact in a range of stochastic collisions that affect the build consistency. Refractive index gradients were formed in the atmosphere above the island scans, which extended many tens of mm beyond the processing area. The rate of extraction of these by-products, regulated by the velocity of the cross-flow, was related to the quality of the builds. A cross-flow perpendicular to the laser scan direction was observed to remove airborne particles from adjacent laser scans most effectively, limiting laser-particle and particle-particle interactions. The model demonstrated that the refractive index gradients away from the vapour jet are due to the metal concentration rather than the temperature of the heated gas.",

The study was carried out during the printing of Ti6AL4V parts using a production scale SLM system (Renishaw RenAM500 M). By-product particles were obtained on the surface of powder removed from the area around where the pulsed laser powder treatments had been carried out. The process by-products examined in this study were damaged Ti6AL4V particles along with condensate. The particles were found to exhibit deshelling, fracture, and collision damage. Based on TEM and SEM examination, the condensate particles were found to have sizes in the nanoscale range and exhibited morphologies, similar to those reported in the literature for welding condensates. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis indicated that the condensate formed from processing Ti6AL4V, exhibited a higher level of aluminum than that obtained for the alloy itself, lower levels of titanium with minimal vanadium levels, were also obtained. This may indicate that the alloy partially decomposes, with the emission of the lower melting point alloying element. The use of an in-situ melt pool monitoring system (called Renishaw InfiniAM Spectral), was evaluated for detecting the presence of these by-product particulates, based on photodiode measurements of the melt pool emissions, along with a camera-based imaging of visual per layer conditions. A reduction in the intensity of infrared emissions was detected, in areas where suspected spatter particles had been redeposited. Thus, demonstrating that process monitoring can be used for the in-situ detection of particulate defects formed during printing.",

In this study, the MSM alloy Ni50.5Mn27.5Ga22.0 was built via laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) using gas atomized powder doped with excess Mn to compensate for the expected evaporation of Mn during L-PBF. The built samples were subjected to stepwise chemical homogenization and atomic ordering heat treatments. The experiments followed a systematic experimental design, using temperature and the duration of the homogenization treatment as the varied parameters. Overall, the produced samples showed only a minor variation in relative density (average density ~98.4%) and chemical composition from sample to sample. The as-built material showed broad austenite-martensite transformation and low saturation magnetization. The crystal structure of the as-built material at ambient temperature was a mixture of seven-layered modulated orthorhombic (14 M) and five-layered modulated tetragonal (10 M) martensites. Notably, ordering heat treatment at 800 °C for 4 h without homogenization at a higher temperature was enough to obtain narrow austenite-14 M martensite transformation, Curie temperature, and saturation magnetization typical for bulk samples of the same composition. Additionally, homogenization at 1080 °C stabilized the single-phase 14 M martensite structure at ambient temperature and resulted in considerable grain growth for homogenization times above 12 h. The results show that post-process heat treatment can considerably improve the magneto-structural properties of Ni-Mn-Ga built via L-PBF.",

    "abstract": "Scalable production using additive manufacturing (AM) requires quality systems that monitor and control manufacturing variability across many machines in a factory environment. AM process variability can result in geometric inaccuracies in parts that can affect their mechanical behavior; however, most research focuses on a single machine and hardware set, while part inaccuracy and AM variability across multiple printers remains poorly understood. This study establishes a framework to study the accuracy of polymer parts made on three identical printers and evaluates the role of manufacturing process parameters and their impact on part variability. We fabricate 90 polymer hexagonal lattice parts over nine builds on three identical Carbon M2 machines with interchangeable hardware tools. Each part is measured using automated metrology that extracts the size and shape of the part features and automatically measures defects. Each hexagonal part consists of 237 individual walls that were measured for 90 parts, resulting in 21,330 individual geometric measurements. Using statistical methods to analyze geometric defects as a function of machine, hardware set, and location in the build, we find that the observed variability can be correlated with process parameters. Geometric defects in the wall thickness depend upon machine and location within the build but do not depend on the hardware tool, while geometric defects in the wall length and height of the part depend upon machine and tool but not location. The uniformity within the parts, measured by standard deviations of the individual features within a part, mostly depends upon unmeasured parameters. We use a generalized linear model (GLM) to model the variability and to predict defects. The framework introduced here can be extended to analyze additional machines and process parameters and provides a practical tool to account for manufacturing variability in an AM production environment.",

    "abstract": "Due to the layer-based nature of the powder bed fusion (PBF) process, part surfaces oriented in space at varying angles with respect to the build direction are differently affected by a wide array of manufacturing-induced phenomena (staircase effects, spatter, particles, etc.), which can significantly influence the functional behaviour of such surfaces, and choices for post-processing where needed. For assessing surface topography of PBF surfaces most researchers have looked at surface texture parameters (profile - ISO 4287 and areal - ISO 25178−2). Texture parameters provide useful summaries of surface-wide properties, but do not allow the analysis to focus on specific topographic formations of interest. On the contrary, feature-based characterisation encompasses a series of recently introduced methods that allow to isolate and characterise specific topographic formations of interest starting from topography datasets acquired with conventional areal topography measurement solutions. In this work, the topography of electron beam powder bed fusion (EBPBF) surfaces as a function of orientation with respect to the build direction was investigated using a combined approach consisting of both texture parameters and feature-based characterisation. A custom-designed test part featuring surfaces at different orientations was measured with a focus variation instrument. A feature-based characterisation pipeline was implemented for the identification, isolation and geometrical characterisation of spatter formations and particles present on the as-built surfaces. The surfaces deprived of the identified features were then characterised by means of conventional ISO 25178−2 texture parameters. The results confirm that combining feature-based characterisation with conventional analysis through texture parameters creates new perspectives for looking at EBPBF surfaces, thus better supporting future research endeavours aimed at achieving a more comprehensive insight on the nature of EBPBF surfaces. For the first time quantitative results are provided on number, shape and localisation of spatter and other particles in EBPBF surfaces as a function of build orientation, and texture parameters are provided that describe the fabricated surfaces in a more reliable way as particles and spatter formations have been removed.",

Hereby, we report on the printing of superhydrophobic objects composed of patterns of micropillars. Superhydrophobicity is an important property of surfaces that has applications in various fields such as self-cleaning, drag reduction, increased buoyancy, and air conditioning. Most existing methods for the fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces are complicated and time-consuming. Here, we performed a simple and cost-effective process for the fabrication of superhydrophobic (SH) objects by Digital Light Processing (DLP) 3D printing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has used DLP 3D printing to fabricate SH 3D objects without further coating process. We designed a novel ink, which contained non-fluorinated acrylates and Hydrophobic Fumed Silica (HFS). We studied the effects of HFS concentration and pillar-array design for imparting the SH property, which was measured in terms of the contact and rolling angle of water droplets on the surface. As proof of the concept of increased buoyancy by superhydrophobicity, we demonstrated the floatation of the printed SH objects in comparison to their non-SH counterparts even after forcefully submerging them into water.",

However, the number of materials which can be processed by SLS is still very limited and requires further research. The present work aims to contribute to this topic by investigating the mechanical properties of neat and short carbon fibre reinforced polyamide 1212 processed by SLS. The specimens were built in different spatial alignments to obtain ample details on the tensile behaviour. The detailed examinations of the fractured specimens were performed by means of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. The comprehensive analysis revealed that most of the fibres (85 – 95%) were oriented in the plane of the powder layer and here, the majority along the direction of the moving roller coater, which distributes the powder on the powder bed of the SLS machine. It was shown that this effect has a direct impact on the strength and stiffness of the printed tensile bars and thus on the mechanical behaviour of SLS printed parts. Furthermore, the analysis results indicate the possibility to control this mechanical anisotropy through a systematic alignment of the components in the powder cake.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this research work is to scientifically contribute to the fatigue strength assessment of selectively laser melted metallic structures and aims to derive a methodology to safely estimate bulk material strength based on experimental data. Investigations focus on determination of the relevant post build and -processing residual stress condition and implementation in state of the art fatigue design concepts, alongside defect population and material properties. Additive manufacturing, especially powder-bed based laser melting, exposes material to immense thermal gradients that provoke residual stresses which bias complex mean stress states in components, may causing premature failure. X-ray diffractometry enables the measurement and allows assessment of present stresses by providing information about the superposition of residual stresses of different order by considering peak broadening effects. Residual stresses of first order overlay with load-induced stresses and significantly alter fatigue performance. Therefore, a mean stress correction of the experimentally determined fatigue strength is carried out by applying Smith-Watson-Topper's damaging parameter. The fully reversed fatigue strength amplitude is matched by complementing Murakami's approach by a correlation coefficient which empirically considers tensile residual stresses relative to hardness. Implementation of the introduced reduction factor to established designing concepts is found to be well applicable, considering that the developed methodology estimates fatigue strength of several test series from different materials in various post treatment conditions within a conservative region of − 3% and − 8%. The approach illustrated within this paper satisfies the demand for a holistic and conservative fatigue design approach incorporating defect population and hardness as well as the effect of the local residual stress condition.",

Mechanical properties of DED components have been shown to vary significantly through a part, making it difficult to achieve the level of process control required for these applications. Using thermal data captured in-situ, cooling rates and melt pool dimensions were calculated and related to the final grain structure, captured by EBSD. The changes in cooling rate explain the microstructural variation between different processing parameters and through the build height. A new approach, using a cumulative anisotropy factor was implemented and correlates the variation in hardness with grain structure. Two regimes were found depending on the linear heat input in 316L, with high linear heat input resulting in great amounts of mechanical anisotropy on the component level. The relationships between thermal signature and mechanical properties suggest close control of anisotropy could be achieved by monitoring and controlling the melt pool size using a coaxial camera.",

    "abstract": "Laser-based powder bed fusion, due to its layer-by-layer nature, results in a unique stress profile in a part after the primary production process. The residual stresses are typically tensile near the top, while they are compressive near the bottom of the part. When it is removed without proper precautions, the part will bend excessively. In order to alleviate this deformation, a stress relief heat treatment can be applied. In this paper, such a stress relaxation heat treatment is modelled to investigate the effect of the post-processing parameters. The model uses an Arrhenius-type creep equation to simulate the influence of the heat treatment temperature and dwell time on the stress field in a relatively simple cantilever beam produced in Ti-6Al-4V. Via validation of the simulations, the effect of the heat treatment is shown to be represented accurately. The validated model is used to predict the deformation that results from the residual stresses after heat treating the part under various conditions. The results from the simulations ultimately allow choosing the optimal heat treatment conditions to obtain a given reduction in the residual stress level, while reducing the need for extensive experimental investigations.",

    "abstract": "Laser-beam powder bed fusion (LB-PBF) of metals is an additive manufacturing (AM) method currently being pursued in numerous industries. In this study, the effect of scan strategy, laser spot size, and hatch distance on the pore structure of additively manufactured permeable stainless steel materials was systematically studied through the analysis of material permeability, pore size distribution, porosity, and surface morphology. When the hatch distance is wide and laser power is low, two kinds of pores are formed and were studied. The first one is pores located between laser-melted tracks, the second type is pores generated inside the laser-melted tracks. Scan strategy and laser spot size have no obvious effect on the porosity, but they affect the powder attached on the surface, the permeability, and the pore size of the permeable material. Hatch distance plays an important role in controlling the material properties. When the hatch distance is larger than 0.13 mm, the effect of powder attached on the surface on the pore structure of the permeable material is weakened, and the permeability increases significantly. By optimizing these parameters, permeable materials with pore sizes ranging from 2.6 to 13.7 µm and a thickness of 0.89 mm were fabricated. To illustrate the potential of the method, for the first time an additively manufactured planar permeable-dense metallic membrane substrate with internal flow channels was fabricated, which is a center piece of a new compact modular integrated membrane reformer system.",

The modeling approach is based on a melt fraction model which allows to cover the entire flow domain from the solid filament entering the nozzle to the melt state at the nozzle exit. The numerical results were compared with a specially developed setup that allows the measurement of the feeding force required to push the filament through the nozzle. The comparison is carried out over a wide range of filament velocities using different nozzle temperatures and nozzle geometries. It is shown that the assumptions used for the simulation are suitable to predict the melting and flow behavior in the relevant processing range. The model represents both the process region where the filament has sufficient time to melt before reaching the nozzle tip and the region of high filament velocities where there is insufficient time for complete melting. In the latter region, the model predicts that the molten region is reduced to a thin melt film at the tip of the filament as it is pushed against the conical transition zone of the nozzle. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the temperature at the nozzle exit decreases with increasing filament velocity. Based on this modeling approach, melting within the additive manufacturing process of material extrusion can be improved. Furthermore, the findings can be used to optimize the strand deposition.",

The plates were made using a robotic controlled gas metal arc (GMA) welding system designed for high deposition rates and were characterized using uniaxial tensile testing, macro- and micro-hardness, and optical microscopy. In addition, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) was used for the first time of WAAM plates to measure the anisotropic elastic modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio. Post processing consisted of mechanical rolling the walls to 25% and 40% strains followed by heat treating at 650 °C, 850 °C and 1050 °C. Results show that anisotropy of mechanical and physical properties is present in the starting microstructure and persists in the rolled plates prior to heat treating, with elastic modulus in the build direction of 50% of the polycrystalline wrought value, and shear modulus and Poisson's ratio of 200% of the polycrystalline value. Anisotropy also persists for all samples stress relieved at 650 °C, and in samples annealed at 1050 °C without any prior rolling strain. Heat treating has shown the reduction in texture and anisotropy only in the rolled plates. Complete elimination of texture and anisotropy was observed for WAAM plates rolled and annealed at 1050⁰C, and for plates rolled to 40% and recrystallized at 850 °C. Recrystallization of the rolled plates at temperatures 850 °C or higher increases yield strength, ultimate strength and elongation to failure relative to the as-built parts, with properties that equal or exceed typical wrought or cast alloys of similar composition. These results demonstrate that WAAM can be used to build custom sized semi-finished parts and blanks that can later be mechanically formed, and heat treated into high quality finished components.",

Particularly for fine featured geometries, there might be a clear mismatch between the latter two. Determining whether the entire component is printable can only be properly assessed through a test-print. The current work proposes an alternative modeling-driven route, which, after system and material characterization, facilitates predicting the geometrical defects of the resulting solidified component (including deformation). This is enabled through a coupled multi-physical modeling of irradiation, photopolymerization, solidification and chemical shrinkage.",

    "abstract": "Metal-based additive manufacturing (AM) represents a paradigm change in engineering and production methods across multiple industries and sectors. AM methods enable mass reduction and performance optimisation well beyond that achievable via conventional manufacturing, thereby impacting significantly on aerospace and space technologies. Technologies relying on high and ultra-high vacuum (UHV), such as x-ray photo-electron spectroscopy, photo-sensors, cameras and cryostats, could also benefit greatly from AM. Despite recent advances in AM processing of metals, additively manufactured UHV chambers have so far not been achieved. Reducing the mass of UHV equipment is particularly critical for the development of portable cold atom systems, which are expected to underpin the next generation of sensing and timekeeping technologies and to allow novel space-based sensors for fundamental research. We demonstrate here an additively manufactured UHV chamber reaching a pressure below $10^{-10}$ mbar, enabling a cloud of cold $^{85}$Rb atoms to be trapped - the starting point for many precision timekeeping and sensing devices. The chamber is manufactured from aluminium alloy AlSi10Mg by laser powder bed fusion and has a mass of less than a third of a commercially-available equivalent. Outgassing analysis based on mass spectrometry was performed and it was demonstrated that even without active pumping the system remains in the $10^{-9}$ mbar regime for up to 48 hours.",

    "abstract": "In laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), powder degradation is mainly driven by the accumulation of highly oxidized spatter particles in the powder bed. Although the amount of spattering can be controlled by the melt pool stability, spatter formation is an unavoidable characteristic of PBF processes. Oxidized spatter risks defect formation in the printed components. However, the factors influencing the level of spatter oxidation during L-PBF processing are not yet fully understood. Herein, the residual oxygen in the process atmosphere was reduced from the traditionally applied 1000–20 ppm using an oxygen partial pressure control system to process Alloy 718 powder. Spatter particles accumulated on the gas inlet were further analyzed to reveal the effect of the oxygen content in the process atmosphere on the spatter oxidation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Increasing the residual oxygen in the process atmosphere increased surface coverage by oxide phases rich in Al and Cr. The XPS analysis confirmed that the surface of Alloy 718 spatter particles were covered with Al- and Cr-based oxides, whose thickness increased with the oxygen content in the process atmosphere. The bulk oxygen content in the spatter powder showed the same trend with approximately thrice the oxygen content in spatters generated at 1000 ppm O2 (608 ppm O in the sample) compared to spatters generated with oxygen at 20 ppm (206 ppm O in the sample). Thermodynamic simulations demonstrate a transition from thick Al- and Cr-based mixed corundum and spinel-type oxides to Al-based corundum oxide with decreasing oxygen partial pressure, consistent with the XPS findings.",

    "abstract": "The ever growing demand for reducing costs and decreasing the time to market in today's plastics industry makes rapid tooling and rapid prototyping a highly researched area. 3D printed injection mold inserts make it possible to produce prototype parts in small series fast and cost-effectively. The mechanical strength and therefore the life expectancy of 3D printed polymeric injection mold inserts are low compared to their traditional steel counterparts. In order to increase the reliability and life expectancy of polymeric mold inserts, in-situ state monitoring during injection molding is essential. In this paper, we analyse the effect of thermal and mechanical loads on the resulting strains of the mold inserts. Three series of rectangular plate products were injection molded with a different type of insert in each series. The pressure inside the cavity and the strain of the 3D printed inserts were measured during injection molding. We correlated maximal cavity pressures and changes in strain with each other in order to set up the deformation characteristic of the inserts. The results indicate a satisfactory correlation between the maximal cavity pressures and the strain change of the inserts. The second important result was that strain gauges can be applied to in-situ monitor the state of the inserts during injection molding.",

    "abstract": "A new class of crack-resistant nickel-based superalloy containing high γ′ fraction is studied for the laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process. The effects of the (Nb+Ta)/Al ratio is emphasized, a strategy that is shown to confer excellent low-temperature strength whilst maintaining oxidation resistance at high temperatures via stable alumina scale formation. The processability of the new alloys is characterized with respect to defect assessment by micro-focus X-ray computed tomography; use is made of a prototype turbine blade geometry and the heritage alloy CM247LC as a benchmark. In all cases, some processing-related porosity is present in thin wall sections such as the trailing edge, but this can be avoided by judicious processing. The cracking seen in CM247LC – in solid-state, liquation and solidification forms – is avoided. A novel sub-solvus heat treatment strategy is proposed which takes advantage of AM not requiring solutioning; super-solvus heat treatment is inappropriate since it embrittles the material by deterioration of the texture and coarsening of grain boundary carbides. The tensile strength of the new superalloy is greatest when the Nb+Ta content is highest and exceeds that of CM247LC up to ∼900°C. The oxidation resistance is best when Al content is highest, and oxidation-assisted cracking resistance maximized when the (Nb+Ta)/Al ratio is balanced. In all cases these are equivalent or superior to that of CM247LC. Nevertheless, the creep resistance of the new alloys is somewhat inferior to that of CM247LC for which the γ′, C, and B contents are higher; this implies a processing/property trade-off which requires further clarification.",

GRCop-42 powder blended with varying content of HR-1 powder (0, 15, 25, 50, 75, 85, and 100 wt%) was cold spray deposited, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the deposits were evaluated. The deposits were characterized using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The use of He process gas resulted in relatively lower porosity and better mechanical properties compared to the deposits produced with N2 process gas. In the as-deposited condition, all the cold spray deposits exhibited brittle behavior with no appreciable ductility. Post-deposition heat treatment significantly improved ductility and tensile strength for both GRCop-42 and HR-1 deposits. However, post-deposition heat treatment resulted in coarsening of Cr2Nb precipitates in GRCop-42, the formation of η phase in HR-1, and the formation of σ phase at the interface in GRCop-42 and HR-1 composite deposits.",

However, traditional experimental trial-and-error methods to determine process parameters for specific materials and L-PBF machines are time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, a phenomenological crystallization model, namely the Nakamura model, is coupled with L-PBF process simulation. A convenient approach for the crystallization parameter determination and a two-step Euler method for the numerical implementation has been developed. Numerical simulations are performed using the material parameters of a Zr-based BMG Zr59.3Cu28.8Al10.4Nb1.5 (at.%, trade name: AMZ4). The numerical results are validated by comparing with experimental results from different perspectives. Based on the numerical findings, a comprehensive understanding of BMG crystallization behavior during L-PBF is gained. In the end, the crystallization model is implemented in our in-house developed software SAMPLE2D. SAMPLE2D simulation results are presented, whereby the L-PBF process window for fully amorphous AMZ4 parts is explored. Thereby, it is believed that the developed numerical software can be applied to aid process development for BMGs by taking the crystallization phenomenon into account.",

    "abstract": "Herein, the effect of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) parameters on the microstructure development of modified 9Cr-1Mo steel and the relationship between the as-built and heat-treated microstructures were characterized using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The optimal energy density for the steel was determined to be 100–150 J/mm3. The microstructure of the as-built steel was found to be mainly composed of coarse and columnar δ-ferrite grains and fine martensite grains. δ-ferrite was formed through rapid solidification, while martensite was formed in the heat-affected zone during LPBF. A higher energy density and scan strategy with a 67 deg. rotation in each layer were found to be suitable for obtaining a higher area fraction of martensite because they can provide a larger heat-affected zone compared with a lower energy density and a 90 deg. rotation. Tempering reduced the hardness via recovery of martensite and enhanced the precipitation of M23C6 carbide at martensite, while the microstructural morphology in the as-built condition was maintained. The typical as-built microstructure disappeared after the normalizing treatment, while the size of the prior austenite grains was affected by the as-built microstructure. In-situ EBSD observation of the phase transformation behavior during normalization revealed that martensite became fine prior austenite grains, while δ-ferrite became coarse prior austenite grains. From these results, the effects of energy density and scan strategy on microstructure development were identified not only for LPBF but also during the normalizing and tempering heat treatments.",

    "abstract": "An acryl-functionalized urethane prepolymer series with various compositions were synthesized using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). A novel acryl-urethane resin (AU) was designed by the addition of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (2-HEMA) as a suitable material for digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. The optimizing photo-initiator and additive were selected by UV-spectroscopy. The formulation containing the UV-curable AU resin and photo-curable additives was exposed to 405 nm UV radiation to produce the flexible 3D architectures. The effects of the photo-initiator/multifunctional acrylate value and UV absorptive power on the 3D printing performance were evaluated in terms of the mechanical properties and dimensional resolution. When the acryl-urethane resin/base acrylate ratio was 1/9, the UV-cured APU formulations had the excellent mechanical properties and highest resolution. The surface properties of the 3D architectures were tuned by controlling the photo-initiator type and composition in the AU resin. Overall, this novel UV-curable AU resin can be a promising prepolymer for the DLP printing of flexible photo-resin for biocompatible and photo-curable applications. © 2001 Elsevier Science.

    "abstract": "First-principles modeling, based on the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, is applied to quantitatively explain the physics of stainless-steel (SS316L) vapor plumes and jets and powder particle entrainment under conditions relevant to laser welding and laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing. The DSMC is a particle-based gas kinetic simulation approach, with few built-in assumptions, that resolves the Knudsen and diffusion layers in vapor microjets. The simulations are performed for different background gas species (argon, helium, and neon) at background gas pressures from 0.1 to 5 bar and molten pool temperatures from 3250 K to 4000 K. The simulations capture the evolution of the vapor jet structure from unsteady to steady-state vapor flow, the transition from subsonic flow at low surface temperatures to supersonic flow at surface temperatures close to boiling, as well as the effects of the background gas species and pressure. The simulations show that the vapor jet structure, as well as the magnitude and direction of the entrained gas close to the laser spot, greatly affects the process environment, creating particle spatter and denudation around the laser track. High pressure and lighter background gas can decrease the amount of spatter. At high pressure, the evaporation is reduced, which forms a low-velocity subsonic plume. For lighter gas species, the gas-entrainment velocity increases while the jet radius decreases which forces entrained particles to merge with the melt pool. The powder particle simulations reveal that the width of the denudation zone strongly depends on particle diameter and increases at low pressure and lighter background gas. This study emphasizes that the ambient gas species and the pressure in the build chamber should be treated as process parameters that are as important as controlling laser power and scan speed when trying to prevent defects.",

The alloy has a medium strength and a good toughness with an elongation to fracture at room temperature of about 40%. Additionally, it has a good electrical conductivity, though lower than that of pure Al or pure Cu. Despite these characteristics, additive manufacturing of the CuAl8 alloy was not yet reported. In this work, the direct energy deposition-arc (DED-arc) with and without in-situ hot forging was used to determine the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties. No internal defects were seen on the parts produced. Hot forging combined with DED-arc was seen to reduce and homogenize the grain size, improve mechanical strength and isotropy of mechanical properties. Moreover, the use of this novel DED-arc variant was seen to reduce the magnitude of residual stresses throughout the fabricated part. We highlight that this alloy can be processed by DED-arc, and the hot forging operation concomitant with the material deposition has beneficial effects on the microstructure refinement and homogenization.",

    "abstract": "Additively manufactured components by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) often suffer from stress-induced cracks (e.g. delamination), especially at the build-substrate interfaces where stiff mechanical constraints and large thermal gradients coexist. To reduce the probability of cracking, this work proposes an innovative strategy to optimize the geometry of the substrate by reducing its mechanical stiffness and, consequently, the stress accumulation during LPBF. To assess the feasibility of the strategy, a coupled thermo-mechanical finite element model, calibrated with the experimental evidence obtained from the LPBF metal deposition of a bridge-type structure, is used to predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of two T-shape AM parts built on (i) a typical solid substrate and (ii) a groove patterned substrate, respectively. The results show that several visible cracks appear at the interface between the build and the typical solid substrate due to stress concentration (up to 1600 MPa), while a crack-free component can be manufactured by adding grooves through the thickness of the substrate, without compromising the resulting microstructure and microhardness of the metallic materials with high crack sensitivity. The difference between the groove patterned substrate design with respect to the use of support structures used for printing cantilever structures is clarified to further justify the novelty of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "To improve mechanical properties, fibre reinforcement has been used in material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM). However, there are few reports about fibre composite mechanics and property prediction in MEAM. This study evaluated seventeen classical composite numerical models to assess their prediction capabilities and applicability in MEAM. Four carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites (PLA, ABS, PA, and PETG) were used. Longitudinal strength and modulus were predicted via the rule of mixtures (RoM), modified rule of mixtures (MRoM), Kelly model, Cox shear lag model, and modified Cox models. Transverse strength was predicted via the RoM transverse model and bridging model. Transverse modulus was predicted via the RoM transverse model, Halpin-Tsai, and modified Halpin-Tsai models. These models are widely accepted in the composite field but have not been assessed for MEAM. The predicted strengths and moduli were normalised by experimental values. For all materials, all models overestimated the longitudinal strength. The best predictions were found for the Kelly model, Cox-Krenchel model, and modified Cox model (with porosity) for longitudinal strength: normalised strengths were 2.02, 1.54, 1.63, respectively, averaged for all materials, compared to 2.46–8.82 for other models. Longitudinal modulus was well-predicted by the Kelly model and Cox-based models (normalised modulus of 0.87–2.05). The RoM transverse model and bridging model accurately predicted transverse modulus and strength, respectively (normalised strength 0.99 and normalised modulus 1.14). Additionally, model efficiency also varied between materials. PA was more predictable for longitudinal strength than PLA, PETG, and ABS (normalised strengths: 3.19, 3.98, 4.56, and 4.81, respectively) and in modulus (normalised moduli: 2.64, 3.01, 2.84, and 2.99), but less predictable in transverse strength (1.74, 2.02, 1.29, and 1.64) and transverse modulus (1.90, 2.02, 0.92, and 1.13). Fractography evidenced non-uniform fibre length, non-uniform fibre orientation, and weak fibre-matrix interface, which likely caused the discrepancies between theoretical and experimental properties. Potential revisions to improve model accuracy were discussed. Factors including fibre orientation, fibre length, fibre clustering, porosity, and fibre-matrix interface were highlighted for better prediction, which facilitates better understanding in mechanics and modelling of 3D printing fibre composites.",

In this paper, a novel lattice generation strategy is proposed to design graded lattice structures with the assistance of Machine Learning (ML). A Neural Network (NN)-based inverse lattice generator is trained to output lattice unit cells from the input of target mechanical properties. The proposed ML-based lattice generation method utilises the density distribution and stress field of low-resolution Topology Optimisation (TO) design to inform the inverse generator and produce lattice cells. The efficiency and efficacy of this method and the influence of cell types are demonstrated with the MBB-beam design case. Furthermore, the developed ML-based method is also applicable to multiple cell types.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have contested long-standing assumptions that mechanical anisotropy is caused by weak interlayer bonding and demonstrated that microscale geometry (the groove between extruded filaments) is the major cause of anisotropy in extrusion additive manufacturing (AM). Inspired by those finding, this study investigates the potential for a new convention for print-path design to improve mechanical properties by setting extrusion width to be at least 250 % of nozzle diameter. The new convention enabled an almost 50 % improvement in mechanical performance, which was supported by finite element analysis data, whilst simultaneously reducing the printing time by 67 %. Whereas a typical extrusion AM part uses several side-by-side extrusions, here, three 0.4-mm-wide extrusions are replaced with a single extra-wide 1.2-mm extrusion; two 0.6-mm-wide extrusions are also studied. The contact area between layers of the extra-wide extrusion was 90 % as opposed to 63 % for the conventional approach. The improved contact area led to a 40–48 % enhancement of strength, strain-at-fracture and toughness. This study presents a compelling case for a methodological shift to extra-wide extruded-filament deposition and explains the underlying cause of anisotropic strength observed in previous studies. Two case studies demonstrate practical applicability for a print run of 1000 nylon visors and lower-limb polylactide prosthetic sockets, for which extra-wide filaments more than doubled load-bearing capabilities. Polylactide material was used for most of the study; potential for translation to other materials is discussed.",

    "abstract": "3D printing of continuous fibre reinforced thermosetting matrix composites is set to revolutionise composite manufacturing practice. The potential of curing additively is anticipated to bring significant improvement in terms of increasing process speed, producing geometries that are inaccessible with current processing routes and eliminating detrimental exothermic effects during the process. This study presents a comparison between the curing stage of the 3D printing and standard batch processing for carbon fibre/epoxy components of varying thickness and size. An optimisation methodology links simulation of the cure using Finite Element solver Abaqus with a Genetic Algorithm capable of dealing with multi-objective problems. Optimal cure cycles to minimise both process time and temperature overshoot in 3D printing and batch processing are identified and the optimal trade-offs compared. The results highlight that temperature overshoot reduction up to 85 % is possible and that the intrinsic additive nature of the 3D printing allows eliminating the dependence of temperature overshoot on thicknesses and producing components with thicknesses that are very difficult to manufacture conventionally. A simplified procedure for the estimation of 3D printing process duration is proposed based on the results of finite element simulation. This is used for exploration of the limits of the process with respect to part size and for a generic comparison of process applicability against batch processing. The analysis shows that 3D printing is highly advantageous for small components, is efficient for mid-size components and can – on the basis of its scalability – offer a feasible route for producing large and very large components.",

    "abstract": "Using 3D printing, continuous fibre can be steered in high curvature paths to create variable-stiffness (VS) laminates for applications such as notched laminates. In the present study, VS 3D printed continuous carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic laminates were designed, manufactured, and tested, to improve open-hole tensile behaviour. The design was carried out taking into account the current limitations of fused filament fabrication. A curvilinear function was used to describe the fibre trajectory of the VS laminates, which enabled the parametrisation of the design-oriented meso-scale model based on the finite element method. Conventional stress-based models for the estimation of damage initiation and ultimate failure strengths were adapted to the behaviour of the 3D printed material. These models successfully reproduced the fibre-dominated behaviour of the printed laminate. An as-manufactured model was also developed to analyse the effect of defects caused by manufacturing constraints. VS laminates presented higher strength than quasi-isotropic reference laminates for holes larger than ∅1mm, increasing to more than 30% for holes of ∅6mm or larger. In addition, this increase in strength combined with the slight decrease in stiffness significantly increased the energy absorbed up to failure (up to 200%).",

These green organic co-solvents enhance jetting reliability and long-term stability of the ink and improve electrical properties of the deposited PEDOT:PSS layers, compared to the commonly used DMSO-containing ink formulations. We achieve large-area and high-fidelity electronic devices (array of 140 devices) with reproducible electrical performance through inkjet-based 3D printing. Enhanced performance stability is observed under cyclic bending, thermal annealing, UV or IR exposure, offering exciting opportunities for sustainable deposition of PEDOT:PSS for large-area 3D printing and its exploitation in heterostructures and flexible electronics.",

    "abstract": "Porous titanium implant surfaces fabricated with suitable porosity and size using additive manufacturing (AM) can enhance bone–implant stability. There is a critical need to understand the biomechanical performance of porous (lattice) type implants to improve bone ingrowth efficiency and interfacial bonded strength. This study proposes a new lattice type implant with appropriate/favorable physiological environment within the lattice for bone ingrowth and increasing bone-implant bonded strength. A unit (1mm3 cube) YM lattice with 65 % porosity and average pore size of 750 µm was designed as a 3D spherical structure to increase bone cell growth capacity with multiple-corners for accepting cell clustering and the transport of fluids, nutrients and the expelling of impurities between these interconnected through-holes. The finite element (FE) sub-modeling technique was used to investigate the implant-bone interface micro mechanical behavior, to include lattice pillars, bone within/around lattices for four different lattice types with YMU, YMR (YM lattice without deformation and with 30 % deformation), DU and DR (Diamond lattice without deformation and with 30 % deformation). The DU and YMR lattice implants (6 × 6 × 3 mm3 block) were selected and fabricated using a Ti6Al4V AM (each n = 5) and implanted into the distal right femurs of 10 rabbits for 8 weeks for observation. The interface tensile bonded strength test was performed after the rabbits were sacrificed. No lattice implant slipped in any of the rabbits after surgery. This confirms postoperative radiographs. The test results showed that both the bonded force and strength of the YMR lattice were found significantly higher than those of DU. The corresponding values were 113.14 ± 21.96 N and 5.39 ± 1.04 MPa for the YMR lattice and 41.41 ± 15.32 N and 1.97 ± 0.73 MPa for the DU lattice. This study proposed a YMR lattice that presented a suitable bone ingrowth environment and interfacial bond strength test for surface porous design for the AM medical implant.",

In this sense, the present work aimed to reduce the grain size and texture by applying an in situ interlayer hot forging (HF) combined with post-deposition heat treatments (PDHT). The produced samples were characterized through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron backscatter diffraction, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and Vickers microhardness. Also, a dedicated deformation tool was designed and optimized via a finite element method model considering the processing conditions and thermal cycle experienced by the material. It is shown that the in situ interlayer deformation induced a thermo-mechanical-affected zone (dynamic recrystallized + remaining deformation, with a height of ≈ 1.2 mm) at the bead top surface, which resulted in thinner aligned grains and lower texture index in relation to as-built DED counterpart. In addition, the effects of solution (1100 °C/ 1 h) and stabilization (980 °C/ 1 h) PDHTs on the Inconel® 625 HF-DEDed parts were also analyzed, which promoted fine and equiaxed static recrystallized grains without cube orientation, comparable to wrought material. Therefore, the HF-DED process significantly refined the typical coarse and highly oriented microstructure of Ni-based superalloys obtained by arc-based DED.",

The grain morphology is determined by several factors such as process conditions, local alloy composition, and number density of nucleating sites. In the present work, a model for simulating columnar-to-equiaxed transition is formulated, considering nucleating site size distribution, rapid solidification and constitutional undercooling in multicomponent alloys. Furthermore, the model is coupled with multicomponent Calphad-based thermodynamic and diffusion mobility descriptions. It is demonstrated that including the above aspects is important in accurately predicting the columnar-to-equiaxed transition by comparing with experimental data for an additively manufactured TiB2-reinforced AlSi10Mg alloy. The framework developed in this work may be used to predict columnar-to-equiaxed transition in additively manufactured technical alloys consisting of multiple elements.",

    "abstract": "A reliable classification architecture for melt pool images is crucial for real-time monitoring and control in additive manufacturing. It enables for the identification of discrepancies between actual and desired process parameters, which could lead to defects in printed part. Moreover, adjusting process parameters according to classification results promotes consistent melt pool geometry and leads to enhanced part quality. In addition to the classification, controlled generation of melt pool images can be employed for data generation, training of classifiers, and offline process parameter optimization along the scan path. This study introduces MeltPoolGAN, a novel machine-learning architecture designed for handling both of these tasks. The architecture is able to classify up to 371 classes consisting of process parameters such as laser power, scan speed and scan direction. This is a significant increase in the total number of classes as well as process parameters compared to state-of-the-art that only classified a maximum of 6 classes, consisting of a single process parameter. With this input, the MeltPoolGAN reaches accuracies of around 97% for power and scan speed class classification, and scan direction estimation errors below 3 degrees making it a reliable solution. Furthermore, the MeltPoolGAN is able to generate plausible melt pool images in controlled and flexible manner based on disentangled input parameters. Finally, since the architecture was trained and tested on two distinct datasets, the publicly available NIST dataset and the in-house created ETH dataset, its robustness and capabilities of being a general-purpose AI model are also demonstrated.",

This study developed new understanding of 3D short-fibre orientation in representative structures intended to capture most features of typical tool-paths. The parametric representative structures included straight paths, curved paths, corners, a range of intersection types, and the start/end of paths. Fibre orientation tensors were used to quantify 3D fibre alignment along the direction of printed filaments (F-alignment), lateral to the in-plane filament direction (F-lat alignment), and normal to the print-platform (Z-alignment). Overall, fibres were highly aligned along the filament direction in both straight paths and curved paths but less aligned at corners and intersections. However, recovery of fibre orientation was found after corners and intersections. To assess fibre orientation uniformity throughout the layer thickness, specimens were sectioned normal to the print platform in seven planes throughout the thickness of a single extruded filament. High fibre orientation (F-alignment) was found intra-filament, but it gradually decreased from upper section to bottom section. Interlayer region showed both high F-alignment and Z-alignment. In addition, extruded-filament width and height critically affected fibre orientation: increasing extrusion width and layer height led to decreased F-alignment. Case studies showed the results are translatable to more complicated structures and a different polymer material. This study provides new understanding of 3D fibre orientation in additive manufacturing and will allow more informed design, analysis and optimisation of short-fibre-reinforced structures to improve performance.",

    "abstract": "Directed energy deposition (DED) is a promising additive manufacturing technique for repair; however, DED is prone to surface waviness (humping) in thin-walled sections, which increases residual stresses and crack susceptibility, and lowers fatigue performance. Currently, the crack formation mechanism in DED is not well understood due to a lack of operando monitoring methods with high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we use inline coherent imaging (ICI) to optically monitor surface topology and detect cracking in situ, coupled with synchrotron X-ray imaging for observing sub-surface crack healing and growth. For the first time, ICI was aligned off-axis (24° relative to laser), enabling integration into a DED machine with no alterations to the laser delivery optics. We achieved accurate registration laterally (<10 µm) and in depth (<3 µm) between ICI measurements and the laser beam position using a single-element MEMS scanner and a custom calibration plate. ICI surface topology is verified with corresponding radiographs (correlation >0.93), directly tracking surface roughness and waviness. We intentionally seed humping into thin-wall builds of nickel super-alloy CM247LC, locally inducing cracking in surface valleys. Crack openings as small as 7 µm were observed in situ using ICI, including sub-surface signal. By quantifying both humping and cracking, we demonstrate that ICI is a viable tool for in situ crack detection.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing of shape memory polymers has gained tremendous interest in recent years due to their versatile potential applications in various industries, such as biomedicine and aerospace. However, the polymers' mechanical properties, specifically stiffness and strength, often hinder their use in mechanically demanding applications, e.g. as structural materials. In this work we produced nacre-inspired composites with a covalent adaptable network, which enables fast and mechanically lossless self-healing, reshaping, and shape memory capabilities. We demonstrate a novel direct write 4D-printing strategy to print smart, nacre-inspired, organic-ceramic composites based on alumina platelets and vitrimers with up to 3.3 and 26.7 times higher tensile strength and stiffness, respectively, in comparison to the pristine vitrimer. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce for the first time a single step 4D-printing process for nacre-inspired composites, that exploits suspension spreading to align micron sized alumina platelets along a common plane, and which utilizes solvent evaporation to induce polycondensation of the monomers resulting in a vinylogous urethane vitrimer after extrusion of the suspension. This work presents a facile, direct write 4D-printing strategy at ambient printing conditions, establishing a foundation for adaptive additive manufacturing of smart organic-ceramic composites of interest to various industries.",

    "abstract": "The fabrication of high-end ceramics by additive manufacturing gained increasing research interest due to the capacity of these techniques to break through the limitations of traditional extractive manufacturing. Although efficient strategies for the processing of ceramic materials by additive manufacturing have been shown, with notable examples in the dental field, the processing of dense glass-ceramics by the same means is almost unexplored. Herein, a processing strategy for the manufacture of complex shapes of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics by material extrusion is detailed shown for the first time. An aging behaviour was observed on the glass loaded aqueous suspensions and in-deep studied, being related with the leaching of Li+ ions. Based on this, a hydrogel-based ink with high solid content (ϕ≈ 50 vol%), suitable rheological properties (G´≈106 and τ ≈1500 Pa) and recovery time was developed. By using the optimized ink, a propeller component with high aspect ratio and small internal connected channels, as well as a dental crown were successfully printed. A debinding schedule was tuned by the combination of differential thermal analysis and hot stage microscopy. The sintered lithium disilicate glass-ceramic parts presented good relative density (≈ 96.7 ± 0.8%) and translucency. Outstanding mechanical properties were achieved (Hv ≈5.3 GPa, KIf ≈2.1 MPa.m0.5, σ ≈279 ± 44 MPa), comparable to values usually attained for these materials by powder technology. The low deviation of the flexural strength data reported here is related with the absence of meaningful processing defects on the analysed fracture surfaces and the homogeneous distribution of the residual porosity as microporous, resulting in a good Weibull characteristic strength σ0 = 301 MPa. The results of the present work emphasized the potential of Direct ink Writing, a material extrusion technique, to fabricate lithium disilicate glass-ceramic parts with complex geometries, as dental crowns.",

    "abstract": "A novel approach for determining triaxial residual stress states by coupling energy dispersive X-ray diffraction and contour method measurements is provided and validated in a Ti-5Al-5V-5Mo-3Cr additive manufactured (AM) bridge sample. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction can provide relatively fine spatial resolution (on the order of 10 to 100 µm) for mapping 3D elastic strain fields within a sample. However, for samples with dimensions larger than one or two centimeters the path length can get prohibitive as both constant wavelength and energy dispersive SXRD are based upon transmission measurements. As an example, for a plate-like sample geometry where the thickness is limited (less than a centimeter) it is trivial to measure the longitudinal and height direction elastic strain components with excellent in-plane spatial resolution (~100 µm) and a somewhat lower through-thickness resolution (10-15 times larger) but obtaining the through thickness component is often not possible as the beam path must be parallel to one of the large dimensions of the plate. While small samples of low Z-number alloys (e.g., Ti or Al) allow determination of the three elastic strain components, this is often not the case for higher Z alloys (e.g., Fe or Ni) or large samples where some strain components can be indeterminable. To overcome these limitations, this work applies a combination of synchrotron X-ray diffraction and the contour method (a mechanical relaxation technique), to determine the triaxial stress state. This novel combination is demonstrated and validated in a relatively small additive manufactured sample where all three orthogonal strain components are accessible via X-ray diffraction for stress determination. The paper also explores methods for determining the strain-free lattice parameter, typically obtained from a small stress-free reference sample. This work shows that a small size AM sample is not stress free, producing unreliable magnitudes of strain and stress. Instead, a strain-free lattice parameter is determined using residual stress equilibrium conditions, which gives consistent strain and stress trends for both X-ray diffraction (alone) and the new diffraction-contour coupling technique. This demonstrates that the coupling technique can be confidently applied to samples to determine stress when path length (size or Z-number) prohibit determination of three orthogonal strain components via diffraction.",

    "abstract": "In laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) additive manufacturing (AM), the laser beam is the fundamental tool used to selectively melt metal powder layer-upon-layer to form a 3-dimensional part. Studies on the effect of the laser scanning parameters (power, speed, hatch distance, and scanning strategy in general) on part quality are abundant; however, far less emphasis has been given to the effect of the laser beam and how it is focused on the laser-material interaction plane. Here, we have studied the effect of laser beam focal point position on porosity and melt pool geometry in PBF-LB AM. In addition, we also study how the various energy density parameters developed for laser melting processes correlate with melt pool dimensions in a situation where the laser beam focal point position (and the beam diameter and laser intensity change at work plane caused by it), is taken into consideration. Furthermore, we assess the possibility of using co-axial, photodiode-based melt pool monitoring signals as a means to monitor the thermal emissions of the process, and how it correlates with the resulting melt pool geometry. It was found that melt pool penetration experiences a major decrease when the focal point position is shifted by more than ±1 mm (or 30% of Rayleigh length), which could be considered as a tolerance limit for acceptable focus shift in PBF-LB machines. Focus shifts larger than this were effectively captured by the photodiode signals, indicating the potential of using such photodiode-based melt pool monitoring systems for continuous monitoring of focus shift in PBF-LB AM. Finally, it was shown that all the studied energy density parameters, except volumetric energy density, were able to capture the trend in normalized melt pool dimensions when focus position is introduced as a variable. A new energy density metric by normalizing the melt pool monitoring signal intensity with the beam area was introduced and shown to correlate with the normalized melt pool dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing has revolutionized the way prototypes and one-off parts are produced, but standard additive manufacturing techniques such as material extrusion or vat photopolymerization still present various issues like high print times and defects due to the layer-by-layer nature of the print process. Computed axial lithography (CAL), a novel volumetric additive manufacturing technique, solves many of the issues associated with traditional 3D printing, like staircasing defects and long printing times. However, state of the art CAL requires complex optical setups, limiting access to a working machine, greatly reducing the pace of new material and technologies being adapted to CAL. The Liquid Crystal Display-based computed axial lithography (LCD-CAL) setup here presented keeps many of the advantages of CAL, but utilizes a single lens and an LCD for its optical setup. By moving to LCDs, the machine cost is greatly reduced, and the extremely simplified optical setup of LCD-CAL makes CAL widely accessible. To highlight the versatility of the developed LCD-CAL, we design and characterize two high-viscosity resins for CAL printing based on highly crosslinked and bio-based acrylates, respectively. This work paves the way for widespread adoption of volumetric 3D printing by making a low cost, high speed CAL printer available.",

    "abstract": "The impact of various post-deposition treatments on the static and cyclic properties of cold sprayed 6061 aluminum alloy was investigated. Microstructural and mechanical properties of helium- and nitrogen-sprayed deposits in their as-sprayed condition were evaluated. To enhance the mechanical properties of nitrogen-sprayed deposits, different heat treatment procedures were applied, including conventional heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The influence of processing temperature was also studied by processing the deposits at regular and elevated temperatures. Specimens were tested in both annealed and solution-aged conditions. The interparticle bond quality of the deposits after various post-deposition processes was assessed using SEM and TEM. The grain structure of the deposits was examined using EBSD. Mechanical properties including hardness, tensile properties, and fatigue behavior were also investigated for different conditions. While helium-sprayed deposits exhibited mechanical performance close to the wrought material, nitrogen-sprayed deposits were non-load-bearing in their as-sprayed condition. However, post-deposition processes proved highly effective in enhancing the mechanical properties of these deposits. Specifically, HIPing at elevated temperature improved tensile strength and fatigue strength of the deposits to 90% and 75% of the wrought material, respectively, placing it in the same range as cast aluminum alloys. Additionally, the study demonstrates that quantifying bonding regions between particles enables the prediction of fatigue life through the application of Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM).",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of Zr-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) has recently attracted attention due to its capacity for microstructure control, the potential for custom-tailored properties, and its versatile applicability across various industries. It is crucial to strike a balance between relative density, relaxation, and crystallinity tailored to a specific application when 3D printing amorphous components. However, prior findings have not revealed an exclusive study concerning low fractions of crystallinity (<5 vol%) and atomic-scale effects during the LPBF process, e.g. the relaxation degree of the amorphous structure. This study employs a systematic experimental approach, complemented by semi-analytical modeling, to comprehensively recognize the nano- and macro-scale amorphous structure and the associated mechanical behavior. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) along with flexural stress-strain measurements disclose that the highest relaxation and crystallization enthalpies, which are obtained for samples printed with lower heat input, are not in correlation with the desired mechanical properties. On the contrary, samples printed with a heat input of ΔH=44 reveal the maximum density range (up to 99.97 %) and showcase laboratory-XRD amorphous structure. This results in the highest flexural strength (up to 2080 MPa) and elastic deformation range (up to 2.6 %), along with the lowest Young's modulus span (60–70 GPa). In this case, the crystallinity (0.02–0.2 vol%) associated with the desired mechanical properties is calculated from the modeling results. The outcomes indicate increased heating/ cooling rates corresponding to the amplified heat input, with cooling rates reaching up to 5×104 °C/s and heating rates up to 6×105 °C/s. However, underlying layers are subjected to reduced heating and cooling rates. This observation not only validates the intricate thermal dynamics in LPBF but also elucidates the crystalline formation in heat-affected zones (HAZs) with associated lower heating and cooling rates.",

    "abstract": "Low surface quality of fabricated parts and long processing times are two commonly stated reasons against a more wide-spread adoption of electron beam powder bed fusion (PBF-EB) as a commercially viable manufacturing technique. Aside from the large particle size distribution (45–150 µm) of processed powders, the surface roughness, limited structural resolution and process instabilities are attributed to unwanted dynamics of the melt pool, like spattering, balling, evaporation and melt pool displacement. As a result, a contouring step using slow but stable melting parameters is usually added to the process to improve surface quality, leading to increased processing times. In this study, we demonstrate how the surface quality can be improved by supplying the energy for melt pool formation over multiple, timely separated interactions. To investigate the effect of this multiple interaction processing (MIP), series of single line melt structures with increasing number of interactions were fabricated, characterized and corresponding thermal diffusion simulations performed. The experimental results show how MIP allows to lower surface roughness of melted structures through a reduction of spattering, balling and melt pool displacement during processing, while our simulation model identifies these benefits to be caused by a significant reduction in surface temperature and thus evaporation, with increasing number of interactions for melt pool formation. Our model further demonstrates, how a relatively simple, computationally inexpensive and thus scalable thermal diffusion model is capable of providing valuable information about thermal conditions during melt pool formation. Lastly, we introduce a few simple equations to calculate appropriate MIP parameters for any kind of scan strategy.",

    "abstract": "Laser beam shaping is a novel and relatively unexplored method for controlling the melt pool conditions during metal additive manufacturing (MAM) processes, but even so it still holds good promise for achieving site-specific tailored properties. In this work, a comprehensive numerical and experimental campaign is carried out to explore this subject within metal laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). More specifically, a multiphysics numerical model is implemented for simulating the heat and fluid flow conditions during LPBF of Ti6Al4V using arbitrary circular beam shapes with various power distributions spanning from a pure Gaussian beam to a pure ring beam profile. The model is subsequently coupled with cellular automata to describe the beam shape effects on the microstructure evolution. Model validation is carried out in a two-fold manner. First, we compare the predicted melt pool cross-section with the one from ex-situ single track experiments, and we find a deviation of less than 9 % in melt pool dimensions. Secondly, advanced in-situ X-ray monitoring is carried out to unravel the melt pool dynamics and we find that the predicted morphology closely matches the in-situ X-ray results. Moreover, it is shown that at lower laser power, a bulge of liquid metal forms at the center of the melt pool when employing ring profiles, and this is ascribed to the absence of recoil pressure at the center of the ring beam. Furthermore, increasing the laser power seems to destabilize the melt pool regime, as the central bulge transforms into a liquid metal jet that periodically collapses and breaks up into hot spatter. Based on the results, we believe that our multiphysics modelling methodology, opens up new pathways for predicting how laser beam shaping influences porosity, surface roughness as well as microstructure formation in LPBF processes.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of parts with precise dimensional control, freedom of design and material properties similar to or better than those fabricated using traditional manufacturing approaches. AM quality control depends upon the fundamental of the laser-matter interaction during metal AM using L-PBF to exploit the potential use of the materials and process control. In this work, thermal-fluid dynamics in gas chamber experimentally and computationally is used to elucidate the interplay between vapour, liquid, and solid phases in L-PBF. It is revealed that the argon (Ar) shielding gas flow with varied inlet velocities by different nozzles has a pronounced effect to minimise the laser-fume interaction, resulting in the reduction in unstable metal vapour flow and enhancing laser absorptivity. In-process monitoring via high-speed visualisation has been used to understand the simultaneous gas plume dynamics as a result of vapourisation and subsequent laser-fume interaction, backed up by thermal-fluid flow simulation. Unfavourable process dynamics associated with unwanted defects such as lack of fusion can be avoided to improve process design and enhance process stability.",

    "abstract": "Current thermal monitoring methods used in metal powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) rely on a priori knowledge of the emissivity, which is usually assumed temperature, wavelength, and time invariant. Given the true dynamic nature of emissivity for a given material, these assumptions result in the calculation of inaccurate process temperatures, or in the reporting of radiant intensity or radiance temperature as a proxy for the absolute temperature. In this work, we detail the use of a multi-wavelength (MW) pyrometry technique, operating in the spectral range from approximately 900–1700nm, to capture radiant intensity emissions during processing of various materials using the electron-beam powder bed fusion (PBF-EB) process. The technique measured spectral intensity and analyzed the results of these data after processing with Planck's distribution law in its two-color or ratio pyrometry form to establish the spectral and temporal emissive behavior in the active range from 1080–1637nm. Four commonly used alloys (Ti6Al4V, TiAl, 316 L, and IN625) were examined here as each of these alloys underwent transitions (from powder to liquid to structured solid) induced during processing. For each material studied, analysis of the aggregated data for ten layers, superimposed in time, identified specific and repeatable trends in the emissivity, with plotted measurements forming clusters or regions in each of the processing stages (preheating, melt scanning, liquid, and cooldown). Also, the data recorded by the MW pyrometer was used to analyze the spectral variability of measurements as well as temporal changes in emissive behavior (from gray to non-gray) at similar temperatures and points in time in each processing stage but during different layers or scans. The results show that the measured emissive behaviors for the four materials were highly variable during processing, with typical differences during transitions ranging from 20% to 75%, and as high as 300% for the case of Ti6Al4V, indicating emissive behaviors that are highly dynamic rather than temporally and spectrally invariant. This dynamic emissive behavior is associated with changes in temperature, morphology, phase, and chemistry of the processed metal that happen during the highly transient and non-equilibrium conditions of PBF AM, and that can only be accounted for by performing in situ measurements during processing using techniques that do not rely on prior knowledge of the emissivity. These results are intended to (1) better inform the additive manufacturing community on the physical nature of emissivity of metallic materials during processing, and (2) provide foundational emissivity data that can be used to improve numerical modeling and the application of radiation thermometry techniques in PBF AM. Further, these results indicate that the emissive behavior during processing can result in significant variations temporally and spectrally, and although the results can be used as foundational emissive behavior measurements, the authors recommend the use of in situ techniques that operate without prior knowledge of emissivity to reduce uncertainties in measurements during PBF AM.",

    "abstract": "Previous work on additively-manufactured oxide dispersion strengthened alloys focused on experimental approaches, resulting in larger dispersoid sizes and lower number densities than can be achieved with conventional powder metallurgy. To improve the as-fabricated microstructure, this work integrates experiments with a thermodynamic and kinetic modeling framework to probe the limits of the dispersoid sizes and number densities that can be achieved with powder bed fusion-laser beam. Bulk samples of a Ni–20Cr + 1 wt% Y2O3 alloy are fabricated using a range of laser power and scanning velocity combinations. Scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization is performed to quantify the dispersoid size distributions across the processing space. The smallest mean dispersoid diameter (29 nm) is observed at 300 W and 1200 mm/s, with a number density of 1.0 × 1020 m−3. The largest mean diameter (72 nm) is observed at 200 W and 200 mm/s, with a number density of 1.5 × 1019 m−3. Scanning electron microscopy suggests that a considerable fraction of the oxide added to the feedstock is lost during processing, due to oxide agglomeration and the ejection of oxide-rich spatter from the melt pool. After accounting for these losses, the model predictions for the dispersoid diameter and number density align with the experimental trends. The results suggest that the mechanism that limits the final number density is collision coarsening of dispersoids in the melt pool. The modeling framework is leveraged to propose processing strategies to limit dispersoid size and increase number density.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing technologies for metallic materials based on powder bed fusion, either with electron (PBF-EB/M) or laser beam (PBF-LB/M) have enormous industrial potential. It is known that the reinforcement of nanoparticles in the metallic matrix improves the mechanical properties. This study presents a novel method for manufacturing reinforced powder particles for PBF technology. The method involves dispersing and dissolving reinforcing nanoparticles in the metallic matrix, resulting in a composite material. The method was applied to a Ti-6Al-4V matrix with SiC nanoparticles as reinforcement to develop a new Titanium Matrix Composite (TMC). A route for atomizing the composite material has been developed to scale up the process on an industrial level. The atomized material has been designed to be used as feedstock with PBF-EB/M and PBF-LB/M. The feedstock is a composite powder obtained by the Electrode Inert Gas Atomization (EIGA) process after mixing and dispersing SiC nanoparticles in the Ti-6Al-4V matrix and consolidating the mixture into an ingot bar using Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). The powder bed fusion process parameters have been studied to obtain specimens with a density greater than 99.9%, and close to 100% after HIP process. The conditions for some heat treatments, such as HIP and stress relief, have been determined. The conditions of machining processes, such as milling and turning, have been studied. The material's properties, such as chemical composition, microstructure, mechanical strength, and fatigue behavior have been evaluated. Compared to Ti-6Al-4V according to the ASTM F2924 standard, both the ultimate tensile strength and yield strength have been improved by 28%, and the elongation at break by between 30-60%. Regarding fatigue behavior, an increase of around 30-50% (high-low cycles) has been observed.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive investigation into the effect that both the crystallization kinetics and the molecular weight of polypropylene feedstock have on the welding properties in material extrusion 3D-printing (MatEx). As sufficient welding at the interfaces between printed layers may be restricted by the onset of crystallization, there is a delicate balance between polymer interdiffusion and the development of spherulites within the weld region. We monitor these processes during a cooling cycle using a well-established theoretical model that requires full characterisation of the rheology and crystallization. The model shows that the largest effect of increasing molecular weight is a reduction in interdiffusion; this mechanism leads to a reduction in the weld strength as demonstrated by mechanical testing. For the highest molecular weight feedstock, we find that the fracture pattern changes from plastic deformation to brittle mode. Furthermore, we observe that the spherulites within the weld are about an order of magnitude smaller than in other samples. These observations cannot be described by the quiescent crystallization kinetics alone. Our findings suggest that it is a flow-enhanced crystallization mechanism that accelerates nucleation leading to smaller spherulites developing in the weld earlier in the cooling process. This significantly restricts interdiffusion at the welds.",

    "abstract": "Laser beam powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) additive manufacturing (AM) technology has become a versatile tool for producing new microstructures in metal components, offering novel mechanical properties for different applications. In this work, enhanced ductility (~55% elongation) and tunable mechanical anisotropy (ratio of ductility along vertical to horizontal orientation from ~0.2 to ~1) were achieved for a CoCrNi medium entropy alloy (MEA) by multi-scale synergistic microstructure manipulation (i.e., melt pool boundary, grain morphology and crystallographic texture) through adjusting key PBF-LB processing parameters (e.g., laser power and scan speed). By increasing the volumetric energy density (VED) from 68.3 to 144 J/mm3, the melt pool size enlarges, and the crystallographic texture transitions from <100>//BD to <110>//BD due to the maximum thermal flux direction changing for different melt pool dimensions, which affects the proportion of grains that have different growth directions. Moreover, excellent mechanical properties of 890 MPa ultimate tensile strength and ~55% elongation to failure can be achieved for loading perpendicular to the build direction with only a ~15% reduction in properties for loading along the build direction. The superior combination of mechanical properties is achieved by processing parameter-controlled strengthening of melt pool boundary interfaces, heterogeneous deformation induced strengthening through bimodal grain structures, and favorable grain orientation for dislocation slip and twinning formation, which was significantly more activated in the <110>//BD texture than in the <100>//BD. This study offers new insights into achieving multi-scale synergistic microstructure manipulation via PBF-LB for desired strength, ductility, and mechanical anisotropy in a CoCrNi MEA.",

    "abstract": "In most additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, objects are realized layer by layer. This layer-by-layer construction leads to inherent anisotropic physical properties. Controlling, understanding and sometimes mitigating such anisotropy is a critical issue in the development of AM. Electrical anisotropy in conductive nanocomposites processed by Vat photopolymerization is demonstrated and quantified in the present work. In the used method, which enjoys high resolution and high speed, layers of an acrylate based resin, are successively cross-linked by UV irradiation of 2D patterns. Carbon nanotubes are used as conductive fillers for their low percolation threshold that allows realizing conductive and still sufficiently transparent materials for UV polymerization. Conductivity parallel to the layers of 3D objects is found to be much greater than conductivity perpendicular to the layers. This electrical anisotropy is explained by the high contact resistance between printed layers. High contact resistance results from the slow diffusion of carbon nanotubes from the uncured material towards the interface of the cured object. It is found that implementing a delay time before curing successive layers, or decreasing the matrix viscosity with temperature, to promote diffusion of the conductive particles allow substantial reduction of the contact resistance between layers. As a result, conductivity anisotropy can be reduced by almost two orders of magnitude. This control and mitigation of conductivity anisotropy allows reconciliation of the high resolution of the Vat photopolymerization technology with the possibility to realize uniform 3D materials.",

    "abstract": "Despite the significant research being conducted on the mechanical reliability of additively manufactured parts, comparatively little focus has been paid to the property of thermal conductivity. Additively manufactured thermally conductive parts have the potential to benefit thermal management technologies that are currently a bottleneck of many classes of advanced electronic devices. Creating parts with high thermal conductivities remains a major challenge for the most prevalent form of material extrusion additive manufacturing, fused filament fabrication, which creates parts by extruding multiple layers of molten polymeric extrudate using an automated gantry system. The low thermal conductivity of these parts stems from several types of interfaces and voids inherent to the fused filament fabrication additive process, which create significant internal resistance to the flow of heat through a part. To increase thermal conductivity, many researchers and companies have added thermally conductive particles into the polymeric filaments. Still the achievable properties are largely constrained by the printing defects inherent to the printing process, especially when compared to injection molded parts. In this work, we investigate the role of thermal post-processing to both anneal the printed part and to tune the crystallization state of the polymer. We find that careful thermal post-processing of parts made with commercial filaments can improve thermal conductivity values to 2.5 times the as-printed property values. Further, we detail several correlations between processing conditions and thermal conductivity outcomes that will improve the implementation of fused filament fabrication for addressing thermal management challenges in industry.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of in-situ sensing solutions to monitor additive manufacturing processes has seen a significant surge in recent years, notably in processes where localised heating is used. These technologies, however, have not always yielded accurate information about final part quality, due to differences between the irregularities observed in-process and the anomalies present in the finished part. One way of investigating such differences is to establish correlations between in-process layer properties and the final condition of the part. In this work, we put forward a solution based on a bespoke fringe projection system designed to monitor layers within the build chamber of a PBF-LB machine. Through the computation of quantitative indicators on fringe projection data and the use of statistical control charts for their monitoring and analysis, we are able to predict local reductions in part density, detrimental to the quality of the final build, which are typically only visible after part manufacture. Principally, this article describes the developed fringe projection system utilised for data collection and the custom indicators used to examine layer topographical characteristics and which are correlated with local final densities. We design an experimental campaign to produce parts with different local densities and show how the proposed indicators, combined with statistical control charts, can predict in-process drops in density. The monitoring performance is validated via X-ray computed tomography (XCT) measurements performed on the as-built samples.",

Nano-composites containing 0.5–1.5 wt% nHA were successfully produced and tensile testing showed that 0.5 wt% nHA provided the greatest reinforcement with a 20% and 15% increase in modulus and strength respectively. However, the elongation at break had significantly declined which was likely due to the formation of nHA aggregates at the sintering borders following the processing of the coated powders despite being initially well dispersed on the particle surface.",

    "abstract": "In this work, real-time in-process monitoring of core motion in metal castings is demonstrated through the use of two emerging technologies. 3D sand printing (3DSP) is a binder jetting additive manufacturing process that is quickly manifesting itself as a technological disrupter in the metal casting industry. Based on its direct digital manufacturing principle, 3DSP enables complex mold and core design freedom that has been previously unavailable to foundry engineers. In addition, the miniaturization and affordability of electronics and sensing equipment is rapidly accelerating. Here, these two shifting paradigms are leveraged together. An experimental casting and mold were designed in this research to demonstrate and evaluate wireless sensing of core shifts. With the use of 3D sand printing, precisely sized and located pockets were manufactured inside of cores. Miniature wireless Bluetooth sensors capable of measuring acceleration and rotation were then embedded inside the cores. From these, high fidelity data were captured wirelessly from the sensors during the casting process. With strategically designed core prints designed to allow varying levels of core motion, it is shown that core shifts can be measured and discriminated during casting in real time.",

    "abstract": "Long production times, the associated high costs of the products and product size limitations belong among current issues of selective laser melting (SLM) technology. Hybrid products containing small and complex-shaped parts deposited by SLM on the forged, rolled or hot stamped semi-products could offer a practical solution to these limitations. Cylindrical hybrid parts were additively manufactured by depositing 18Ni300 maraging steel on the cylindrical semi-products of CMnAlNb low-alloy advanced high strength steel (AHSS). The AHSS was used either in forged and air cooled condition or after heat treatments typically used for inducing the TRIP (transformation induced plasticity) effect. Various post-build heat treatments of the hybrid parts were performed. The mechanical properties of the hybrid parts were determined by hardness measurement across the interface and by a tensile test of the dissimilar joints. All tensile samples fractured in the high-strength steel side, several millimetres from the interface. Microstructure analysis of both materials and the interface region was carried out using light and scanning electron microscopes. The hybrid parts had the ultimate tensile strengths of 840−940 MPa, with total elongations of 12–19 %. The best combination of tensile strength and elongation was obtained with two-step heat treatment of the TRIP steel prior to additive manufacturing with no post-build heat treatment of the hybrid part.",

The nanocomposite powder is based on a core-shell structure where nanoparticles (graphene nanoplatelets, GNP) are encapsulated on the surface of the polymeric particles (polyamides PA12) in a thin layer of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Powder rheology data as well as SEM and TEM showed that GNP were dispersed well in the PVA coating and improved flow. Half time crystallisation kinetics was used to determine differences induced in the polymer and the laser sintering process by the presence of GNP. Nanosafety aspects, critical in a manufacturing environment, are also considered here and exposure monitoring tests were carried out. Results confirmed a low nanoparticle air exposure and therefore confirmed the successful surface encapsulation of the GNP in nanocomposite powders. The laser-sintered 0.1GNP/PVA-PA12 parts showed enhanced mechanical properties in tensile, compression and 3-point bending test.",

Filaments based on TPU and PA12 filled with melt-spun Nd-Fe-B particles (up to 92 wt%) were prepared using a twin-screw extruder, and test specimens were manufactured using a low-cost desktop FFF 3D printer. TPU based bonded magnets exhibited better magnetic performances, less warpage, and more robust processability compared to PA12 based bonded magnets, while the latter provided higher flexural modulus, flexural strength, and higher stiffness at elevated temperatures. It was found out that the best magnetic properties were measured on specimens manufactured from TPU filled with 92 wt% of Nd-Fe-B particles, where remanence (Br) was 532 mT and energy product (BHmax) was 47,5 kJ/m3. The developed method enables robust FFF Additive Manufacturing (AM) of TPU - Nd-Fe-B particles` bonded magnets using low-cost desktop 3D printers with magnetic properties comparable to the injection moulded (IM) bonded magnets, which is mentioned for the first time in the scientific literature.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue crack initiation of Alloy 718 additively manufactured via electron beam-powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) process was investigated. The melt parameters were chosen to achieve sufficient energy input and minimize process-induced defects. A line offset of 200 µm with enough line energy was used, leading to the formation of wide and deep melt pools. This strategy facilitated the formation of equiaxed grains at the melt pools bottom, and short columnar grains within the melt pools aligned parallel to the build direction. The mixed grain morphology and texture were retained after various thermal post-treatments, including heat treatment (HT), hot isostatic pressing (HIP), and HIP-HT. Micron-sized non-metallic inclusions in the feedstock powder, such as Al-rich oxide and titanium nitride clustered during the EB-PBF process, and remained intact during the post-treatments. Low cycle fatigue cracks mainly originated from the non-metallic inclusions found near the surface of the test specimens. HIPing was able to remove a portion of the internal defects, including round-shaped and shrinkage pores; therefore, a small fatigue life enhancement was observed in HIP-HT compared to HT.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional metallic microlattice structures are critical for advancements in areas such as energy storage and conversion, high-sensitivity sensors, light-weight structures, bone implants, and high-efficiency catalysts. In this paper, Aerosol Jet 3D nanoparticle printing (Saleh et al., 2017) [23] is utilized to fabricate novel highly complex three dimensional (3D) metallic microlattice materials having near-solid truss members with diameters of 30–60 µm and unit sizes of 100–400 µm. Three types of lattice structures having densities from 5% to 26% of the bulk metal are designed to deform via bending-dominated and buckling-dominated mechanisms under compressive loads. The mechanical response of these microlattices could be tuned by changing the structure density as well as making simple changes to the cell architecture. It is shown that AM related local defects in the 3D structures did not significantly influence their global stress-strain response. A modified semi-empirical foam deformation model is proposed to capture the oscillating hardening and softening mechanical behavior of ordered structures in the plateau stress region and is fit to all three lattice structures printed in this study. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the deformation using 3D beam elements was also performed, which showed an agreement with the experimental observations for both the global stress-strain response and the local deformation for structures that deform by bending. A theoretical model of general applicability is also proposed that captures the periodic hardening and softening behavior of the microlattice structures in the plateau region of their stress-strain plots. The research results establish that AJ printing can be used to fabricate a novel class of microlattice structures with tunable and controlled mechanical response.",

However, the fundamental mechanisms of solidification and microstructure development inherent to the non-equilibrium conditions of this additive manufacturing method, which differ largely from those typical of conventional processing techniques, remain widely unknown. In this work, an in-depth characterization of the microstructure of Al7075 SLM processed samples, built from powder mixtures containing ZrH2 microparticles, demonstrates the occurrence of icosahedral quasicrystal-enhanced nucleation during laser fabrication. This solidification mechanism, only observed to date in cast Al-Zn and yellow gold alloys containing minute additions of Cr (Kurtuldu et al., 2013) or Ti (Chen et al. 2018), and Ir (Kurtuldu et al., 2014), is evidenced by the presence of an abnormally high fraction of twin boundaries and of five-fold orientation symmetry between twinned nearest neighbors lying within a matrix of equiaxed, randomly textured, ultrafine grains. This research attests to the wide range of possibilities offered by additive manufacturing methods for the investigation of novel physical metallurgy phenomena as well as for the design of advanced metals.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a dominant process in the fast-emerging additive manufacturing (AM) industry. Despite the many advantages that can be gained by adopting AM, sustained future growth in this industrial sector requires AM to overcome several barriers, most notably, the formation of in-part defects and the high production cost. Motivated by the growing interest of reducing feedstock cost, we studied the cost-efficient hydride-dehydride (HDH) Ti-6Al-4 V powder in L-PBF and show that the in-part porosity can be controlled to produce nearly fully dense (> 99.8% density) components by optimizing process parameters. The process map that was developed with the HDH powder offers a general guideline for the usage of non-spherical powder in powder bed AM. In this work, we investigated the size, morphology, and spatial distribution of the powder-induced porosity in 3D and quantified the interaction between the HDH powder layer and keyhole fluctuation in-situ by utilizing advanced synchrotron-based x-ray computed tomography and dynamic x-ray radiography. With the assistance of a Monte Carlo image-based analysis, we propose two porosity formation mechanisms and attribute them to the unique characteristics of the HDH powder bed, i.e., variable local packing and larger particle size.",

    "abstract": "Bioresorbable stents (BRS) potential in treating coronary heart disease is still to be further developed. Current trends include research with new polymeric materials, the need for thinner struts combined with appropriate mechanical properties, radiopacity and optimized local drug delivery. This work presents a novel solvent-cast direct-write (SC-DW) printing system to manufacture BRS onto a rotating cylinder with poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) and poly(l-lactic-co-ɛ-caprolactone) (PLCL) inks. Printed stents were characterized in terms of mechanical, thermal and biological properties with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Expansion assays showed that stents withstood pressures of at least 16 atm and the indirect cytotoxicity test indicated that stents were biocompatible. Polymeric inks were further modified with the addition of 3 radiopaque agents, namely iodine, triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) and barium sulfate (BaSO4) to render stents radiopaque. Subsequent characterization showed a general increase in strut thickness with respect to control PLLA or PLCL stents, which in turn resulted in higher resistance to compression. Microcomputed tomography was used to assess stents' radiopacity, showing that TIBA and BaSO4-containing stents presented high X-ray attenuation values and maintained their radiopacity after 3 months incubation time.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a concept of using surface roughness data as an evaluation tool of the process variation in a commercial Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) machine is demonstrated. The interactive effects of powder recoating, spatter generation, gas flow and heat transfer are responsible for the intra-build quality inconsistency of the L-PBF process. Novel specimens and experiments were designed to investigate how surface roughness varies across the build volume and with the progression of a build. The variation in roughness has a clear and repeatable pattern due to the strong impact of the orientation of inclined surface to the laser origin. The effects of other factors such as exposure sequence of specimens, build height, and recoating process are less prominent and are difficult to isolate. A neural network regression model was built upon the large dataset in measured Ra values. The neural network model was applied to predict distribution of roughness within the build volume under hypothetical processing conditions. Connections between the predicted variation in roughness and underlying physical mechanisms are discussed. The present work has value for machine qualification and modifications which lead to the manufacturing of parts with better consistency in quality. The detailed variation observed in surface roughness can be used as a reference for designing experiments to optimise processing parameters in order to minimise the roughness of inclined surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Laser-based powder bed fusion of 300-grade maraging steel allows the production of parts with a high hardness, which improves the service life and wear resistance of tooling or mould insert produced from this material. The material typically consists of a martensitic matrix material, with retained austenite and nano-precipitation. The transformation from austenite to martensite has been linked to compressive stresses at the surface of parts produced in 300-grade maraging steel. In a cantilever beam-type part, this means that after cutting from the base-plate, the part will bend downwards, which is the opposite direction from the deformation found in most other materials after additive manufacturing. One way to gain insight into processing 300-grade maraging steel, while limiting the number of test samples that need to be printed, is by means of a numerical model. Using previously established models, additive manufacturing of a cantilever part in 300-grade maraging steel is simulated. Inclusion of the transformation from austenite to martensite into a numerical simulation of the laser-based powder bed fusion revealed the origin of the compressive stress at the surface of a simple cantilever beam-type sample. Additionally, changing the effective laser power through the laser absorptivity shows that the behaviour of the post-cutting deformation flips as compared to more conventional materials. Information about the laser absorption coefficient is rare, while it can greatly affect the results of a simulation. It is included in the presented result through the effective laser power, which is the product of the input laser power and laser absorption coefficient. When the effective laser power is changed from 95 W to 47.5 W, the cantilever bends upwards rather than downwards after release from the base plate. The results demonstrate the major influence played by the laser absorption coefficient on the simulation, an aspect to which little attention is paid in literature, but is proven to be one of the main factors to determine the component distortions after the laser-based powder bed fusion process.",

    "abstract": "Process parameters for manufacturing of complex parts in electron beam powder bed fusion are usually derived from material-specific process windows, which are established by fabrication and evaluation of standardized cuboid specimen. The mechanisms defining low- and high-energy boundaries of the process window are well understood. The boundary emerging at high scan speeds and beam power however, was observed but the underlying mechanism is not further discussed. In addition, appropriate methodologies to transfer process parameters from standardized process windows to complex geometries are not readily available, as the meltpool geometry is significantly affected by the scan length. This work introduces and verifies a characteristic scan length dependent process parameter limit for the fabrication of complex geometries. Electron-optical process monitoring enables the surface characterization for a wide range of process parameter and the subsequent identification of the process parameter limit as a linear function of scan length. A semi-analytical heat conduction model is used to examine the corresponding meltpool geometries. The underlying mechanism is determined as the meltpool stability limit, which occurs, when the aspect ratio of the meltpool reaches the threshold for a liquid film instability. Based on the meltpool geometries for different scan lengths, an analytical relationship for the process parameter limit as a function of scan length is proposed. This relationship may be used as a guideline for the selection of process parameters and the development of new scan strategies for the fabrication of complex geometries.",

    "abstract": "In three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting, errors during the printing process leads to lower structural fidelity, and the desired structural and functional performances cannot be fully satisfied. Process monitoring with high-speed imaging techniques is helpful for identifying material deposition errors. 3D reconstruction of printed objects enables comprehensive evaluation of structural characteristics, with wide-field full-depth imaging being necessary for large objects. In this study, we demonstrate 3D extrusion-based bioprinter-associated optical coherence tomography (3D P-OCT) to achieve high-speed, wide-field and full-depth imaging, and provide in situ process monitoring and comprehensive evaluation for 3D bioprinting. In 3D P-OCT, a wide field was achieved with a lateral image mosaic using the simplified iterative closest point algorithm, and the extension of imaging depth was achieved with a longitudinal image mosaic using image fusion based on maximum intensity values. During the printing process, 3D P-OCT enables real-time multi-parameter quantification for intelligent feedback. In conclusion, with in situ process monitoring and evaluation, 3D P-OCT contributes to ensure better structural and functional performances of 3D functional tissue constructs.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the lack of suitable photoinitiators (PI) and photoinitiating systems (PISs) represents the utmost challenge in 3D-VAT printing. High photoinitiating efficiency is needed for example in the presence of nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which absorb and scatter light. Many prominent PISs contains iodonium salt as an initiator and a second component as a photosensitizer. This study addresses the high demand for innovative PISs with improved photoinitiating efficiency by a complete cycle of research: from the synthesis of new biphenyl derivatives, through their employment as photosensitizers of iodonium salt for light-induced cationic, free-radical, and hybrid polymerization processes, to the representative application in 3D printing processes such as digital light processing (DLP) or laser printing. The ultimate performance of the newly synthetized compounds was tested by preparing 3D-printable photosensitive nanocomposite resins filled with CNTs as a nanoscale filler. Their photopolymerization kinetics as well as the effect of the CNT concentration on the crosslinking were analyzed via real-time FTIR and photo-rheology. The printouts were observed with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the key printing parameters were determined, i.e. Ec (critical energy to initiate polymerization) and Dp (penetration depth of curing light). Our results evidence the capability of the synthetized compounds to take part in the photoinitiating systems of complex and demanding 3D printing applications.",

Hence, wood fibre reinforced filaments have the potential to be used in four-dimensional (4D) printing. In this work, biocomposites based on granulated or milled thermomechanical pulp (TMP) fibres and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) were prepared and evaluated based on their tensile properties. Poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHA) or poly(butylene-adipate-terephthalate) (PBAT) were included in the biocomposite recipes to assess their effect on the melt flow index (MFI) and tensile properties. Clear effects of the TMP fibre morphology on MFI were quantified. Biocomposites containing 20 wt% PBAT turned out to be stronger and tougher than the ones containing PHA. Based on that, filaments for 3D and 4D printing were manufactured. Interestingly, the tensile strength of 3D printed specimens containing milled TMP (TMPm) fibres was about 33% higher compared to those containing TMP fibre granulate (TMPg). Using hot water as the stimulus, the 3D printed specimens containing TMPg showed a greater reactivity and shape change compared to TMPm specimens.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) has become an established method for manufacturing end-use metal components. Exploiting the geometric freedom of additive manufacturing (AM) offers broad possibilities for part optimization and enables performance enhancements across industry sectors. However, part shape and feature size have been found to locally affect residual stresses, melt pool cooling rates, microstructure, and thus the mechanical properties of components. Even though the mesoscale structure can locally induce microstructural changes, there are no prior studies on how it influences corrosion. Using AM-produced, optimized parts in critical applications necessitates a better understanding of their long-term performance. In this study, lattice structures were used to probe the influence of feature size and shape on corrosion susceptibility and its spatial localization. The susceptibility of submillimeter LPBF-fabricated 316L stainless steel lattice structures to corrosion was investigated by conducting a 21-day immersion corrosion test in an aqueous 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. Schoen gyroid and Schwarz diamond triply periodic minimal surface lattices were manufactured with three unit cell sizes and wall thicknesses (0.867, 0.515, and 0.323 mm). The nominal surface and cross-sectional areas were the same for the two geometries. X-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) scans before and after the corrosion test were compared for volumetric losses. In addition, the mechanical properties and microstructure of the samples were evaluated. As part of the study, a workflow to register, index, and analyze volumetric changes of consecutive microCT image stacks was developed. The reported method is applicable to any time-lapse studies with microCT. Three out of five of the 0.323 mm wall thickness lattices displayed visually aggressive pitting. Based on the microcomputed tomography data, the mass losses were localized either in the entrapped powder particles or partially melted surface globules. Corrosion did not occur in the dense base material. The total mass losses ranged from 8 to 19 mg. Despite visual indications to support a higher corrosion susceptibility for the smallest lattice sizes, the mass loss values did not confirm this conclusion. The tensile test results did not provide any clear indications of latent corrosion effects on mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) has widely demonstrated its ability to economically produce parts at low volumes. Attention is now shifting to higher volume applications, such as mass customization and the manufacture of standard parts. In these contexts, production losses due to process variability and inefficient machine use are common concerns for the application of AM. The Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) metric is a tool widely used in traditional manufacturing to assess the effective use of production capacity. Previous studies seeking to apply OEE to AM are limited in scope and have neglected the above sources of inefficiency. This article seeks to address this gap in two ways. First, we present a framework for measuring OEE within AM operations; and systematically map the 'six production losses' to the AM workflow to codify our understanding of the main sources of inefficiency. Second, we conduct a simulation study investigating how the AM operations approach, product variety and lead time requirements affect the OEE of an AM process. Our findings demonstrate that – with some conceptual adaptation – the OEE metric can indeed be used in the context of AM. Furthermore, we identify the approach to AM operation as a major determinant of performance in terms of the OEE achieved. We conclude with a set of managerial insights on how to apply the OEE metric to AM processes in practice.",

The acoustic resonance measurements are tested against an experimental database that covers a broad range of process parameters and large variations of the standard volumetric energy density. Two other nondestructive techniques are used to assess the potential of the RUS measurements of additively manufactured samples: the easy-to-use Archimedes density measurement and the cost-intensive computerized X-ray tomography. Our results show that RUS provides both qualitative and quantitative insights that allow the detection of the amount of lack of fusion porosities and the estimation of the elastic properties of the fabricated samples. Quantitative correlations between the three nondestructive testing methods are obtained, hinting at how RUS could be used effectively for systematic post-production testing of LPBF samples.",

    "abstract": "Computationally efficient models that consider only conduction are increasingly used in powder bed fusion (PBF) to predict the thermal history for relatively large build volumes. We propose a systematic method to calibrate experimentally representative heat sources for use in such models. An inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP) methodology is applied to determine the parameters that characterise a double-ellipsoid volumetric heat source, based on temperature measurements taken from the solidification boundary of the melt pool. We demonstrate that these fitted parameters follow well-defined trends across a range of laser powers and scan speeds, for melt pools in the conduction and transition modes typically used in laser PBF. Furthermore, we found that these trends in the fitted parameters are related to the energy density of the scanning laser beam, enabling an appropriate source to be calculated even at intermediate laser powers and scan speeds where calibration experiments have not been undertaken. These results enable a heat source to be selected for conduction-only models that incorporates experimentally calibrated effects such as the laser absorption and the penetration of the vapour depression into the melt pool, which are computationally expensive to calculate from first principles. The approach could also be used to characterize laser PBF systems, for example to monitor the drift in process settings that occur over time. The datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are available in the PURE repository, with the identifier https://doi.org/10.17861/a1b95c12-5734-47f9-a469-ea75e73eb143 . • Experimental calibration of heat sources for conduction-only numerical models • Source is related to laser energy density for conduction and transition melt pools • Source can be interpolated for process settings between calibration experiments • Melt pool evolution during island scans inferred from heat source from first track",

    "abstract": "With the development of material extrusion (ME) technology, ME parts have been widely adopted in various industries owing to their cost-effectiveness. However, air gaps, which are intrinsic problems in the process, are the main reason for the low coalescence, resulting in deteriorating mechanical properties. In addition, the presence of an air gap increases the deviation of the mechanical properties in a build-orientation and worsens the difference in mechanical properties with build orientations. Thus, the reduction of air gaps should be achieved to expand the applications of ME parts. In this study, the authors investigated the effectiveness of a warm isostatic pressure (WIP) process to reduce the air gap. It can be concluded that the WIP process can be helpful to reduce anisotropy and to improve the ductility and bonding force between layers.",

Manual design is difficult, time-consuming, and leads to sub-optimal designs that fail to fully exploit the extended geometric freedom that additive manufacturing offers. By using topology optimization and incorporating all manufacturing steps (printing, milling, and assembly) into the optimization formulation, high-quality optimized and manufacturable designs can be obtained in an automated manner. With a special focus on overhang control, minimum feature size, and computational effort, the proposed methodology is demonstrated using a case study of an industrial motion stage, optimized for maximum eigenfrequencies. For this case study, an optimized design can be obtained in a single day, showing a substantial performance increase of around 15% as compared to a conventional design. The generated design is manufactured using laser powder-bed fusion in aluminum and experimentally validated within 1% of the simulated performance. This shows that the combination of additive manufacturing and topology optimization can enable significant gains in the high-tech industry.",

    "abstract": "In-situ alloying using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) allows for formation of new alloys and complicated components with spatially controlled characteristics. A major issue in in-situ alloying is the macro-segregation of alloying elements, that results in chemical inhomogeneity. The precise control of composition is one of the most important steps in any effective in-situ alloying process. In this study, a mesoscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for simulating single-tracks is developed to advance the in-depth understanding of in-situ alloying of dissimilar metals. Surface tension and recoil pressure driven flows at the free surface, rapid phase change, laser reflections, and other physical phenomena affecting the LPBF process have all been examined. Species conservation is used to trace the mixing of different metals. Simulations are performed by melting a layer of Al powder on a Cu substrate, and the impact of recoil pressure and Marangoni convection driven flows on Al-Cu mixing was addressed. The homogeneity of the simulated track is quantified by defining a mixing index. The effect of different laser energy densities and remelting on the homogeneity of the deposited track is investigated. Numerically, it was observed that the high thermal conductivity of both metals results in a sharp and short melt pool, and rapid solidification of such a melt pool generates a heterogeneous concentration dispersion. At high energy density, a low mixing index value is observed, indicating improved homogeneity in the deposited track. Furthermore, remelted tracks have a low mixing index value, indicating that remelting is an effective strategy for improving homogeneity. This study provides fundamental insights on the mixing of dissimilar metals and aims to support future research activities on the design and development of new alloys using LPBF process.",

    "abstract": "Supramolecular polymers are the most used materials for 3D printing applications because of their ability to improve the flow behavior of inks, and consequently enhance the mechanical strength of printed architectures. However, their interactions are assessed without considering the fact that their formed structures are affected by the printing process. Here, the effects of printer temperature of an extrusion-based printing system, or surface temperature of a laser powder bed fusion printer, on the molecular behavior of starch were investigated. Starch, being a highly branched polymer, was selected as the tested biopolymer since it provides numerous noteworthy benefits for an investigation of the depolymerization/crosslinking mechanisms upon printing, which could shed light on the impact of 3D printing on non-degradable materials. Completely different behaviors of starch functional properties are found between the two printing systems, where the extrusion-based printer promoted a significant degradation of the starch chains, while the laser powder bed fusion offered a typical behavior associated with crosslinking/branching. Extrusion 3D printing induced a reduction in starch molecular size and therefore in the structural strength of networks formed from it. However, this was also found to increase the starch digestibility rate/extent. In contrast, laser powder bed fusion increased the molecular size, inducing a viscoelastic gel-like character. At the same time, it decreased the starch digestion rate/extent. The obtained data offers information that can support the mechanistic interpretation of the depolymerization/crosslinking kinetics on the non-degradable materials, where it may be much harder to obtain the branch-length distribution.

    "abstract": "The effect that the infill orientation angle has on the strain-rate dependence of the yield stress for material extrusion additive manufactured (ME-AM) PolyLactic Acid (PLA) material was investigated. Symmetric angle-ply stacking sequences were used to produce ME-AM tensile test samples. Measured yield stresses were compensated for the voided structure, typical of ME-AM components. Furthermore, molecular orientation and stretch was macroscopically assessed by a thermal shrinkage procedure. Additionally, hot-press compression molded (CM) samples were manufactured and mechanically characterized in uniaxial tensile and compression in order to determine the material's isotropic bulk properties. Initial model parameters for the Ree–Eyring modification of the Eyring flow rule were determined using CM data. According to SEM fractography, all samples showed microscopically brittle fracture behavior. Notwithstanding, contrary to CM samples, ME-AM specimens showed macroscopically ductile stress–strain behavior and a transition from a regime with only a primary α-deformation process, at low strain rates, to a regime with 2 deformation processes (α+β), at high strain rates. These effects are an influence of the processing step and are attributed to the molecular orientation and stretch of the polymer chains, provoking anisotropic mechanical properties. As a consequence, a deformation-induced change of the Eyring rate constants is needed to adequately describe the strain-rate dependence of the ME-AM yield stress behavior, leaving the initial activation volumes unchanged. Taking this deformation-dependence of the rate constants into account, yield stresses as a function of infill orientation angle can be appropriately predicted.",

    "abstract": "Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) offers high flexibility in the production of customized and geometrically complex parts. The technique receives great interest from industry and academia but faces substantial challenges regarding processability and insufficient mechanical properties of LAM-produced material. One reason is that currently mainly conventional alloys are being used in LAM, which were developed for different processes such as casting. Since these alloys are not optimized for the specific process conditions encountered in LAM such as fast cooling and cyclic re-heating, they cannot be expected to perform ideally in such processes regarding processability and resulting mechanical properties. Here we present the development of a new, simple ternary Fe-Ni-Ti maraging-type alloy tailor-made for LAM. We used compositionally graded samples to screen Ti compositions from 0 to 21 at. % and efficiently identify promising microstructures and mechanical properties. Under LAM solidification conditions the desired mainly martensitic microstructure needed for a maraging steel formed at Ti compositions ranging from 0 to 7 at. %. Within this composition range, the intended microstructure is formed and additionally some unique process conditions of LAM such as cyclic re-heating can be exploited. Specifically, in-situ phase transformations can be controlled during LAM, via the thermal history. At higher Ti compositions two different eutectic microstructures with different primary phases were found that show a high hardness of up to 700 HV.",

    "abstract": "This work demonstrates the tailoring of the microstructure of two FeMnSi-based shape memory alloys during laser powder bed fusion. Significant variations in the microstructure of the parts can be induced by modifying the scanning speed or the scanning strategy during the process. Specifically, the volume phase fractions, texture, and grain size and morphology change with the applied processing parameters as the thermal history experienced by the material is modified. Additionally, the generally undesired Mn evaporation during laser melting can be deliberately exploited to manipulate the phase composition in the final microstructure. Taking advantage of this, graded-microstructure samples with tailored amounts of the two phases (bcc-δ and fcc-γ) and distinct microstructure at different locations can be fabricated. A good combination of pronounced shape memory effect and ultrahigh strength can be achieved in this way. The findings of this study offer valuable insights that can drive future research and advancements in additive manufacturing, opening exciting opportunities for the fabrication of multifunctional and high performance materials.",

    "abstract": "Material extrusion (ME) has become a popular 3D printing method for large-scale applications such as in the automotive, naval, aerospace, and architecture sectors. It allows the production of complex, customized parts without the need of labour-intensive molds. The increasing need to produce larger and larger parts has been addressed with the introduction of large pellet extrusion systems to increase the extrusion rate. With these extruders the production time is not limited by the extrusion rate of the extruder (kg/h) but by the time the material needs to cool down before the next layer can be printed consecutively. Furthermore, larger bead dimensions result in increased material usage and, therefore, might affect the environmental impact of the printed element. In this study, a method for large extrusion 3D printing based on hollow beads is proposed, to address the limitations of speed, cooldown and maximize the extrusion rate of thermoplastic 3D printing. This paper introduces Hollow-Core 3D printing (HC3DP) and compares it to off-the shelf large-scale pellet extruders and their maximum achievable extrusion rate for a given geometry. A comparative analysis of cooldown characteristics between conventional thermoplastic extrusion 3D printing and HC3DP validates that the latter increases the maximum possible extrusion rate. Additionally, the successful 3D printing of large-scale beads with multiple polymer feedstocks is demonstrated. Then the data associated with printing speed and material usage is presented and discussed in comparison with thermoplastic and other large-scale 3D printing methods. The fabrication of large-scale hollow-core beads at a dimension of 24x20mm is showcased with an extrusion rate of 7250 mm3/s (1308 material, 5941 air). HC3DP for large-scale applications is validated through the production of 2-meter tall cylinders with a diameter of 400 mm in less than two hours. Furthermore, bespoke die geometries that subdivide the inside of hollow 3D-printed beads are presented. To successfully print those, the concept of differentiated internal air pressure per print point is introduced. Finally, 3PT bending tests are conducted to compare different die geometries. In conclusion, this study presents a printing method that highlights the benefits of hollow core 3D printing for large-scale applications, showcasing its positive impact on both the printing process and resulting part properties. By addressing the limitations of traditional approaches, HC3DP pushes polymer 3D printing into a scale relevant for architecture and construction, offering similar extrusion rates as concrete 3DP.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) has enabled the fabrication of extremely complex components such as porous metallic lattices, which have applications in aerospace, automotive, and in particular biomedical devices. The fatigue resistance of these materials is currently an important limitation however, due to manufacturing defects such as semi-fused particles and weld lines. In this work a chemical–electrochemical surface treatment (Hirtisation®) is used for post-processing of Ti-6Al-4V lattices, reducing the strut surface roughness (Sa) from 12 to 6 μm, removing all visible semi-fused particles. The evenness of this treatment in lattices with relative density up to 18.3% and treatment depth of 6.5 mm was assessed, finding no evidence of reduced effectiveness on internal surfaces. After normalising to quasi-static mechanical properties to account for material losses during hirtisation (34%–37% reduction in strut diameter), the fatigue properties show a marked improvement due to the reduction in surface roughness. Normalised high cycle fatigue strength increased from around 0.1 to 0.16-0.21 after hirtisation, an average increase of 80%. For orthopaedic implant devices where matching the stiffness of surrounding bone is crucial, the fatigue strength to modulus ratio is a key metric. After hirtisation the fatigue strength to modulus ratio increased by 90%, enabling design of stiffness matched implant materials with greater fatigue strength. This work demonstrates that hirtisation is an effective method for improving the surface roughness of porous lattice materials, thereby enhancing their fatigue performance.",

Two cylindrical samples are considered: ∅ 1.3 mm and ∅ 2.0 mm. The larger specimen demonstrates better fatigue resistance particularly in the high-cycle regime, with the differing surface roughness contributing to this effect. It is also confirmed that processing-induced porosity can compromise the fatigue performance even when the initiation sites are surface defects. The larger contribution of porosity to the fatigue fracture process of the larger specimen results in a higher scatter in the fatigue life. Differences in microstructure do not seem to contribute strongly to the variation in fatigue properties of the two specimens, but we present some evidence that the coarser microstructure of the larger specimen promotes a stronger tolerance to defects and induces more tortuous crack paths which hinders fatigue crack growth.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is one of the most commonly used metal additive manufacturing technologies due to its advantages in fabricating complex structures. The LPBF process utilizes laser scanning to melt and consolidate the powders, in which the laser tool paths are often referred to as the scan pattern. However, traditional scan patterns could cause large distortion due to residual stresses induced during the fabrication process. Although recently some studies have attempted to develop optimization methods instead of using the empirical trial-and-error approach, they are seldomly implemented for fabricating 3D geometries due to various limitations. In this paper, we propose novel adaptive toolpath generation algorithms based on minimizing thermal gradients so that can reduce the part distortion. The objective function of temperature fields is determined by numerical simulation both considering time and distance. Two constraints including collision-free and smoothing constraints are also incorporated during the toolpath patterns generation process. In addition, to improve the efficiency of adaptive toolpath generation algorithms for large or complex structures, island-based strategy is developed and combined with the adaptive toolpath generation algorithms. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to validate the proposed algorithms. The optimal parameters consisting of smoothing coefficient and searching radius are determined by toolpath patterns analysis and characterization of the fabricated cube samples. The fabricated cube samples with optimal adaptive toolpath patterns are compared with traditional zigzag patterns as well and results show that they are at the same level of characterization in surface roughness, microhardness and relative density values. Six different groups of cantilever beams are fabricated and the distortions are measured to compare the effects of toolpaths on the distortion. Results show that the distortion of our proposed algorithms could reduce about 46 % compared with that of the zigzag patterns and reduce about 36 % compared with that of the traditional chessboard-based patterns. Therefore, our algorithms proposed in this paper can significantly reduce the distortion during the LPBF process. In addition, we extend our proposed algorithms from 2D to 3D cases to realize fabrication of complex 3D geometries. Finally, we fabricated a \"molar tooth\" model with freeform surfaces and overhang feature to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed algorithms.",

A good understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the tamping effect is therefore crucial for producing high-quality coatings, unfortunately, very few studies along this direction have been conducted. In this study, a multi-particle impact model was proposed to investigate the tamping effect on the deformation behavior and morphology of Cu particles in cold spray. It was found that the tamping effect could induce a traceable change in the flattening ratio of the first coating layer, which served as a reliable indicator for identifying the critical velocity. By continuously flattening the particles, the tamping effect led to a denser microstructure of the under-layer coating, although such a densification effect would become weaker with the increase of coating thickness. At a high impact velocity, the obstruction and extrusion of surrounding particles were not ignorable, as these interactions could significantly affect the thickness and shape of the central coating and thus affect the overview surface quality of additively manufactured copper coatings. In addition, the particles with a higher impact velocity exhibited a stronger tamping effect during cold spray, which resulted in a higher risk to penetrate the coating with potential damage to the substrate.",

    "abstract": "When manufacturing parts using material extrusion additive manufacturing and anisotropic polymers, the mechanical properties of a manufactured component are strongly dependent on the print trajectory orientation. We conduct non-planar slicing and optimize the print trajectories to maximize the alignment between the material deposition direction and the stress flow induced by a predefined load case. The trajectory optimization framework considers manufacturability constraints in the form of uniform layer height and line spacing. We demonstrate the method by manufacturing a load bearing mechanical bracket using a 5-axis 3D printer and a liquid crystal polymer material. The failure strength and stiffness of the optimized bracket are improved by a factor of 44 and 6 respectively when compared with conventional printing.",

    "abstract": "Evolution in the energy storage field requires the development of more sustainable and efficient high-performance electrochemical storage devices (EESDs). Additive manufacturing (AM) opens unique opportunities to improve the efficiency and the electrochemical response by the design of 3D electrodes and the increasing of exposed active surface area impossible to achieve by other processing techniques. In other to reach high-performance EESDs, carbonaceous species are well-established as electroactive materials owing to their electronic properties, low cost, and sustainable origin. Although the materials have been widely investigated, there is a lack of feedstock development for the fabrication of EESDs by AM technologies. This work presents the fabrication of metals free light conductive filaments for material thermal extrusion (MTE) by formulating PLA-based composites with a high content of colloidal graphite and graphene (15–25 vol%). By the colloidal characterization and surface modification of the carbonaceous species, an improved distribution and enhanced platelet/polymer bond were achieved, provoking the inorganic phase's orientation during the extrusion process. Prepared filaments were characterized to analyze the influence of the microstructural anisotropy on thermal, thermorheological, mechanical, and electrical properties. Subsequently, developed filaments were used to print complex electrodes by MTE, enhancing the electrochemical properties of the electrodes with superior control of the macrostructural design. The developed colloidal filaments with an oriented inorganic microstructure, not only allow a defined shaping of the outer structure of the electrodes but also let the design of completely different microstructures. Consequently, different microstructural configurations were printed increasing the number of conduction paths in the polymeric matrix to achieve high electric conductivities (22 S.m-1) in printed electrodes.",

    "abstract": "Liquid metal jetting droplet-on-demand additive manufacturing is an attractive alternative to industry-standard, laser-based metal additive manufacturing techniques that use powder feedstocks and produce large heat affected zones. Liquid metal jetting provides a low feedstock footprint, minimal materials waste, less contamination and inclusions from feedstock, and is compatible with a large range of materials. However, little has been reported on the liquid metal jetting process-structure-property relationships that are crucial to understanding how to consistently print high quality metal parts. We investigate the effects of build plate temperature, infill pattern, and track raster rate on the macro- and microstructure, density, hardness, and tensile strength of metal parts created with our custom droplet-on-demand setup using pure tin feedstock as a surrogate for more relevant structural materials. We found that although the build plate temperature had the largest influence on the structure and properties, the infill pattern is an important factor for optimal structural integrity. It was observed that the track raster rate influenced track-to-track porosity and should be considered in toolpath development. Despite printing in ambient air, we could not identify oxide on the surface or in the bulk of the parts and saw no adverse effects on microstructure or tensile performance. The results and methods of this study will help guide future work in optimizing the liquid metal jetting process to reliably print parts using any liquid metal jetting system for a wide variety of metal feedstocks.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a strategy for creating highly oriented crystalline-amorphous composites using the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. The strategy involves using a novel two-stage melting approach and ultra-high-pressure hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on well-known AMZ4 (Zr59.3Cu28.8Al10.4Nb1.5) and equiatomic CuZr amorphous alloys. The experiments demonstrate that by the fine-tuning laser parameters, allowed to obtain parts with purely amorphous material and to create geometry-specific microstructural design composites based on laminate amorphous-crystalline structure. This approach also provides novel opportunities for nonequilibrium phase distribution design by controlling local crystallization in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and avoiding heat accumulation. Additionally, the porous amorphous material can be densified without crystallization using HIP at a temperature near the supercooled liquid region. The distribution of the crystalline phase created during LPBF and crystallization on pre-induced nuclei during HIP was proven to be a critical factor for composite properties. Wear and bending tests reveal the influence of crystalline-amorphous layers orientation on mechanical properties. The functional demonstrators were manufactured to show the possibilities in the design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) with a microstructure-designed composites.",

    "abstract": "Many naturally occurring materials exhibit repeating hierarchical structures, comprising of multiple constituent materials that combine to form a composite material. In this work an additive manufacturing technology known as Material Jetting is used to fabricate co-continuous multi-material structures. The structures are produced using two materials with distinctly different mechanical properties at a variety of proportions. The design of experiments was developed based on a triply periodic minimal surface known as the Gyroid, allowing for different scales and shapes with co-continuous material phases to be generated for a wide range of proportions. The resulting designs were assessed for stiffness, strength and ductility, using a combination of analytical models, finite element modelling and a quasi-static compressive experiment. It was found that the most important factor for strength and stiffness is the material proportion. The surface-type gyroid shape resulted in increased ductility, and slightly higher stiffness and strength compared to the network-type structure which demonstrated bending-type failure and a more gradual yielding behaviour. Using larger unit cells for the same volume (less unit cells per sample) resulted in a reduction in mechanical performance and greater error between modelling and physical experiments as boundary conditions began to dominate. The accuracy of the various modelling methods was also assessed, with the finite element method with periodic boundary conditions providing the best results for predicting the effect of shape, while the analytical power-law model provided the best fit to the experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in the quality and accuracy of additive manufacturing have drawn particular attention to metamaterials characterized by a multistable response to achieve exceptional mechanical properties. This work focuses on the design, fabrication, testing, and simulation of tensegrity-like lattice chains accomplishing a multistable behaviour. The chains are composed of chiral tensegrity-like units featuring a highly nonlinear bistable response with compression-twisting coupling. Different chains are designed by exploiting the chirality of the units and realised by the inverted stereolithography technique. Their mechanical response is experimentally characterized, demonstrating the attainment of the desired multistable behaviour. A predictive semi-analytical model is derived to reconstruct the multistable energy landscape and force-vs-displacement curve of the whole chain. The presented chains may constitute a flexible platform for programmable materials, potentially extending to modular chains also based on other types of tensegrity-like units.",

    "abstract": "Cementitious materials may exhibit significant creep at very early age. This is potentially important for concrete 3D printing, where the material is progressively loaded even before it sets. However, does creep actually affect the buildability of 3D printed concrete? Herein, the influence of early-age creep on the buildability of 3D printed concrete is studied numerically. Creep is considered using the \"local-force method\", which was developed in our previous work. This 3D printing model be used to quantify the influence of early-age creep on typical failure modes, i.e., structural instability due to buckling and plastic collapse resulting from material yielding. The green strength and early-age creep experiments are conducted to characterize early-age visco-elastic-plastic behaviors. The model is then validated with the comparison to printing experiment about buildability quantification and failure mode prediction. Parametric analyses are subsequently performed to quantify the influence of early-age creep on various printing geometries in which different failure modes are dominant. The numerical results highlight the significance of initial printing time and material mix design for predicting the buildability of 3D printing of concrete. Finally, a discussion on how creep affects structural buildability is given from the perspective of localized damage and element strain.",

    "abstract": "The formation of residual stresses is inevitable during the additive manufacturing of metallic parts due to thermo-mechanicals effects, but the chaotic nature of printing processes makes it impossible to have a comprehensive understanding about the magnitude and distribution of these residuals. The voxel-based eigenstrain (inherent strain) reconstruction method is capable of the full-field reconstruction of residual stresses in discontinuous processing bodies at a scale that depends on the resolution of experimental data without using simplifying assumptions and regularisation functions. This advanced method firstly maps the distribution of eigenstrains and then quantifies corresponding residual stresses, residual elastic strains, and displacements by a cost-effective linear elastic computational framework. The reliability of this process solely depends on the quality of experimental data and the availability of computational power. The motivation behind this study is the use of the voxel-based eigenstrain reconstruction method for the full-field mapping of complex residual stress fields, that cannot be predicted by regularizing assumptions, in discontinuous processing additive manufacturing parts. The height Digital Image Correlation (hDIC) technique satisfied the need for high-quality experimental data by calculating triaxial displacements, corresponding to the elastic response of CM 247 LC powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing part after changes in the boundary conditions due to separation from the base, using optical profilometry measurements at a resolution adjusted in a way to reconstruct Type I residual stresses. Three components of displacements calculated by the hDIC were used to map the distribution of three components of eigenstrains for the reconstruction of six residual stress, six residual elastic strain and three displacement components that belong to the before and after separating from the base states. The reliability of calculations has been validated by monochromatic synchrotron X-ray beams in powder diffraction mode from the same surface of optical profilometry measurements and in transmission mode from the sampling volumes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the complex phase transformations during additive manufacturing (AM) of low-alloy multi-phase steels is a necessary task to discover the mechanisms that lead to formation of AM-specific, heterogeneous microstructures. In the present study, investigations were carried out to gain fundamental insights on microstructure evolution of low-alloy steels during AM and upon post-AM heat-treatments. To this end, a low-alloy steel, with a composition similar to DP600 dual-phase (DP) steel, was processed by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). Subsequently, two post-L-PBF heat-treatments were applied to obtain ferritic-martensitic DP microstructures. The first heat-treatment consisted of austenitization followed by isothermal holding in ferrite (α)/austenite (γ) region (AIH), whereas the second comprised of inter-critical annealing (IC) in α/γ region. The as-built state exhibited a tempered martensitic microstructure with a weak (almost random) crystallographic texture in combination with compositional and morphological heterogeneities. Combination of multiphase-field simulation and multi-scale microstructure characterization revealed that the formation of compositional and morphological heterogeneities in as-built state was governed by consecutive liquid-solid (delta-ferrite (δ) → γ) and solid-solid (γ ↔ martensite (α΄)) phase-transformations. For both post-L-PBF heat-treatments, Mn-segregation bands that formed during L-PBF led to heterogeneous α΄ distribution after annealing. Electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) measurements revealed that the local Mn and C distributions were closely related to the spatial distribution of α and α΄. The AIH heat-treatment resulted in annihilation of morphological heterogeneities, namely coarse- and fine-grained clusters. The absence of austenitization in IC heat-treatment resulted in distribution of ferritic-martensitic DP microstructure in coarse- and fine-grained clusters that inherited the L-PBF specific grain morphology distribution. Lastly, the IC state showed overall best mechanical properties due to the conservation of the heterogenous clustered microstructure, which potentially aided to simultaneously obtain high tensile strength (890.9 MPa) and relatively high ductility (20.5%).",

    "abstract": "The laser powder bed fusion process (LPBF) has been widely used in many industrial sectors, including automotive, aerospace, and biomedical devices. With the fast development of new materials designed for critical applications, the conventional design of experiments for determining an optimal LPBF process window is a time and material-consuming activity. This can impose difficulties on small-to-medium industrial businesses where investing resources are limited. To address these challenges, this study draws inspiration from a reliable diagram used in laser welding to construct a similar diagram for the LPBF process. The objective is to enable the \"right-first-time\" selection of parameters that achieve a minimum of 99% density, regardless of the metallic materials and machine platforms. The diagram is established based on dimensionless beam power and velocity, derived from multiple LPBF process parameters (e.g., laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing) and the thermophysical properties of materials (e.g., melting point, density, thermal diffusivity). Furthermore, hot cracking susceptibility is considered by a strain-rate approach incorporated with the dimensionless thermal strain factor, which benefits when processing hard-to-weld alloys. The diagram shows high reliability in determining parameters corresponding to lack of fusion, keyhole porosity and 99% dense parts when plotting against literature data of LPBF for several metallic materials. Similar results were observed when applying to a novel material ABD-900AM Ni-based alloy, for which no previously published data were available. Moreover, the diagram proved effective in selecting parameters to process the high-cracking susceptible CM247LC Ni-based alloy, resulting in significant mitigation of hot cracking in the as-fabricated parts.",

In this work, 3D patterned structures based on bi-component filaments with a core-shell arrangement have been additively manufactured in a single step by material extrusion. A system has been designed consisting of two concentric syringes for simultaneous printing of pseudoplastic core and shell ceramic inks with a single pressure device. Aqueous boehmite and boehmite/18 vol.% graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) composite inks have been formulated. The rheology of both inks has been matched to ensure the printability and integrity of the boehmite (core)-composite (shell) layout and its reverse. The as-printed coaxial scaffolds have been treated at 500 ºC for 2 h in nitrogen atmosphere to transform boehmite to γ-alumina while the GNP remain undamaged. The thermal properties and the heat transfer of these robust coaxial structures have been experimentally analysed using the transient pulse source method and a high-resolution infrared camera, respectively. Besides, they have been theoretically simulated by finite element methods. These coaxial architectures promote higher thermal anisotropy as compared to mono-material scaffolds, allowing better control of the heat fluxes. The mechanical behaviour of the different lattice materials has been assessed through compression tests to calculate the strength and the apparent elastic modulus, and the fracture surface of the lattice struts after failure has been examined.",

    "abstract": "Colors enhance the esthetic and functional aspects of three-dimensional (3D) printed objects via material extrusion (MEX). However, existing 3D printing techniques require additional materials and hardware that are either challenging to calibrate or too costly for average 3D printing users. This paper presents a fabrication technique we call 3D printed pyrography, which enables printing multiple shades of color and gradients using a wood filament and a single-nozzle extruder. We investigate the effects of printing temperature and speed on the color properties of wood filament (ColorFabb). Using Euclidean distance in CIELAB color space, we employed perceptual metrics to quantify color differences between samples with different print temperatures (minimum: 195°C, maximum: 300°C, and 5°C increment). As a result, we identified all samples had perceivable discrete colors (ΔE ≥ 1), and, by applying a more conservative threshold, we can refine the count to sixteen distinct colors (ΔE ≥ 2.3). This approach underscores the sensitivity of color perception to printing parameters and highlights the utility of ΔE in CIELAB parameters in discerning color differences in 3D printed objects. Furthermore, we encapsulate this information in a custom software interface. This tool allows users to specify shades or map photographic images directly onto 3D surfaces, and generates the G-code that modulates the nozzle temperature and achieves the desired shading. We demonstrate 3D printed pyrography through 11 applications, such as enhancing visual esthetics, offering visual guidance, and embedding markers to merge digital information with physical objects.",

    "abstract": "Binder Jetting is a layer-based additive manufacturing process in which a printhead deposits droplets onto a pre-prepared layer of particles. Upon droplet impact, the binder begins to migrate and infiltrate adjacent areas away from its originally intended location. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism of furan binder migration. Observing in-situ binder spreading is challenging, especially for the furan binder used in this work. The strong discoloration of the surrounding sand makes it difficult to distinguish between the printed pattern and the surrounding loose sand. For this reason, a fluorescent dye is added to the binder. A wavelength-matched laser in the binder jetting machine provides the excitation energy, and in-situ observation of binder migration becomes feasible. The results show an unexpected behavior where the actual microscopic fluid redistribution of the binder does not match the observed macroscopic measurements of other reports. It becomes clear that the migration mechanism of furan binder in sand binder jetting is strongly influenced by gaseous mass transport. To support this theory, a phenomenon called boundary zone is studied by micrographic and computed tomographic analysis. This outer shell region surrounds samples with higher binder contents and extends over a thickness of approximately 400 µm. The binder content here is significantly higher than that of the core of the specimen and its target value, demonstrating that liquid concentration equalization is not feasible. A plausible explanation is evaporation and condensation of binder, resulting in localized binder accumulation in areas of high catalyst to binder ratios. Since binder evaporation is an overlooked issue in furan binder jetting, additional experiments are performed to demonstrate the extent of evaporation. For this, particle layers are deposited on a scale, the printhead deposits binder, and the resulting mass loss is recorded. With a better understanding of binder migration, new strategies can be developed to reduce geometric deviation, improve geometric precision, and possibly allow for higher layer thicknesses in furan sand binder jetting.",

    "abstract": "In material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing, the layer-by-layer structure often presents challenges such as poor adhesion, void formation and rough surfaces, which can compromise the mechanical properties of printed parts and limit their applications. This study investigates whether 3D printing from bicomponent core-sheath filaments instead of printing from conventional monofilaments provides a potential solution to some of the described issues. Based on different material selections, various bicomponent filaments, comprising a rigid core and a soft sheath, were produced through co-extrusion and overcoating extrusion techniques. Tensile properties of 3D-printed specimens with different raster angles (0° vs 45°) from bicomponent filaments are compared to the properties of reference specimens printed from conventional monofilaments. While similar mechanical properties were observed for some 3D-printed specimens from bicomponent filaments (e.g., polylactic acid (PLA)-based), as compared to reference specimens, some core-sheath combinations of polyamide (PA) demonstrated a noticeable improvement of the mechanical properties of 3D-printed specimens, particularly for 45° raster angles. In particular, bicomponent filaments comprising a carbon fiber reinforced PA (PACF) core and a pure PA sheath exhibited improved processability and enhanced structural strength. Moreover, two overcoated filaments consisting of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) monofilament cores with a copolyester (CoPES) sheath were prepared for 3D printing. 3D-printed parts made from PET/CoPES overcoated filaments exhibited good compatibility and satisfactory results when printed at temperatures above the melting point of PET. These findings demonstrate the potential of bicomponent filaments to enhance both printability and mechanical performance of 3D-printed parts, offering new avenues for material selection and design optimization in various 3D printing applications.",

This study presents an optimized analytical approach using acoustic emission (AE) based defect detection technique to identify and quantify process-induced cracks during the DED process. The developed signal processing technique enabled the identification of actual AE events associated with cracking, distinguishing them from other disturbances. Experimental validation was conducted using manufactured parts that were longitudinally sectioned to determine the relationship of the crack location with the recorded acoustic signal. The demonstrated correlation of acoustic signatures with cracking illustrates the robustness of the AE technique to identify the process-induced cracking for quality assurance during the DED process.",

    "abstract": "In the near future, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) may become a valuable widespread alternative to the conventional fossil-based commodity plastics, if drawbacks related to its melt-processability and mechanical properties are overcome. In this work, PHB disadvantages are mitigated by compounding with glycerol trilevulinate (GT) bioplasticizer. The additive synthesis has been studied and optimized, starting from bio-based reagents that are wastes from other productions. GT has shown a remarkable plasticizing effect, making it to compete with commercial green plasticizers, for which several health concerns have recently arisen. The hindrance of GT allowed to increase the free space among the polymeric chains, producing a reduction of the glass transition temperature of PHB of approx. 10 °C with only 5 wt% of additive. The same content of GT also decreases the typical high stiffness of PHB of approx. 30 % and reduces its melt viscosity of 28 %, which are similar or even better plasticization effects that can be obtained with commercial plasticizers. Moreover, GT has made PHB suitable for extrusion to obtain filaments and fabrication of complex architectures by injection-molding and 3D printing, importantly reducing the processing temperature from 200 to 180 °C, thus limiting the associated thermal degradation phenomena. This work opens a new approach based on polymer-compounding to simply mitigate the limiting properties of polyhydroxyalkanoates towards a new class of sustainable commodity plastics.",

    "abstract": "One particularly interesting class of mechanical metamaterials are those having a negative Poisson's ratio, which are referred to as 'auxetics'. Because of their geometrical complexity, auxetic designs cannot always be easily created. However, Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods like material extrusion in 3D printing present the opportunity to construct auxetic structures. Nevertheless, extruded 3D printed material can be highly anisotropic. Before 3D printed auxetics manufactured through material extrusion can be used in engineering applications, it is important to generate powerful simulation tools that can reliably reproduce and foretell their mechanical characteristics irrespective of their form and intricacy. In view of this, the current work proposes printing path-dependent models based on an experimentally validated multi-scale modelling scheme using the Lattice Beam Model (LBM). This is done by first representing idealized microstructures of extruded 3D printed polymers through geometric models and simulating these on the material scale. The aim is to explicitly model the inter-layer and intra-layer bonds that exist in material extruded 3D printed parts by assigning experimentally obtained interface properties that significantly differ from the bulk material. On the auxetic structure scale, two planar auxetic designs are modelled using the determined material scale relationships as input: Re-Entrant (RE) and Rotating Square (RS). In terms of mechanical response, the experimentally and numerically obtained force displacement curves agree reasonably well: the stiffness of the modelled auxetic designs fit well with the experimentally measured ones while the LBM simulations generally provide a good estimation in strength. Finally, it has been shown on both the material and auxetic structure scales that incorporation of the interfacial bond strengths in simulations of extruded 3D printed polymers is important, because neglecting these results in significant overestimation of the strength.",

The reinforcing particles are introduced with varying size and volume concentration to the CCA powder fulfilling two purposes – improving the flowability of the feedstock and to cause nanoparticle strengthening, as demonstrated here using nanoindentation. We focus on the microstructure and texture evolution of all the alloys, and the phase transitioning of the particles. TiN nanoparticles of all sizes dissolve in the melt pool and uniformly precipitate as TiO2. We observed distinctive core-shell nanoparticle formation with higher TiN content that also resulted in 45 % higher tensile strength.

    "abstract": "The 17–4 precipitation-hardened (PH) alloy can be printed into diverse microstructures. Existing reports on the alloy have focused on the effect of Creq/Nieq ratios and the processing parameters of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) on the final microstructures of the δ-ferrite and α'-martensite phases in the alloy. However, the effect of microstructural variations on the residual stress field of LPBFed 17–4 PH stainless steel has not yet been investigated. This study bridges the gap between what is known about the microstructure and residual stresses by proposing an alloy-equivalent phase prediction diagram for the additive manufacturing of the 17–4 PH alloy by varying the Creq/Nieq ratio and volumetric energy density to control residual stresses via microstructure manipulation. Dilatometry and Satoh tests were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the offset effect in martensite transformation. To control the microstructures, samples were fabricated with various Creq/Nieq ratios (2.05, 2.15, 2.30, and 2.49) and laser powers (130, 150, 170, and 190 W). The 17–4 PH alloy exhibited a low Ms temperature and approximately net zero residual stresses in the Satoh test. The study confirmed that martensitic transformation, which occurs more readily at lower Creq/Nieq ratios and higher laser powers, effectively offsets tensile residual stresses during the LPBF process.",

    "abstract": "Fiber orientation is a critical factor in determining the mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of 3D-printed short-fiber polymer composites. However, the current numerical studies on predicting fiber orientation are limited to straight single-strand configurations, while the actual printed parts are often composed of complex multi-layer structures. To address this issue, we conducted numerical simulations of material extrusion in multi-layer big-area additive manufacturing without any post-deposition strand morphology modification mechanism. By examining the effects of material properties and printing conditions when extruding and depositing strands on a fixed substrate as well as previously deposited layers, it was possible to observe the complex interplay between multiple layers and its impact on fiber orientation. The work and methodology presented in this paper can be used to identify optimal extrusion-to-nozzle speed ratios, material rheology, fiber content, and fiber aspect ratio to achieve the desired performance and thermo/mechanical properties of additively manufactured parts. This work is an important contribution towards the manufacture of high-performance, short-fiber polymer composites as the presented methodology can enable engineers to precisely predict and tailor the fiber orientation in 3D printed parts.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is uniquely suitable for healthcare applications due to its design flexibility and cost effectiveness for creating complex geometries. Successful arthroplasty requires integration of the prosthetic implant with the bone to replace the damaged joint. Bone-mimetic biomaterials are utilised due to their mechanical properties and porous structure that allows bone ingrowth and implant fixation. The predictability of predetermined interconnected porous structures produced by AM ensures the required shape, size and properties that are suitable for tissue ingrowth and prevention of the implant loosening. The quality of the manufacturing process needs to be established before the utilisation of the parts in healthcare. This paper demonstrates a novel examination method of acetabular hip prosthesis cups based on X-ray computed tomography (CT) and image processing. The method was developed based on an innovative hip prosthesis acetabular cup prototype with a prescribed non-uniform lattice structure forming struts over the surface, with the interconnected porosity encouraging bone adhesion. This non-destructive, non-contact examination method can provide information of the interconnectivity of the porous structure, the standard deviation of the size of the pores and struts, the local thickness of the lattice structure in its size and spatial distribution. In particular, this leads to easier identification of weak regions that could inhibit a successful bond with the bone.",

    "abstract": "Support structures and materials are indispensable components in many Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems in order to fabricate complex 3D structures. For inkjet-based AM techniques (known as Material Jetting), there is a paucity of studies on specific inks for fabricating such support structures. This limits the potential of fabricating complex 3D objects containing overhanging structures. In this paper, we investigate the use of Tripropylene Glycol Diacrylated (TPGDA) to prepare a thermally stable ink with reliable printability to produce removable support structures in an experimental Material Jetting system. The addition of TGME to the TPGDA was found to considerably reduce the modulus of the photocured structure from 575 MPa down to 27 MPa by forming micro-pores in the cured structure. The cured support structure was shown to be easily removed following the fabrication process. During TG-IR tests the T5% temperature of the support structure was above 150 °C whilst the majority of decomposition happened around 400 °C. Specimens containing overhanging structures (gate-like structure, propeller structure) were successfully manufactured to highlight the viability of the ink as a support material.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) may offer a flexible, cost-effective approach to address conventional manufacturing limitations, such as time-consuming, high work-in-progress, multi-step assembly. In principle AM can also allow more novel geometric or even bespoke designs of structural and functional products. However, in terms of energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors, the benefits of AM have not yet been explored to any significant extent. In this paper, a hybrid-AM system, combining low-cost fused filament fabrication (FFF) and direct ink writing (DIW) techniques, has been designed to fabricate supercapacitors (electro-chemical double layer capacitors, EDLCs) in a single, automated operation. The inherent flexibility of the AM process provided an opportunity to address restrictions in geometric form factor associated with conventional planar supercapacitor manufacturing approaches. Functioning, ring-shaped EDLC devices were manufactured in a single, multi-material operation comprising symmetric activated carbon electrodes in a 1Μ potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte hydrogel. Gravimetric and areal electrode capacitances were 116.4 ± 0.6 F g−1 and 599.2 ± 3.0 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1, with a columbic efficiency of 99.6 ± 0.4% in the as-printed condition. The work aims to accelerate progress towards monolithic integration of energy storage devices in product manufacture, offering an alternative fabrication process for applications with irregular volume/shape and mass-customization requirements.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we have used laser powder bed fusion (PBF) to manufacture and characterize metal microwave components. Here we focus on a 2.5 GHz microwave cavity resonator, manufactured by PBF from the alloy AlSi10Mg. Of particular interest is its thermal expansion coefficient, especially since many microwave applications for PBF produced components will be in satellite systems where extreme ranges of temperature are experienced. We exploit the inherent resonant frequency dependence on cavity geometry, using a number of TM cavity modes, to determine the thermal expansion coefficient over the temperature range 6–450 K. Our results compare well with literature values and show that the material under test exhibits lower thermal expansion when compared with a bulk aluminium alloy alternative (6063).",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulation is a powerful tool for understanding the complex physics of metal additive manufacturing (MAM) processes and to provide guidelines for optimization of the process conditions. The fast kinetics and highly localized nature of the involved phenomena demand high levels of time and space discretization for MAM simulations which significantly increases the computational costs. The existing simplified simulation approaches apply gross approximations to overcome the numerical cost barrier. This study proposes a multiscale approach which breaks down the problem into two scales of local and global simulations. The method argues that a high level of discretization is only required for capturing the physics of fast-kinetics phenomena occurring in the vicinity of the melt-pool, while a much coarser discretization is applicable for the rest of the simulation domain. As a particular type of adaptive submodeling technique, the results of fine-mesh local simulations around the moving melt-pool are combined with the outcome of a coarse-mesh global solution to provide reliable predictions at a significantly reduced computational cost. The efficiency and reliability of the proposed idea has been evaluated for 2D thermal simulation of the selective laser melting process. The outcome of the exercise demonstrates that the methodology can reduce the computational cost of the simulations by an order of magnitude with minimal loss of accuracy.",

Because the mechanical properties of the printed parts depend largely on the microstructure, knowledge on the crystalline architecture is important. We developed a numerical model based on the finite element method to solve the flow, temperature and crystallization kinetics of PA12 powder during sintering using two different geometries. Our results show that the temperature plays a crucial role in the crystallization kinetics and that simplified 0D calculations can be used to study the crystallization kinetics if the temperature behavior in time at a certain location is known. With our choice of initial and boundary conditions, we found primarily crystals of the α′-phase.",

    "abstract": "High Speed Sintering is an advanced powder bed fusion polymer Additive Manufacturing technique aimed at economical production of end-use parts in series manufacture. Surface finish is thus of high importance to end users. This study investigates the surface topography of High Speed Sintered parts produced using a range of different energy-related process parameters including sinter speed, lamp power and ink grey level. Areal surface texture was measured using Focus Variation microscopy and the sample porosity was systematically examined by the X-ray Computed Tomography technique. Surface topography was further characterised by Scanning Electron Microscopy, following which the samples were subject to tensile testing. Results showed that areal surface texture is strongly correlated with porosity, which can be further linked with mechanical properties. Certain texture parameters i.e. arithmetic mean height Sa, root-mean-square Sq and maximum valley depth Sv were identified as good indicators that can be used to compare porosity and/or mechanical properties between different samples, as well as distinguish up-, down-skins and side surfaces. Sa, Sq and Sv for up- and down-skins were found to correlate with the above energy-related process parameters. It was also revealed that skewness Ssk and kurtosis Sku are related to sphere-like protrusions, sub-surface porosity and re-entrant features. Energy input is the fundamental reason that causes varying porosity levels and consequently different surface topographies and mechanical properties, with a 10.07 μm and a 30.21 % difference in Sa and porosity, respectively, between the 'low' and 'high' energy input.",

    "abstract": "This paper extends a previously published fatigue strength estimation methodology for additively manufactured metallic bulk material by additionally accounting for effects of as-built surface layers. Interaction of intrinsic defects and surface texture convergently initiates fatigue failure. Holistic consideration of influencing factors significantly contributes to scientific fatigue assessment of structures fabricated by Laser-Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). Surface texture is highly dependent on the building parameters and performed post treatments. Three dimensional, optical topography scans form the basis of determining representative areal surface texture parameters. Areal notch valley depth Sv, alongside notch radii ρ evaluation, enables usage of a modified Peterson's approach. Effects of notch-like roughness features are quantified by a reduction factor ks, as analogously published for bulk material imperfections kb. Superimposition of ex- and intrinsic material characteristics is empirically assessed by an interaction exponent derived from experimental fatigue data. Macroscopic, tensile residual stresses acting as mean stresses are considered by Smith-Watson-Topper's approach. Unifying presented influencing factors derives a comprehensive model, conceived to estimate fatigue strength of additively manufactured metallic structures. Regardless of post processing condition, sound applicability of developed design approach is substantiated by averaging −7.1%, comparing estimated fatigue strength to experimental results.",

    "abstract": "The capability of additive manufacturing to produce parts with complicated geometrical features is one of the unique advantages of this technology over traditional production methods. However, the intricate interaction between concentrated stress fields imposed by various geometrical profiles, inherent defects, and external loads must be comprehensively recognized to leverage the aforementioned ability. Consequently, this study investigated the simultaneous effects of macroscopic notches and microscale defects on the performance of tool steel 18Ni300 under quasi-static and cyclic loading regimes. The specimens were manufactured using the laser-powder bed fusion technique, a common method for industrial applications that rely on metals. Eleven (horizontally built) sample designs, consisting of external or internal notches with different characteristics, were considered in this study to ensure a comprehensive comparison. The results showed that the surface quality was slightly higher along the notch roots than in the other areas. All the notches, regardless of their types, reduced ductility. Notch strengthening was generally observed in the notched samples under quasi-static loads. However, the degree of strengthening was directly related to the stress concentration factor, unlike for typical conventional metals. This unexpected behavior was attributed to the inherent defects in the manufacturing process. The surface defects at the notch roots played a dominant role in governing fatigue failures. A modification of the Murakami approach was proposed to estimate the fatigue life of notched components fabricated via additive manufacturing. Finally, the applicability of the Solberg–Berto diagram to predict the failure locations in horizontally manufactured samples was evaluated. The diagram largely agreed with the experimental data obtained from this study.",

    "abstract": "The multitude of influences on the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process and local deviations from the intended process conditions can lead to the occurrence of quality deviations. The cyclic nature of the process could enable in-situ process monitoring systems to detect those deviations and to reduce the need for post-process quality control or even prevent defects by utilizing the extracted data for closed-loop or intermittent control. Most existing approaches are focused on the thermal observation of the melt pool or use matrix cameras to view the solidified material from fixed positions. This work presents an approach for in-situ process monitoring by leveraging the process-inherent recoater movement to obtain highly resolving images of the complete process area with a recoater-based line camera. A monitoring system is designed and integrated into a LPBF-machine. The system is calibrated and benchmarked to obtain images with a width of 97.67 mm at a resolution of 5.97 µm/px and a recoater speed of up to 100 mm/s. Details as small as 12.40 µm can be identified according to a USAF1951 test and the focal depth is sufficient to encompass the whole process area (part surface & powder) of a typical LPBF process. Samples with varied conditions are produced and layer-wise images are acquired to evaluate the potential of the system under actual process conditions. Features relating to the brightness and periodicity of the images are defined and extracted from the image data. The relationships between the extracted features on the one hand and the laser power, scanning speed, layer thickness, shielding gas flow and laser defocus on the other hand are investigated and correlations are found. Overall, the findings indicate a high potential of the investigated system for the detection of deviations in the LPBF process and its future application for in-situ quality control.",

Directed Energy Deposition using high power lasers and a powder feed is a useful option but the interactions between the powder stream and the laser beam are not completely understood. It is well known that the powder particles heat up in the laser beam and some theoretical models predict that they can reach their vaporisation temperature and have their flight path altered by the associated recoil pressure. In order to learn more about these phenomena, powder streams were observed with a high-speed camera at different laser powers (up to 6 kW) and with three batches of powder (AlSi10Mg) of different particle sizes. The results showed an increase of powder focussing with increased laser power. In addition, some particles were found to disintegrate in the laser beam. It is demonstrated that particle disintegration is most likely to be caused by the momentum induced by the recoil pressure.",

    "abstract": "Compressibility and viscosity of polymer feedstock are critical to their volumetric flow rate, weld strength, and dimensional accuracy in material extrusion additive manufacturing. In this work, the compressibility and viscosity of an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material is characterized with an instrumented hot end design. Experiments are first performed with a blocked nozzle to characterize the compressibility behavior. The results closely emulate the pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) behavior of a characterized generic ABS. Experiments are then performed with an open nozzle over a range of volumetric flow rates and temperatures. The static pressure data is fit to power-law, Ellis, and Cross viscosity models and the dynamic melt pressure data is then used to jointly fit material constitutive models for compressibility and viscosity. The results suggest that the joint fitting substantially improves the fidelity relative to the separately characterized viscosity and compressibility. The implemented methods support material extrusion process simulation and control including real-time identification of process faults such as (1) limited melting capacity of the hot end, (2) skipping (grinding) of the extruder drive gears, (3) low initial nozzle temperature, (4) varying flow rates associated with the intermeshing gear tooth velocity profile, and (5) delays and reduced melt pressures due to drool prior to extrusion. The ability to monitor the printing process for faults in real time, such as that presented in this work, is critical to born qualified parts. Additionally, these approaches can be used to screen new materials and identify optimal processing conditions that avoid these process faults.",

It is a method based on fused filament fabrication 3D printing with the application of nanofiber interleaves. We used poly (lactide acid) (PLA) both for producing nanofibers by electrospinning and for preparing 3D printing filaments by extrusion. The nanofiber mat (interleave) was placed between two printed layers during the printing process. We systematically studied the morphology of nanofibers at the interlaminar interface and found that nozzle temperature was the essential parameter that affected the adhesion between the nanofiber interleaves and the printed layers. We varied nanofiber content to study its effect on the mechanical properties of nanocomposites. With the integration of nanofibers, nanocomposites obtained improvements in storage modulus and tensile strength.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that two types of fine microstructures have been obtained in the β-containing γ-TiAl alloys by varying the energy density during the EBM process. A uniform α2/β/γ mixed structure containing an α2/γ lamellar region and a β/γ dual-phase region is formed at high energy density conditions. On the other hand, a lower energy density leads to the formation of a peculiar layered microstructure perpendicular to the building direction, consisting of a ultrafine α2/γ lamellar grain layer and a α2/β/γ mixed structure layer. The difference in the microstructures originates from the difference in the solidification microstructure and the temperature distribution from the melt pool, which are dependent on the energy density. Furthermore, it was found that the strength of the alloys is closely related to the volume fractions of the β phase and the ultrafine α2/γ lamellar grains which originates from the massive α grains formed by rapid cooling under low energy density conditions. The alloys with high amounts of these peculiar microstructures exhibit high strength comparable to and higher than the conventional β-containing γ-TiAl at room temperature and 1023 K, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Material Extrusion (MEX) systems with dual-material capability can unlock interesting applications where flexible and rigid materials are combined. When chemically incompatible materials are concerned the adhesion between the two might be insufficient. Therefore researchers typically rely on dovetail type interlocking geometries in order to affix two bodies mechanically. However, dovetail type interlocking introduces extrusion discontinuities and relies on the material's resistance to deformation, which is difficult to model. We propose a simple and effective 3D lattice consisting of interlaced horizontal beams in vertically alternating directions which interlock topologically: the interlaced topologically interlocking lattice (ITIL). It ensures continuous extrusion and ensures an interlock even for highly flexible materials. We develop analytical models for optimizing the ultimate tensile strength of the ITIL lattice in two different orientations relative to the interface: straight and diagonal. The analytical models are applied to polypropylene (PP) and polylactic acid (PLA) and verified by finite elements method (FEM) simulations and physical tensile experiments. In the diagonal orientation ITIL can obtain 82% of the theoretical upper bound of 8.6 MPa. ITIL seems to perform comparably to dovetail interlocking designs, while it lends itself to application to non-vertical interfaces. Optimizing the lattice for non-vertical interfaces, however, remains future work.",

    "abstract": "Glass has a number of attractive properties, such as transparency, chemical resistance, good thermal stability and high electrical resistivity, that make it a favourable material for a range of applications, including medical technology, electronics, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. However, compared to metals and polymers, the additive manufacturing of glass is still at a primitive stage. The inherent material properties of glass, i.e. its amorphous structure, lack of ductility and high processing temperatures, make processing of glass by additive manufacturing challenging. This paper describes the laser powder bed fusion of a soda lime silica glass. Optimisation of the laser powder bed fusion process was undertaken and the physical and mechanical properties of the manufactured parts were characterised revealing an average porosity of 12%, a mean flexural strength of 6.5 MPa and a fully amorphous structure. Feasibility examples were successfully demonstrated, indicating that geometrically complex shapes are possible. Even though the manufactured parts are opaque, they could potentially find use in applications where the need for chemical inertness and geometrical complexity surpass the need for transparency as in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries e.g. in the form of continuous flow reactors or structured catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Digital light processing (DLP) is a versatile additive manufacturing technique able to quickly create complex 3D constructs. DLP has been used successfully for many years in dental applications and rapid prototyping and has gained recent attention in the field of tissue regeneration. Especially the advances in fabricating soft tissue constructs have favored the development of biocompatible and bioresorbable resins. However, to be printable, a resin needs a viscosity of < 10 Pa·s. Thus at ambient temperatures, these resins often require the use of added solvents or reactive diluents (RD) to lower the formulation viscosity to enable printing. Alternatively, the temperature of the resins can also be increased to lower their viscosity. However, most commercial DLP printers come without a thermally controlled bath, and even lack the possibility of adding this functionality without purchasing a new machine. In this work, we report the development of a transparent indium-tin-oxide (ITO) based heating stage that is low-cost and can be easily implemented by other research groups with an existing DLP printer. We then demonstrate that this heating solution ensures a constant, controllable temperature for each layer that is photocured. Furthermore, we showed the effectiveness of this approach by fabricating complex 3D structures using different biocompatible poly(ester) and poly(ester-co-carbonate) urethane acrylate based resins that are unprintable at ambient temperature.

    "abstract": "The differences between the physicochemical properties of the laser and electron beam powder bed fusion (L- and EB-PBF) methods are yet to be explored further. In particular, the differences in the residual stress and phase stability of alloys with unstable phases remain unexplored. The present work is the first to systematically investigate how the heat source type and process parameters affect the surface residual stress and phase stability of an unstable β-type titanium alloy, Ti–15Mo–5Zr–3Al. The surface residual stress and β-phase behavior were studied using high-precision X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD). Significant differences were observed between the two methods. The L-PBF-made specimens exhibited tensile residual stresses of up to 400 MPa in the surface area. HP-XRD analysis revealed a stress-induced lattice distortion, interpreted as a transitional state between the β-phase and α\"-phase. In contrast, the EB-PBF-made specimens showed no significant residual stress and had an undistorted β-phase coexisting with the hexagonal α-phase caused by elemental partitioning. This study provides new insights into the previously neglected effects of L-PBF and EB-PBF in unstable β-type titanium alloys.",

    "abstract": "Deposition patterns can significantly influence the distribution and magnitude of residual stress in additively manufactured parts. Time-consuming thermal-mechanical simulations and costly experimental studies are often required to identify the optimal patterns. A simple and generic method to evaluate and optimize the deposition pattern for the purpose of minimizing residual stress is in urgent need. To overcome the shortcomings of the current practice, here we propose a novel pattern evaluation criterion. Starting from the discretization of the deposition pattern by a series of sequence numbers, we introduce two interconnected concepts. The first is called \"equivalent bead sequence number\" which can be physically interpreted as an index of the localized heat accumulation induced by the deposition process. Based on this point-wise \"equivalent bead sequence number\", the second concept called \"bead sequence number dispersion index\" which can be considered as a representation of the global heat accumulation gradient, is proposed as a criterion for assessing the resulting residual stress. The temperature fields and residual stresses of a square part with six typical deposition patterns predicted by thermo-mechanical finite element simulations are used to develop and verify the proposed criterion. It is found that the \"equivalent bead sequence number\" of a given pattern is closely correlated to the distribution of the associated temperature and residual stress. More interestingly, both the highest equivalent and highest maximum principal residual stress of a pattern linearly increase with its corresponding value of \"bead sequence number dispersion index\". Guided by this relation, two new patterns with lower residual stress are developed and evaluated. Among all the patterns considered, the so-called S pattern shows the lowest value of the \"bead sequence number dispersion index\" which corresponds to the lowest residual stress. The proposed sequence-driven approach provides a new candidate for real-time evaluation and optimization of the deposition pattern in additive manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is used to produce foam-like Ni-Mn-Ga with tailored microscale and mesoscale features. Ni50-Mn28.2-Ga21.8 (at%) powder was gas atomised and processed in an L-PBF system with a range of energy density from 26.24 and 44.90 J/mm3. We characterised microscale and mesoscale properties, such as the chemical composition, crystal structure, magnetisation measurements, density, and porosity measurements as a function of process parameters, in a systematic design of experiment. Preliminary research on macroscale properties included tensile testing and magnetic field induced strain (MFIS) measurements. Results show how controlling process parameters allows tailoring the Ni-Mn-Ga polycrystalline microstructure. Hence, obtaining twinned martensitic structures with a predominant orientation going across the visible grain boundaries. All the processed samples showed a 56 Am2/kg magnetisation level, close to Ni-Mn-Ga 10 M single crystals. Mesoscale results show a distinctive porosity pattern that is tailored by the process parameters and the laser scanning strategy. In contrast, macroscale mechanical tensile test results show a brittle fracture of Ni-Mn-Ga due to the high porosity with yield stress 2-3 times higher than shown in single crystals. In sum, we built geometrically complex demonstrators with (i) microscale twinned martensitic structures with a predominant orientation going across the visible grain boundaries and (ii) mesoscale tailored periodic porosity patterns created by modifying power, scanning speed, and scanning strategy systematically. L-PBF demonstrates great potential to produce foam-like polycrystalline Ni-Mn-Ga, reducing grain boundary constraints and thus the magnetic force needed for MFIS.",

In this method, rather than heating the entire volume of the polymer throughout the entire process, a second, additional laser is used to heat the material selectively in terms of volume and time. The principle of operation and the design of the prototype are presented. Using the developed system, an experiment has been carried out in which samples of technical polylactide (PLA) powder were sintered for selected process parameters. This experiment confirms that the proposed method is fully functional and proves that sintering can be controlled in a wide range. A preliminary comparison of the changes in the physicochemical properties of the obtained samples compared to those sintered by standard polymer Laser Sintering (pLS) was carried out using Gel Permeation Chromatography, Fourier Transform Infrared Reflectance and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Our experiment shows that the method has a potential to limit the thermal degradation of sensitive polymer materials.",

    "abstract": "One of the main drawbacks of phase change materials (PCM) to be employed as thermal energy storage (TES) systems in energy applications, such as concentrated solar power (CSP), is the liquid leakage, which considerably reduces the storage efficiency. To overcome this issue, a novel approach is presented, which is based on the development of three-dimensional (3D) engineered TES structures (3DTES) formed by highly porous patterned 3D printed low-cost clay supports (up to ~85% of total porosity) that are infiltrated with a molten sodium nitrate salt. Expanded vermiculite supports are additive manufactured by robocasting, a direct ink writing technology, using clay aqueous inks with a pseudoplastic behavior. 3DTES are lightweight (~1.8 g·cm−3), easy to handle, mechanically robust (~68 MPa) and exhibit high PCM encapsulation capacity (~78%), avoiding the molten salt leakage. Furthermore, they present an enthalpy of fusion of ~136 J·g−1, excellent thermal stability, and high thermal energy storage efficiency (~80%) and thermal conductivity (1.27 W·m−1·K−1), which is indicative of a great charging-discharging ability. The results open new opportunities through the 3DTES approach to manufacture promising affordable materials with outstanding performance for CSP applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a novel voxel-based technique to accurately model 3D printed continuous yarns of fibre composites at printed filament scale. To cater for the constraints of continuous filament printing, the design strategy here makes use of a set of variables that fully define the printing path as input in the model. A voxel-based algorithm is developed to obtain the local orientations of the filaments and local quantities of yarns and matrix from a pixelated flat layout of the printed composite. This voxel-based representation is then translated into a Finite Element model to obtain the required structural properties. This approach simplifies and potentially shortens the design of the part, compared to other analytical techniques. The design space of the part is defined by the variables of the gcode used to print the composite. The voxel model is coupled with an evolutionary algorithm to explore the part of the design space related to the use of continuous yarns. The hygro expansion of the material was measured to determine the coefficients of moisture expansion serving as input in the model. Promising results are obtained from a test case related to a continuous flax fibres-reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) printed structure, mimicking the shape of a leaf. The proposed modelling strategy has the potential to characterise geometric, material, mechanical and actuation properties of general 3D printed structures with negligible out-of-plane (i.e., through thickness) printing.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to assess the processability of the LaCe(Fe,Mn,Si)13 magnetocaloric material using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) to create room temperature high surface-area-to-volume magnetic refrigeration media. LPBF process optimisation was performed on block samples, focusing on the build densification and the microstructural development. The porosity fraction decreased with the increase in laser energy density (E), however, cracks and keyholes were induced at E ≥ 140 J/mm3. Following thermal heat treatment and quenching, the magnetic entropy change (ΔS) of the blocks increased with the increase in E, due to the increase in homogeneity, where the maximum value achieved at a Curie temperature (Tc) of ~290 K for the sample built using E = 123 J/mm3 was 4.9 J/kg K. Meanwhile, the samples built using E > 140 J/mm3 showed higher ΔSmax values that reaches 7.2 J/kg K but at lower Tc of 260 K and the samples are rich in cracks. The block sample built using E = 123 J/mm3 is recommended as the optimum condition, where it shows the lowest defects and the highest room temperature ΔS with highest compressive mechanical stress value of 90 MPa. A microchannel block sample was built using the optimum condition, which shows ΔSmax value of 4.2 J/kg K with adiabatic temperature change of 1.4 K at µ0H = 1 T, which is close to the value of the block sample revealing the consistency in the magnetocaloric properties between the block and the porous samples.",

In order to determine the relationships between process parameters in laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) and final porosity in AlSi10Mg, samples were processed following a space-filling experimental design in the present study. A total of 144 samples were fabricated considering layer thicknesses of 30 µm, 45 µm, 60 µm, and 90 µm. Afterwards, porosity was assessed using image analysis and computed tomography. Different types of defects were found as expected, however, fully dense parts were realized in case of every considered layer thickness. Predictive models were developed using data-driven approaches, eventually enabling multivariate analysis of the correlations and determination of appropriate processing conditions resulting in both low porosity of parts and high build rates.",

    "abstract": "Despite a growing interest in additive manufacturing technologies, there is still a limited selection of suitable materials developed regarding the unique non-equilibrium cooling conditions. A highly promising alloy system for Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is Al-Ce, which shows outstanding processability in recent studies. The medium strengths already achievable with the binary system are to be improved in these investigations by additional precipitation-forming elements. By adding Mg and Si, a very high tensile strength of 593 MPa in the as-built condition can be achieved. XRD measurements show that the addition of these two elements lead to additional formation of an AlCeSi phase and phases of the Mg2Si precipitation sequence, which affects the usually expected eutectic formation of the Al11Ce3 phase. Contrary to the expected dominance of the binary intermetallics, AlCeSi in particular can be identified. The Al11Ce3 content in the microstructure can only be significantly increased with modified parameter combinations or volume energy inputs. Along with this, additional differences in grain size and grain morphology can be identified by EBSD investigations. The influence of the parameters extend to different mechanical properties as a function of the applied parameter combinations. With the very good additive processability in the form of wide process parameter windows, the parameter combinations can be used to adjust the properties in the as-built state.",

    "abstract": "Increasing demand for complex concrete shapes in architecture has triggered the use of digital fabrication methods for producing non-standard formworks. To this end, polymer extrusion 3D printing has already shown promising results in a range of research projects. However, 3D-printed polymer formworks can suffer from sudden failures during casting, which are generally associated with the pressure exerted by the wet concrete on the thin plastic formworks. Such failures can however be substantially accelerated by the corrosive effects of the wet concrete paste on some 3D-printed thermoplastics, a phenomenon that has not been studied in depth so far. This paper first reviews the state of the art of 3D-printed polymer formworks and their applications in architecture. It focuses on the failures caused by formwork pressure and synthesizes the various solutions to this problem reported in the literature. Beyond this, additional results are introduced to provide a guideline for thermoplastic selection in 3D-printed formworks. Common thermoplastics are presented, and their behaviour during concrete casting is documented. This behaviour can be analysed through ultimate strength and creep tests performed in three-point bending on 4 × 10 × 100 mm 3D-printed polymer samples, both in dry state and exposed to an alkaline solution of pH 13, typical for cementitious materials. The tests show that contact with the alkaline solution leads to a rapid strength loss in some thermoplastics. This effect is particularly pronounced with PLA and its blends, for which the strength loss over 10 min is more than 80 % compared to dry samples. Other thermoplastics, such as ABS, ASA, HIPS, Nylon, PVA and ABS/PC have shown more limited or in some cases no deterioration under the same conditions. The material-specific mechanism of deterioration is environmental stress cracking in contact with the alkaline solutions and it occurs in all 3D printing orientations and loading directions where tensile stresses occur.",

    "abstract": "Electron beam powder bed fusion/hot isostatic pressing (E-PBF/HIP), also known as in-situ shelling, is an emerging technology that produces components by only forming their shells whilst retaining sintered powder at the core, and then using HIP to consolidate the entire structure. E-PBF/HIP can boost additive manufacturing productivity, however, the fundamental understanding of the process-microstructure-property correlations remains unclear. Here, we systematically investigate the microstructural evolution of E-PBF/HIP Ti-6Al-4V parts as a function of hatch melting parameters. All HIPped samples achieve full densification, however, their microstructures are significantly different from one another. Using X-ray computed tomography (XCT) and optical microscopy, our results show that the HIPped Ti-6Al-4V microstructure can be controlled by varying the porosity, P (%), pore surface areas and morphology in the as-built parts with a single set of HIP parameters. The HIPped microstructures still exhibit the as-built columnar grains when the as-built porosity, P < 3 % with mainly spherical micro-pores; a mixture of columnar and equiaxed grains when the 3 % < P ≤ 5 % with a tortuous and interconnected pore network; and equiaxed grains when P > 5 % with a highly dense pore network. This work suggests two main drivers for the grain morphology transitions during HIP: (1) a dramatic increase in pore volume increases the localised applied pressure up to 4 times at the core region of the sample and (2) minimise lack-of-fusion pores with high surface energies, promoting dynamic recrystallisation. This study provides a fundamental insight into the E-PBF/HIP technology, showing the feasibility to tailor microstructural properties of E-PBF built parts whilst boosting additive manufacturing productivity.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we demonstrate a novel 3D printing method and printhead capable of 3D printing objects, which are combinations of nano-/microfibers and solid or infill layers. The method is a unique combination of material extrusion and melt-blowing: the filament can be fused and then either deposited or turned into ultrafine fiber mats with the aid of hot pressurized air. This study introduces the operation of the prototype device, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the airflow field, and various tests on the generated specimens. We were able to make layers of ultrafine fiber mats from poly lactic acid (PLA), which adhered to the solid deposited layers of the same PLA material. Higher air speed and smaller nozzle size resulted in smaller fibers. Fibers with a diameter of as small as 300 nm and an average of 900 ± 100 nm were generated at supersonic air velocities. The fiber layers enhance the crystallinity of the printed products, and can reinforce those. We can control the position and ratio of the fibers and the solid (or infill) parts of the printed object, so even porous objects can be generated. These hierarchical 3D printed objects have lots of possible applications, such as scaffolds, controlled drug delivery devices, filter media, structural composites and smart textiles.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is an attractive processing route to make efficient use of rare-earth elements (REE) in systems containing complex-shaped rare-earth (RE) based magnets. Powder bed fusion using laser beam (PBF-LB) is one of the most promising technologies to obtain fully dense AM parts and has seen significant recent research efforts. However, most works use commercial Nd-Fe-B powders with a composition more suited for binder based AM methods, which reduces the parameter window and does not allow property enhancement by the application of annealing cycles. In this work, a close-to-industrial process route was developed in order to produce a narrow-distributed 40-µm Nd-Fe-B powder, derived from strip casting, hydrogen decrepitation and milling, with a composition close to the usual sintered magnet grades having around 30 wt% REE content. The composition was adjusted by preliminary small-scale experiments focused on the reduction of cracking and the promotion of fine-grained equiaxed microstructures. This powder was then used to build magnets by the PBF-LB method. The best magnetic properties could be achieved with building conditions providing just enough energy to completely melt the material, yielding nano-grained microstructures almost deprived of α-Fe phase. After laser parameter optimization and post-process annealing, properties of Br = 0.62 T, Hcj = 1790 kA.m−1 and BHmax = 65 kJ.m−3 were obtained.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents in-situ X-ray computed tomography (CT) experiments used to study the flow behavior within a conventional hot-end of a fused filament fabrication printer. Three types of experiments were performed to better understand the melt and flow behavior. In one experiment, 360° CT scans were conducted, focusing on the air gap between the filament and the nozzle wall. In a second experiment, the flow profile inside the nozzle was studied using radiography. To provide a good contrast to the surrounding nozzle material, filament was prepared containing small amounts of tungsten powder as a contrast agent. During a third test, the extruder forces were measured and compared with the X-ray results and the predictions of a numerical simulation. The CT scans showed that at higher filament speeds, less area of the nozzle wall is in contact with the melt. This means that a larger part of the barrel section is occupied by an air gap between the solid filament and the nozzle wall. In contrast to the filament speed, the influence of the heater temperature shows no discernible effect on the part of the nozzle filled with melt. Radiographic evaluation of the velocity profile revealed a parabolic distribution under the studied conditions, closely matching numerical simulations modeling the flow as isothermal and non-Newtonian. The study's findings offer potential for improving nozzle design. Furthermore, the presented experimental method can serve as a valuable tool for future validation of more complex numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "Cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) is a solid-state deposition process with the potential to produce near-net shape components with complex geometry at a high fabrication rate, making it an attractive alternative to more widely established additive manufacturing (AM) processes. However, CSAM is still in its early stages and requires numerous advancements. The current literature highlights the lack of a design framework for fabricating structural components that encompasses the advantages and constraints of CSAM. This work proposes such a framework to guide product and process engineers, with its novel aspects including (i) accounting for different spray trajectories and their effect on anisotropic mechanical properties, (ii) accounting for the primary constraint for toolpath planning (maximum overhang angle 'MOA'), and (iii) virtual development and optimisation of a real-world structural component with complex geometry. To exemplify this framework, tensile properties under two spray trajectories were determined experimentally for a common lightweight metal (titanium) supplemented with a ceramic to form a metal matrix composite with improved strength and hardness. Optimisation of the design was conducted via finite element analysis and topology optimisation (TO). Two different TO processes were conducted, namely (i) minimising the strain energy of the structure and reducing the weight by 60% (best stiffness-to-weight ratio) and (ii) minimising the weight by targeting a maximum factor of safety (FoS) value of 1.2. The final design was fabricated via CSAM with relatively little raw material wastage and reasonably close geometric accuracy. Fabrication defects were, however, noticed after making a demonstration component and mitigation measures are discussed within the context of the design framework proposed here.",

However, current multimaterial 3D printers allow printing of one material at a time, with limited ability of mixing multiple materials. Herein, we present the new 3D printer which eliminates the above shortcoming by merging the Fused Filament Fabrication and Direct Ink Write in one compact system. The developed printer expands the range of materials that can be printed and allows mixing and printing of multi-part materials with cost effective parts and increases the printing window of complex materials such as two-part rubbers. The experiments performed using various materials show the developed 3D printer having good control even at high printing speeds (up to 20 mm/s). The performance of the printer was evaluated extensively by varying different parameters such as nozzle diameter, pressure and printing speed. Finally, the capability of developed printer is demonstrated by autonomous printing of various 3D smart structures.",

    "abstract": "Equiatomic Cobalt-Iron (Co-Fe 50%at.) has great potential as a soft magnetic alloy, but its wider use has been limited by its poor workability and strength. Recent advancements in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), an Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique, provided a new pathway for constructing fully dense, structurally sound, complex-shaped components from bulk equiatomic Co-Fe in a single process step. To obtain the desirable soft magnetic performance in the alloy, thermal post-processing with a controlled slow cooling needs to be applied. In order to identify the optimum heating conditions, several single and multiple step heat treatment profiles were performed and compared. The effects of the thermal post-processing on the microstructure, structural ordering, and functional properties of the alloy after each heat treatment were investigated using electron microscopy, neutron diffraction (ND), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and quasi-static magnetic characterisation in a closed loop magnetic circuit. Results have shown that a normalisation heat treatment at 1300 K for 2-hours followed by a 4-hour primary heat treatment at 1123 K and slow cooling to room temperature produced a recrystallised microstructure characterised by predominantly equiaxed grains with an average size of up to 61 µm, and a fully ordered B2 structure. The quasi-static soft magnetic properties obtained were favourable compared to those of commercial Co-Fe grades, with maximum relative permeability higher than 8000, coercivity as low as 112 A/m and magnetic saturation polarization of 2.39 Tesla. These findings provide the basis to enable the manufacturing of three-dimensional complex-shaped electromagnetic cores by LPBF.",

    "abstract": "In laser-based powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) systems, the shielding gas flow is important for controlling the accumulation of melting byproducts such as soot and ejecta near the melt pool as well as sweeping ejecta, agglomerates, and \"flying\" powder away from the build region. It is necessary to understand the flow field throughout the build chamber in order to sufficiently control these contaminants to prevent their interference with delivered laser power and maintain part quality. A measurement technique called Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry (MRV) was applied to measure the entire three-dimensional three-component mean velocity field in a scaled flow model of a commercial EOS M290 PBF-LB/M build chamber. Flow conditions in the model were at a Reynolds number of 36000 (based on the average bulk velocity in the supply duct and its diameter) comparable to conditions in the full size M290. MRV measurements reveal five large jets issuing from the upper vent of the M290: the top jet supplies fresh gas flow across the optics keeping them clean, three jets issue horizontally, and the last jet travels downward impinging on the center of the build plate potentially sweeping contaminants toward the exit or delivering contaminants to the surface from the upper portion of the chamber. The lower vent supplies flow across the build plate, but this flow issues from above the build plate creating a backward facing step flow in which a region of separation with backwards flow exists. The backwards flow extends several centimeters over the edge of the build plate nearest to the vent before the inlet flow \"attaches\" to the build plate and proceeds to the exit. Single layer laser scans on individual titanium plates spaced uniformly around the build surface are performed, and their melt pool depths are measured as an indication of delivered laser power. Measured depths for plates in the separated flow region are measured to be 23 % shallower than in the central region of the build plate where the flow is unidirectional toward the exit. The influence of the shielding gas flow on melt pool depth is demonstrated using an extra vent placed below the lower vent to supply unidirectional flow across the build plate in the separated flow region. With the flow improvement, the melt pool depths increased by 15 %. These experiments support arguments that shielding gas flow is important for building consistent high quality parts and demonstrate the utility of MRV measurements for investigating, understanding, and potentially improving the shielding gas flows in PBF-LB/M systems.",

    "abstract": "The usage of three-dimensional (3D) printing in pharmaceutical applications offers significant advantages compared to conventional manufacturing approaches such as tableting or encapsulation. Laser sintering (LS), also referred to as powder bed fusion – laser beam (PBF-LB), formerly also known as selective laser sintering (SLS), offers the production of pharmaceuticals directly from a powder mixture with high geometrical flexibility and adjustable release profiles. However, due to limitations of conventional powder application methods for PBF-LB, neither the material composition nor the material distribution can be tailored within a printed layer. To overcome these restrictions, electrophotographic powder application (EPA), a novel method for selective powder application, was utilized in this study. EPA allows the deposited layer thickness to be reduced to values between 12 and 76 µm, depending on the used pharmaceutical powder blend. Thus, the laser energy input required for interlayer connection can be reduced, enabling the use of a CO2 laser. In this study, for the first time, EPA in combination with powder bed fusion – laser beam of polymers (EPA-PBF-LB/P) was utilized to successfully deposit and print three different model drugs: paracetamol, nicotinamide, and caffeine, mixed with Eudragit L 100–55, a pharmaceutical grade polymer. Through the use of EPA, thin layers of powder blends were successfully deposited in the build chamber, leading to no thermal degradation of the polymer or drugs from the use of a CO2 laser. Single- and multi-material pharmaceutical films were successfully printed via EPA-PBF-LB, utilizing EPA to selectively as well as precisely apply different powders within a single layer into the build chamber. This introduces a novel method of printing pharmaceuticals using SLS with a CO2 laser and without the use of additional colorants.",

Open PBF-EB machines enable the development of new scanning-strategy-based compensation schemes to solve this challenge. This study introduces a new return time compensation scheme for line-based hatching strategies in PBF-EB, that enables the fabrication of complex geometries with a homogeneous melt pool geometry over constant cross-sections in build direction. Using thermal simulations and melt surface analysis, it is shown that the proposed compensation scheme prevents geometry-induced defect formation in two complex model geometries, in comparison with basic line-based hatching strategies. It is illustrated that the developed compensation scheme has the potential to transfer arbitrary melt pool geometries to complex parts. Ultimately, the universality of the return time compensation scheme is demonstrated and compared to existing process-parameter based compensation schemes.",

    "abstract": "The multiple collapse mechanisms of complex materials produced by additive manufacturing (AM) were identified by measurements of the acoustic emission (AE) of the samples under tension. A perfect correlation between AE avalanches and deformation mechanisms is shown to hold in the extremely complex AM metallic materials such as 'as-built' and 'stress-relieved' AM 316 L stainless steel (SS). The main criterion is that multibranches of the energy-amplitude scaling in AE proves the coexistence of several deformation mechanisms. The as-built AM 316 L SS shows three branches in the energy-amplitude scaling of AE signals, which originate from dislocation movements, twinning-detwinning processes and stress-induced martensitic transformations. After stress-relieving annealing at 600°C for 1 h, two branches remain visible with the dominant deformation mechanisms of dislocation movement and twinning-detwinning. The energy exponent of dislocation avalanches is ε =1.6, which is not affected by the heat treatment. The twinning-detwinning exponent increases from 1.8 to 2.0 after annealing. The avalanche behavior of the martensitic transformation shows power laws with energy exponents near ε =1.65 in stress-induced martensite in as-built AM 316 L SS and ε =1.8 for strain-induced martensite in stress-relieved AM 316 L SS. This multibranching phenomenon can, thus, be used to identify the mechanisms underlying the deformation of AM-alloys and facilitates online monitoring of deformation processes.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the evolution of recycled fibres and their influence on the mechanical property loss in material extrusion additive manufacturing of discontinuous carbon fibre reinforced polyamide-6 thermoplastic composites. For the first time, recycled carbon fibres in a broad range of 100 µm - 2.8 mm lengths with a consistent fraction of 20 wt.% were produced in composite flakes as feedstock with specific sizes, which were screw-extruded into filament for material extrusion additive manufacturing. Comprehensive characterisations were carried out to trace the evolution of material microstructure throughout the recycling and manufacturing processes. The void content, fibre orientation, fibre length and its breakage were analysed. Tensile tests show that the printed composites with the longest fibre length of 433 µm have the highest tensile strength of 126 MPa and tensile modulus of 6.4 GPa, which are 37% and 63.2% higher than the sample with a conventional 0.1 mm length of milled fibres. Specifically, it was found that the fibre length in 1.4 mm flakes was reduced to 750 µm by screw-extrusion (with customised auger teeth and extruder nozzle) and further reduced to 324 µm by material extrusion (with a nozzle diameter of 1 mm). It has been experimentally identified that the tensile strength of the current 3D printed composites using the initial fibre length of 1.4 mm in coupon can be further increased by more than 55.6% if properly reducing the air voids, fibre breakage and improving the fibre orientation.",

    "abstract": "Schwarz P unit cell-based tissue scaffolds comprised of poly(D,L-lactide-co- ε -caprolactone)(PLCL) fabricated via the additive manufacturing technique, two-photon polymerisation (2PP) were found to undergo geometrical transformations from the original input design. A Schwarz P unit cell surface geometry CAD model was reconstructed to take into account the geometrical transformations through CAD modeling techniques using measurements obtained from an image-based averaging technique before its implementation for micromechanical analysis. Effective modulus results obtained from computational mechanical characterization via micromechanical analysis of the reconstructed unit cell assigned with the same material model making up the fabricated scaffolds demonstrated excellent agreement with a small margin of error at 6.94% from the experimental mean modulus (0.69 ± 0.29 MPa). The possible sources for the occurrence of geometrical transformations are discussed in this paper. The inter-relationships between different dimensional parameters making up the Schwarz P architecture and resulting effective modulus are also assessed and discussed. With the ability to accommodate the geometrical transformations, maintain efficiency in terms of time and computational resources, micromechanical analysis has the potential to be implemented in tissue scaffolds with a periodic microstructure as well as other structures outside the field of tissue engineering in general.",

    "abstract": "Photopolymerization-based Additive Manufacturing (AM), a technique in which a product is built in a layerwise fashion by local curing of a liquid monomer, is increasingly being adopted by the high-tech sector. Nevertheless, industry still faces several challenges to improve the repeatability of product quality, as recognized by several authorities on AM standardization. It is commonly recognized that there is a need for an in-depth understanding, in-situ monitoring and real-time control of the curing process to work towards end-products of higher quality. This motivates the investigation on closed-loop control of the curing process and the build-up of material properties. This pioneering research contributes to the development of a control-oriented model in the form of a state-space description that describes the multiphysical photopolymerization process and connects curing kinetics, heat flow, strain and stress evolution. This work focuses on one spatial dimension and is extendable to higher dimensions. Moreover, an extension to existing control systems theory is proposed to anticipatively control the process through the quadratic tracking framework. The control strategy is based on sequential linearization of the nonlinear model obtained from multiphysical modeling. This theoretical-numerical approach demonstrates the potential of model-based control of the material property build-up during vat photopolymerization processes such as stereolithography and serves as a proof of principle.",

However, internal residual strains are accumulated during the layer-by-layer fabrication process. They bring about shape distortions and a degradation of mechanical properties. In this paper, an in-situ distributed measurement of residual strains in MEX fabricated thermoplastic specimens is achieved for the first time. This innovative measuring system consists of an Optical Backscatter Reflectometry (OBR) interrogation unit connected to a distributed fiber optic strain sensor which is embedded during the MEX process. The characteristic residual strain distribution inside 3D printed components is revealed and numerically validated. The main mechanisms of residual strain creation and the sensing principles of in-situ OBR are described. A minimum measuring range of 4 mm and a spatial resolution of 0.15 mm were experimentally demonstrated. The potential of in-situ OBR technology for detecting invisible manufacturing defects was shown by a trial experiment.",

    "abstract": "Additively Manufactured (AM) lattice structures of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process generally have different surface geometries depending on the overhang angle and location. This means that the design validation stage is often challenging, considering it is based on an ideal Computer Aided Design (CAD) model that is not truly representative, since the AM part will be different in terms of dimensional accuracy and surface finish. Previous studies have relied on the design of surface textures that are independent of the overhang angle, or techniques based on directly using X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) data. In this paper, a new technique for designing surface texture on the CAD of lattices has been investigated and correlated with areal surface roughness parameters. After extracting areal surface parameters from the XCT data of the lattice, the method allowed for the design of this surface texture on the part CAD taking in consideration if its up skin or down skin, without using XCT data as the main input. By applying this method, it is possible to obtain a lattice CAD model with a designed surface texture and geometry that is more representative of the actual AM lattice. The mean deviation between the CAD model with the designed surface and the XCT was a third of the one between the XCT and the initial CAD. The proposed method allows for designing and replicating LPBF AM surfaces on the CAD of a lattice, taking into consideration the dimensional deviation caused by AM surfaces, especially on overhangs. Assuming that an LPBF AM process is stable and produces approximately the same AM surface, this method can be used to predict the geometry of a lattice, providing a cost-effective and efficient methodology that minimizes the time needed for design validation.",

The characterization of the production process was made using standard methods, including: laser light diffraction, optical and scanning electron microscopy, hardness examinations, and the investigation of mechanical properties. The XCT method was used to conduct the quality of powder feedstock, the influence of the L -PBF build strategy on the samples' porosity, and also to evaluate a quantitative analysis of damage behavior before and after ex-situ mechanical testing. The porosity recorded for the powder feedstock was 0.2% and for test samples did not exceed 0.02%. The majority of the observed pores are aligned in patterns connected with the scanning strategy and were arranged in lines appearing along the borders between adjacent stripes. It was observed that increasing the resolution of the XCT scanning significantly influenced the mapping of the shape of pores and – to a lesser extent – the recorded porosity. The comparison of geometry deviations after numerical simulation and tensile test for FE models obtained with different XCT resolutions allowed to show differences in the geometry of experimentally and numerically damaged test samples.",

    "abstract": "3D printing of hydrogels is currently limited to triaxial printers that have inherent disadvantages like being optimized for planar print substrates, limitations in surface quality, and the need for support structures when printing overhangs. Multi-axis 3D printing of hydrogels has the potential to overcome all these disadvantages, making especially non-planar print substrates available for 3D printing that were e.g., extracted by imaging techniques like magnetic resonance (MRI) of bones. Therefore, we aim to pave the way towards multi-axis 3D printing of hydrogels in this contribution. In a first step, MRI scan data of a tibia was processed to obtain a smoothed bone surface that was fed afterwards into a curved slicing and path planning algorithm, thus generating non-planar layers composed of curved printing paths. The printing paths were translated into a 3D printed hydrogel based on gelatin methacryloyl by a newly developed print head mounted to a seven-axis kinematic that also allows UV curing of the printed hydrogel inks to solid hydrogels after printing. The properties of the 3D printed hydrogels were compared to molded hydrogels, showing that the 3D printed hydrogels were less stiff and had a higher equilibrium degree of swelling in water than the molded hydrogels. Summarizing, the results demonstrate the advantages of multi-axis 3D printing for hydrogel processing, but also shed light into open research questions concerning cross-linking chemistry and formulation of hydrogel inks relevant both for triaxial and multi-axis 3D printing.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties of components manufactured (\"printed\") by the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process are usually limited by the cohesion achieved between melt-processed thermoplastic filament strands perpendicular to the filament deposition direction. This significantly limits the usefulness of the FFF process and commercial FFF printers for the production of a wide range of functional components and consumer goods, so that the FFF process is currently used for the production of prototypes for visualization purposes only. In order to open up potential markets for structural components in the future, the realization of an optimized bonding layer quality via a significantly improved cohesion between the filament strands is essential. Since the mechanical properties of polymeric materials generally depend on the density of molecular entanglements and tie molecules in the material structure, it is of the utmost importance to realize the highest possible density of such entanglements and tie molecules between the individual filament layers also in FFF components. The present work deals with different methods of heat input to improve the entanglement and tie molecule density in the bonding layer of FFF components through enhanced polymer diffusion at temperatures far above the glass transition temperature for amorphous plastics or the melting temperature for semi-crystalline plastics, respectively. Heat can be either globally or locally introduced by conduction, convection, and radiation, the latter being the most effective for the FFF process when applied locally via properly controlled laser radiation. Ideally, a compact, cost effective and easy to use radiation source is used for this purpose. Hence, a setup based on a diode laser is presented in this work. Furthermore, an idealized calculation of the amount of heat required to promote the formation of interfilament bonds and thus to achieve an increased mechanical property profile was carried out. Two types of materials commonly used for the FFF process, polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylic-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS), were used for the experimental procedure. After producing a special monofilament with improved laser absorption characteristics, test specimens were produced. As a reference, test specimens made of the same materials were printed with the conventional FFF process. The differently manufactured test specimens were characterized optically and visually, using a stereomicroscope, and mechanically, using tensile tests. In addition, specimens were produced with a specially designed device for local heat input onto the substrate layer region just ahead of the new filament deposition. The effectiveness of this laser-assisted method could be proven in tests by adjusting the process parameters of the FFF process. After finding the optimum printing speed (equivalent to the laser power applied) for the materials PLA and ABS, an optical examination of the fracture surfaces of test specimens with filaments laid down perpendicular to an applied tensile load showed a significant increase in plastic deformation capacity, indicative of an improved interfilament bonding. This was confirmed by the mechanical property values determined in tensile tests. Thus, for optimized printing speeds, an increase in tensile strength values of ~20% for PLA and ~7% for ABS was achieved. For elongation at break, the improvements were ~21% for PLA and ~34% for ABS, respectively. The methodology of laser-assisted FFF printing thus offers great potential for mechanically and structurally optimized functional components with specifically introduced anisotropy.",

    "abstract": "The build rate of powder bed additive manufacturing could be significantly accelerated if consolidation of metal powders evolved from a serial process to a parallel process. In this work, the physics of Large-Area pulsed laser Powder Bed Fusion (LAPBF) in 316L stainless steel was studied through high speed imaging and high-fidelity physics simulations. Laser pulses were found to rapidly melt the metal powder, with subsequent fast coalescence of the melted particles into larger droplets. Conduction of heat from the molten droplets melted the substrate surface, and the molten droplets then spread out over roughly 100 μs. For the laser and metal powder parameters used in this study, layer thicknesses of greater than 40 µm resulted in uneven distribution of added material onto the substrate surface and thus an increase in porosity in multilayer prints. Simulations showed that pit features could be created (that can result in pores) from overlying powder particles shadowing the underlying substrate and blocking sufficient laser energy to deposit into the substrate. Simulations suggested that for these laser and powder parameters using thinner powder layers would reduce shadowing and allow the laser pulse to effectively heat the substrate thereby mitigating the defect formation. Implementing this change ultimately demonstrated > 99.5% density in the simulation, and > 99.8% density experimentally in 316L stainless steel prints. During the LABPF process very little material ejection was observed, a known impediment to laser powder bed fusion scaling to larger volume part production. This absence of eject a suggests that LAPBF may be able to produce material with high quality, suitable for critical applications, and scalable to high volume production.",

    "abstract": "Metal additively-manufactured (AM) parts are increasingly used as safety-critical components in industry. Surface textures of metal AM parts are different to conventionally machined surfaces and can directly influence the functional performance of the parts. However, it is difficult or impossible to access and measure non-line-of-sight AM surfaces by conventional measurement techniques. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is a promising technique that can measure non-line-of-sight surfaces non-destructively. However, the metrology framework for XCT to evaluate surface texture of AM parts is yet to be fully established, and there is a lack of development in surface texture reference standards that fit the purpose. In this paper, we have established a route to calibrate XCT for AM surface texture evaluation using a prototype three-dimensional roughness standard (3DRS) developed by the National Physical Laboratory that has a range of AM surface texture features and was designed for compatibility between 2D (profile), 2½D (areal), and tomography measuring instruments. A measurement protocol has been established between XCT and the contact stylus system, and uncertainty evaluation of 3DRS surface texture was established.",

The quality of the material produced depends on the optimization of a large range of build parameters and the complex thermo-mechanical build process is prone to inducing detrimental material features such as porosity and residual stresses negatively affecting fatigue resistance and lifetime. Here we apply neutron Bragg edge radiography in a parametric study on printing 316L steel. The parameters concerned are the laser scanning speed and strategy as well as the optional use of support structures. Analyses of the full field single shot wavelength-resolved Bragg edge radiography data enables to characterize local density inhomogeneities, as well as cracks, based on the long wavelength tail of the spectrum and variations of the stress field but also textural features based on the Bragg edge pattern. It is found that in the performed study not only respective differences in the residual stresses due to parameter variation are manifesting but also systematic irregularities due to machine imperfections (e.g. issues with the powder coater) are observed in the printed samples. The study supports the use of the parallel scanning strategy without supports and with the lower utilized scanning speed.",

    "abstract": "Microstructures produced by Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques determine many characteristics of components produced by this particular manufacturing technique. Residual stress and texture are among those characteristics, which need to be optimized to meet dimensional and strength requirements. Post-build heat treatments are necessary to relief residual stresses, homogenize the microstructure and to develop the necessary microstructures (precipitation or solution hardening) for strength. Our focus in this study is the measurement of residual stresses during a vacuum stress relief (VSR) heat treatment. We employ the energy-resolved neutron imaging to investigate, in-situ, the uniformity of the as-built texture and to map the residual strain distributions within samples of Inconel 625 (IN625). The samples used in this study were printed using the powder-bed metal laser melting additive manufacturing technique. Strain and texture variations were measured at room temperature for the as-built samples as well as their changes during stress relief annealing at 700 °C and 875 °C in a vacuum furnace. The uniformity of crystalline plane distribution, from which texture can be inferred, was imaged with sub-mm spatial resolution for the entire sample area exceeding several square centimeters. Despite the limited accuracy of in-situ lattice strain reconstruction during sample annealing, the results indicate that most of the strain relaxation occurs at 700 °C within the first 2–3 h. Relaxation of the strain at 875 °C happened at a much faster rate. In addition, energy-resolved neutron imaging demonstrates the possibility to correlate the uniformity of grain orientation and the degree of texture variations with printing parameters, in particular the laser translation speed. Simulations of the AM build process were carried out to predict the residual stress distributions within the samples as a function of the build process parameters. Comparisons of the simulation results to the room temperature experimental measurements show good agreements when the simulation data are averaged over the volume of the part confirming the usefulness of the experiments for validating simulation results. The neutron imaging technique described in this study can be helpful for the evaluation of bulk crystallographic characteristics in AM printed materials and can be used as a guide for developing the heat treatment cycle and for validations of VSR simulation results.",

    "abstract": "Reduction of the thermal distortion caused by the fabrication process of metal additive manufacturing is an important issue. Considering the problem of forming an object having lattices inside it to reduce the thermal distortion, we perform a lattice density distribution optimization and its experimental verification. In the optimization, assuming a cube with a sphere void as the base lattice shape, the lattice's distribution optimization is constructed based on the recurrent formula inherent strain method and a gradient method. The lattices are approximately handled as solid materials having effective stiffness calculated by the homogenization method. In the experiment, the laser powder bed fusion is introduced to fabricate test pieces. The test pieces are partially cut from the baseplate by a wire electric discharge machine, and the edge clearance caused by warping deformation is measured. The thermo-mechanical analysis is also introduced for the mechanical interpretation of the results. The reduction rate of the clearance caused by warping deformation in the experiment was 10.4%–24.8% in the quasi 2D example (comparison with 61.0%–91.4% volume fraction uniform lattices and a solid test piece) and 6.0% in the 3D example (comparison with the same volume fraction uniform lattice with the optimal lattice).",

The main challenge in this paradigm, however, is that current methods have either limited measurement throughput or produce signals that are difficult to interpret and to relate to build properties. In this work, we present a new methodology that combines high-throughput in-situ measurements during laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) with robust and unbiased numerical image analysis to predict build density from the surface topography of the consolidated material. The method relies on high resolution and large field of view optical scans of the layer—acquired through our powder bed scanner (PBS) technology—which we segment into \"superpixels\" to capture local and distributed differences in surface morphology and roughness. The high accuracy of our predictions together with the fast data acquisition and analysis enabled by the PBS and the low-dimensionality of the optical dataset after segmentation make our methodology an ideal candidate for in-line monitoring of materials produced by L-PBF. In addition, the ability to indirectly deduce a specific material property—namely density—as opposed to inferring a qualitative descriptor related to it makes our methodology unique and transferable to commercial powder bed fusion processes.",

    "abstract": "Polyaniline (PANI), particularly in its emeraldine salt form (PANI-ES), possesses several desirable properties such as high tuneable conductivity, pseudocapacitance and chemical stability, which make PANI a promising material for a wide range of electrochemical applications. However, its use is severely limited by its poor processability due to its non-thermoformable nature. In this work, a novel additive manufacturing method to process PANI is introduced, which enables the fabrication of electrodes with complex geometries exhibiting conductivities of up to 20000 mS/cm. This novel additive manufacturing process is based on the thermal doping of PANI in its low-conductive emeraldine base form (PANI-EB) with dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA). For this purpose, a commercially available 3D printer was modified with a custom-made syringe extrusion system to enable the extrusion of a viscous PANI-EB/DBSA paste. The influence of the additive manufacturing process parameters on the conductivity of printed electrodes was evaluated, and the resulting printed materials were characterised by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy – attenuated total reflection, X-ray powder diffraction, thermo-gravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The feasibility of the 3D printed PANI-ES/DBSA electrodes was studied by conducting a proof-of-concept electrochemical study of 3D printed interdigitated symmetric electrochemical capacitors, demonstrating how the printed structures could be easily integrated in prototypes of electrochemical devices. Although the fabricated devices did not exhibit superior capacitance, they presented a memristive behaviour with a potential for other applications such as artificial neural networks. Moreover, the results of this proof-of-concept study illustrate the significant importance of the conductivity of the printed electrodes, hence the importance of the additive manufacturing process parameters on the electrochemical performance.",

    "abstract": "In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), recovered unfused powder from the powder bed often degrades upon sequential processing through mechanisms like thermal oxidation and particle satelliting from ejected weld spatters and particle-laser interactions. Given the sensitivity of LPBF performance and build quality to powder properties, spent powder is generally discarded after a few build cycles, especially for materials that are sensitive towards surface oxidation. This increases feedstock material costs, as well as costs associated with machine downtime during powder replacement. Here, a new method to chemically reprocess spent LPBF metal powder is demonstrated under ambient conditions, using a heavily oxidised Cu powder feedstock recovered from prior LPBF processing as a model material. This is compared to an equivalent virgin Cu powder. The near-surface powder chemistry has been analysed, and it is shown that surface oxide layers present on spent Cu powder can be effectively reset after rapid reprocessing (from 5 to 20 min). Diffuse reflectance changes on etching, reducing for gas-atomised virgin Cu powder due to the formation of anisotropic etch facets, and increasing for heavily oxidised spent Cu as the highly absorptive oxide layers are removed. The mechanism of powder degradation for moisture sensitive materials like Cu has been correlated to the degradation of LPBF deposits, which manifests as widespread and extensive porosity. This extensive porosity is largely eliminated after reprocessing the spent Cu powder. Chemically etched spent powder is therefore demonstrated as a practical feedstock in LPBF in which track density produced is comparable to virgin powder.",

    "abstract": "One of the essential requirements to create nanoparticle (NP)-based applications and functions is the ability to control their deposition in specific locations. Many methods have been proposed, with wet direct writing (DW) techniques such as inkjet printing being the most employed. These methods generally depend on off-line and solvent-based NP synthesis leading to contamination and impurity in the final NP film as well as inhomogeneity in the deposition caused by solution-substrate interactions. This paper introduces a dry aerosol direct writing (dADW) method, which combines spark ablation-based and solvent-free NP synthesis with spatially selective deposition using aerodynamic focusing in a vacuum chamber. The challenge is to print high-resolution lines and spots of nanoparticles with a diameter < 100 nm. We study two aerodynamic nozzle concepts, a converging nozzle (CN) and a sheath gas nozzle (SGN), and investigate numerically how their design, as well as operating parameters, relate to the deposition process performance. This is quantified by three criteria: contraction factor, focusing ratio, and collection efficiency. We also compared our numerical results to experimental assays by manufacturing two SGNs and three CNs and evaluating the performance of each nozzle in terms of resolution, sharpness and thickness of the line. Using one of the SGN designs with an outlet diameter of 248 µm and an aerosol to total flow rate ratio of 0.17, we achieved a high-resolution line with a width of 67 µm, i.e., equal to 27% of the nozzle diameter, when printing < 100 nm Au NPs. The presented additive manufacturing method enables, therefore, the creation of high-resolution and sharp patterns of metallic nanoparticles, which can be employed in a wide range of applications, ranging from interconnects to optical and gas sensors.",

In this work, we are focused on fused filament fabrication (FFF) and we intend to analyze the melt flow patterns generated by a commercial version of polycarbonate, modeled by means of a viscoelastic model (Giesekus) based on rheological properties experimentally determined under viscometric flows. The axisymmetric flow through the same longitudinal section nozzle geometry used in the work of Mendes et al. (2019) has been numerically simulated in steady state at a constant temperature using OpenFOAM® (O. Ltd, 2019) and rheoTool (Pimenta and Alves, 2016). The results show that although the extensional flow type is predominant in the fluid domain, the shear-induced normal stress differences are relevant, and even dominating, not only at the exit of the die but also in the tapered region of the nozzle. Shear-induced normal stress differences are responsible for the excess pressure drop, and also for the equilibrium height (H∗) in the backflow region, where the polymer melt flows upwards, between the solid filament that enters into the print-core and the liquefier wall.",

    "abstract": "The increasing importance of Laser Sintering (LS) for the industry brings a rising number of available materials for this process. One example is the enhanced use of alternative polyamide types like polyamide 6 (PA 6). For polyamide 12 (PA 12), the powder ageing effect is well-known and of great importance from an economical point of view. However, relatively little is known about the powder ageing behavior of newer LS materials. Hence this paper focuses on the experimental powder ageing study of PA 6 in the LS process, both on powder and part level. The powder was reused in total seven times without refreshing and constant sinter parameters were used to produce the samples. Morphological, thermal and rheological measurements of the powder showed a rising number of agglomerates, an apparent increase in the powder crystallinity, and an increase in the viscosity by a factor of 7. These increases consequently affected the density and the mechanical properties of the parts, latter were determined by tensile tests. Between the first and the last iteration, a decrease of the Young’s Modulus of 60 % and the tensile strength of 70 % was observed. Besides the decline of mechanical properties, the geometrical dimensions of the last iteration were only 60 % of the first iteration, the mass was halved and the surface quality suffered from the orange peel effect. The results prove that similar powder ageing effects known for PA 12, and here especially the polyamide post condensation, also take place in LS printing of PA 6.",

    "abstract": "To incentivize carbon sequestration activities, kraft paper, a renewable and recyclable bioproduct that is already manufactured at scale, is proposed as feedstock for producing economically viable carbon materials. The paper was first additively manufactured into 3D open cell honeycombs and closed cell plate lattices using a sheet lamination process before being pyrolyzed into paper-derived architected carbon foams (PDACFs). In the isostress orientation, PDACFs displayed low moduli, high elastic strains (~ 30–40%) and a compressive resilience similar to graphene aerogels, but at stresses up to ~ 3 orders of magnitude higher, despite the brittle nature of the carbonized fibers. In the isostrain orientation, PDACFs exhibited better moduli (~ 1 MPa – 1 GPa), which were comparable to conventional carbon foams, and smaller elastic strains (~ 5–10%). Failure in isostrain orientation proceeded by fracture propagation through and/ or between the layers while cracks in the isostress orientation extended mainly across the layers. The strength of the PDACFs (~ 0.2 – 14 MPa) was similar in both orientations, however, likely because both interlayer and intralayer failure onset involved microscopic fractures initiating and propagating through a multitude of carbonized fiber interfaces. Notably, Honeycombs and Plate Simple Cubic PDACFs exhibited a combination of strength (> 3 MPa) and energy absorption (> 1 MJ/m3; > 1 kJ/kg) not found in porous carbon materials previously, suggesting that the hierarchical arrangement of carbonized fibers within a macroscopic lattice architecture is better for dissipating energy than the tetrakaidecahedron microstructure commonly found in foams. Furthermore, as an electrode in a Li-ion battery, the carbonized cellulose making up PDACFs showed reversible specific capacities of 65–140 mAh/g at a specific current of 10 mA/g for 300 cycles, which is comparable to that of commercial lithium manganese oxide batteries and graphitic anodes derived from non-renewable polymer foams.",

The printing inks for direct-write printing however, need careful synthesis and invariably undergo extensive preparation before being able to print. Hence, new ink synthesis efforts are required every time a new material is to be printed; this is particularly challenging for low storage modulus (G') materials like silicones, especially at higher resolutions (under 10 µm). Here we report the development of a precise (< 10 µm) 3D printable polymer, with which we 3D print micromoulds which are filled with standard silicones like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and left to cure at room temperature. The proof of concept is demonstrated using a simple water soluble polymer as the mould material. The approach enables micrometre scale silicone structures to be prototyped with ease, away from the cleanroom.",

    "abstract": "This research studies the directed-energy deposition of Ti-6Al-4V (wt%) in an argon atmosphere containing 9–9500 ppm oxygen (from air), using both fresh and recycled feedstock powders. For fresh powder builds, when exposed to a 3500 ppm oxygen-containing atmosphere, a yield strength (YS) of 1061 ± 0.6 MPa and an elongation-to-fracture (ETF) of 10.5 ± 1.6 % are obtained. The oxygen pickup in the build deposit tends to plateau at 1000 ppm beyond 3500 ppm oxygen exposure. Conversely, the nitrogen pickup shows an increasing trend, reaching 1000 ppm for the air exposure range investigated. Recycled powder builds are stronger but less ductile than equivalent fresh powder builds made under comparable atmospheres. A higher degree of interstitial element pickup with no apparent saturation is identified for builds made from recycled powders, due to their smaller average particle size and a correspondingly larger specific surface area. The resulting microstructure for all samples made with air exposure comprises full lamellar α + β, formed through the in-situ decomposition of martensite at a temperature close to 600 °C. This conclusion is supported by the β volume fraction at 600°C as predicted by Thermo-Calc agreeing with image analysis data. The α lath thickness is found to increase with air exposure level. The increased β-transus temperature and martensite start temperature, and the accelerated diffusion-driven phase transformation due to the presence of elevated interstitial element contents accounts for the α lath thickening behaviour. YS and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) are found to increase linearly with oxygen equivalent. Solid solution strengthening from nitrogen and oxygen pickup is responsible for this increase. YS and UTS models based on oxygen equivalent are proposed. Nitrogen and oxygen in the builds dictate the ETF, with nitrogen content being the more potent factor.",

    "abstract": "Porous ceramics are employed in an extensive range of industrial applications due to superior thermal insulation and physical properties that permit their use for separation and storage. However, in conventional manufacturing environments, an additional process is required for artificial pore control. Furthermore, these methods are inferior in terms of the geometric design of the fabricated products owing to limitations in the forming process. To improve these disadvantages, many studies have recently been conducted on the porous structures using additive manufacturing techniques. In particular, binder jetting method can be utilized for fabricating porous ceramics to overcome the limitations of conventional manufacturing process. This study demonstrates an optimal process for the fabrication of porous ceramics by applying binder jetting technology. Powder flowability and compatibility were optimized using the flow agent and the secondary binder. The effects of adding glass frit and adjusting the sintering temperature on the microstructure, porosity, and mechanical properties of the final product were also investigated in detail. Additionally, various filter design of inner flow path was investigated using computational fluid dynamics to improve the filtering efficiency and fabricated using the optimized ceramic powder through binder jetting technique.",

This is interesting in medical applications, such as prevention of diabetic foot ulcers. The base geometry consist of a capacitive layout with parallel wire structures and has two flexible elements on two sides. Experimental devices are optimized using electrostatic and mechanical models and printed using material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM) with a flexible thermoplastic polymer (TPU). Two geometries with different sizes are designed and tested. The smallest design is 8.75×8.75×11mm and its responsivity is measured to be 0.9 pF/MPa for a measurement range of ±140kPa. The design can easily be altered to meet specifications for a variety of other applications. The realised sensors show some hysteresis, which we attribute primarily to the mechanical behavior. The capacitive measurement of the displacement is quite linear. The mechanical hysteresis can partially be explained by the properties of the printed material. The results are promising for application in shoe insoles and can relatively easily be adapted to meet requirements for other applications.",

Furthermore, Inconel 718 is characterised and the DEM contact models are fully calibrated through a rigorous procedure devised specifically for metallic powders in AM and involves angle of repose and slide tests, nano-CT imaging, and shear cell experiments. The spreading of Inconel 718 by a blade is simulated in vacuum and gas. It is found that the presence of the gas increases the amount of deposited powder and the thickness of the bed. As the blade speed increases, the difference in the powder deposition between gas and vacuum surroundings increases. Furthermore, it is observed that the newly laid particles are disturbed by the wake of the blade since the gas velocity near the bed can be more than the terminal velocities of most particle size classes in the simulation.",

To this end, this paper presents a new framework for accurate and fast prediction of the stacking of weld beads for arbitrary substrate geometries. The prediction is split into two tasks: the footprint prediction, for which a data-driven approach based on a deep convolutional neural network is proposed; and the weld bead shape prediction, for which a numerical model based on the minimization of surface energy is developed. For each prediction tasks, the prediction approaches are compared against baseline models. An extensive dataset is created for training and evaluation of the models. Dataset generation, noise, training procedures, and evaluation metrics are discussed. The results demonstrate an accurate prediction capability, with a median accuracy of 0.1mm and 0.19mm for single weld bead prediction and end-to-end prediction, respectively. The average prediction time amounts to approximately 150ms per weld bead.",

    "abstract": "Smart-Alloying enables local modification of the chemical composition of metallic components within additive manufacturing processes. In the example of laser based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M), this new technology uses suspensions to place alloying elements precisely at every requested point of the printed area. It allows a tailor-made change of the local microstructure and properties. High chromium-containing stainless steel and carbon as the alloying element serves as a demonstration example. Microprobe and EBSD analyses confirm a locally increasing carbon content, which leads to the formation of fine martensitic structures with chromium-rich carbides at the grain boundaries of the ferritic base material. The associated change in microstructure regarding grain size and phase composition results in modified mechanical properties. Indentation tests carried out show a corresponding locally increased indentation hardness. This decisive influence of even individual alloying elements paves a new way for functional grading of metallic components in additive manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "The field of additive manufacturing (AM) has advanced considerably over recent decades through the development of novel methods, materials, and systems. However, as the field approaches a level of maturity, it is relevant to investigate emerging trends which may shed light on the fundamental scaling limits of AM systems to pattern matter from digital data. A simplified mathematical model which describes process dynamics of many AM hardware platforms is presented. In this model, the influence of several key parameters on total manufacturing time is examined and compared with performance results obtained from real-world AM systems. A general model of such systems is developed which relates the volumetric build rate of a given manufacturing system to its minimal feature size, and total build volume. Furthermore, a new framework for classifying manufacturing processes as \"top-down\" or \"bottom-up\" is proposed which differs from the conventional usage of such terms. Finally, a geometric model is proposed for \"bottom-up\" manufacturing and the limitations of such systems compared and contrasted with the limiting factors for \"top-down\" manufacturing systems.",

    "abstract": "The lack of an ideal silicone-based ink material with optimal printability has significantly limited the potential to fabricate silicone-based microfluidic devices via 3D vat photopolymerization (VPP) printing. Oftentimes, photoabsorbers are incorporated into the ink material for better control of the photocuring depth in order to avoid excessive curing of unwanted parts. However, the search for a suitable photoabsorber without staining the ink material remains challenging due to the need to retain the clear interface in the final printed product. Herein, we present the fabrication of highly precise and transparent microfluidic devices using hydrophilic silicone-based ink via 3D VPP printing upon photocuring depth adjustment with cellulose nanocrystals (CNC). With the optimal CNC content, the ink material demonstrates enhanced printing accuracy with highly precise replication of channel patterns consisting of near zero deviation in width dimension down to 100 µm. Moreover, the addition of optimal CNC content exhibits no distinct final color and has no negative impact on the pre-gel viscosity and the gel point of the developed ink material. Moving on, the printed devices exhibit excellent fluid manipulation with various solvents for up to 24 hours, with incubation temperature up to 100ºC for 5 hours, and with a continuous flow rate up to 20 mL/min. The sustainable hydrophilicity, good organic solvent resistance, and excellent biocompatibility properties of the printed material further eliminate the need for additional surface modification to suit its application with either organic solvents or biological cells. To the best of our knowledge, the approach to tuning the photocuring depth of ink material with CNC is not widely reported. Besides, the successful fabrication of a highly detailed, neutral-colored, and highly functional hydrophilic silicone-based microfluidic device via 3D VPP printing upon the incorporation of CNC introduces a new avenue in terms of printing material and fabrication method for the mass production of microfluidic devices.",

    "abstract": "Micro-droplet printing remains an invaluable tool for the additive manufacturing industry due to its versatility, efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The design and deployment of a disposable micro-droplet dispenser seeks to facilitate a quick and easy way to alternate between different printing materials (such as ink, metals, bio-materials, pharmaceuticals, etc.) without the need for thorough cleaning or separate delivery systems. While this works well in principle, in practice achieving consistent performance between dispensers can prove challenging. This paper aims to tackle this issue through the use of Machine Learning (ML) in order to (1) build a model that predicts dispenser performance from a set of physical features, (2) explain the model's predictions by relating features to outcome, and (3) suggest criteria that characterize optimal performance. A micro-droplet dispenser was used in conjunction with a drop-watcher for in-situ monitoring of droplet formation. Using this setup, 300 micro-droplet dispensers were evaluated for printing performance while various physical measurements of the dispensers were taken separately using a high magnification digital microscope. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting Machine algorithms were used to train and test classification models based on dispenser performance. AUC scores in the range of 0.75–0.85 were observed for the various algorithms while Partial Dependence Plots were utilised to investigate how the physical attributes of the dispenser impacted performance. Importantly, results were presented and interpreted in the context of providing an insight to transparency for ML in the regulatory environment.",

    "abstract": "We present a topology-aware computational framework that enables global collision-free and support-structure-free material extrusion for curved layer multi-axis printing of a range of high-genus and simply connected models. The nature of multi-axis additive manufacturing facilitates continuous variation of build direction, which paves the way for numerous approaches of geometry-based curved layer design. However, due to unawareness of global topological features, prevention of collision between the printer nozzle and the workpiece can either remain uncertain or demand for exhaustive algorithmic approaches, depending on the topological and geometrical complexity of a given mesh model. In this paper, we present a topological analysis framework that draws inspiration from the concepts of Reeb graph and Morse theory, to distinguish between collision-prone and collision-free regions of mesh models. We provide an exact definition for global collision-inducing features in regions of risk and optimise the nozzle orientation vector field to avoid global collisions whilst adhering to the overhang angle constraints. A new shape analysis method is then proposed to find the model orientation which maximises the manufacturability of bifurcating simply connected models. To validate our algorithmic framework, several high-genus and bifurcating simply connected models are printed using a robotic multi-axis printer. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our framework for minimising global collisions in multi-axis curved layer additive manufacturing for a range of mesh models.",

    "abstract": "Thermoplastic composites present considerable promise for 3D printing cryogenic fuel storage tanks, offering enhanced recyclability and repairability compared to thermoset composites. However, a significant knowledge gap remains regarding their ability to withstand cryogenic environments without suffering ply cracking, especially the effects of high thermal residual stresses and voids on the microcracking resistance of 3D printed composites. This study investigates the microcracking behaviour of continuous carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) composites fabricated through extrusion-based 3D printing. Three-point bending tests were conducted to assess the microcracking resistance of the as-printed and heat-treated composites at room and cryogenic temperatures. The results reveal that the nylon-based CFRTP composites printed at room temperature exhibit a remarkable ability to withstand an applied strain of 0.60 % without ply cracking at liquid nitrogen temperature. This performance surpasses that of conventional carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composites, which typically experience ply cracking even at zero applied strain. Some of the microcracks were traced back to manufacturing defects, which could be fused by a post-heat treatment at 180℃ for 60 minutes. Unexpectedly, however, the treatment reduced the ply-cracking strain to 0.40 % at the liquid nitrogen temperature. Computational micromechanical modelling revealed that this unexpected decline in ply-cracking resistance resulted from the increased thermal residual stresses induced by the heat treatment. The findings of this study suggest that 3D-printed thermoplastic composites exhibit robust resistance to microcracking at cryogenic temperatures, making them a promising solution in the quest for sustainable lightweight cryogenic fuel storage solutions.",

    "abstract": "Ni-Mn-Ga-based magnetic shape memory (MSM) alloys are renowned for their large magnetic-field-induced strains, making them attractive for compact magnetically controlled actuators requiring high response frequencies and large reversible deformations. In this study, Ni-Mn-Ga alloy samples were deposited using powder-blown laser-based directed energy deposition (DED-LB), employing gas-atomised powder pre-alloyed with excess Mn. The samples were deposited following a systematic experimental design, varying the applied laser power and employing two melting strategies: unidirectional and bidirectional. The results demonstrate the feasibility of achieving high relative densities (>97.5 %) in multi-layered Ni-Mn-Ga samples through DED-LB. All as-deposited samples exhibited a consistent 0.7–0.9 at% Mn loss in comparison to the powder feedstock, thus showing that the Mn overdosing requirements for DED-LB differ from those in laser powder bed fusion. Both as-deposited and heat-treated samples exhibited seven-layered modulated (14 M) martensite structures at ambient temperature. In contrast, the heat-treated samples also exhibited fully reversible martensite transformation at around 66 ºC and a Curie temperature at around 94 ºC. Distinct microstructural characteristics were observed based on the melting strategy, with bidirectional melting promoting the formation of large columnar grains with a strong <100> texture approximately along the build direction. This study highlights the potential of DED-LB processes in manufacturing relatively large (mm to cm scale) functional Ni-Mn-Ga actuators and contributes to the ongoing efforts in laser additive manufacturing of functional materials.",

    "abstract": "Material Jetting (MJ) is distinguished in the additive manufacturing field for its ability to create accurate multi-material functional objects with features in the range of few micrometers. Analyzing the impact of each step in MJ from virtual design to 3D printed object on the process response is essential for optimizing the technology's capabilities. The current state-of-the-art reveals a gap in MJ regarding the fundamental understanding of the correlation between the pre-processing workflow and the geometrical and dimensional accuracy. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining factors such as utilization of different CAD software with diverse working principles, part-based versus assembly-based design, alternative 3D model formats (STL, OBJ, 3MF, AMF, STP), and slicing approaches (using open-source slicers). Two test specimens, each containing ten elements (either cylinders or hemispheres) with diameters ranging from 254 µm to 12.7 mm are examined. The results demonstrate the significant influence of the aforementioned factors on geometrical and dimensional accuracy, except for 3D model formats. Specifically, for large elements, the achievable accuracy depends on the tessellation approach of the CAD system, while for very small elements, the rasterization process is defining, and designing in assembly mode can further enhance accuracy. The handling of the 3D model by the slicer particularly affects geometrical accuracy. Experimental validation confirms the impact of the pre-processing workflow, though the data-related dimensional deviation for the base layer is masked by the wetting behavior of the dispensed droplets on the substrate.",

    "abstract": "Laser beam shadowing in directed energy deposition process occurs when in-flight powder particles partially block the laser beam, preventing it from fully reaching the melt pool. This blockage alters the beam's profile, introducing spatio-temporal randomness in heat transfer to the melt pool and affecting its stability. This study utilizes a novel high-fidelity multiphysics model to quantitatively analyze gas-powder stream dynamics and laser-particle interactions. It specifically focuses on dynamic variations in laser beam shadowing, attenuation, and reflection of the laser beam radiant energy, along with powder particles temperature prediction from in-flight heating, accounting for multiple reflection phenomena. Gas-particle dynamics is modeled using a fully coupled CFD-DEM approach, while laser-particle in-flight interactions are predicted using a ray-tracing-based photon discretization method. Modeling predicted that interactions between the laser beam and the in-flight powder stream could result in energy losses up to approximately 70 % due to shadowing and attenuation. The study comprehensively explored the spatio-temporal variations in the attenuated laser beam profile, revealing significant deviations from its initial Gaussian profile and substantial stochasticity and randomness over time. To confirm the modeling results and correlate computational predictions with experimental data, high-speed visible imaging of the powder stream, both with and without the melt pool, along with laser beam attenuation measurements using a photodiode system, were conducted. The model's predictions of particle velocity and laser beam attenuation characteristics aligned with the results from these experiments. Modeling and high-speed imaging demonstrated that in-flight heating caused some particles to melt and few others to reach the vaporization threshold. High-speed imaging further validated these numerical findings by examining the interaction of heated particles with the melt pool across different phases (solid, liquid, and partially vaporized). A significant observation was the increased velocities of partially vaporized particles due to recoil pressure from selective vaporization, which led to the formation of deep craters in the melt pool resulting from high-speed impact.",

    "abstract": "Integration of metal additive manufacturing (AM) and cold spray (CS) technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to manufacture coated material systems with complex geometrical features. The application of these material systems in functionally critical components requires adequate structural integrity, particularly in the presence of cyclic loading. This work researches the multiaxial fatigue (axial-torsional cyclic loading) behavior of a coated material system consisting of 15Cr-5Ni precipitation-hardening stainless steel (15-5 PH SS) substrate additively manufactured by direct metal laser sintering with a layer of chromium carbide nickel (CrC-Ni) barrier coating deposited by CS. The influence of AM and CS-induced residual stresses on fatigue performance of test specimens was thoroughly studied. Additionally, the effect of surface roughness and processes induced defects were considered to explain the crack growth mechanism. Stresses assessed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction indicated a substantial accumulation of residual stresses, particularly in the outer surface of the as-fabricated 15-5 PH SS specimens. The state of residual stress was changed notably following the deposition of CrC-Ni coating in the axial, hoop, and radial directions of the fatigue test specimen. Also, CS deposition of CrC-Ni coating caused significant improvement in the surface quality of the additively manufactured components. Fatigue test results indicated, CS deposition of CrC-Ni substantially enhances the fatigue life of the AM-produced 15-5 PH SS substrate in all loading conditions, particularly in the high cycle fatigue regime. The improvement in the fatigue life of the specimens with coating was associated with a reduction in equivalent residual stress at the substrate surface and improvement in the specimens' surface condition (i.e., reduced surface roughness). The fractographic analysis of the specimen indicated the cracks tend to initiate in the surface of both as-fabricated and cold-sprayed specimens. However, the mechanism of crack growth changed notably following the deposition of CrC-Ni coating. The cracks tended to propagate in the planes parallel or with a small deviation from the build layers of the AM-produced specimens. On the other hand, deposition of CrC-Ni coating increased the deviation of crack growth plane from the build layers of the substrate.",

We demonstrate 3D additive batch electrospinning (3D-abES) workflow to efficiently produce layered hydrogel gelatin microfibres, tethered to 3D printed thermoplastic structures of various shapes. Enabled by the digital-design approach, multiple 3D printed fibre devices can be fabricated in a batch efficiently with minimised sample-to-sample variance. Customised fibre patterns and device geometries can be rapidly altered to fit with potential applications in 6- to 24- well plate formats. The diameter of as-produced dry fibres is in a range of ∼2−4 μm. With the intended device applications in aqueous environments, we investigate the effect of combinations of processing parameters on the gelatin fibre integrity, and its swelling behaviour when immersed in water. Aided by the parametric study, patterns of swelling-induced fibre curling, from straight to wavy, can be tuned. Our findings could serve as a guide to optimise the 3D fabrication and patterning of electrospun hydrogel-like fibres made of crosslinked hydrophilic polymers and oligomers, for cell culture or bio-sensing applications.",

Here, we introduce a novel support-free hollowing method that uses an arrangement of vertically-aligned prolate spheroids. In addition to reducing stress concentration through their inherently smooth boundaries, these spheroids require no additional support structure, when properly designed. Additionally, the resulting spheroidal hollows facilitate the circular printing motion of extruders using G2/G3-codes, which provide three critical advantages compared to the currently popular G1-code-based linear motion: shorter printing time, better printing quality, and smaller tool path file. Here, spheroids are arranged by the Voronoi diagram of 3D ellipsoids and the tool path, including circular printing motions, is produced using the Voronoi diagram of circular 2D disks. The proposed algorithms are implemented as the HollowTron webserver and are freely available from Voronoi Diagram Research Center.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing technologies enable various possibilities to create and modify the material composition and structure on a local level, but are often prone to undesired defects and inhomogeneities. This contribution makes use of such flaws to generate material-inherent, hidden codes and watermarks in metals for authentication and anti-counterfeiting applications. By controlled and random process variation, unique codes that can be read and authenticated by an eddy current device were produced with the processes of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and laser directed energy deposition (L-DED). Two approaches are presented: First, volumetric, porous structures with a defined shape are manufactured with L-PBF. Second, coatings are fabricated by L-DED with alternating process parameters, leading to local deviations of the magnetic permeability. This non-deterministic coding approach generates a distinctive material structure that triggers high signal amplitudes in the eddy current measurement. Counterfeiting becomes impossible due to the irreproducible melt pool dynamics. Statistical hypothesis testing proves that the system is able to prevent false acceptance or rejection of a code with a certainty of 500 million to one. A low-cost setup for a novel locking system demonstrates that a code can be sensed reliably within one second.",

    "abstract": "Laser Sintering is an additive manufacturing technology capable of producing robust, geometrically complex polymer parts, with polyamide 12, also known as nylon-12, the most common and well understood feedstock powder. While Laser Sintering has drawn increased interest from industry for producing end-use components directly, little information is currently available regarding the effects of in-service conditions on mechanical performance. When considering applications where parts spend significant periods of time outdoors, such as the automotive sector, the effect of exposure to natural UV light is an obvious concern. To assess their suitability for long-term outdoor applications, Laser-sintered polyamide 12 parts were subjected to up to 2 months of constant UVB radiation. UV exposure was found to cause significant yellowing of the parts, evidenced by their reflectance of blue light decreasing continually as exposure time was increased beyond 24 h. Results from UV/visible spectroscopy demonstrated an increase in UV absorbance with exposure time, attributed to increasing carbonyl concentration. Similarly, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy showed increases in surface oxygen concentration proportional to UV exposure, with changes to the O 1s and C 1s environments after 2 months of exposure consistent with the generation of new carboxylic acid groups. Photo-degradation led to substantial decreases in both Ultimate Tensile Strength and Elongation at Break, with the deterioration first becoming appreciable between one and two weeks of exposure. Mono-energetic Positron Spectroscopy, a non-destructive surface analysis technique, demonstrated a correlation between these mechanical properties and free volume at the parts' surfaces. Decreases in free volume were concluded to be due to changes in the nature of the polymer crystal structure and an increase in overall crystallinity at the part surfaces after UV exposure, identified using DSC. Overall, it was concluded that UV exposure causes significant deterioration of Laser-sintered polyamide 12 parts and this should be mitigated against prior to use in long-term outdoor applications.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a new family of backbone modified polyetheretherketone (PEEK) grades in the powder bed fusion (PBF) process, coded as PAEK1 and PAEK2, with the same chemical structure but different molecular weights. By incorporating polyetherbiphenyletherketone (PEDEK) comonomer, the optimal powder bed temperature of the new grades could be reduced to 290 °C, approximately 40 °C lower than that of PEEK. The underlying crystallisation kinetics in the PBF process was investigated by replicating the in-process temperature profiles using a flash differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) machine. This method enabled monitoring of the development of crystallisation during the process and at different deposition thicknesses. The results confirmed that the PAEK2 grade with a higher molecular weight is slower crystallising. A significant part of the crystallisation of PAEK2 was found taking place in the later stage of the printing process, i.e. the free cooling stage. This leads to a better particle coalescence and enhanced elongation, a feature previously difficult to obtain in the PBF process. The PBF PAEK2 tensile bars achieved a significant increase in mechanical performance with an outstanding 13% in elongation, reaching its yielding point. The data supports that PAEK2 is the first high temperature polymer grade in the PBF process to match its bulk mechanical properties while maintaining a high level of crystallinity in the printed parts.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the difference between the properties of Ti-6Al-4 V alloy parts printed using continuous wave (CW) and modulated wave (MW) laser emission modes, with equivalent input energy densities. Laser powers in this powder bed fusion process, were systematically altered to evaluate the effect of different input energies on the as-built parts. Printed alloy parts were obtained across five equivalent laser energy densities, in the range of 31–51 J/mm3, investigated using the two laser emission modes. The impact of changes in laser emission mode and energy density was examined based on printed part dimensions, microstructure, porosity, hardness and tensile properties. It was demonstrated that microstructural refinement occurs as a function of melt pool size, which was associated with the penetration depth of the laser energy. The microstructure of samples produced using CW laser emission mode were characterised by thinner laths and narrower prior β grains. Tensile testing according to ASTM E8M, obtained at the different energy levels, demonstrated that over the energy density range investigated there was up to a 17.4% increase in yield strength (YS) and a 2.5% increase in Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) for the CW printed samples, when compared with those obtained using the MW laser wave emission mode. Comparatively, MW laser emission mode resulted in thicker laths with slightly wider prior β grains, which exhibited an elongation at break of 13.6% during tensile testing at high energy densities. The influence of the laser emission mode on dimensional accuracy was also investigated. Sample printed using the MW laser emission mode showed up to a 50% improvement in dimensional accuracy when compared with that obtained for CW wave laser emission mode.",

The thermal performance of the filament is investigated through test printing, thermal conductivity testing and scanning electron microscope imaging. Topology optimisation is used to generate novel heat sink designs for passive cooling through natural convection. The optimised designs are complex and are printed using soluble support materials. The measured anisotropic thermal conductivity of the layer-by-layer additively manufactured specimens is included in the topology optimisation process to design heat sinks specifically with the chosen filament and process in mind. It is shown that when taking the material anisotropy into account, the topology-optimised heat sinks deliver up to 10–20% reduction in thermal resistance compared to a reference straight-fin design.",

    "abstract": "One of the essential requirements in Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing (CSAM) is the control over the profile of the deposited materials. This paper introduces a workflow for designing contoured axisymmetric nozzles, which aims to improve on the metal particle delivery and the deposit profile of current commercial cold spray nozzles. The workflow uses two aerospace design codes based on the Method of Characteristics (MOC). By using coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, the performance of a current commercial cold spray nozzle is compared with that of a redesigned nozzle. The new nozzle is obtained by performing a multi-objective optimization of the nozzle inner wall profile. This is done by varying the nozzle inlet convergent angle, the throat radius of curvature, and the inflection angle in the divergent section. The design performance is then assessed by evaluating a penalty function for each nozzle shape. The penalty function combines some of the most desirable characteristics in CSAM, namely a high particle impact velocity, a good spatial uniformity in this velocity and a good uniformity of the radial distribution of the particles. The numerical predictions show that the optimized nozzle shape delivers a more radially uniform deposit. A higher particle velocity is obtained at the same operating conditions/costs used by the industry standard nozzle. This study suggests that this integrated, multi-objective, parametric design approach can be built up in complexity to further improve the deposition performance of cold spray nozzles in additive manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Radiation thermometry techniques have been implemented to measure thermal signatures in powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing (AM), including the use of imaging devices with a large field of view, to measure large areas of the powder bed with spatial discrimination, and those considered single spot devices that measure signatures from a small region. Traditionally, these techniques can be categorized as single-color (brightness) or two-color (ratio) pyrometry; imaging devices are single-color while spot devices can be either. Both techniques can be used to infer a target temperature using a priori knowledge of the emissivity or employing the graybody assumption of constant emissivity across the spectrum. However, the dynamics of PBF AM, where a concentrated heat source is employed to selectively melt powder material, lead to complex material phase transitions under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. This makes it challenging to measure accurate thermal signatures because the emissivity of the target is also constantly varying as the PBF process unfolds. In this work, we employed an established technique of multi-wavelength pyrometry in an electron beam powder bed fusion (PBF-EB) system to continuously measure temperatures and the thermal emissive behavior during sintering and melting of an Inconel 625 powder that was subjected to preheating by direct scanning with the electron beam. The measurements displayed distinctive changes in signal strength or emissivity (in the wavelength range between 1080 nm and 1640 nm) that indicated the material phase change from loose to sintered powder to molten material and finally to solidified material; these changes in signal strength/emissivity were correlated with electron microscopy observations. This work highlights the suitability of multi-wavelength (MW) pyrometry as an in situ diagnostic tool to identify thermal process signatures (i.e., absolute temperatures), and the radiative emissive behavior of the materials being processed. Several demonstrations of the use of this MW pyrometry technique as a diagnostic tool are provided, illustrating its ability to sense signal strength/emissivity differences as the material experiences changes due to its temperature, phase, morphology, and chemistry. Although spatial and temporal improvements in the technique can be pursued, the sensitivity of the approach is demonstrated, as an example, in the ability to capture the passing thermal wavefronts arising from the scanning electron beam. It is anticipated that this technique and the information it provides can be leveraged in the development of advanced techniques for thermal monitoring and process control in PBF.",

Two processing routes employing nitrogen as a reactive process gas are explored: (1) Standard inert processing in argon followed by reactive remelting in nitrogen and (2) reactive processing in nitrogen. Incorporation of nitrogen is depth-dependent and both approaches result in a dispersion of ZrN nanocrystals in the amorphous matrix close to the surface. The process parameters can be adjusted to control the volume fraction of crystalline phases formed. Hence, it is shown that reactive additive manufacturing can be utilised to form bulk metallic glass–ceramic composites in surface near regions. Thereby we demonstrate that the reactive gas atmosphere utilised during additive manufacturing enables local tailoring of structure, composition, and mechanical properties in the vicinity of the surface.",

The pumps implement a novel actuator design with a notched cross-section that requires less than half the force to fully seal, making it possible to create and maintain low vacuum at low actuation speed. The devices are made via multi-material extrusion: the rigid parts of the pumps are made in polylactic acid (PLA), while the compliant parts of the pumps are made in FiberFlex 40D—a relatively new flexible material that is easier to print than mainstream Ninjaflex, even though the two materials have similar hardness. A novel, analytical, reduced order model of a peristaltic vacuum pump is also presented to provide insights into its operation, while identifying the key parameters to optimize and improve its performance. Characterization of 3D-printed FiberFlex 40D demonstrates >105 cycles fatigue life, and its hyperelastic behavior is satisfactorily described by the Mooney Rivlin model. Experimental characterization of pump prototypes demonstrates the devices attain an order of magnitude lower base pressure than a state-of-the-art, single-stage, miniaturized diaphragm vacuum pump. The technology is of interest for in-situ, low-waste manufacturing of analytical hardware far from population centers, including in-space manufacturing and space colonization.",

However, defined charging of powder particles is crucial for achieving an accurate selective deposition of powder layers by means of electrophotography. This is the first comprehensive study on the specific triboelectric charge control of polymer particles for their subsequent use in electrophotographic powder application for PBF-LB/P. For this purpose, approaches for charge control of toner particles in the context of digital (2D) printing technologies are adapted and applied to polypropylene (PP) feedstocks for PBF-LB/P. In order to show transferability to other polymers, the charge control method developed in this paper is also applied to polyamide 12 (PA12) high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polystyrene (PS). For successful EPA, unipolar charging of polymer particles is crucial. However, non-functionalized PP shows a strongly bipolar triboelectric charging, which is unsuitable for EPA. The charge control method developed in this work shifts this strongly bipolar triboelectric charging to a unipolar charging. This is achieved by the synergy of both functionalizing the particle surface with charge control agents (CCAs) and choosing suitable carrier particles known from two-component toners. The developed method allows to control crucial parameters of triboelectric charging, namely polarity, amount of charge and resulting surface potential. Furthermore, the presented results provide new insights into the transfer behavior of charged PP particles in an external electric field. Finally, this enables the triboelectric charging mechanism to be used for electrophotographic powder application in PBF-LB/P.",

    "abstract": "Bioresorbable stents (BRS) are conceived to retain sufficient radial strength after implantation while releasing an antiproliferative drug in order to prevent vessel restenosis until complete resorption. Ongoing research trends involve the use of innovative manufacturing techniques to achieve thinner struts combined with optimized local drug delivery. This work presents a combination of solvent-cast direct-writing (SC-DW) and electrospinning (ES) using poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) and poly(l-lactic-co-ɛ-caprolactone) (PLCL) as a new approach to generate everolimus-eluting BRS for cardiovascular applications. A Design of Experiment (DoE) was conducted to determine the optimal parameters to obtain a homogeneous coating with high specific surface. Manufactured stents were characterized by means of mechanical tests and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with everolimus release in accelerated conditions quantified through High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Drug loading was achieved either encapsulated in the struts of the stent or in an electrospun PLCL membrane covering the stent. In the former case, everolimus release was found to be insufficient, less than 3% of total drug loading after 8 weeks. In the latter, everolimus release considerably increased with respect to drug-loaded 3D-printed stents, with over 50% release in the first 6 hours of the test. In conclusion, everolimus release from PLCL-coated 3D-printed stents would match the dose and timeframe required for in vivo applications, while providing thinner struts than SC-DW drug-loaded stents.",

    "abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing (AM) has now become the perhaps most desirable technique for producing complex shaped engineering parts. However, to truly take advantage of its capabilities, advanced control of AM microstructures and properties is required, and this is often enabled via modeling. The current work presents a computational modeling approach to studying the solid-state phase transformation kinetics and the microstructural evolution during AM. Our approach combines thermal and thermo-kinetic modelling. A semi-analytical heat transfer model is employed to simulate the thermal history throughout AM builds. Thermal profiles of individual layers are then used as input for the MatCalc thermo-kinetic software. The microstructural evolution (e.g., fractions, morphology, and composition of individual phases) for any region of interest throughout the build is predicted by MatCalc. The simulation is applied to an IN738 part produced by electron beam powder bed fusion to provide insights into how γ′ precipitates evolve during thermal cycling. Our simulations show qualitative agreement with our experimental results in predicting the size distribution of γ′ along the build height, its multimodal size character, as well as the volume fraction of MC carbides. Our findings indicate that our method is suitable for a range of AM processes and alloys, to predict and engineer their microstructures and properties.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) is an additive manufacturing technique which has recently been growing in popularity in industrial use cases. However, several challenges persist, including the issue of solidification cracking observed in widely used Ni-based superalloys. Through retrofitting an existing PBF machine with a dual beam system capable of dynamic beam shaping, it is possible to overcome this issue. The appropriate process parameters for the laser beam need to be determined prior to manufacturing the system. In this regard we propose a methodology that utilizes a numerical simulation tool to identify optimized parameters. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, two example processes are presented. Initially the numerical model is validated by comparing its results against experimental data obtained from single track scans of two metal powders, CM247LC and IN713LC. Subsequently, an optimization study is conducted to identify optimal combinations of differently shaped and sized primary and secondary beams. The goal is to reduce the cooling rates within certain critical temperature ranges, thus mitigating the likelihood of solidification cracking, while avoiding the occurrence of other process defects such as balling, porosity, or lack of fusion. The effectiveness of these beam shapes is then verified through the production of physical samples. Through this example, a methodology for leveraging physics-based, model-driven process optimization is presented. Additionally, insights into the potential application of the same model for large-scale simulations are provided.",

Based on bio-inspired anchoring systems, fibrillated fibres were also employed in 30 mass% fibre composites. The resulting 3D printed samples displayed outstanding mechanical performance, particularly with high fibre content. Compared to neat PLA, unmodified formulations showed reduced tensile strength and strain at break with the addition of fibres, but they had a moderate improvement in Young's modulus. However, by combining fibre fibrillation, matrix modification, and post-printing annealing, we achieved an excellent balance of tensile strength (85 MPa), Young's modulus (7.2 GPa), and strain at break (3.2%) - the highest reported values for such composites. Incorporating fibres and increasing PLA crystallinity via heat treatment significantly enhanced the thermo-mechanical stability of the composites, raising the storage modulus up to 38 times at 60 °C and 200 times at 80 °C compared to neat PLA. This combined strategy paves the way for the 3D printing of high-performance structures using 100% bio-derived materials.",

The vertical tensile sample, with a dominant <001> // TD texture, failed at an UTS of 750 MPa with an enhanced failure elongation of 52%. Microstructural analysis of the deformed samples showed that the horizontal samples were mainly deformed via the formation of mechanical twins, whereas the twining activity was less profound in the vertical samples. Single crystal micro-pillar compression testing revealed that the deformation mechanism complies well with the Schmid's factor. In addition, a higher critical resolved shear stress for twining compared to slip was also confirmed in the micro-pillar compression testing.",

    "abstract": "Arc based direct energy deposition combines the flexibility of additive manufacturing with high build rates and low investment costs. However, high geometric fidelity of manufactured components is not possible with state-of-the-art methods. Highly varying and geometry-dependent boundary conditions, e.g. heat dissipation and the interpass temperature, are quasi-random influences with a strong impact on the geometric fidelity and the manufactured microstructure. Without adjusting for these variations, process stability decreases, geometric deviations become more likely and defects accumulate from layer to layer. A high geometric fidelity of the manufactured components can therefore not be guaranteed with the state of the art. Due to the large number of influencing variables in the arc-based manufacturing process, this problem cannot be solved by the definition of simple setpoints. Closed-loop control, however, offers the opportunity to flexibly counteract any deviations that occur by adjusting the process parameters in real time. Since the manufactured part is created by solidification from the weld pool, a closed-loop control of the weld pool size is being developed. The developed controller uses the weld pool properties and the interpass temperature as feedback variables and takes into account the non-linear system behaviour as well as the process noise and the parameter uncertainties. The subordinate control of the welding power source is further used for improved process stability. To the best of our knowledge, this solution provides a level of robustness, steady-state accuracy and geometric fidelity that has not been achieved by previous approaches reported in the literature. To illustrate the performance of this closed-loop control for components with low heat dissipation, we demonstrate the fabrication of thin-walled components with high geometric accuracy for a fast 3D printing process and investigate the influence of the welding process variables on the microstructure, the evaluation of the geometric fidelity is based on EN ISO 1101.",

    "abstract": "Fused Filament Fabrication is an additive manufacturing technique in which molten thermoplastic polymers are extruded through a nozzle. Therefore, the interplay between the viscoelastic nature of the polymer melt, temperature, printing conditions and nozzle shape may lead to inconsistent extrusion. To improve the extrusion control and optimize the print-head performance, a better understanding of the flow process of the polymer melt both in the nozzle and the liquefier is needed. However, several challenges need to be overcome due to the complexity of gathering experimental data on the melt pressure in the nozzle and the lack of numerical models able to capture the full rheology of the molten polymer. This research introduces an innovative approach for monitoring the pressure within a material extrusion 3D printer's nozzle. This method involves utilizing a pin in direct contact with the molten material, which then transmits the applied force from the material to an externally mounted load cell. The setup provides reliable, repeatable pressure data in steady-state conditions for two nozzle geometries and at different extrusion flows and temperatures. Moreover, the Giesekus model enabled capturing the viscoelastic rheometric features of the melt, and the numerical predictions have been compared with the experimental data. Results show that the numerical model accurately describes the flow conditions in the nozzle and allows the estimation of the behaviour of the melt in the liquefier zone, the area of the print-head where the filament is molten. It could be concluded that the backflow, which is the backward flow of the molten polymer in the gap between the filament and the liquefier towards the cold end, caused significant non-linearities in the total pressure drop measured in the feeders, which were related to normal forces induced by shear in that region.",

    "abstract": "The additive manufacturing of electroactive polymer (EAP) devices poses significant challenges due to their distinct structure and dissimilar properties of their constituent materials. It requires deposition of multiple functional materials with different properties, achieving μm-scale resolution in layer thickness, and executing incremental deposition and curing steps while preserving the previously deposited functional material layers. This study introduces an airbrush 3D printer concept and employs it for fabricating EAP transducers. An airbrush 3D printer was constructed by adapting a standard extrusion printer platform and integrating it with a two fluid atomizer (i.e. an airbrush) as the deposition tool. A process was developed for printing of the bending P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) actuators with carbon black electrodes, and actuators with a single and dual EAP layers were fabricated. The airbrush printer attained in-plane resolution of 0.5mm, thickness resolutions of 0.63 μm and allowed atomizing up to 7% P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) solutions. The 18 mm x 4 mm EAP actuators achieved 340μm (440 Vpp) and 3.7 mm (400 Vpp, 104 Hz) tip deflections respectively in quasi-static and resonant operation. Airbrush printing therefore proved to be a robust method for printing precursor materials with a wide range of properties, and is anticipated to be a versatile approach for printing other passive and stimuli-responsive materials and devices.",

    "abstract": "Elastomeric materials, most prominently polydimethylsiloxane, are of great importance for microfluidic systems. Unfortunately, most elastomeric materials used in these systems so far show poor chemical resistance. Fluorinated elastomers are promising for chemistry-on-chip applications performed on these microfluidic systems, but challenging to shape on the microscale and difficult to bond which is a required step for the fabrication of embedded chips. In this work, a custom-synthesized fluorinated photocurable resin which can be structured using vat photopolymerization 3D printers, and shows a high elasticity combined with a remarkable chemical resistance was demonstrated. The material provides excellent stretchability, with a linear deformation capability of 523% and remains stretchable even after being soaked in tetrahydrofuran for 24 hours. By using multi-material printing microfluidic chips with bonded hard and soft segments of different fluorinated resins were fabricated. Also, a variety of chemically resistant microfluidic components including pneumatic valves and peristaltic pumps were proven feasible. This novel fluorine-containing resin is expected to initiate further advancements of chemistry-on-chip application.",

    "abstract": "The successful application of laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) for fabricating bulk metallic glass (BMG) parts heavily relies on the development of effective process strategies. An optimal process strategy for BMGs is required to go beyond manufacturing defect-free parts and address the critical aspect of minimizing crystallization. However, traditional trial-and-error experimental methods for process development are time-consuming and costly. This paper uses an in-house developed simulation software, SAMPLE2D, to systematically explore PBF-LB/M process conditions for BMGs, with the Zr-based glass-forming alloy Zr59.3Cu28.8Al10.4Nb1.5 (at.%, trade name: AMZ4, AMLOY-ZR01) as an example. We uncover that BMG crystallization during PBF-LB/M is a localized phenomenon, primarily induced by short-range in-situ heat treatment. We comprehensively explore process conditions, encompassing laser beam-related parameters (beam power, speed, diameter, and line offset), as well as powder bed-related parameters (powder layer thickness, preheating temperature, and oxygen level of AMZ4). Leveraging insights derived from the parameter study, we delve into innovative scanning strategies. Various scanning strategies are explored, including line jumping, adding waiting times, translating the scan pattern, and rotating the scan pattern. Remarkably, our findings highlight line jumping as a highly effective scanning strategy to reduce crystallization while maintaining relative density. While either layer-wise translation or non-180° rotation of the scan pattern is generally not recommended, when focusing solely on consolidation and crystallization aspects. This study not only provides an in-depth understanding of how PBF-LB/M process conditions shape the properties of BMG parts, but also offers a fresh perspective on applying PBF-LB/M technology in BMG part production.",

    "abstract": "High manganese steels offer exceptional combinations of high strength and ductility, resulting in weight reduction when utilized in structural applications. Nevertheless, the conventional manufacturing routes of these steels is hindered by many production problems. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a reliable solution to fabricate thin or complex shape compounds using these steel grades. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the success to fabricate high manganese twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) and transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels by laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF). However, a recent study on a high manganese triplex steel composition has revealed the occurrence of both hot cracking and micro segregation during rapid solidification in L-PBF, highlighting potential processability issues of this family of high alloy steels. In this study, the hot cracking susceptibility of different triplex steels is evaluated, focusing on the impact of the composition on the solidification paths and final microstructures. A Computer Coupling of Phase Diagrams and Thermochemistry (CALPHAD) approach is employed to predict alloy-dependent hot cracking susceptibility so as to establish guidelines for preventing hot cracking and provide insights into alloy design for AM. Microstructural observations are used to determine the accuracy of CALPHAD predictions in terms of elemental segregation, phase formation and hot cracking susceptibility. To this end, scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to evaluate elemental segregation at grain boundaries, while the local distribution of phases and their relative amount is measured by electron backscattered and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Hot cracking susceptibility is experimentally evaluated by measuring the length of cracks (when present) in the cross section of printed specimens.",

    "abstract": "The Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process was used to manufacture NiMnGa polycrystalline samples. The initial powders with a fine particle size of about 20 µm were firstly prepared by a ball milling from melt-spun ribbons. The microstructure and texture evolution of NiMnGa alloy manufactured by LPBF were investigated employing SEM, TEM, and synchrotron radiation diffraction. Using two different scanning strategies, optimization of laser parameters and post-processing heat treatment, a homogeneous microstructure with a strong crystallographic texture was obtained. The localized heating/cooling conditions allow obtaining a layered structure with preferred <100> fiber orientations along the growth direction. The crystal structure and crystallographic texture drastically change when the laser oscillation mode is chosen. The strong crystalline anisotropy and layered-type microstructure have a significant impact on twining flow behavior giving rise to an anisotropic mechanical response. The variant reorientation during mechanical training is realized by the so-called orthogonal shearing. It is also shown that the resulting crystal structure and characteristic transformation temperatures are strongly dependent on chemical composition related to Mn losses and internal stresses along with chemical order creating metastable phases due to the extremely high cooling rate upon the 3D printing. Therefore, all the above parameters are thoroughly monitored during the three-stage fabrication process.",

Herein we investigate the influence of two key parameters; baseplate temperature and infill rotation angle, on the densification, microstructure, and tensile properties of AlSi7Mg parts produced via magnetohydrodynamic-based liquid metal jetting additive manufacturing. Adjusting the baseplate temperature from 220°C-500°C resulted in substantial variation in the densification, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the printed material, however, infill rotation angle had a minimal influence over these characteristics. Higher baseplate temperatures resulted in higher densification, coarsened precipitates within the microstructure, as well as greater hardness and tensile strength in the as-printed condition. Greater than 99% dense samples were fabricated with a unique hierarchical grain structure (20-40 µm) and relatively high ductility (> 15%) in the as-printed condition when processed on a 420°C baseplate. Our results aid in understanding the role that key process parameters play in determining the microstructure and properties of parts produced using liquid metal jetting towards industrial adoption.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we demonstrate the preparation of magnetic polyamide 11 feedstock powders for powder bed fusion (PBF) using liquid-liquid phase separation and crystallization. By adding magnetic nanomaterials during the precipitation process, the particulate additive is incorporated into the polymer matrix. This enables the production of filled systems at single particle level, which is advantageous in terms of the adjustable magnetic strength and homogeneity of the powder. Thermogravimetric analysis is used to determine the additive content and onset temperature of decomposition of composite powders, where additive-enhancement of PA11 powders with magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles showed a positive influence on the thermal stability of the feedstock. Successive analysis of particle size distribution, shape, colour, crystal structure, magnetic properties and thermal properties of the composite powders are carried out and their properties are discussed with respect to the PBF process. A decrease in particle size, width of the thermal process window and isothermal crystallization time can be attributed to the nucleating effect of the magnetic additive. The PBF processability of the composite feedstock is demonstrated by the production of magnetic tensile bar specimens from additive-enhanced PA11 powders with 1 wt.-% magnetic iron oxide.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for advanced materials with load-bearing capabilities in extremely high-temperature environments has brought considerable attention to the design and fabrication of novel refractory complex concentrated alloys. Despite the notable progress in design of customized alloys, there are still significant challenges regarding their processing and fabrication, highly limiting their exploitation. In this study, model non-equiatomic Nb-Ta based refractory complex concentrated alloys were created as potential materials with improved high-temperature stability and performance for space propulsion applications. Gas atomization was used for producing spherical pre-alloyed powders. Two different additive manufacturing techniques, i.e., laser powder bed fusion and cold spray were used to explore the manufacturing complexities of this novel alloy. The results highlight the importance of powder's features on its processability by laser powder bed fusion and cold spray. High interstitial content, inhomogeneous microstructures, fractured and hollow particles, and the presence of microsegregation, led to embrittlement, and in case of cold spray, the wide particle size range of the feedstock resulted in undesired flowability, adversely affecting the processibility of the developed material. The obtained results provide valuable insights and recommendation for improving design, preparation, and fabrication of custom-designed refractory alloys for additive manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "In conventional additive manufacturing, the layer-by-layer approach leads to mechanical weaknesses, particularly in the vertical tensile strength (Z-axis) and the shear resistance between layers. The unique mechanism of mechanical enhancement found in natural materials has served as inspiration for solving the above problems. Here this study introduces two novel Interlaced Printing strategies for 3-axis printers inspired by nature. The proposed strategies involve moving the deposition head in the XY plane while periodically adjusting its height in the Z-axis, enhancing interlayer bonding and shear resistance. These strategies were closely examined to understand their impact on toolpath width and layer thickness, considering various parameters. Both strategies resulted in \"dumbbell\"-shaped toolpath geometries, a characteristic that can be lessened by reducing print speed. Mechanical tests revealed that objects printed using these strategies significantly outperform traditional planar toolpath methods in terms of mechanical strength, showing improvements of 31.9% and 67.5% in interlayer shear resistance. Notably, these new strategies can be combined with each other or with conventional methods, broadening their potential applications.",

    "abstract": "Vat Photopolymerization (VPP) technology is highly regarded for precision micromachining applications like microfluidic chip fabrication, owing to its fine resolution, adaptability, and rapid prototyping capabilities. However, the challenge of resin over-curing resulting from UV energy penetration poses a significant obstacle in microchannel printing. This study addresses this challenge by investigating the intricate relationship between resin properties and over-curing. Diverse microfluidic chips were printed utilizing VPP technology, and the overall cross-sectional over-curing characteristics of the channels were systematically examined. A novel combination of the classical UV light curing model and computational Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) model with the VPP printing process was proposed to examine the complex hydrodynamics and exfoliation dynamics within VPP-printed microchannels. The simulation results suggest that resins with higher viscosities and surface roughness are better suited for microchannel printing. Subsequent experiments using five different resins verified these findings and showed that the microchannels obtained with resins of lower viscosity and surface roughness resins have an irregular trapezoidal cross-section, which is uncontrollable and unpredictable and seriously affects the microchannel printing accuracy. Conversely, resins with higher viscosity and surface roughness have an ideal rectangular cross-section, which can be compensated by the model further refined printing to print microchannel. Finally, microfluidic chips were printed using \"high precision 8 K resin\" and \"8 K-clay resin\" with higher viscosity and surface roughness. The results proved that the microchannels printed by these resins had the desired rectangular cross-section, which was consistent with the \"DLP light-curing\" model. This study elucidates, for the first time, the intricate interplay between resin properties, printing structure, and microchannel over-curing, and this provides a solid groundwork for advancing high-precision microfluidic chip fabrication via DLP printing.",

    "abstract": "Wire–arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is an emergent method for the production and repair of high value components. Introduction of plastic strain by inter-pass rolling has been shown to produce grain refinement and improve mechanical properties, however suitable quality control techniques are required to demonstrate the refinement non-destructively. This work proposes a method for rapid microstructural assessment of Ti–6Al–4V, with limited intervention, by measuring an acoustic wave generated on the surface of the specimens. Specifically, undeformed and rolled specimens have been analysed by spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy (SRAS), allowing the efficacy of the rolling process to be observed in velocity maps. The work has three primary outcomes (i) differentiation of texture due to rolling force, (ii) understanding the acoustic wave velocity response in the textured material including the underlying crystallography, (iii) extraction of an additional build metric such as layer height from acoustic maps and further useful material information such as minimum stiffness direction. Variations in acoustic response due to grain refinement and crystallographic orientation have been explored. It has been found that the limited α-variants which develop within prior-β grains lead to distinctive acoustic slowness surfaces. This allowed prior-β grains to be resolved. A basic algorithm has been proposed for the automated measurement, which could be used for in-line closed loop control. The practicality and challenges of applying this approach in-line with fabrication are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper demonstrates the utilisation of in-situ synthesised novel metal organic framework (MOF)-polymer nanocomposite laser-sintered parts with enhanced CO2 adsorption properties. Making use of polyamide PA12, one of the most common materials in powder bed fusion process as the base polymer, an in-situ synthesis of nanofiller ZIF-67 crystals on the surface of polyamide polymer particles was proposed to allow the fabrication of a nanocomposite powder with a good dispersion, reducing any health and safety handling issue arising from use of loose nanoparticles. This in-situ synthesis method allowed a maximum exposure of the ZIF-67 nano-porous sites. Laser sintering was used to fabricate porous structures with additional macro-pores and controlled cavities to increase the surface area. The laser-sintered ZIF67-PA12 part at only 2.6% wt ZIF-67 concentration exhibited a CO2 capacity of 3.02 and 4.89 cm3/g at 298 K and 273 K at 1 bar. This in-situ synthesis method of making ZIF67-PA12 powders combined with the design freedom and the ease of fabrication of parts opens opportunities in a wider range of applications for MOFs such as energy storage and conversion.",

Flexibility in the shape and dimensions of this technology leads to the possibility to overcome the restrictions in the design and manufacturing of complex-shaped bulk magnets. The nanocomposites discussed here were fabricated by the addition of magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles into a polymeric matrix: PEG-PVB and silicone gel. Composites with nanoparticles to polymer blend weight concentrations varying from 20% to 60% were prepared. The rheological behaviour of the suspensions was studied using rotational rheometry. The 3D prints were performed with and without an externally applied magnetic field. Microstructure, morphology and magnetic properties of the synthesised nanocomposites were confirmed by Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), respectively. The composites showed a uniform morphology with nanoparticles embedded homogeneously in the matrix. Magnetic response, namely remanence, saturation, coercive field and squareness, depend substantially on the type of polymeric matrix and nanoparticles concentration. Composites based on silicone have around 20–25% lower squareness ratio than the PEG-PVB-Fe3O4 ones. The elements printed from selected composites exhibit weak but well pronounced magnetic shape anisotropy – a feature characteristic for bulk magnets.",

    "abstract": "Conventional direct ink writing uses circular nozzles and, therefore, results in cylindrical strands. 3D printing with non-circular nozzles adds new degrees of freedom to this versatile technology, and allows obtaining structures with higher specific surface area or even introducing concave surfaces in the printed architecture. This is an enticing prospect for countless applications, including tissue engineering, chemical reaction catalysts, water evaporators and electrochemical energy storage devices. Despite this, it has been hardly explored by the 3D-printing community. Herein, we develop for the first time 3D printed structures with complex filament section morphologies using a custom-made modular nozzle and a self-setting ceramic ink. The fast elastic recovery of the ink allows obtaining good shape fidelity in the printed filaments, permitting the creation of intricate surfaces with up to 30% concavity and increasing up to 2.5 times the specific surface area compared to cylindrical strands. The use of non-circular nozzles introduces some specific constraints in the printing process. The geometry of the nozzle determines the stable printing directions, and nozzle orientation becomes a critical parameter to achieve a stable printing. Strand torsion, a phenomenon that remains unnoticed with circular nozzles, may result in relevant changes in the geometrical features of the printed structures.",

    "abstract": "Additively manufactured lattices are emerging as promising candidates for structural, thermal, chemical, and biological applications. However, achieving a satisfactory prototype or final part with this level of complexity requires synthesis of disparate knowledge from the distinctly digital and physical processing stages. This work proposes an integrated framework for processing self-supporting, open lattice structures that do not require supports and facilitate material removal in post-processing steps. We describe a minimal yet comprehensive design strategy for generating uniform lattice structures with conformal open lattice skins for an arbitrary unit cell configuration. Using continuous liquid interface production (CLIP™) on a Carbon M1, printability is evaluated for five unique bending-dominated lattice structures at unit cell length scales from 0.5 to 3.5 mm and strut diameters ranging from 0.11 to 1.05 mm. Using a cubic lattice as a basis, we further examine dimensional fidelity with respect to 2D lattice void dimensions and part position, finding differences between length scales and within parts, due to physical processing artifacts. Finally, we demonstrate a functional grading strategy based on process control methods to compensate for dimensional deviations. Using an iterative approach based on a naïve process model, deviation of the planar strut radius in a cubic lattice was decreased by approximately 85% after two iterations. These insights and strategies can be readily applied to other structures, characterization techniques, and additive manufacturing processes, thereby improving the exchange of information between digital and physical processing and lowering the energy barriers to producing high-quality lattice parts.",

    "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques have gained extensive attention recently as they are able to directly produce 3D parts utilising a layer-by-layer manner. Inkjet printing is one such technique which can produce micron-scale features but is generally constrained to liquid viscosities of less than 30 mPa·s, therefore available materials are limited. A 3D reactive inkjet printing (3DRIJP) approach to deposit low viscosity monomers and polymerise in-situ to form polymer parts is emerging. In this work, a 3DRIJP approach has been developed to fabricate bisphenol A-polycarbonate (BPA-PC) for the first time by using a low viscosity reactive ink containing monomers, catalyst and solvent. A set of processing parameters were explored and optimised including temperature of droplet formation, substrate temperature and droplet spacing to print films. With a thermal post-curing process, BPA-PC was formed successfully with a molecular weight comparable to those which were manufactured by the conventional melt transesterification process. The thermal properties were evaluated suggesting good thermal resistance characteristics. Finally, a 3D ziggurat structure was printed to demonstrate the capability to fabricate BPA-PC by an AM method, thus broadened the library of AM materials to include engineering grade polymers via 3DRJIP. This approach was innovative in both the BPA-PC material formulation and the 3DRIJP process development from traditional inkjet printing methods, where a single printable formulation of monomers for thermoplastic optical-clear BPA-PC was able to be printed using one printhead to form 3D structures.",

    "abstract": "Photopolymerization processes are exploited in light exposure-based 3D printing technologies, where either a focused laser beam or a patterned light sheet allows layers of a UV curable, liquid pre-polymer to be solidified. Here we focus on the crucial, though often neglected, role of the layer thickness on photopolymerization. The temporal evolution of polymerization reactions occurring in droplets of acrylate-based oligomers and in photoresist films with varied thickness is investigated by means of an optical system, which is specifically designed for in-situ and real-time monitoring. The time needed for complete curing is found to increase as the polymerization volume is decreased below a characteristic threshold that depends on the specific reaction pathway. This behavior is rationalized by modelling the process through a size-dependent polymerization rate. Our study highlights that the formation of photopolymerized networks might be affected by the involved volumes regardless of the specific curing mechanisms, which could play a crucial role in optimizing photocuring-based additive manufacturing.",

Though electron beam powder bed fusion (E-PBF) can produce components with minimal defects and residual stresses compared to laser powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition, variations of them may occur within the complex geometry of a component, due to inherent variations of thermal signatures and the evolution of section modulus along the build direction. This work reveals the residual stress distribution, characterised from neutron diffraction, of an as-fabricated Haynes 282 monolith containing internal cube voids and thin wall struts of varying thicknesses. Complementary local hardness measurements and multi-scale microscopy were used to investigate the geometry-structure-property relationships. Observed variations in hardness were attributed to a combination of type I macro-scale residual stresses and variations in bimodal γ′ precipitation behaviour. The results highlight the influence of residual stresses and microstructure on the mechanical properties of E-PBF Haynes 282.",

    "abstract": "Overheating is a major issue especially in metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes, leading to poor surface quality, lack of dimensional precision, inferior performance and/or build failures. A 3D density-based topology optimization (TO) method is presented which addresses the issue of local overheating during metal AM. This is achieved by integrating a simplified AM thermal model and a thermal constraint within the optimization loop. The simplified model, recently presented in literature, offers significant computational gains while preserving the ability of overheating detection. The novel thermal constraint ensures that the overheating risk of optimized designs is reduced. This is fundamentally different from commonly used geometry-based TO methods which impose a geometric constraint on overhangs. Instead, the proposed approach takes the process physics into account. The proposed method is validated via an experimental comparative study. Optical tomography (OT) is used for in-situ monitoring of process conditions during fabrication and obtained data is used for evaluation of overheating tendencies. The novel TO method is compared with two other methods: standard TO and TO with geometric overhang control. The experimental data reveals that the novel physics-based TO design experienced less overheating during the build as compared to the two classical designs. A study further investigated the correlation between overheating observed by high OT values and the defect of porosity. It shows that overheated regions indeed show higher defect of porosity. This suggests that geometry-based guidelines, although enhance printability, may not be sufficient for eliminating overheating issues and related defects. Instead, the proposed physics-based method is able to deliver efficient designs with reduced risk of overheating.",

    "abstract": "Balling is one of the cornerstone defects in laser powder bed fusion of metals, leading to high porosity of the 3D printed parts and substantially deteriorating their performance. The transition to the balling mode is commonly identified through a series of trial-and-error experiments, an extremely inefficient approach. Here, we propose an outstandingly simple thermal scaling model for predicting the threshold from balling mode to conduction mode in laser powder bed fusion. The resulting balling criterion can be expressed as a dimensionless number which combines the material properties, the powder size and the pre-heating of the substrate. The model predictions are well in agreement with our validation experiments for three different materials (copper, bronze and steel). The applicability of the model assumptions is verified through a set of suitably designed multiphysics computational fluid dynamics simulations. The combination of first-hand experiments and simulations substantiates the balling model as a readily usable and reliable scaling criterion for establishing the minimum required power for laser powder bed fusion, applicable to different materials, as well as suggesting viable strategies to adjust the operating parameters towards the defect-free regime.",

    "abstract": "The importance of 3D printable hydrogels is constantly increasing in the field of tissue engineering, due to their characteristic structure and similarity with the human body extracellular matrix (ECM). Herein, Quinizarin-based bioderived photoactive dyes were employed for the 3D printing of methacrylated chitosan by vat photopolymerization (VPP). Dyes are commonly needed in VPP to obtain good resolution avoiding the light scattering in the vat, here the bioderived molecules had further utility granting the printability with good resolution while acting both as photosensitizers and fillers/crosslinkers. Defined and detailed architectures in the range of millimetres were obtained with low printing times showing for the first time the possibility to obtain all-chitosan 3D structures with suspended features by Digital Light Processing (DLP), which is a form of vat photopolymerization; such a result is not achievable without the quinizarin-derived dyes. The same structures were achieved with an optimized concentration of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, as a comparison, enhancing the resolution. For all the formulations, the important feature to obtain the gel printability (considering reactiveness, viscosity, shear thinning behaviour, mechanical properties and stability) were evaluated. The hydrogels mechanical characterization and swelling properties were also tested and reported. Lastly, the possible application in tissue engineering was also evaluated through cell proliferation analysis over samples, including metabolic activity and DNA contempt assays. The use of such bioderived photoactive molecules that simultaneously act as photosensitizer enhancing the ink reactivity, as dye improving the definition of the final structures and as filler/crosslinker increasing the mechanical stability, could represent a valuable route for the DLP printing of soft hydrogels.",

    "abstract": "Polypropylene (PP) powder bed fusion (PBF) with subsequent mechanical postprocessing can enable the development of more efficient and effective surfaces for bioprocessing equipment. However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the most relevant surface differences when compared to standardized surfaces. Herein, we present a new systematic methodology, including the evaluation of relevant roughness parameters and surface wettability, which has been implemented to assess the potential of AM to produce biopharmaceutical components. Surfaces of PP components produced by PBF and mechanically postprocessed by tumble surface finishing at 5, 10 and 15 h were compared to reference surfaces produced by computer numerical control (CNC) milling manufacturing. Thirteen roughness parameters were found to be relevant, of which the arithmetic mean peak curvature (Spc) and the density of peaks (Spd) were the most significant. The results demonstrate that the reference surfaces had Spc and Spd values of 1029 ± 36 mm−1 and 67739 ± 5440 mm−2, respectively, and moderate wettability with advancing (ACA) and receding (RCA) contact angles of 89 ± 3° and 68 ± 2°, respectively. The as-printed PBF surfaces were hydrophobic, with ACA of 119 ± 2° and RCA of 107 ± 4°, and with Spc and Spd values of 1089 ± 110 mm−1 and 30078 ± 4325 mm−2, respectively. PBF surfaces switched to a hydrophilic surface of 67 ± 3° and 44 ± 4° when the tumble surface finishing time was increased to 15 h. By taking advantage of this knowledge, we could produce surfaces using PBF and 5 h of mechanical postprocessing, which mimicked surface wetting and had Spc of 1100 ± 68 mm−1 and Spd of 55702 ± 9477 mm−2, similar to that of the CNC milling manufacturing. The developed comparative method and the results are important to better understand AM surfaces and can be used to transfer manufacturing from subtractive to additive technologies.",

With almost no shape limitation, structure's functionality is mainly defined by a fabrication resin used in the curing process. Recent advances in TPP attempt to incorporate multiple materials into the printing process; however, due to required nano-scale accuracy, maintaining common coordinate system between subsequent materials poses the biggest challenges in the process. In this paper, a novel multi-material TPP procedure is introduced based on transport of intensity equation phase imaging method for alignment purposes. The proposed method utilizes hardware already present in most TPP fabrication setups, delivering a complete and cost-free solution for multi-material fabrication. As a result, the position inaccuracy reaches less than 0.5μm. For demonstration purposes, a multi-material structure is designed, fabricated, and verified in terms of geometry and refractive index distribution accuracy. The multi-material object is made out of two polymers across two development cycles effectively expanding accessible refractive index range.",

The solidification microstructure is significantly affected by overlapping the melting laser beam with a defocused high-power heating laser beam. This heating concept results in a reduced temperature gradient G at the solidification front leading to a columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) and a fine-grained equiaxed microstructure with exceptional mechanical properties. Dense and crack-free DL specimens could be obtained by using a scan speed of 800 mm/s, a melting laser beam with a power of 130 W and a spot size diameter of 80 µm, followed by the heating laser beam with an offset of 160 µm, a power of 600 W and with a defocused spot size diameter of 400 µm. The study also found that by using DL-PBF, it is possible to reduce the temperature of the substrate plate for in situ HT from 800°C for single laser (SL) PBF to 600°C for DL-PBF.",

    "abstract": "We report on the development of a 3D printing process dedicated to the production of soft glass optical fibers. Direct printing with a miniaturized crucible for melting glass blocks with a pneumatic extrusion head was established. For 3D printing, a developed in-house heavy metal oxide glass was used. Contrary to previous studies on 3D printing of optical fiber preforms, the proposed process is based on the deposition of straight horizontally-oriented lines with a diameter of 300-500 µm to replace standard stack-and-draw manual assembly technique typically used in the development of microstructured optical fiber preforms. A test fiber preform composed of 2500 microrods with dimensions of 60x25x25 mm was printed. As a proof of concept, a photonic crystal fiber preform composed of a solid core and 3 rings of air holes in photonic crystal cladding was printed, and further processed into the optical fiber using a standard fiber drawing tower. We measured a single mode performance of fabricated fibers at 1.55 µm, and flat dispersion in the range of 1.6 – 2.2 µm with zero dispersion wavelength at 1.70 µm.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is a well-established process which allows to generate complex and accurate geometry required in several applications, from medical to automotive area. The exploitation of polymer resin into additive manufacturing needs to overcome the problem of viscosity and reactivity which can be improved by high temperature vat photopolymerization (VPP). Moreover, the concern about climate change and depletion of fossil fuels arises the requirement to move toward bio-derived products which can substitute the commercially available resins without compromise the final properties. In order to close this gap, we have studied vegetable epoxy oil polymer resins as main component for new bio-derived formulations which can be used in vat photopolymerization 3D printing. Furthermore, knowing the limits of the vegetable oils in terms of final properties, the investigation explores the possibility to 3D printing bio-derived composites by adding bio-based fillers, such as wall-nut shell. The UV-curing process was investigated by photo-DSC and photorheology to verify the feasibility of AM. Then, the effect of the presence of the filler on the UV-process was assessed and finally we successfully 3D printed composites of different geometries. The thermo-mechanical properties of the thermoset materials were studied by dynamic analysis and tensile testing. The benefit of the addition of the filler was confirmed and explained by investigating the surface modification of the filler which had an incredible impact on the properties of the composite. Finally, we pursuit the possibility to chemically degrade the thermoset joining the proof-of-concept of circular economy.",

    "abstract": "Multi-photon polymerization, like the so-called direct laser writing (DLW) technique allows for flexible additive manufacturing of three-dimensional ultra-precise structures on the micro- and nanoscale. A possible application for DLW is the manufacturing of measurement standards for calibration procedures of optical measurement instruments. This requires flexible and high precision manufacturing of individualized geometries with high quality surfaces. However, many of the process parameters in DLW have to be selected based on experience and previous knowledge. In this article, the influence of DLW process parameters on the micro-geometry and surface roughness produced are systematically studied, and optimized in terms of printing speed and manufacturing accuracy. Resulting microstructures are being evaluated with different measurement techniques, i.e., a stylus instrument, SEM and AFM. Based on optimized process parameters, a new measurement standard for the novel interferometric measurement instrument Ellipso-Height-Topometer is manufactured and examined as a case study. As a result, it can be shown, that DLW is able to manufacture ultra-precise micro geometries in a very flexible and very fast way and satisfies the tolerances for manufacturing of the designed measurement standard.",

    "abstract": "The present study demonstrates for the first time a unique UK-designed and built Additive Manufacturing (AM) hybrid system that combines polymer based structural deposition with digital deposition of electrically conductive elements. This innovative manufacturing system is based on a multi-planar build approach to improve on many of the limitations associated with AM, such as poor surface finish, low geometric tolerance and poor robustness. Specifically, the approach involves a multi-planar Material Extrusion (ME) process in which separated build stations with up to 5 axes of motion replace traditional horizontally-sliced layer modelling. The construction of multi-material architectures also involved using multiple print systems in order to combine both ME and digital deposition of conductive material. To demonstrate multi-material 3D Printing (3DP) we used three thermoplastics to print specimens, on top of which a unique Ag nano-particulate ink was printed using a non-contact jetting process, during which drop characteristics such as shape, velocity, and volume were assessed using a bespoke drop watching system. Electrical analysis of printed conductive tracks on polymer surfaces was performed during mechanical testing (static tensile and flexural testing and dynamic fatigue testing) to assess robustness of the printed circuits. Both serpentine and straight line patterns were used in the testing of Ag particle loaded ink and they showed very similar resistance changes during mechanical exposure. Monitored resistance and stress changed as a function of strain exhibiting hysteresis with more prominent residual strain during stretching and compression cycles and 3-point bending flexural tests of PA and CoPA substrates. Bare and encapsulated tracks exhibited low electrical resistivity (1–3*10−6 Ω*m), and its change was more rapid on ABS and minor on PA and CoPA when increasing tensile and flexural strain up to 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively. Resistance of Ag tracks on ABS also increased rapidly during fatigue testing and the tracks easily fractured during repeated stretching-compression cycles at 1% and 1.2% strain. No resistance changes of Ag tracks printed on PA and CoPA were observed at lower strain amplitudes whereas at higher strain amplitudes these changes were the lowest for conductive tracks on CoPA. Thermal analyses were conducted to determine the printed material's glass transition temperature (Tg), stability and degradation behavior to find the optimum annealing conditions post printing. The novel AM printer has the ability to fabricate fully functional objects in one build, including integrated printed circuitry and embedded electronics. It enables product designers and manufactures to produce functional saleable electronic products. This new technology also gives the opportunity for designers to improve existing products, as well as create new products with the added advantages of geometrically unconstrained 3DP.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates a fluid-filled, closed-cell lattice as a novel route to reducing peak acceleration in impact environments. A conical structure was designed and built using fused filament fabrication. One structure was manufactured hollow (100% air), another 70% filled with water (50% by height) and a third 100% water-filled. Peak acceleration was evaluated by performing 4.1 kg impacts at 1, 2, 3 m/s. Impacts were then simulated in shell and solid finite element analysis models, employing the smooth particle hydrodynamic method for the water and a surface-based fluid-filled cavity method for air. The air-filled, conventional closed-cell structures achieved the lowest peak accelerations at lower impact energies, however, water infill improved impact performance at higher energies. For low to medium impact energies, shell and solid modelling accurately simulated experimental trends, although the latter is more computationally expensive. Solid modelling is the only viable solution for scenarios achieving structural densification, due to the inaccuracies in shell-based models caused by the inter-surface penetrations. This work has demonstrated that fluid-filled structures provide a promising approach to reduce acceleration and so achieving enhanced protection, whilst also presenting a computational pathway that will enable efficient design of new and novel structures.",

    "abstract": "Thermally expandable microspheres are extensively used in industry as a lightweight filler for many products. The spheres can expand up to 60 times the initial size and are used for different purposes, including material reduction and surface modification. In fused filament fabrication (FFF), a material is deposited in a layer-by-layer process. Typically, FFF objects need not be solid because such objects are typically used for applications with low mechanical stress. Low material infill percentages are commonly used inside a solid outer shell to reduce material usage, weight, and manufacturing time. This paper proposes a new composite filament for FFF consisting of polylactic acid (PLA) and thermally expandable Expancel microspheres in the form of masterbatch granules. These filaments contain unexpanded microspheres that can be expanded during printing by heating. Two types of filaments containing 2 wt% and 5 wt% of masterbatch granules were manufactured and tested. The filaments were successfully used with a commercial 3D printer to manufacture objects with a density of 45% compared to objects manufactured using standard PLA. The tensile strength of these objects changed linearly with density and was comparable to that of PLA objects of the same density prepared using infill patterns. The composite filaments are advantageous in that they can reduce the amount of material used, as is currently done by using different amounts of infill in a pattern. Further, by varying the nozzle temperature, their density can be adjusted directly during printing as well as during fabrication to produce layers of different densities in the same object.",

    "abstract": "Many prior works highlight the potential of additive manufacturing (AM) for flow components. Examples include hydraulic manifolds with multiple crossing flow channels that guide separate fluid flows in a single part. Creating the 3D geometry of such complex parts can be challenging. Designers must consider functional requirements, such as minimizing the channels' length, creating smooth channel paths, and preventing overlaps between channels for different fluid flows. Furthermore, designers must adhere to manufacturing restrictions specific to the chosen AM technology. Critical overhangs inside channels must be avoided for processes such as laser powder bed fusion by adapting the shape of channel cross-sections. However, such production-related design changes can cause overlaps between different channels and require re-adjusting the channel paths. Consequently, routing several flow channels is often challenging when manually designing parts for AM. This work aims to automate the routing of multiple channels considering the AM overhang restriction. The presented approach models flow channels as virtual cables defined by a chain of particles (connected by line segments) and collision spheres (located at the cable particles). The cable line segments describe the path or centerline of channels, while the cable collision spheres approximate the required space of each channel. The cables are initialized as straight lines between the channel inlets and outlets and iteratively subjected to geometric-based constraints, e.g., to minimize the cables' length and smoothen their paths. The collision spheres are used to detect overlaps between channels for different flows and repel the affected cables from each other. The radii of the collision spheres are iteratively updated to consider the adaption of cross-sections for AM. After the iterative cable simulation convergences, the cable paths are used to generate a detailed 3D part design. A case study applies the approach to a hydraulic manifold fabricated using laser powder bed fusion of stainless steel. The study demonstrates the automated design and production of customized design variants.",

    "abstract": "We report the design, fabrication, and characterization of novel, digitally manufactured, compact retarding potential analyzers (RPAs), i.e., multi-electrode instruments that can be used as in-orbit mass spectrometers and as on-ground/in-orbit ion energy analyzers. Unlike most RPAs reported in the literature, our devices enforce active aperture alignment across the grid stack, maximizing ion transmission. The RPA electrode housing (the most critical component of the RPA, as it precisely positions the electrodes to maximize grid stack transmission while avoiding space charge effects and providing electrical insulation) is additively manufactured in Vitrolite® (a printable glass-ceramic) via vat polymerization, resulting in non-porous, high-temperature compatible, and high-vacuum compatible hardware. Metrology of as-printed (green) VitroliteⓇ parts shows an in-plane, per axis manufacturing accuracy of 60 µm (i.e., the in-plane length of the voxels) and an out-of-plane manufacturing accuracy of 100 µm (i.e., the height of the slices). VitroliteⓇ 3D-printed objects annealed at 900 °C show a ~5 % shrinkage, a slightly larger maximum tensile stress, a similar Young's modulus, and a larger compression yield stress compared to green samples. Also, the assembly misalignment between the grids and a 3D-printed housing annealed at 900 °C is a twofold larger compared to using a green housing. Annealing 3D-printed VitroliteⓇ at temperatures above 900 °C causes significant distortion of the printed part due to material reflow, which is incompatible with a precision engineering application. Four different RPA designs were synthesized to probe the ionosphere (design with floating grid alignment at the aperture level) and laboratory plasmas (designs with floating grid aperture alignment at the cluster level). Simulations conducted in this study show that the RPA design that enforces floating grid aperture alignment at the aperture level attains the best performance, although RPA designs that implement floating grid aperture alignment at the cluster level are more resilient to grid misalignment. Experimental characterization of the RPAs using an ion source and a helicon plasma source is consistent with expected performance and the literature. Plasmas with a Debye length as small as 50 µm were successfully characterized using the reported sensors, matching the performance of state-of-the-art RPAs manufactured via semiconductor microfabrication.",

    "abstract": "We describe how robocasting and carbonisation of partially dehydrated whey, a surplus of the dairy industry, produced 3D porous carbons with custom morphologies. A relatively simple printing device was first used to manufacture 3D structures of whey pastes. The whey pastes behaved as a thermoset polymer when heated hence keeping the original shape of the printed pieces upon carbonisation, albeit an isotropic size reduction (23%) due to thermal shrinkage. The rheological properties of the whey pastes were similar to those of other inks commonly used in direct ink writing, with a shear thinning behaviour and static and dynamic yield stresses that predicted their printability in most robocasting devices. Once the 3D whey structures were printed, a heat-curing process was required to avoid the uncontrolled emission of volatiles that would otherwise distort them. When doing so, 3D lattices of carbon filaments with ca. 500 µm in diameter and ca. 425 µm mesh size were manufactured. The ash content of the carbonised structures, which is related to the salt content of the original whey, was reduced by conventional washing procedures, bringing about 3D hierarchical porous carbons (70% porosity) with modest specific surface areas (500 m2/g) and relatively high compressive strengths (5 MPa).",

    "abstract": "The significant improvements made in additive manufacturing (AM) techniques since their beginnings, coupled with its intrinsic advantages, have resulted in a technology that stands out as most suitable for applications in leading sectors today. In addition to some of the properties of the parts, there are also some inherent aspects of AM techniques that hinder their applicability. In this respect, the application of calcium sulfate parts manufactured by binder jetting (BJ), as expendable casting elements, is limited by both the high quantity of volatile substances, due to the BJ process, and their low compression resistance. In this work, a novel part post-processing procedure is presented. This procedure consists of applying various heat treatments, in combination with a vacuum infiltration process using an Epsom salt solution. The procedure reduces the volatile content of BJ AM parts and enhances the compression strength with little modification to the part geometry. This post-processing substantially improves the applicability of BJ AM parts as expendable casting elements. After presenting this novel procedure and analyzing the significant enhancement of the properties of the AM calcium sulfate parts (i.e. permeability, the reduction of volatile content and reduction of compressive strength), a case study is presented with an expendable mold for aluminum casting. This procedure allows for a safer casting process, improves the part's surface quality and reduces the internal porosity of the cast parts.",

    "abstract": "Lasers used in standard metal Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) machines are focused at the build plane with typical beam diameters less than 100 µm. This results in millions of individual laser beam scanning vectors when fabricating complex metal parts, and in most build scenarios, the laser turns on and off at the beginning and end of each vector, respectively. The standard configuration for LPBF machines includes a laser beam steering system with two mirrors attached to galvanometers, called the scanner. Most commercial lasers have response times for beam power control below 10 µs yet acceleration/deceleration times of commercial scanners are an order of magnitude slower (due to the dynamics of the mechanical system). A common strategy for allowing the scanner to \"catch up\" with the commanded location and speed is to employ \"skywriting\" with additional built-in time delays to allow for the scanner to maintain constant velocity while the laser is on. These delays along with skywriting are intended to increase resolution and reduce defects, although the actions and times are typically not accessible by the user. In fact, the millions of laser on/off events result in additional sources for defect generation to include lack of fusion voids, keyhole voids, surface roughness, and spatter. Ultimately, this results in differences in part performance within builds (build location) and between LPBF platforms. Recent work has identified methods to eliminate some forms of laser on/off defects by controlling the laser power ramp rate. To the authors knowledge, laser power ramping is not currently implemented on any commercial LPBF machine, and the use of laser power ramping has yet to be evaluated on realistic, complex parts. As a result, the current work implemented laser power ramping on a commercial LPBF machine using a complicated geometry with 1,309,338 laser on/off events (vectors) to analyze the holistic impact of fabricating real parts on defects, mechanical properties, and spatter. Ramping the laser power over 300µs eliminated the formation of back spatter, and a demonstration build of a complex qualification test artifact using IN718 reduced total spatter by nearly 5%. However, this laser power ramp change over 300µs (i.e., linearly varying laser power from 0 W to the desired power set point over 300µs) increased lack of fusion defects near part edges that reduced the tensile ductility from 17% to 12% without affecting tensile strength. The research highlighted the financial challenges imposed when scrutinizing microsecond level interactions, and as a result, a low-cost method to identify minimum ramp rates to prevent back spatter using a smart phone and an optical microscope was demonstrated. Microsecond control over the laser must be accompanied by microsecond control of the scanner and the impacts must be quantified holistically over a variety of response variables to broadly apply the developments to industry applications.1",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a ray tracing model to simulate the laser-powder bed interaction for additive manufacturing processes. Ray tracing is a technique that is able to accurately and efficiently capture the interaction of light with multiple objects with complex geometries made of different materials. In the proposed methodology the laser energy distribution is modelled by a finite number of rays which are traced through the powder bed that is modelled as stacked spherical particles. The proposed ray tracing methodology addresses the reflection and refraction of light using the Fresnel equations and its absorption using a Beer–Lambert law. Simulations of a stationary laser on a powder bed show that for metallic materials the effect of polarisation of the light on the energy distribution in the powder bed is negligible. In addition, it is demonstrated that the refracted rays are fully absorbed by single powder particles. The illumination results of a stationary polarised laser under a range of incident angles indicate a significant absorption difference at high angles. In order to increase computational efficiency, a closed form relation for an equivalent homogenised volumetric laser heat source has been derived, whereby the shape and power profile of the laser matches the ray tracing results. Simulating single scan lines by varying power, spot size and speed demonstrates that the model accurately captures a moving laser in a DEM simulation, revealing the relations between single scan line dimensions and printer settings.",

    "abstract": "The design flexibility of Additive Manufacturing (AM) can be utilized to develop innovative and sustainable hot stamping tools with enhanced quenching capability compared to tools manufactured by conventional manufacturing processes. This study proposes a concept for hot stamping tools with integrated lattice structures that selectively substitute a die's solid areas. A lattice structure demonstrates reduced thermal mass and can affect the ability of the tool to absorb heat from the blank and the rate at which the tool is cooled between two consecutive stamping cycles. This study explores the design space of a hot stamping tool with integrated lattice structures. It presents the optimized design for an effective compromise between cooling performance, structural integrity, and several other design parameters shown in the study. The proposed method utilizes a 2D thermo-mechanical finite element analysis model of a single cooling channel combined with Design of Experiments (DoE) to reduce the computational cost. The results show that the integration of lattice structure cannot only deliver improved cooling performance with minimum change in the dimensions of the cooling system but also achieves a faster AM build time since less material is required to be printed.",

    "abstract": "Additively manufactured components often exhibit pronounced anisotropy due to the heterogeneous microstructure generated by the complex and repetitive thermal cycling history. Grain orientation is one of the determinant microstructural features that influences the activation of different deformation mechanisms. In this work, laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) was applied to fabricate Fe49.5Mn30Co10Cr10C0.5 interstitial-strengthened high entropy alloy (iHEA). Fabrication was performed at angles of 0° and 90° relative to the main laser scanning direction, and the plastic deformation behavior of these two oriented specimens was studied. The initial microstructure of the LPBF-built iHEA was composed of a complex heterogeneous columnar grains containing high-density dislocation network and a large number of stacking faults, as well as nano-precipitates and elemental segregation of Mn at subgrain boundaries. During uniaxial tension in-situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HE-SXRD) was performed to track the deformation processes and mechanisms of this metastable iHEA. The influence of different deformation mechanisms on the mechanical responses of the current LPBF-built iHEA was scrutinized combining in-situ HE-SXRD with electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses, which not only gives insights into the macrostructural evolution but also provides comprehensive characterization on microstructural responses and the orientation-dependent effects imposed by the fabrication constraints originally imposed. The implemented multiscale characterization revealed the presence of a strain-induced fcc to hcp phase transformation, which is influenced by the growth texture close to <110> along the building direction. Moreover, EBSD and TEM analysis of the fracture regions uncovered the formation of nanosized deformation twins, confirming the simultaneous activation of phase transformation- and twinning-induced plasticity (TRIP and TWIP) effects. The results obtained in this work gain new insights into orientation-dependent deformation behavior of additively manufactured iHEA, which facilitates the microstructural design when exploiting the TRIP/TWIP effects.",

    "abstract": "The metal vat photopolymerization technique (MVP) has high potential for metal part production because of its high accuracy, speed, and flexibility. However, low density, poor mechanical properties, and effects of sintering parameters on the properties are some of the challenges in MVP. This paper is the first to investigate the possibility of producing a NiTiCu metal alloy using VP from Ni, Ti, and Cu elemental and mechanically alloyed powders. The effect of particle size distribution and solid content on the physical and mechanical properties is also studied and compared. The results indicate that all three elements are homogeneously distributed in the whole print without premixing the powders, which considerably reduces processing time. Finer particle size and higher solid content also improve densification degree, hardness, flexural strength, and surface quality of the final parts. The measured surface roughness (Ra) of NiTiCu was 6.42 µm and 10.31 µm for milled and elemental powders, respectively. However, the mechanical properties of NiTiCu produced by VP in this study remain insufficient and in need of further improvement.",

    "abstract": "Topology optimization for weight reduction of additive manufacturing parts is commonly achieved throughout the creation of lattice structures, typically generated with beams of small size cross-section. In order to carry out accurate simulations of these lattice structures, knowing the mechanical behavior of pillars is required. In this paper, a methodology for determining the mechanical properties of small size pillars printed in PA-12 material, using polymer powder bed fusion (PBF) and in particular the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology, is presented. The effect of defects originated during the manufacturing process on the macroscopic mechanical properties is studied and the mechanisms which influence these properties are analyzed. A methodology for the determination of these properties is proposed, based on a successive correction of the printed nominal diameters according to two approaches; one due to the outer skin of unmelted material and the other due to internal melting defects. Once the material properties are determined, as a function of the cross-section of the lattice pillars, the numerical simulation of lattice-type structures has been carried out and the degree of adjustment of the proposed methodology has been experimentally verified, obtaining good results. This validation provides a reliable method for the simulation of the macroscopic behavior of lattice-type structures with reduced sizes, taking into account the intrinsic defects generated during the printing process.",

    "abstract": "Conventional grinding tools in orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery are solid in structure, leading to a limited amount of coolant that can reach the bone surgery zone, and therefore causing localized high-temperature-induced issues (infection, necrosis, and complications). Additive manufacturing allows the incomparable design and manufacturing freedoms and offers the opportunity to redesign the surgery tool to suppress the grinding temperature within a safe range. Here we present a hollow ceramic grinding tool enabled by additive manufacturing. Our CFD simulation and experiments have proved that, owing to the new design, the coolant can better reach the surgery zone, not only helping to restrict the heat accumulations, but also to remove excessive bone debris. In the in vivo test, we found that, the new design produced less apoptosis and edema area to the rat brain in comparison with the conventional tool. This design minimizes the occurrence of complications such as osteonecrosis due to high surgical temperatures, opening new opportunities for the development of orthopedic surgical tools using additive manufacturing technology.",

    "abstract": "While additive manufacturing of polymers, especially material extrusion-based methods such as fused filament fabrication, has become increasingly popular for design studies, rapid prototyping and the production of non-critical spare parts, its application in structurally loaded components is still scarce. One of the reasons for this might be scepticism of engineers due to the lack of knowledge regarding the expected lifetime and reliability of these components under stress. Therefore, it is necessary to find fast, easy and reliable ways to determine the expected lifetime of a component without the need to apply expensive full-scale component testing for every new part. To realise this, finite element analysis combined with fracture mechanical lifetime calculations can be applied. In this paper, crack growth kinetics of the commonly used material poly(lactic acid) have been utilised to estimate the lifetime of a component under complex loading conditions, namely fatigue and friction. The calculated lifetime, based on a damage tolerant fracture mechanics approach, was found to be in good agreement to the results of full-scale component tests, proving the applicability of the chosen approach. Applying this knowledge can vastly decrease the necessary time during component design and encourage the additive manufacturing community towards applying their components also in structurally loaded applications.",

    "abstract": "The successful synthesis of oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) alloys via laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) requires a better understanding of the interaction of the oxide dispersoids with the metallic melt pool. Here, a γ/γ'-strengthened Ni-8Cr-5.5Al-1Ti (wt%) model alloy is studied, as a simplified version of the commercial CM247LC alloy, by melting pre-alloyed powders in which 0.5–1 wt% Y2O3 nanoparticles were added via mechanical alloying. The Y2O3 nanoparticles follow three distinct paths. First, the strong affinity between Y2O3 and Al leads to the formation of Y4Al2O9 slag which floats on the melt pool; if in excess, the slag leads to vertically aligned mm-size cavities, preventing complete consolidation of the alloy. Second, a high number density of oxide nanodispersoids is distributed within the alloy's grain inducing a strong (100) texture and noticeably reduces grain size compared to the unmodified base alloy. Third, despite the high stability of Y2O3, the extreme temperatures achieved in the melt pool decompose some of the Y2O3 precipitates leading to the formation of Ni- and Y-rich particles (16 nm in radius) and Y segregation to the alloy's grain boundaries. The local composition on cracked grain boundaries is consistent with Ni17Y2 having an embrittling and liquation effect. Based on these results, the critical role of Al in reacting with oxide nanodispersoids during L-PBF manufacturing is discussed, and various types of potentially more successful dispersoids are suggested.",

    "abstract": "The sustained, independent advancements in additive manufacturing and magnetoelectric composites motivate the hybridization of these exciting technologies, as is the case in the current research study, leading to the fabrication of materials conducive to flexible and wearable electronic applications. The resulting additively manufactured composite materials exhibit tailorable mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties by adjusting the ratios of the photopolymer framework, electroactive polymer, and magnetic particles. Moreover, the outcomes of this research exemplify the process-property-performance interrelationship, hence providing a pathway to realizing deployable magnetoelectric devices. Several resin versions were synthesized and used to print various geometries using the digital light projection approach, including neat photopolymer and photopolymer/polyvinylidene difluoride with and without magnetic particles. The addition of magnetic particles did not substantially affect the mechanical performance of the composites, contrary to the expected results based on the rules of mixture. The insensitivity of the mechanical performance to the addition of magnetite particles was attributed to agglomeration, where the particles acted as pores rather than enforcements. Remarkably, the addition of merely 2% by weight of polyvinylidene difluoride improved the mechanical and magnetic properties of the composite samples by increasing ductility by 25% and magnetization by >160% compared to their PVDF-free counterparts. PVDF chains acted as a suspended network, preventing particle settling during printing and improving the distribution of the magnetic particles within the samples. The outcomes of this research highlight the opportunities and challenges of additively manufacturing magnetoelectric composite materials using digital light projection while primarily emphasizing the tailorability of the mechano-electro-magnetic properties.",

    "abstract": "Supersonic impact deformation-induced bonding is at the heart of the cold spray (CS) process, and therein lies the difficulty of clearly understanding CS behaviors. In this study, the supersonic impact-bonding behavior was systematically investigated by accurately reproducing the CS process using a newly developed material model (Ma-Wang material model) with 6061-T6 aluminum alloy (Al6061-T6) as the target material. First, the material properties of the Ma-Wang material model were identified using general flow stress data. Then, the high-fidelity modeling was fully confirmed by comparing the simulated and experimental coefficients of restitution and microparticle deformations over a wide range of impact velocities. More importantly, the rebound origin and bonding features of supersonic impacts between identical and dissimilar materials (Al6061-T6/Al6061-T6 and Al6061-T6/sapphire) were thoroughly explored, revealing that regardless of the substrate type, metallic plastic deformation is the main pathway for energy dissipation (dissipating approximately 90% of the energy). In addition, the rebound of metallic microparticles is highly dependent on the elastic recovery of the substrate. The difference is that during the supersonic impact between dissimilar materials, interfacial friction can be another important pathway for energy dissipation (dissipating approximately 10% of the energy). The coordinated deformation between microparticles and substrate favors supersonic impact-bonding. Further, the distinct features due to jetting and energy can be regarded as precursors to CS bonding.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the tailoring of calcium phosphate powders for their use as powder bed selective laser process feedstock. Hydroxyapatite and chlorapatite were used as starting powders for the preparation of different blends through the addition of graphite as a laser absorptance additive. A methodical study was conducted to compare the processing windows of the blends containing different amounts of graphite through the laser patterning of circular samples. It was found that the addition of graphite increases the process window of the powder blends being the powder without additive non processable. Hydroxyapatite showed a clear phase transition (decreased when using higher volumetric energy density) into other calcium phosphate phases while chlorapatite was demonstrated to be thermally stable during the whole process (examined through X-ray diffraction and vibrational spectroscopies). In parallel, the study evaluating the powder blend composed of hydroxyapatite and graphite for the production of solid and complex parts was carried out although it required long printing times. The productivity of the process was improved by modification of printing parameters. Then, a series of solid samples were produced for the analysis of the microstructure and mechanical properties. High interconnected porosity was observed in the samples which could improve the bioactivity of the bioceramic scaffolds. A post-treatment of the parts increased their proportion in the hydroxyapatite phase and their mechanical properties. These results are expected to contribute to the application of powder bed selective laser processing of calcium phosphates powders toward bone tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "Material extrusion is the most commonly used additive manufacturing process. However, currently it is mainly applied for the production of prototypes or simple jigs and fixtures due to issues with anisotropic material behavior. Diffusion and entanglement of the polymer chains is limited between the layers and among the infill lines within a layer of the usually thermoplastic material as it solidifies immediately after deposition. This results in weak bonding leading to a reduced load-bearing capacity. In this study, a thermosetting polymer is developed and presented. It enables cross-linking over the interfaces between the infill lines and layers during post-curing which resolves this issue. The formulation is based on a solid epoxy resin, allowing it to be processed in filament form and a latent curing agent preventing it from curing within the hotend and ensuring a suitable shelf life. To benchmark the newly developed material it is compared to casted and milled bulk specimens and 3D printed specimens with commercial thermoplastic filaments. Tensile tests and micrographs of the fracture surfaces prove the mechanical isotropy of the solid epoxy formulation. In addition, the material formulation is modified with single-walled carbon nanotubes to add electrical conductivity and allow functional 3D printing. Due to the high aspect ratio of the nanoparticles, a significantly lower filler content is necessary compared to the commercial materials. However, an electrical anisotropy is still observed as the material remains in a solid state during post-curing to retain its shape which limits the mobility of the nanoparticles and suppresses the agglomeration needed for conductive network formation after thorough dispersion. Proof of concept studies show that the functionalized material can be used in temperature and strain sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "Bio-inspired composites are a great promise for mimicking the extraordinary and highly efficient properties of natural materials. Recent developments in voxel-by-voxel 3D printing have enabled extreme levels of control over the material deposition, yielding complex micro-architected materials. However, design complexity, very large degrees of freedom, and limited computational resources make it a formidable challenge to find the optimal distribution of both hard and soft phases. To address this, a nonlinear coarse-graining approach is developed, where foam-based constitutive equations are used to predict the elastoplastic mechanical behavior of biomimetic composites. The proposed approach is validated by comparing coarse-grained finite element predictions against full-field strain distributions measured using digital image correlation. To evaluate the degree of coarse-graining on model accuracy, pre-notched specimens decorated with a binarized version of a renowned painting were modeled. Subsequently, coarse-graining is used to predict the fracture behavior of bio-inspired composites incorporating complex designs, such as functional gradients and hierarchical organizations. Finally, as a showcase of the proposed approach, the inverse coarse-graining is combined with a theoretical model of bone tissue adaptation to optimize the microarchitecture of a 3D-printed femur. The predicted properties were in exceptionally good agreement with the corresponding experimental results. Therefore, the coarse-graining method allows the design of advanced architected materials with tunable and predictable properties.",

    "abstract": "Process monitoring allows for unique opportunities to capture information at intermediate layers during fabrication for part qualification, but also to improve process robustness by identifying issues before yield or quality is reduced. An industrial-grade laser profilometer has been integrated for the first time in a commercial polymer laser sintering machine and used to monitor powder bed quality and potentially qualify parts during production. Powder layer quality was measured in different conditions and changed drastically as a function of recoating speed, preheating temperature but also particle shape. The effective layer thickness was obtained for the first time in PBF of polymers, and gradually increased with the layer count until reaching a plateau at the nominal layer thickness. Powder layer density could be calculated as well and lies between 34 and 65 %, depending on the powder type and layer count. Finally, curling increased with decreasing preheating temperature, ranging from 70 µm to 350 µm i.e. until collision with the recoater. Based on the measured degree of curling, mitigation strategies could be integrated using a closed-loop feedback control. Effective process monitoring such as the one provided with laser profilometry may enable the development of new materials featuring more complex processing conditions, but also larger machines where thermal uniformity might be an issue.",

In this study, FIM samples transitioning from stainless steel (SS) 316 L to Haynes 282 Ni-based superalloy were deposited via directed energy deposition (DED). The FIM samples were compared to baseline, homogeneous single-alloy deposited samples using digital image correlation during tensile testing, together with microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron backscattered diffraction, and thermodynamic modeling, to assess the performance of different co-deposition strategies. Each FIM sample exhibited a compositionally and microstructurally unique transition region from SS 316 L to Haynes 282, which was found to have implications on the strain localization across the transition region during uniaxial tensile loading. Finer step sizes in co-deposition were found to minimize strain localization by avoiding sharp compositional interfaces in the transition region.",

    "abstract": "The Additive Manufacturing (AM) industry is seeing a sustained and high rate of growth (average annual growth rate of 23.3% (2016–2019)), and applications are growing across all sectors. The ubiquitous nature of AM, and its ability to manufacture products simply from CAD data, has resulted in an undesirable side effect where the ability to manufacture fraudulent components and pass them off as authentic has become easier to achieve, with increased risk of the use of stolen intellectual property to produce counterfeit goods. Developing robust authentication methods is the focus of much research activity, which include the use overt (visible markers, such as hologram tags) and covert (concealed indicators such as laser etching or barcodes) technologies, but these are becoming increasingly easier to detect and reproduce and are therefore unreliable. Methods for authentication of AM products are thus required. This article investigates a novel method for authenticating material extrusion 3D printed semi-crystalline polymer parts, produced in polylactic acid (PLA) thermoplastic, to ensure supply chain integrity in the manufacturing industry. Two key process parameters (extrusion temperature and build plate temperature), and the material sampling position of the deposited material within the sample were varied to embed a target degree of crystallinity (φc) within the component, which could be extracted at any instance in the supply chain in a non-destructive manner. Samples were manufactured using a matrix of the three process parameters, and thermal history of the deposited material was collected using thermal imaging. φc for each sample was determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. A statistical analysis of the results, with extrusion temperature, build plate temperature and sample position as variables and φc as the dependent observable revealed that the position in the component at which the φc was measured produced the most significant effect on φc. The build plate temperature had the second most significant effect on the φc. Finally, the extruder temperature had a minor effect on φc. The analysis of experimental results led to a conclusion of the validity of the authentication method and the future work required as a result of the promising conclusion of this investigation.",

    "abstract": "Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) combines the utility and efficiency of simulations with experimentation to drive forward materials design and discovery. These physics-based and data-driven frameworks have enabled material advancement by querying the complex process–structure–property–performance relationships to inform and guide experiments for the cost-effective design of alloy systems. In this study, a proven computational framework is presented and applied towards the tailored design of additively manufactured (AM) high-temperature NiTiHf shape-memory alloy (SMA) parts. Specifically, the effort deploys a design tool to attain specific transformation temperatures by composition control through differential evaporation, which in turn depends on processing conditions. This framework consists of a fast-acting discrete source model to simulate thermal history, a multi-layer model to account for composition evolution across melt pools, and a differential evaporation model to evaluate Nickel loss throughout the fabrication process. Besides the development of this multi-model chain, proper quantification of model uncertainties is critical to an ICME approach for materials design. Addressing these concerns, the parameter calibration and uncertainty quantification (UQ) of hierarchical model components is conducted through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian approach over either the model itself or a representative Gaussian process-based surrogate model. These uncertainties are propagated across the models to the final response, i.e., martensitic start temperature. Subsequently, the hierarchical model framework is validated by comparing the experimental results with the most plausible values and uncertainty bounds obtained for the multi-model predictions at different processing conditions. From this calibrated and validated framework, process maps to streamline and illustrate the tailored design of AM high-temperature NiTiHf SMAs are developed, which demonstrates a promising path towards efficient design under uncertainty in additive manufacturing processes.",

    "abstract": "The thermal transport properties of the powder layer play a crucial role in the process of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). This paper introduces an in-situ measurement method utilizing active lock-in infrared thermography (LIT) to determine the thermal diffusivity and thickness of the powder layer. The proposed method exhibits great potential for accurate powder property and thickness measurements and real-time process monitoring. In this lock-in thermographic technique, the LPBF laser beam is directed through an optical diffuser and modulated into a square thermal wave. This thermal wave serves as an active heat source to heat the surface of the powder bed. The surface temperature response is captured using a long-wave infrared (LWIR) camera. A one-dimensional thermal model is employed to provide insights into heat transfer in the frequency domain. The frequency-dependent phase response of temperature is influenced by the effective thermal diffusivity and thickness of the powder layer. This model is validated experimentally first and then utilized to measure the thermal diffusivity of different powder layers created using various particle sizes and wiper spreading speeds. Larger particle size and slower wiper spreading speed are shown to produce higher thermal diffusivity. Finally, the paper shows how this technique can be used to measure the powder layer thickness over printed geometries. This capability enables the detection of deviations in the fused part surface or errors in the wiper through analysis of resulting variations in the powder. These findings highlight the potential of the lock-in thermographic technique for rapid in-situ inspection of the new powder layer in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processes.",

However, the comparison outcome strongly depends on data alignment accuracy, which is hindered by typical process-induced part deformations arising during and after production. This work presents a methodology that includes the modelling of part deformations for improving the alignment and comparison of in-process and post-process datasets. The methodology was successfully implemented, starting from deformations predicted by process simulations, and verified experimentally by producing samples including fiducials specifically designed to provide insights on local deformations. Results show an improved data alignment accuracy, which is fundamental for enabling the establishment of robust correlations aiding the reduction of false positives and false negatives in the in-process gathered signals. The approach is also found to be effective in accurately categorizing non-significant process signatures occurring during the fabrication, hence preventing the implementation of wrong corrective actions.",

Selecting a crosslinker weight percentage of 15%, optimization of the mechanical properties of the printed parts has been carried out through a variation of the formulation components, combining the crosslinker with 1 or 2 monofunctional monomers chosen from 2-hydroxy ethyl acrylate (HEA), PEGMEA, methacrylic acid (MAA) and 2-carboxyethyl acrylate (CEA), in different proportions. All the formulations were printable, and have allowed for modulating the mechanical properties of the printed parts, in terms of rigidity/flexibility and resistance. All printed parts have been shown to be sacrificial in basic water. Finally, a proof of concept has been carried out for its possible use as sacrificial molds, to obtain screws from a thermoplastic poly (ε-caprolactone) and from a silicone network, obtained respectively by heating and chemical crosslinking, followed by solubilisation in aqueous media.",

Guided by electron-matter-interaction simulations, we control the cross-linking thickness between 250 nm and 2 µm. The 3D prints contained up to 500 layers, and the voxel size is about 550-nm. In addition to more sustainable materials, our digital process complements two-photon lithography in three areas; (i) it is compatible with chemistry beyond photopolymers, (ii) we can print delicate suspended structures and tubes because our structures are not immersed in liquid resins that reside in cavities and destroy structures by interfacial forces, (iii) free-hanging structures are printed without sacrificial supports.

    "abstract": "The usefulness of semi-analytical thermal models for predicting the connection between process, microstructure and properties in powder bed fusion has been well illustrated in recent years. Such an approach provides predictions that are orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than numerical approaches. However, the opportunity to make predictions that span several orders of magnitude in space and time comes at the cost of significant simplifications, limiting fully quantitative predictions without empirical calibration. This approach relies on the solution to a linear problem meaning that first order non-linear effects induced by e.g. the temperature dependence of material properties and surface boundary conditions, are not incorporated. Here, we revisit these limitations and highlight ways that temperature varying material properties and radiative heat loss from the melt pool can be systematically accounted for without prior calibration. These corrections, made with an eye to minimizing additional computational overhead, bring the technique's predictive capability much closer to that of higher fidelity thermal simulations without a significant computational cost. Quantitative comparisons to experiments are used to illustrate the important impact of including such corrections.",

In fact, the control of the epoxy-functionalized surface enables the formation of active surfaces, and this study employs supported Ionic Liquids with catalytic properties as a proof of concept. Ionic liquids (ILs) and polymeric derivatives represent a promising path to generate multifunctional complex 3D structures, playing advanced roles in multiple applications. The fine-tuning of the functionalization methodology and formulation enhances the resolution of acrylate-based resins, allowing the production of highly detailed structures that can significantly boost catalytic efficiency. Through a comparison with commercial resins, the developed formulation demonstrates superior resolution capabilities, positioning it as an effective alternative for use in vat photopolymerization technologies. Additionally, controlling the level of functionalization and accessibility of the ILs' active sites through the control of the surface area of the reactor has led to improved process performance in terms of yield and space-time yield (STY) in the CO2 cycloaddition to epoxide reaction.",

    "abstract": "Powder bed fusion processes are nowadays able to manufacture parts with a high geometric complexity. However, it is still challenging to realize these complex geometries defect-free as well as with homogeneous properties using classic line-based melting strategies. Electron beam powder bed fusion offers the promising opportunity to achieve this goal by spot melting, i.e., jumping from melt spot to melt spot with a very high velocity. The fundamental idea is, that homogeneous properties result, if all melt spots are independent from each other regarding their thermal history. The corresponding sequence of melt spots controls the temperature field and thus the microstructure leading to the mechanical properties. The main challenge is to develop a spot melting sequence resulting in independent spots while ensuring other process restrictions, like machine dependent jump lengths. In this contribution, a new heuristic algorithm to generate a spot melting sequence is developed. It bases on the subdivision of complex geometries into consecutively melted groups. The groups are transformed into graphs, connecting the spots inside the groups with all possible jumps meeting certain machine restrictions. A heuristic algorithm to identify Hamiltonian cycles is adapted to determine the final spot melting sequence. We demonstrate the applicability of the heuristic algorithm on complex geometries by one layer of a fuel nozzle combined with temperature simulations.",

    "abstract": "In metal additive manufacturing (AM), fast and efficient simulation approaches are essential to explore the full potential of these promising processes, particularly in generating components with tailored microstructures via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF).Due to the inherent multiscale nature of LPBF, existing approaches often need to resort to strong simplifications, such as layer-wise heating models, to make part-scale simulations feasible.In contrast, the present article proposes a scan-resolved approach, which consistently resolves the laser scan path in a coupled thermo-microstructural model of LPBF.Building on a high-performance computing model for the thermal problem, we propose a highly efficient implementation of a recently developed microstructure model for Ti-6Al-4V with three main constituents: stable -phase, martensitic -phase and -phase.The implementation is tailored to modern hardware features using vectorization and fast approximations of transcendental functions.A performance model and selected numerical examples of LPBF manufacturing of parts on the centimeter scale are studied to verify the high degree of optimization.Depending on the specific example, results were obtained with moderate computational resources in a few hours to days.We demonstrate how the proposed scan-resolved model allows us to predict the correlation between scan strategy and resulting microstructure composition, an aspect that layer-wise heating models cannot capture.The numerical examples include scan-resolved thermo-microstructure simulations of the full NIST AM Benchmark cantilever specimen.It is shown that varying the build plate temperature by only 100 K can significantly change the microstructure composition from -to -dominated.",

    "abstract": "The predominant technique for producing 3D-printed structures of nanocellulose involves freeze-drying despite its drawbacks in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint. This study explores the less-energy-intensive drying approach by leveraging the valorization of forest residual streams. We utilized wood flour and Kraft lignin as fillers to facilitate room-temperature drying of the nanocellulose-based 3D printed structures. Various ink formulations, integrating cellulose nanofibers, wood flour, and lignin, were tested for direct ink writing (DIW). The formulations exhibited shear-thinning behavior and distinct yield stress with rising stress levels, ensuring the effective flow of the ink during DIW. Consequently, multilayered objects were printed with high shape fidelity and precise dimensions. Lignin and wood flour prevented structural collapse upon room-temperature drying. A reduced shrinkage was observed with the addition of lignin in freeze and room temperature drying. Moreover, the room-temperature dried samples were denser and demonstrated significantly higher resistance to applied compressive force, surpassing those reported for cellulose-based 3D composites in the existing literature. Remarkably, the trade-off effects of lignin are highlighted in terms of efficient stress-distributing and micro-scale sliding, enabling better strength. Along with wood flour, it further increases thermal stability. However, lignin hinders the hierarchical porous structure, the main ion transportation channels, reducing the double-layer capacitance of the carbonized structures. Overall, the results underscore the potential of all-biobased formulations for DIW for practical applications, highlighting their enhanced mechanical properties and structural integrity via the more sustainable drying method.",

    "abstract": "Laser-based powder bed fusion has the potential to enable manufacturing of local material properties and locally varying alloys. One promising approach under research is shaping of the applied laser beam. The current commercial standard using a Gaussian laser beam profile is associated with a high energy intensity peak and strong gradients. A potential alternative beam shape is the point-ring profile where laser energy is distributed between a central spot and an outer ring. We conduct a numerical study of beam shape impact on melt-pool shapes, surface temperatures, evaporation and flow dynamics of single-melt-tracks. To that end, we apply a Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics solver coupled with a ray-tracing laser scheme. A point-ring profile is compared to a standard Gaussian profile. The profiles are studied at two different beam sizes to find the influence of beam size on the shape effect. We find good agreement between numerical results and experimental data for both narrow and deep, as well as wide and shallow melt-tracks. The simulation results show that beam size and thus energy density influence the effect beam-shaping has on the melt-pool dynamics. Both the distribution of evaporation and surface tension forces over the melt-pool surface are found to depend on the used beam shape. The study highlights the importance of distinguishing between size and shape effects when investigating laser beam shapes. Both energy density and its distribution need to be tuned for the desired melt-pool behavior.",

    "abstract": "Binder jet printed components typically have low overall density in the green state and high shrinkage and deformation after heat treatment. It has previously been demonstrated that, by including nanoparticles of the same material in the binder, these properties can be improved as the nanoparticles can fill the interstices and pore throats between the bed particles. The beneficial effects from using these additive binder particles can be improved by maximising the binder particle size, enabling the space within the powder bed to be filled with a higher packing efficiency. The selection of maximum particle size for a binder requires detailed knowledge of the pores and pore throats between the powder bed particles. In this paper, a raindrop model is used to determine the critical radius at which binder particles can pass between pores and penetrate the bed. The model is validated against helium psychometry measurements and binder particle drop tests. It is found that the critical radius can be predicted, with acceptable accuracy, using a linear function of the mean and standard deviation of the particle radii. Percolation theory concepts have been employed in order to generalise the results for powder beds that have different mean particle sizes and size distributions. The results of this work can be employed to inform the selection of particle sizes required for binder formulations, to optimise density and reduce shrinkage in printed binder jet components.",

Microtensile testing is providing a wealth of information on these local property variations. Here we utilize spatial autocorrelation techniques to show autocorrelation of grain sizes and mechanical properties with build height in a specially-designed, additively manufactured AlSi10Mg part. This result suggests that, at least in some cases, an interplay between local part geometry and the fabrication process occurs that affects local mechanical properties.",

However, efficient 3D arrangement and wire routing of circuits for seamless integration into the printing process requires the support of appropriate design software. In this paper, we introduce an approach to integrate the wire routing into the slicing software for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). This allows us to consider process parameters for each specific print, e.g. extrusion width, layer thickness or shell thickness. The volumetric object model is first converted into a graph data structure which is then used to apply a routing algorithm. The resulting G-code with embedded wires can be directly executed by the printer. The G-code also includes instructions for a pick and place system to automatically produce the entire object, including electronic components, without operator intervention.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) methods such as Aerosol Jet (AJ) printing allow the fabrication of structures via sintering of micro and/or nanoparticles, leading to microstructures that consist of various combinations of pore and grain sizes. It has been reported that AJ printed and sintered silver micropillars show an unusual behavior of high stiffness and high strain-to-failure for structures with high porosity and vice versa (Saleh et al. 2018 [1]). This behavior, however, is accompanied by the stiffer structures having smaller grain sizes and softer structures having larger grain sizes. To explain the physics of this behavior where a trade-off between hardening caused by size effects (grain refinement and gradients) and softening caused by porosity is expected to play a critical role, a multi-scale modeling approach is proposed in this paper. The model formulation consists of a continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD) framework, coupled with continuum plasticity and finite element analysis. The dislocation dynamics formulation is introduced into a user material subroutine and coupled with a finite element commercial solver, in this case, LS-DYNA, to solve the model in three-dimensional scale with the same size as the AM micropillars. The results from the model capture the general trends observed in compression tests of AM micropillars. In particular, it is shown that the grain size and dislocation density have a disproportionately higher influence over the mechanical deformation of metallic structures when compared to the porosity. These results show that the behavior of AM structures in the plastic regime is dominated by grain size effects rather than porosity. Some limitations of the model and possible future refinements are discussed. The paper provides an important analytical framework to model the mechanical behavior of AM structures with internal porosity in the plastic regime.",

    "abstract": "Thermal expansion plays an important role during additive manufacturing by electron beam powder bed fusion because it strongly affects the quality of the manufactured parts. However, prediction and control of thermal expansion is a difficult task due to the high complexity of part geometries and the corresponding temperature distribution. Therefore, powerful process monitoring tools are required to improve insight into the process. In the current study, the capabilities of in-situ acquisition of electron optical images are assessed with respect to measurement of thermal expansion. For this purpose, a large series of electron-optical images was recorded during cooling down of a PBF-EB build job. The subsequent image analysis revealed that the image quality is high enough to monitor thermal shrinkage of the part and to quantify thermal strain with remarkable accuracy. These findings are very promising and give rise to new applications of in-situ electron-optical observation with regard to temperature management and validation of numerical frameworks.",

    "abstract": "A novel approach for down-selection of a repaired support structure design produced using Laser Blown Powder – Direct Energy Deposition (LBP-DED) and filled with interstitial Ni-Al powder (∼0.75 area fraction) in a turbine segment was investigated. Simulation of flattening and un-flattening of the segment with implications to degradation of the support structure was quantified using a four-point bend test to identify the role of axial Young's modulus in out-of-plane flexure. Two markedly different LBP additive structures; Diamond Lattice (DL) - nodal and Continuous Path (CP) – non-nodal, were produced and compared with the un-repaired condition. At room temperature, the forward and rear walls and internal nodes of the original equipment (OE) and DL support structures were found to contribute significantly to the Young's modulus, with significantly reduced stiffness observed in the CP structures. Oxidation plays a key role in the development of internal compressive stresses within the abradable, with a two-fold increase in elastic modulus in the CP structure, but a smaller increase occurred in OE and DL support structures. A decrease in elastic modulus and concomitant increase in radius of curvature (flattening) occurred with an increasing number of flexural cycles. Cracking is most prominent in the nodal design within the front and rear walls and cracks propagate either to the surface or towards the base of the abradable lattice. No such degradation was observed for equivalent flexural cycles in the original and CP support structures, even up to a significant number of cycles. A criterion for catastrophic failure of the abradable was deduced from a steep decrease in flexural elastic modulus accompanied with a marked change in curvature. A non-nodal design support structure is optimum to counter in- service flattening/un-flattening.",

    "abstract": "Laser Powder Bed Fusion has become a widely adopted method for metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) due to its ability to mass produce complex parts with increased local control. However, AM produced parts can be subject to undesirable porosity, negatively influencing the properties of printed components. Thus, controlling porosity is integral for creating effective parts. A precise understanding of the porosity distribution is crucial for accurately simulating potential fatigue and failure zones. Previous research on generating synthetic porous microstructures have succeeded in generating parts with high density, isotropic porosity distributions but are often inapplicable to cases with sparser, boundary-dependent pore distributions. Our work bridges this gap by providing a method that considers these constraints by deconstructing the generation problem into its constitutive parts. A framework is introduced that combines Generative Adversarial Networks with Mallat Scattering Transform-based autocorrelation methods to construct novel realizations of the individual pore geometries and surface roughness, then stochastically reconstruct them to form realizations of a porous printed part. The generated parts are compared to the existing experimental porosity distributions based on statistical and dimensional metrics, such as nearest neighbor distances, pore volumes, pore anisotropies and scattering transform based auto-correlations.",

    "abstract": "For the broader industrial usage of metal additive manufactured parts, especially made by laser powder bed fusion, a better prediction and understanding of the warpage and of eigenstresses within the final part are necessary. Due to the diverse and sophisticated metallurgical and thermal processes during production, physically motivated simulations are rather complex and time consuming. Therefore, various simplifications concerning the process and material models are frequently made, which leads to practicable simulation times at the expense of physical accuracy. This motivates the procedure in this contribution: A multiscale approach combining various modelling levels, in particular regarding the heat source and material model. The model is based on three finite element simulations on different levels and with different specific aims, i.e. the laser scan model, the layer hatch model and the part model. For the smallest scale considered, a sophisticated thermomechanically fully coupled model based on a phase transformation model explicitly considering the powder, molten, and re-solidified material is incorporated. The goal of this detailed simulation is to extract an effective heat source for the next level of simulation, i.e. the layer hatch model. The layer hatch model is used to extract the inherent strains for the part model. With these strains, the remaining deformation and eigenstresses of arbitrary large parts with the same material and laser parameters can be efficiently and directly computed. The capabilities of the present framework are investigated by simulations on the behaviour of a twin cantilever beam, where the effect of different process parameters on the overall material and structural response is carried out.",

    "abstract": "Anisotropy in dielectric properties can have deleterious effects in structures intended for use in high-field environments. We show that dielectric anisotropy is introduced into parts fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques based on the orientation in which the part is printed. Dielectric strength testing data, based on the ASTM D149 standard, are presented for samples fabricated using the polymer jetting (PolyJet), stereolithography (SLA), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and selective laser sintering (SLS) additive manufacturing techniques. Each unique printing direction available, based on the printing method, was examined in turn. Each printing technique was found to introduce anisotropic dielectric properties within the sample coupons that were a function of the original orientation in which the part was printed, and the direction of structural susceptibility was found to be print-method dependent. Differences in dielectric strength for coupons printed in different orientations were found to exceed 70% for some combinations of printing technique and polymer. Overall, test coupons printed with stereolithography (SLA) were found to exhibit the lowest degree of dielectric strength anisotropy between print orientations. Dielectric failure mechanisms are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing is capable of producing highly complex and personalised products. However, innovation in both material science and processing is required to achieve the performance, reliability and miniaturization of modern mass-produced electronic systems. This article presents a new digital fabrication strategy that combines 3D printing of high-performance polymers (polyetherimide) with light-based selective metallisation of copper traces through chemical modification of the polymer surface, and computer-controlled assembly of functional devices and structures. Using this approach, precise and robust conductive circuitry is fabricated across flexible and conformal surfaces omitting the need to connect and assemble separate circuits. To show how this process is compatible with existing electronic packaging techniques a range of modern components are solder surface mount assembled to selectively metalized bond pads. To highlight the potential applications stemming from this new capability, high frequency wireless communications, inductive powering and positional sensing demonstrators are manufactured and characterised. Furthermore, the incorporation of actuation is achieved through selective heating of shape memory alloys with a view towards routes towards folding and deployable 3D electronic systems. The results in this paper show how this process provides the required mechanical, electrical, thermal and electromagnetic properties for future real-world applications in the field of robotics, medicine, and wearable technologies.",

Conductors deposited via microsputtering promise significantly improved electrical conductivity over traditional extrusion ink-based methods. This study investigates, via a design of experiments, the deposits created by a 3D printer-compatible write head that encompasses an atmospheric-pressure gold microsputterer with strong coaxial gas flow. In addition to attaining 1 nm/s deposition rates—on par with traditional (i.e., vacuum) sputtering, the microplasma sputterer creates ~100 nm-thick gold films with near-bulk electrical resistivity (down to 2.9 µΩ cm, i.e., 120% the bulk value) and excellent adhesion—without employing an adhesion layer, annealing, or any other pre/post-processing steps. It is concluded that the strong gas flow promotes the formation of nanoparticles in the plasma plume out of the originally microsputtered gold atoms, which in turn, deposit and create films with excellent adhesion and conductivity.",

We propose a process for handling and additively manufacturing powders that functions independently of the gravitational environment and with no restriction on feedstock powder flowability. Based on a specific sequence of boundary loads applied to the granular packing, powder is transported to the printing zone, homogenized and put under compression to increase the density of the final part. The powder deposition process is validated by simulations that show the homogeneity and density of deposition to be insensitive to gravity and cohesion forces within the DEM model. We further provide an experimental proof of concept of the process by successfully 3D printing parts on-ground and in weightlessness, on parabolic flight. Powders exhibiting high and low flowability are used as model feedstock material to demonstrate the versatility of the process, opening the way for additive manufacturing of recycled material.",

    "abstract": "Extrusion-based 3D printing of hexagonal and lamellar lyotropic liquid crystals is a powerful technique to produce hierarchical materials with well-defined anisotropic structure. Tailoring the properties of 3D printed objects requires a precise control of the nanostructure; however, a sufficiently high degree of anisotropy is often not achieved. In this study, scanning small angle X-ray scattering was performed in situ at the exit of the needle during 3D printing. We study the induced anisotropy and nanostructure in hexagonal and lamellar lyotropic liquid crystals. Mapping of extruded filaments during printing revealed that narrower nozzle diameters (370 µm) resulted in less anisotropic structures with a wider distribution of orientation angles across the cross section, while larger nozzle diameters (550 µm) resulted in more anisotropic structures with an overall higher degree of orientation. The apparent wall shear rate is higher for the narrower nozzle, which produces wall slip, resulting in a highly anisotropic shell, and a less aligned filament core. Further examination of the filaments revealed phase transitions due to solvent evaporation. The time scales were of 10–20 min of exposure to atmospheric conditions. Simultaneously, a loss in the macroscopic anisotropy of the hexagonal self-assembled structure was observed. These processes occur during and after extrusion-based 3D printing of liquid crystals and limit the fine control of the final structure. The variability of structures achieved for our different systems highlights the importance of structural characterization during and after extrusion to guarantee high anisotropy and well-defined structures.",

Test results for in-plane shear properties of fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs) are generally obtained with methods that generate multiaxial stress states, and no simple shear response is measured. In this paper, the in plane torsion test method is applied to additively manufactured (AM) continuous FRPs. With this method, planar simple shear loading is achieved for a dedicated, spiral lay-up of the AM specimen. Using digital image correlation, surface strains were obtained for an observed section of the specimen, and shear stress–strain curves were extracted for fibre bundles, co-extruded thermoplastic material, and the composite of both. Shear stiffness and shear strength values are yielded for representative surface areas. Furthermore, the fracture behaviour in shear is discussed. The co-extruded thermoplastic filler material is shown to be the phase where cracks progress is most likely, however as some fibre bundles are split, these can be bridged by the crack. In conclusion, the method is well suited for determination of shear properties of AM continuous FRP material, giving consistent results for the test sample.",

    "abstract": "A method is presented, using Fe3O4 nanoparticles hybridized with hollow carbon nanofibers (Fe3O4NP@CNF) as an example, to add functionality to polymer powders for powder bed fusion with laser beam (PBF/LB-P). There are currently only a small number of polymers that can be processed successfully and reliably by PBF/LB-P. It was proposed that coating PA12 powder, a material that has a good track record in laser sintering, with a small amount (0.1 wt%) of Fe3O4@CNF would provide a new material with additional functionality without affecting the processability of the PA12 powder, since the Fe3O4 is contained within the CNF. Commercial PBF/LB-P PA12 particles were coated with Fe3O4@CNF without altering the morphology of the powder particles. No significant reduction in the PBF/LB-P processing window was observed when processing the resulting polymer nanocomposites, and parts were produced with comparable mechanical properties to the base polymer. Interestingly, magnetic investigations of PBF/LB-P cylinders built in three different orientations, with alignment of the long symmetry axis along the X, Y or Z axes of the build chamber, showed a preferential orientation of the hybridized magnetic fibers along the Z-axes in the composite. This suggests the appealing possibility of tailoring pieces with preferential magnetic orientation. Moreover, no agglomeration or nanoparticle growth was observed after PBF/LB-P. It is proposed that the low-cost method used in this work could be easily applied to other nanoparticles, without creating restrictive processing windows and the time-consuming process to determine them. Thus, a range of powders with additional functionality could be easily created for use in a variety of applications and industries.",

    "abstract": "Material jetting is a key additive manufacturing technology to enable the production of microscale components, but its application is limited by susceptibility to deviations from intended design and performance. The main challenge remains in producing accurate and functional parts in a reproducible and timely manner, particularly for fine featured geometries. Existing frameworks to mitigate part deviations are based on computationally expensive physics-based simulations, but little attention has been paid to techniques suitable for high-throughput conditions. Here we develop and validate an inverse problem framework which facilitates predicting the morphology of printed features with a Shape from Shading (SFS) photometric technique coupled with the rapid optimisation of process parameters to enhance the quality of the product. The framework incorporates the critical printing parameters including drop spacing, printing frequency and standoff distance such that we are able to build the morphology of complex patterns with an error percentage less than 10 % in seconds. The inverse problem framework is highly versatile since it can be utilized in conjunction with computer vision algorithms for accurate in-situ inspection of printed features and to find the optimal printing parameters for freeform patterns considering different materials and substrates or even other AM technologies to improve the quality of printed parts in a timely manner.",

    "abstract": "This study demonstrates that refinement of the prior-β grains generated during the wire-direct energy deposition of Ti-6Al-4V is achievable whilst maintaining a stable processing condition in the as-deposited condition, not reliant on penetration of the feedstock to the melt pool. Previous studies on prior-β grain refinement of Ti-6Al-4V have been reliant on either post-processing, alloy modification or agitation of the melt pool to achieve refinement. Through process control alone, it was identified that an increase in the deposition rate for a fixed energy input led to a reduction in the specific energy density of deposited material. Utilising pyrometry, it was determined that the reduction in the specific energy density led to a decrease in the thermal gradient, measured using a linear thermal gradient approximation, encouraging apparent homogenous nucleation within the melt pool. Whilst maintaining a stable ‘droplet’ transfer mode, the gradual reduction in specific energy density transformed the grain structure from the typical columnar morphology through a mixed morphology to an equiaxed grain morphology; confirmed via prior-β grain reconstructions and inverse pole figure analysis made possible by electron back scattered diffraction microscopy of the deposited samples. Microhardness measurements demonstrated larger variations in the refined prior-β grain specimens as compared to the columnar as a result of more complex α morphologies generated.",

    "abstract": "In this research, a 3D numerical thermal cavity radiation model was developed to predict the evolution of the macroscale thermal field within the build chamber of a commercial EB-PBF system. The model was applied to predict the evolution of the thermal field in a component during fabrication. A combination of quantitative and qualitative data extracted from an ARCAM Q20Plus machine was used to validate the model. The results indicate that the portion of heat transferred to the inner Heat Shield via cavity radiation was a strong function of the Start Plate's temperature, reaching 88% of the total heat input at a peak temperature of ~725 °C. Once validated, the thermal model was used to analyse heat transport within the build chamber during the fabrication of a component. The outcomes revealed variability in temperature within the hexagonal base, up to 118 °C, and the powder bed below the platform of 107 °C. Moreover, substantial temperature variations exceeding 200 °C were identified within the component, specifically between the hexagonal base and the platform.",

    "abstract": "Polymer Laser Sintering (LS) is a well-known Additive Manufacturing process, capable of producing highly complex geometries with little or no cost penalty. However, the restricted range of materials currently available for this process has limited its applications. Whilst it is common to modify the properties of standard LS polymers with the inclusion of fillers e.g. nanoclays, achieving effective dispersions can be difficult. The work presented here investigates the use of plasma treatment as a method of enhancing dispersion with an expectation of improving consistency and surface quality of laser sintered nanocomposite parts. To enable the preparation of polyamide 12 nanocomposite powder for applications in LS, plasma surface modification using Low Pressure Air Plasma Treatment was carried out on two nanoclays: Cloisite 30B (C30B) and Nanomer I.34TCN (I.34TCN). Plasma treatment strongly reduced the aggregation of the nanoclay (C30B and I.34TCN) particles, and powders displayed higher decomposition temperatures than those without plasma treatment. LS parts from neat polyamide 12, untreated I.34TCN and plasma treated I.34TCN composites were successfully produced with different complex shapes. The presence of well dispersed plasma treated nanoclays was observed and found to be essential for an improved surface quality of LS fabricated which was achieved only for plasma treated I.34TCN. Likewise, some mechanical properties could be improved above that of PA12 by incorporation of treated I.34TCN. For example, the elastic modulus of plasma treated composites was higher than that of polyamide 12 and the untreated composite. In the case of the ultimate strain, the plasma treated composite performed better than untreated and results had a reduced variation between samples. This illustrates the feasibility of the use of plasma treatments on nanoclays to improve the properties of LS parts, even though further studies will be required to exploit the full potential.",

    "abstract": "Multi Jet Fusion™ (MJF) is a new proprietary form of Additive Manufacturing (AM) from Hewlett Packard (HP) developed to manufacture structures with design and functional complexity while simultaneously providing a dramatic increase in the production rate relative to other forms of polymer-based AM. The increased rate is now enabling more efficient production of mid-volume products, and coupled with the additional benefits of geometric freedom, the technology is particularly well suited for the fabrication of complex manifold gas delivery systems. This paper describes a comprehensive study to evaluate the utility of MJF structures for maintaining pressures under static and dynamic conditions. The static pressure and gas confinement was applied to cylindrical structures at 345 and 689 kPa and pressure drops were measured in real-time. Similarly, fatigue pressure testing was performed for 105 cycles under 1724 kPa, and the cylinders demonstrated to be effective at maintaining a constant pressure under both ambient and high temperature (90 °C) conditions. Additional analyses relevant to the automotive industry were performed and included (a) gas permeation testing conducted with oxygen and carbon dioxide gas to study the gas storage performance on printed Polyamide-12 and (b) an oil chemical exposure experiment was performed to investigate mechanical performance degradation.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) of Ti-6Al-4V enables rapid fabrication of complex parts, including porous lattices which are of interest for aerospace, automotive, or biomedical applications, however currently the fatigue resistance of these materials is a critical limitation. Engineering the alloy microstructure provides a promising method for increasing fatigue strength, but conventional heat treatment procedures are known to produce atypical results for AM and porous samples, and must therefore be optimised for these materials. Using vacuum heat treatment, microstructures comparable to those observed for conventional wrought and heat treated alloys were achieved with porous AM Ti-6Al-4V. Fine lamellar microstructures were produced using sub-transus heat treatment at 920 °C, while coarse lamellar microstructures were produced using super-transus heat treatment at 1050 °C or 1200 °C. Increasing the heat treatment temperature increased the elastic modulus from 2552 ± 22 MPa to a maximum of 2968 ± 45 MPa, due to strut sintering increasing the effective strut thickness, and removal of prior β-grain orientation. Heat treatment eliminated the brittle α' martensite phase in favour of an α + β mixture, where the phase boundaries and β-phase provide greater resistance to crack propagation. Super-transus heat treatments increased the α-lath size which typically reduces crack propagation resistance, however strut sintering reduced surface crack initiation sites, increasing the fatigue strength by 75% from 4.86 MPa for the as-built material to a maximum of 8.51 MPa after 1200 °C heat treatment. This work demonstrates that vacuum heat treatment is effective at tuning the micro- and macro-structure of porous AM Ti-6Al-4V, thereby improving the crucial fatigue resistance.",

Consequently, simulating the microstructure becomes challenging, making it difficult to optimize the process and predict the mechanical properties of an additive-manufactured part. In this work, a framework is developed, including several sequentially applied methods to obtain increasingly accurate information about the microstructure resulting from a wire deposition process. This framework is based on understanding experimental data and utilizing them as inputs to simplify the problem or accelerate numerical simulations. The experimental inputs consist of light optical images, SEM, and EBSD images.

    "abstract": "Rapid prototyping is an essential part of today's research and development process. The ability to produce objects quickly, cost-effectively and on-site is critical to meeting this fundamental requirement. One of the factors that leads to inconsistencies and defects in the produced parts is the uncompensated change in material properties used in the material extrusion 3D printing manufacturing process. This creates the need for a real-time, low-cost filament quality monitor that can characterise the material properties of the filament along its length. This can be achieved by tracking the variation in measured capacitive tube capacitance and diameter of different sensor types over multiple selected axes and encoding the results to a specific fragment of filament used in material extrusion 3D printing. With such collected data it is possible to monitor factors such as material moisture, roundness, internal and external defects, component proportions, relative electrical permeability, Poisson's ratio and material type. This work presents the first proof of concept of such a device and describes its operating principle in detail. As examples of applications, filament material type recognition is presented based on the characteristics of several types of filaments from different manufacturers, the process of moisture absorption over time for selected filaments is described, and the detection of defects of varying degrees is shown.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on how spatter particles are transported within a laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) machine. The machine's gas flow rate and salient flow features are studied with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and are validated with experimental measurements of the flow near the build plate. The CFD model is also paired with a discrete phase model (DPM) to show how a spatter particle's diameter, speed, ejection angle, material, and ejection location each affect its trajectory. The spatter model results are also validated by experiments wherein hot spatter particles are identified with an infrared camera. Overall, this work brings focus to several spatter-mitigation strategies including increasing gas flow rate, controlling spatter production through laser settings, and changing part placement. Throughout the infrared experiment's single build cycle, over 14 million spatter particles were detected, contaminating both the parts and the powder bed. Both the spatter model and experiment suggest that spatter particles travel primarily in the downstream direction. This suggests that placing parts next to one another instead of downstream from one another could be a strategy to prevent spatter particles from traveling between parts. A low-speed zone is also discovered beneath the lower nozzle and is predicted to negatively alter the removal of spatter from that region of the build area.",

    "abstract": "Numerous existing and emerging microsize technologies operate by utilizing electrical circuits on surfaces and within solid objects, i.e., external and internal electrodes, respectively. While current micropatterning techniques have achieved extensive progress on current systems via pattern resolution and discretization on simple surfaces, the introduction of new applications relies on the complexity of the parts on which these patterns are fabricated. Additionally, many state-of-the-art applications utilize novel materials for functional systems, which further complicates their fabrication. This paper introduces innovative electrode micropatterning and microchannel filling approaches that support complex 3D designs and reduce the number of fabrication steps. The approaches leverage microsize hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphologies fabricated using the two-photon polymerization (2PP) additive manufacturing (AM) process, in conjunction with the target part. Once fabricated, the part is dipped into a conductive solution or other functional liquids, forming patterns on the surfaces and filling the channels based on the pre-designed wetting morphologies. These morphologies incorporate additional structures beyond the conventional hydrophilic and reentrant hydrophobic structures to facilitate the dipping process. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of the tunable electrode micropatterning approach to fabricate various microsystems utilizing 2PP, wetting morphologies, and the developed dipping process.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic materials yields distinctive hierarchical and heterogeneous microstructures owing to the complex thermal conditions during the build-up process. Consequently, the knowledge gained from creep properties of conventionally manufactured (CM) Ni-based alloys cannot be directly applied to AM-processed alloys. Furthermore, insufficient creep life has posed a significant challenge in the development of Ni-based superalloys fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), one of the most important AM techniques. Nevertheless, limited research has been conducted to understand their creep behavior due to the time-consuming nature of creep testing and extended research cycles. This study delves into investigating the creep behavior of an additively manufactured, precipitation-strengthened Ni-based alloy (NiCrAl) in comparison to its CM counterpart, focusing on the structure-property relationships. Constant-load creep tests were conducted at temperatures of 750 °C and 950 °C up to a maximum duration of nearly 1500 h. Although both the AM and CM states demonstrated high creep activation energy and creep exponents, indicative of a dislocation climb mechanism, the AM state demonstrated inferior creep life and ductility compared to the CM state for creep times below 500 h. To gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms, multi-scale microstructural characterization was performed to understand the effect of the AM-inherent microstructure. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the creep behavior of Alloy 699XA after AM and CM processes, emphasizing the significance of AM-specific microstructural heterogeneities.",

Machine learning-based methods may enhance reliability, but are often themselves insufficiently reliable for use in production. Foundation artificial intelligence models have enabled significant improvements in performance across many tasks. Here, a vision-based control system is reported, coupling active learning and uncertainty awareness with a foundation model to continually learn to build a specific part better. The resulting framework is called Iterative Learning, as it improves performance by learning from its own errors during repeated build cycles of the same part. The iterative learning approach is shown to enable robust error detection and correction while being more space, time and computationally efficient compared to a naive fine-tuning approach. This provides a path showing how foundation models may be adapted to enhance reliability across a wider range of additive manufacturing processes.",

    "abstract": "In material extrusion additive manufacturing, the extrusion process is commonly controlled in a feed-forward fashion. The amount of material to be extruded at each printing location is pre-computed by a planning software. This approach is inherently unable to adapt the extrusion to external and unexpected disturbances, and the quality of the results strongly depends on a number of modeling and tuning parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first framework for Force Controlled Printing for material extrusion additive manufacturing. We utilize a custom-built extruder to measure the extrusion force in real time, and use feedback on this quantity to continuously control the material flow in closed-loop. We demonstrate the existence of a strong correlation between extrusion force and line width, which we exploit to deposit lines of desired width in a width range of 33 % up to 233 % of the nozzle diameter. We also show how Force Controlled Printing outperforms conventional feed-forward extrusion in print quality and disturbance rejection, while requiring little tuning and automatically adapting to changes in the hardware settings. Our results demonstrate that Force Controlled Printing can deposit lines of desired width under severe disturbances in bed leveling, such as at layer heights ranging between 20 % and 200 % of the nominal height.",

    "abstract": "Vat photopolymerization (VPP) is widely known for its exceptional printing accuracy, but effectively controlling stitching errors to achieve high-precision, large-scale printing remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel compensation method, termed \"Spatial-Pixel Integration Compensation\" (SPIC), to address this key obstacle. SPIC combines Spatial Motion Compensation to initially control stitching errors between adjacent sub-images to be within 100 µm and Pixel Compensation for precise adjustments, further reducing stitching errors. Integrating SPIC with our high-precision printing system resulted in a remarkable reduction of stitching errors by a factor exceeding 40. Crucially, this method minimizes the stitching error between any two sub-images to be less than one pixel point, specifically below 4 µm. Notably, SPIC is the first method specifically focused on effectively controlling and reducing stitching errors to achieve large-scale printing while maintaining high precision. To validate the practical applicability of the SPIC method, we used SPIC to print both Zig-Zag and herringbone structures (HBS) and achieved high-precision large-scale manufacturing with dimensions of 44 mm × 33 mm. In the HBS structure, the minimum feature size was 14.2 µm, and the printing error was less than 1 µm. These printed structures were used as molds to fabricate proof-of-concept polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chips, demonstrating the successful mixing of rhodamine B and ethanol within the microfluidic channels. Furthermore, SPIC was extended to the printing of complex three-dimensional (3D) Triple-Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures, successfully producing TPMS-Gyroid and TPMS-Diamond structures with a minimum feature size of 20 µm and a printing error below 1.5 µm. These results demonstrate that the SPIC algorithm effectively enables high-precision, large-scale printing. This work significantly advances the application of VPP technology in fields requiring complex, high-precision, and large-scale 3D structures and provides valuable insights for future research in high-precision and large-scale printing.",

    "abstract": "Cold spraying has proved as an attractive and rapidly developing solid-state material deposition process that allows for fast formation of high quality, large 3D volume objects. Low risks of undesirable heat effects lead to increased interest in cold spraying based rapid additive manufacturing. However, by continuous powder spraying and high-pressure gas operation, cold spray additive manufacturing in terms of shape building is sensitive to operating parameters and imposes high requirements on the control of process conditions and locally needed kinematics. Every step of the manufacturing process therefore needs to be meticulously conceived and planned, especially the toolpath planning and implementation. This is not only essential to meet basic performance requirements, but also needed for the desired geometric accuracy. To address these needs, this study presents a new implementation method for cold spray additive manufacturing to improve manufacturing accuracy and flexibility. The workflow and principles of the proposed method are explained and strategies are presented for building up various component types, including rotational geometries as well as freestanding parts. The developed algorithms for 3D applications can be well integrated into the cold spray additive manufacturing process for toolpath planning and path parameter determination. Reliable and accurate robot programs were developed to make the process easy to repeat and to follow. Toolpath planning and robot programming are supported and performed by applying virtual cells to simulate the automation process for the real scenario. Path parameter adjustment and kinematic optimization can then be conducted according to the feedback from the simulation result. Applied benchmarking tests prove acceptable shape accuracy and demonstrate that the current method can enhance the capabilities of cold spray additive manufacturing for near-net shape construction. This implies that careful planning and manufacturing strategies should enable overcoming the challenges associated with cold spray additive manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Micro- and nano-patterns are gaining increasing attraction in several fields ranging from nanoelectronics to bioengineering. The mechanical properties of the nanostructures (nanopillars, nanotubes, nanowires, etc.) are highly relevant for many applications but challenging to determine. Existing mechanical characterization methods require mounting the testing setup inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and additional sample modification. Here, we propose two atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods, based on contact mode imaging (CMI) and force spectroscopy imaging (FSI), to determine the mechanical characteristics of individual micro- and nanopillars as fabricated, without using SEM. We present the working principles of both methods and two case studies on nanopillars fabricated by additive manufacturing methods: two-photon polymerization (2PP) and electron beam induced deposition (EBID). Various mechanical parameters were determined using CMI and FSI, respectively. For the 2PP nanopillars, we measured the stiffness (13.5 ± 3.2 N/m and 15.9 ± 2.6 N/m), the maximum lateral force (883.0 ± 89.5 nN and 889.6 ± 113.6 nN), the maximum deflection (64.2 ± 13.6 nm and 58.3 ± 14.24 nm), the failure stress (0.3 ± 0.03 GPa and 0.3 ± 0.02 GPa), and the adhesion force (56.6 ± 4.5 µN and 58.6 ± 5.2 µN). For the EBID nanopillars, we measured the failure stress (2.9 ± 0.2 GPa and 2.7 ± 0.4 GPa). The similar results obtained using both techniques confirmed the efficacy and consistency of the methods. The proposed methodologies have the potential of enabling otherwise impossible measurements particularly when the specimens need to be tested under wet conditions, such as patterns for mechanobiological studies.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the use of additive manufacturing in the design and fabrication of a non-planar fully 3Dprinted low-pass filter.The process implements stereolithographic 3D printing and copper electroplating to produce the necessary parts and their casing.The filter we produce acts as a demonstrator: we present the possibility of constructing building blocks and combining different elements into a full assembly for system integration.We introduce the \"drop-and-screw\" concept, which is implemented to mount the parts into a single connectorized assembly without the need for welding.The method we propose may be suitable for building other components by simply changing the building blocks.We pay special attention to the design of the constituent parts of the filter (a 3D conical inductor and a 3D capacitor), exploring new geometries to reduce the size of the final filter prototypes.The results demonstrate the potential of additive manufacturing in the construction of high-performance RF components and assemblies, and we present a modular prototype with a high degree of reconfigurability and multifunctionality.",

A potential solution to increase the reliability of LPBF is employing in-process monitoring targeting defect detection. This study aims to detect stochastic defects driven by spatter particles via in-situ monitoring and validate the detection method ex-situ via X-ray computed tomography (XCT). By means of in-situ optical tomography (OT), monitoring images were registered layerwise during the manufacturing of Hastelloy X specimens. The images were analyzed to detect spatters landing within specimen boundaries, and the spatial coordinates of the detections were obtained. The specimens were also measured ex-situ by means of XCT, from which key features and coordinates of internal defects were obtained. The in-situ spatter detection method was then compared to the XCT measurements. It was found that 79 % of lack of fusion defects were detected in OT images. The detection was particularly successful for large defects. Spatter-induced lack of fusion defects were present in the specimens manufactured with optimized processing parameters in different degrees, depending on the robustness of the processing conditions to spatters. This study demonstrates the applicability of optical tomography in-situ monitoring for indirect detection of stochastic lack of fusion, whose presence is inferred from spatter redeposits on the powder bed.",

    "abstract": "Architected materials produced by metal additive manufacturing techniques offer realization of complex structural hierarchies that mimic the principles of crystal plasticity while still being ultralight-weight. However, they suffer from deep-rooted multiscale defects including microstructural heterogeneity caused by the complex thermo-mechanical transients in the melt pool. Here we manufacture meta-crystal 316L stainless steel microlattice structures for utilizing the strain localization mechanism in bulk structures akin to dislocation slip mediated plasticity. These lattices are characterized here using scanning and transmission electron microscopy, along with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to reveal the microstructural, chemical and crystallographic orientation information at various locations in the struts and joints. The presence of inherent voids was the major drawback that would undermine their structural performance as mechanical metamaterials. Nevertheless, other defects in the form of spatially correlated dislocation networks and micro-segregated cellular substructures overcome the strength-ductility trade-off and render the bulk structures comparable to other engineering materials including conventional steels. By exploiting this intrinsic strengthening mechanism due to the rapid (i.e. non-equilibrium) solidification phenomenon, the bond (i.e. strut) strength of meta-crystals can be enhanced (or controlled) on top of employing hardening principles of metallurgy to design architected materials with tailored properties.",

    "abstract": "In Direct Energy Deposition, manufacturers require a simple and economical technique to simulate a given powder flux. This study proposes a novel analytical method based on a straightforward measurement technique to reverse engineer the powder flow distribution of a coaxial annular nozzle up to its focus position. Different axial profiles of powder concentration were obtained by blowing powder over a coated plate at different working distances. The observed marks were then discretised into a mixture of Gaussian density of probabilities. A predictive model correlating information between the powder flow profiles to reproduce the powder flow as a sum of continuous statistical functions, each associated to an individual trajectory was developed. This method is assessed on a random nozzle to prove its reliability. The model was trained using data from seven low working distance profiles. It was then tested on two horizontal planes closer to the powder focus and one tilted plane taken at a low working distance. The model shows good predictability with an average R2 of 0.874 for the profiles of the plane nearest to the powder focus, which is very similar to the training phase R2. Regarding the tilted plane, the model was able to predict expected variations on the dispersion and the centroids' positions, which demonstrates the validity of an application to complex surfaces.",

Process parameters, such as laser power, scanning strategy or inert gas properties, affect the generation of emissions and by-products such as spatters and fumes and their removal from the process chamber. Numerous authors investigated these effects in numerical studies to predict suitable process parameter sets. However, the basic challenge of modelling time-dependent particle and heat ejection from the moving melt pool region as well as predicting of the resulting transport and deposition mechanisms with sufficient accuracy still remains. In this context, an approach of modelling the statistical particle ejection as well as underlying heat transfer into the process chamber through analytical considerations is presented. Particle transport and deposition are numerically investigated for the case of a real case of application. Several production layers are covered in one transient simulation, assessing the influence of different scanning strategies. Especially the effect of convective flow caused by high heat influx through the melt pool is investigated. Results are compared to data obtained from an associated experiment. The presented model enables numerical simulation of arbitrary scanning patterns and laser properties without the need for preceding experimental studies determining pattern specific ejection rates.",

    "abstract": "In additive manufacturing (AM), low geometrical tolerances, high-quality material properties, and low surface roughness are challenges. To increase the process capabilities, a promising concept is to tailor process parameters for the fabrication of a part. Instead of selecting identical process parameters to the geometry of the whole part, different sets of process parameters are assigned to different regions named manufacturing elements (MEs). The ME approach offers three main advantages: significant reduction of required sacrificial support structures based on the reduced build angles and less post-processing efforts; reduced AM processing time due to less sacrificial support structures and a higher laser speed; and local adjustment of the material and surface properties. Previous studies have examined the ME approach and applied it to simplified test samples. This study shows an end-to-end implementation of the ME approach for the fabrication of a real-world industrial part and highlights the associated opportunities and challenges for the implementation. The application is demonstrated for a complex-shaped industrial part that can only be manufactured using the ME approach. The industrial part is a winding former of a superconducting solenoid coil. The implementation consists of three major steps: (1) the development of a process parameter model for laser-based powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and stainless steel 316 L; (2) segmentation of the part into MEs; and (3) use of the enhanced design freedom for surface texturing. The ME approach facilitated support-free fabrication of the part with build angles of as low as 25°. The enhanced design freedom enabled surface texturing, which allowed the maximum shear strength to be improved by 63% compared to that of a nontextured surface. The results are discussed, and possible enhancements and research directions are outlined, such as the automated assignment of process parameter sets. The results are applicable to reduce the costs of a superconducting solenoid coil for the treatment of cancer with proton beams. This can enable a larger number of patients to have access to this cancer treatment. In addition, the results are further applicable to increase the performance of the future circular collider at CERN.",

    "abstract": "Porous biomaterials are often used to treat large bony defects or fractured vertebras. Most of such biomaterials are made of metals and their alloys and have a pre-defined, fixed shape. Due to their predefined fixed shape, however, they are not suitable for implantation through minimally invasive surgical procedures. To overcome this problem, we designed three different deployable non-assembly mechanisms, which were manufactured using selective laser melting. These deployable geometries, including a bicapped cube, a bicapped trigonal antiprism, and a bicapped square antiprism, possess a large aspect ratio in their retracted state. Upon the application of an external force, they expand radially into their deployed load-bearing configuration. Using non-assembly manufacturing, revolute joints, wavelike elements, rigid rods and restrictions could be integrated into the design. The designs were manufactured in such a way that the least amount of support structures was required during the fabrication process. Additionally, the deployable structures were functional immediately after printing. Mechanical tests were performed to determine the forces required to deploy the designed structures and to determine their failure load. A maximum change of 322 ± 7% in the circumdiameter was found for the bicapped trigonal antiprism while the bicapped square antiprism showed the largest reduction in the height (61 ± 1%). A maximum force of 10.3 ± 1.6 N was required during the deployment process of the bicapped square antiprism 3. The bicapped antiprisms could support up to 1212 ± 45.5 N before they failed, while the bicapped cubes failed under a force of 232 ± 5.5 N. The elongated geometry of our designs makes them ideal for implantation using minimally invasive surgical procedures. Given the fact that these are the first non-assembly deployable bone substitutes manufactured using selective laser melting, further studies are required to make them suitable as orthopedic implants.",

    "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing of scaffolds with controlled porosity has demonstrated its value in many fields such as tissue regeneration and filtration applications. However, there is a scarcity of reports investigating the manufacturing of scaffolds with hollow fibers. Mainly, this was due to the lack of proper tools (extrusion nozzles) that enable the production of such structures. In this study, a methodology for designing and manufacturing a nozzle that can be fitted onto a fused filament fabrication 3D printer is proposed. Titanium laser powder bed fusion technology, coupled with chemical polishing, was used to produce the complex design of the nozzle with minimal post processing steps. Through this approach, we were able to produce a nozzle with the required internal structure. Numerical simulations and experimental analyses were conducted to better understand the melt flow behavior within the nozzle and the extrudate swell. The designed nozzle was capable of extruding tubular fibers with an outer and inner diameter of 1.3 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. This, for example, enables the fabrication of tissue regeneration scaffolds with hollow fibers. This proposed method for designing and manufacturing can be used to produce nozzles capable of 3D printing scaffolds that best suit the intended application.",

    "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing of open porous metallic structures has a high potential for advanced applications such as for cooling or catalysis on small length-scales. For such applications the 3D morphology, and in particular the surface geometry, will strongly determine the performance. Attached spherical particles on the surface of functional structures made by Laser-based Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-LB) have been observed in various studies. This study applies a novel approach to characterize such complex structures made by Additive Manufacturing. In this study, synchrotron µ-CT was applied to analyze the surface morphology of six different open porous PBF-LB-samples at ~ 1.5 µm voxel size. Due to the high level of detail, the reconstructed 3D images allow an impression very close to the original physical sample. In contrast to classic functional design for AM, the open porosities considered in this study are the result of the manufacturing parameters (e.g. hatch spacing) and not of a CAD-design. The work shows that scan strategy and process parameters have a major impact on the resulting surface area and the volume of the open porous structures. In particular, the surface area is driven by the attached particles, while their impact on the volume is considerably lower. This difference between material distribution and material property could be used to determine specific application properties. The presented findings may thus pave the path for adding an additional level of functionality to Additive Manufacturing of porous metallic samples.",

The isothermal and non-isothermal crystallisation kinetics were explored using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fast Scanning Calorimetry (FSC). The half-time, onset and ending of crystallisation were obtained for isothermal crystallisation temperatures between 150 °C and 330 °C, while the crystallisation under constant cooling was obtained using rates between − 0.5 K s−1 and − 45 K s−1. The results were used to draw the Continuous Cooling Transformation (CCT) and the Time-Temperature Transformation (TTT) diagrams and calculate the Avrami numbers using the parallel Avrami model. These results were then compared to the degree of crystallinity as a function of time and temperature for the MEX process. To evaluate the crystallisation within the MEX process a 1D transient transfer heat model was used to obtain the printing thermal profile, which was replicated using the FSC technique. The results showed that for the MEX printing process, the crystallisation usually is a product of a combination of rapid cooling and heating processes followed by periods of greater thermal stability which, depending on the nature of the process, can approach a quasi-isothermal crystallisation process. By superimposing the process thermal profile on the TTT and CCT diagrams and comparing the crystallinity values measured from each point in the thermal profile, it was possible to understand the crystallinity evolution and the remelting of the build surface promoted by the subsequent printed layers.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing and specifically laser-based powder bed fusion processes of metals show a rapidly increasing demand in production technology. One key parameter that impacts the quality of the finished part is the condition of the powder bed. It is not surprising that the uniformity of the metal powder distribution has a great influence on the process stability. Caused by the recoating system, the powder may have uneven roughness or unwanted structures such as waviness. One consequence of these conditions may be for example that the fabricated structure contains porosity. In this paper we are proposing an instrument to detect powder bed irregularities in-process, using the so-called structure function. The dimensional data of the powder bed surface can be rapidly evaluated and, moreover, relevant parameters can be obtained with this statistical tool, allowing for in- or off-line process assessment.",

    "abstract": "Two time-efficient surrogate models are proposed to emulate the nonlinear heat equation in the context of laser powder bed fusion, the performance of which is compared in accuracy and online execution time. Fast-computed numerical solvers are critical in implementing the digital twin framework in the additive manufacturing process addressing one of its main open problems: lack of quality assurance. The first surrogate model is the reduced Gaussian process emulator. It is a data-driven model equipped with a nonlinear dimension reduction scheme and manages to predict temperature profiles almost instantly (around 0.036s on average) with an accuracy of 95% for 99.38% of tests. Another surrogate model is the sketched emulator with local projection. It projects the accurate but high-dimensional finite element method solution on a low-dimensional basis and then bypasses the majority of costly computations for the temperature-dependent matrices in the projected model by randomized sketching. It has higher accuracy (97.78% of tests with relative errors below 1%) while spending comparably more time online (around 42.23s on average). Although compared with the finite element model both surrogates promote time efficiency with some minor controlled compromise in accuracy, the reduced Gaussian process emulator enables real-time implementation while the sketched emulator with local projection offers comparably higher levels of accuracy. A series of numerical experiments are carried out, which assumes a three-layer printing process with a fixed laser beam trajectory using a small number of printing control parameters as inputs, namely the laser power, scan speed, and time coordinates. Both surrogates are also principally feasible in other thermal-driven additive manufacturing to obtain better quality assurance with techniques like uncertainty management and closed-loop control.",

In this study, an infill structure was investigated which consists of hollow spheres in a hexagonal closed packing. An additional characteristic is, that the contact between the spheres is modelled as an intersection. A script-based design approach was used for generating the structure within a cylinder. Thus, the sphere diameter, the sphere wall thickness and the outer shell thickness can be varied. The deformation behavior was studied using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Compression tests on additive manufactured cylindrical specimens verify the FEM results: (1) appropriate modelling of the contact between the spheres enhances the stability to the structure. (2) Increasing the relative density increases the mechanical properties. (3) Lower values for the relative sphere wall thickness result in an improved ductility.",

    "abstract": "Silicone polymers are already known as feedstock for a variety of silicate bioceramics, in the form of scaffolds with complex shapes, obtained by Vat Photopolymerization. Printing is enabled by using silicone blended with photocurable acrylates. The development of a particular silicate composition that functions as a glass or glass-ceramic precursor is possible by the addition of suitable oxide fillers (especially carbonate powders), suspended in the polymer blend. Oxides, from the fillers, easily react with silica left by the thermal transformation of the silicone. The fillers, however, also determine complications in Vat Photopolymerization, due to light scattering; in addition, local oxide concentrations generally impede the obtainment of glassy products. The present paper illustrates a simple solution to these issues, based on the inclusion of a Ca salt in nano-emulsion within a silicone-containing blend. Homogeneous printed samples are later converted into crack-free, fully amorphous ceramic composites, by firing at only 700 °C. The glass matrix, resembling 70S30C (70% SiO2 and 30% CaO) bioglass, is achieved according to the quasi-molecular CaO distribution. The secondary phase, promoted by treatment in N2 atmosphere and consisting of pyrolytic carbon, provides a marked photothermal effect.",

    "abstract": "Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing techniques have enabled the fabrication of geometrically complex porous metallic lattice structures. Despite the many advantages of this approach, surface and near surface defects inherited from the fabrication process act to limit their structural and mechanical integrity. Consequently, surface cleaning techniques such as chemical etching have been increasingly adopted post process. Although the benefits of this technique have been captured across a range of lattice structures, the existing body of work is typically a characterisation of the engineering mechanical properties of lattices, rather than the bulk mechanical properties of the material. From a design perspective, characterisation of such properties is fundamental to prediction of mechanical performance and failure mechanisms. In this study, standardised micro-strut dog-bone geometries were adopted as a means of isolating geometrical variations between lattice designs; allowing us to study the bulk mechanical properties of the material. Incremental etching was conducted and changes to both the surface and morphological properties of the micro-structs was characterised. Improvements in these factors was associated with a corresponding increase in mechanical properties. Both strength and stiffness increased following removal of process inherited surface defects, which can be linked to a removal of non-load bearing material. Failure strain and fatigue resistance also improved following surface etching, although similar fracture surfaces were observed in both groups. Together these findings demonstrate the benefits of chemical etching for improving the mechanical properties of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V lattice structures.",

    "abstract": "Surface characterisation has always been an important aspect in quality control for industrial parts. With the development of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies and the design freedom they provide, new measuring techniques have become necessary for inspection of inner elements and hidden surfaces. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) has the potential for this purpose. Its performance in surface characterisation has been studied mainly for new metallic AM technologies due to its extended use in industrial products; however, it is not possible to directly extend this knowledge to polymeric AM surface characterisation, due to the material, manufacturing process itself and behaviour with X-rays. In this paper, a study of different polymeric AM surfaces by means of XCT is presented, taking into consideration the layer-by-layer technology and geometrical parameters (angle of inclination, layer thickness). Areal and linear roughness parameters are extracted to create a comparison between XCT measurements and reference measurements with a calibrated focal variation microscope (FVM). A reasonably achievable geometrical magnification for a polymeric AM assembly with industrial part dimensions (28 µm voxel size for a 50 mm × 55 mm × 60 mm object) is demonstrated to be suitable for roughness evaluation with an acceptable precision. Results show that it is possible to evaluate roughness in FDM and Polyjet technologies with linear parameters, while areal parameters are more suitable for SLS parts; also, post process has an important role in surface characterisation, but its effect is different depending on the technology.",

Although formulation strategies can address some of these issues, they require heavily formulated or complex systems, which require time and resource to solve/overcome. In this study we present a novel, filament free 3D printing system, obviating limitations of unsuitable filament properties and opening up the pharmaceutical formulation space in material extrusion of pharmaceutical oral solid dose forms (OSDs). Prasad et al. reported on a 30% w/w Paracetamol (PCM) in Affinisol™ HPMC HME 15LV (30PCM-AFF) formulation, not printable on a conventional filament based material extrusion printer. This formulation was processed on the filament free 3D printer to successfully print OSDs. In initial rheological screening tests, process conditions for initial printing trials were identified. The operating space of the filament free 3D printer and slicer settings in this process were investigated as well as the uniformity of mass and dimensions of printed OSDs. A relationship of Slicer Infill percentage (microstructure) and tablet core weight was also assessed, demonstrating the ability to create patient centred dose forms. Material reconciliation showed good traceability of material during the manufacturing process.",

It is also demonstrated that laser powder bed fusion is a flexible fabrication method for the ceration of structures with different thicknesses, hole geometry and tapered openings, allowing the acoustic properties to be modified. It was confirmed via both finite element simulation and practical measurements that these structures supported Fabry-Pérot resonances, needed for metamaterial operation, at ultrasonic frequencies in water.

    "abstract": "After laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of an ultra-strong in situ TiC whisker reinforced β-Ti composite, this paper investigates the evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties in response to heat treatment at different temperatures. Using in depth nano-SEM and TEM analyses, it is shown that ageing at 400 °C rounds the whiskers, annihilates the strain fields and grows Mo segregated nano-cells, but without improving the ductility. In contrast, ageing at 600 °C enables the transformation of metastable β to a lamellar β + α, leading to a dual phase matrix embedding TiC particles. This is in such a manner that extra ageing at 600 °C coalesces the nano-lamellar α + β microstructure to form a coarser micro-lamellar α + β matrix. This microstructure achieves 66 % of the compressive deformation of Cp-Ti, and over 1400 MPa compressive strength after 1 h of ageing at 600 °C. Despite this success under compression, hard and stiff TiC particles may still cause large spherical fractured voids, severely limiting the plastic deformation under tension.",

    "abstract": "The unique solidification kinetics of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing tend to result in solidification modes deviating from the phase diagram predictions. This study documents an approach for developing LPBF solidification mode selection process map based on an analytical equation model which determines the solidification mode transition criteria as a function of laser power (P), scan velocity (V) and material properties. As case studies, solidification mode selection process maps were developed for three Ti6Al4V-xB alloys (x = 1, 2, 5 wt% B), presenting primary β, primary TiB, and coupled eutectic solidification modes. To validate the proposed approach, laser deposition experiments were conducted to fabricate single-tracks, single-layer and two-layer pads on arc-melted Ti6Al4V-xB alloy buttons with different P-V parameters. The model-developed process maps agreed with the experimental results. P-V windows were found to allow coupled-eutectic solidification for off-eutectic Ti6Al4V-1, 2, 5 % B and primary-β solidification for hyper-eutectic Ti6Al4V-5 %B, producing a microstructure with a continuous TiB network and a microstructure with a discontinuous network of nano-scale TiB whiskers respectively. Single-layer and two-layer pads showed consistent microstructure features of the tracks, except for the narrow region that was remelted during pad deposition. Melt pool hardness was measured, which increases with scan velocity and shows a sudden change when solidification mode was altered. The potential and limitations of the proposed method for LPBF microstructure investigation are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Fused granular fabrication (FGF) is a cost-effective and increasingly popular additive technology that enables the production of parts using a wide range of exotic materials that are not typically available with material extrusion additive manufacturing. This paper presents a novel needle valve approach for flow control in a FGF system that uses flexibly connected screw extruders. The addition of a needle valve to the existing system allows complex travel moves to be performed without stringing, greatly increasing the available part complexity of the printer. The needle valve is actuated by one of the 3D printer's extruder stepper motors and can be controlled by g-code generated by off-the shelf slicer software. This paper also proposes a mathematical model for predicting the oozing volume of the valve, which is the small quantity of material that escapes through the nozzle during valve actuation. This model is important for calibration and g-code generation, which could be integrated with commercial slicers to use this needle valve design without writing custom code. The model is tested experimentally, and results show a strong correlation between predicted and measured oozing volumes. The performance of the valve is also characterized in terms of flow rate versus needle position. Experiments showed that the needle stroke (the vertical distance that the needle travels between open and closed states of the needle valve) is the most important parameter in minimizing oozing. An optimized stroke of 0.4 mm was used, with a maximum flow rate of 346 mm3/min when using a nozzle inner bore diameter of 0.8 mm. Using the optimized valve parameters, parallel cube structures were printed to demonstrate the reduction of stringing, along with various demonstration parts including a 3Dbenchy benchmark print and a soft robotic actuator. Overall, this study demonstrates that needle valves present a reliable and low-cost approach for controlling the flow of polymer in FGF systems with a remotely connected screw extruder.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a new type of catalytic stirrer made entirely of porous carbon. These stirrers are made by printing 3D structures directly from whey pastes that were subsequently carbonised to produce impellers with meshed surfaces made of porous carbon with up to a 3% N content. The characteristics of the carbon pieces include a high porosity of approximately 70%, mainly in the macropore range, although there is also some development of mesoporosity and microporosity obtained by a simple washing process with HCl (SBET = 400 m2/g). The blades are strong (mechanical strength of 165 Pa) and able to sustain high stirring speeds (2000 rpm) immersed in highly viscous fluids without damage. The blade design of the stirrer is optimised to provide effective mixing, and to facilitate fluid circulation through the blades, as demonstrated experimentally and by CFD simulation. All these characteristics are expected to enhance the contact between the catalyst and the reactants and/or favour the deposition of selected catalysts on their surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Recent development in direct electrochemical 3D microprinting allows the fabrication of 3D metallic micro-components of predominantly noble metals with the positive standard reduction potentials (e.g., Cu, Au, or Pt). These pure metals (e.g., Cu, Au, or Pt) have a small shear modulus up to 60 GPa, which limits one of the important strengthening mechanisms, Taylor hardening. Hence, their mechanical strength is relatively low and limits the application in a structural component. 3D printing of mechanically high-strength metals (e.g., Ni), specifically, printing of microscale parts by direct electrodeposition using a voxel-by-voxel printing technique, is so far very challenging due to the negative standard reduction potential, which leads to hydrogen evolution and unstable printing. In this paper, we demonstrate the stable and successful room temperature (RT) electrochemical printing of Ni micro-architectures by using a newly formulated Ni ink and supporting electrolyte, which were developed through 2D voltammetry and deposition analysis. The micro manufacturing of Ni succeeds at a high deposition speed up to ∼61 nm/s, which is the fastest speed reported so far for microprinting of Ni. 3D printed micropillars feature a heterogeneous nanostructure from ∼13 nm at the center to ∼27 nm at the perimeter. By performing micropillar compression tests, the printed pillars exhibit a high compressive yield-strength of 2.3 ± 0.1 GPa, only ∼15 % lower than 2D processed samples (2.7 ± 0.1 GPa) featuring a homogeneous nanostructure of 27 ± 16 nm. Thus, by deposition of stronger, but less noble metals we show a new pathway to enhance the mechanical robustness of 3D-printed structures, opening up new applications where mechanical rigidity is essential.",

    "abstract": "The onset of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led to a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), medical devices, and other medical supplies causing many stakeholders and the general public alike to turn to additive manufacturing (AM) as a stopgap when normally accessible devices were not available. However, without a method to test these AM constructs, there continued to be a disconnect between AM suppliers and the community's needs. The objective of this study was to characterize the pressure drop and leakage of four different publicly available AM face mask models with two filter material combinations, as well as to investigate the impact of frame modification techniques including the use of foam strips and hot-water face forming to improve fit when the masks are donned on manikin head forms. AM face mask frame designs were downloaded from public repositories during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. AM face masks were fabricated and tested on manikin head forms within a custom chamber containing dry aerosolized NaCl. Pressure drops, particle penetration, and leakage were evaluated for various flow rates and NaCl concentrations. Results indicated that filter material combination and frame modification played a major role in the overall performance of the AM face masks studied. Filter material combinations showed improved performance when high filtration fabric was used, and the cross-sectional area of the fabric was increased. AM frame modifications appeared to improve AM face mask leakage performance by as much as 69.6%.",

    "abstract": "The European Organisation for Nuclear Research, CERN, is in the process of designing and testing parts for the next generation of linear accelerators. In order to operate the experiments, the pre-alignment precision of the components of the two opposing accelerating complexes has placed increased demands on part tolerances, which are now approaching the micrometre. In order to meet these demanding requirements, improvements are necessary to the build processes, machining parameters and post-manufacture characterisation stages. One of the most promising methods for the production of these parts is Laser Powder Bed Fusion, and as such, this paper focuses on the manufacture of the lightweight air bearing rotor component and the micro-scale tolerance machining required by this part. The results demonstrate that despite being able to initially machine the part to a form tolerance approaching 2 μm, subsequent notch cutting and the release of residual stresses from the part obtained by Laser Powder Bed Fusion induces an 18 μm part misalignment which is larger than the tolerance limits of 5 μm required for operation. This demonstrates that further minimisation and understanding of the residual stresses induced during machining are required to facilitate the effective manufacture of high precision components of this type.",

The results show that aging time of the pre-gel has a big impact on storage and loss of modulus which both increases with increasing aging time, particularly in the first 48 h. The pre-gel is successfully printed and is shown to be able to support itself making it possible to fully print structures before curing. Compression and tensile samples are printed and compared to cast samples. The pre-gel aging time showed that an increased time resulted in a lower strain at failure for both cast and extruded samples. However, when printing with a speed of 10 mm/s with UV-curing during printing, a significant increase in strain at failure is achieved. Furthermore, the compressed samples display self-healing abilities at room temperature and almost completely returns to its original state before compression occurred.",

    "abstract": "To understand the relation of molecular design of powder formulations in the realization of effective stress transfer at sintered polymer – polymer interfaces by the concept of interfacial stereocomplex crystallization in a broad temperature range, the effect of temperature and molar mass ratio are studied in heterogeneous poly(lactide) melt-states. Whereas the stereocomplex crystallization rate is dictated by supercooling and relative viscosities, the length-scales depend on the formation of crystalline stereocomplex domains connected via amorphous regions resulting in network formation, gelation. Upon gelation, further diffusion is impeded, which is supported by rheometry, DSC and FTIR imaging. When the initial relative viscosity between the PLA fractions is low, the time to reach critical network density is high. On the contrary, the length-scales of stereocomplex crystallization and ultimate mechanical stiffening are strongly influenced by the chosen temperature and molar mass ratio of the PLA fractions. Occurrence of interfacial stereocomplex crystallization under the non-isothermal conditions of selective laser sintering is validated. This fundamental understanding on the time- and length-scales of interfacial diffusion, successive stereocomplex crystallization, and nucleation of homocrystals upon further cooling, assists in the technical assurance of mechanically reinforced polymer-polymer interfaces – not only in sintered but in additively manufactured polymeric constructs in general.",

    "abstract": "In this work an optical and inductive calibration procedures for calibrating multi-material fused filament fabrication 3D printers in the x and y directions is presented. The inductive calibration is based on the principle that the inductance of a detection coil placed on the print bed changes when the (metallic) extrusion nozzle passes it. This calibration method shows a repeatability of up to 2 µm. To determine the accuracy of this calibration method, another calibration method is proposed that directly measures the position of the deposited material. During this alternative process, a calibration structure is printed on an A4-format sheet of paper using every tool. The paper is subsequently scanned using a digital scanner, and the resulting image is analyzed using an image-processing script. Using this method as a reference, it was determined that the inductive method has an accuracy of approximately 45 µm. For applications where this accuracy is sufficient, the inductive method provides a fast solution that requires little to no user interaction. For more demanding applications, the optical calibration might be the better choice, since it is more time-consuming but yields a more accurate solution. It is expected that the accurate calibration of tool offsets will reduce both the chance of poor adhesion between materials and the mixing of filaments due to local over- and under-extrusion at material interfaces.",

    "abstract": "To exploit the design freedoms of Powder Bed Fusion, parameters can be varied within sub-volumes of components to achieve the optimal part for both service conditions and manufacturing productivity. This involves prioritising mechanical strength in areas of structural significance and high volumetric build rates in areas of low structural significance. In theory, a component with similar mechanical behaviour to that seen in standard Laser Powder Bed Fusion parts can be built in significantly less time and at a reduced cost. In practice however, the boundary between such regions is yet to be understood and discretising components into sub-volumes can induce interfacial defects. In this study, an in-depth analysis of interfaces between disparate layer thickness volumes in single components has been explored, to gain information vital to solving interface quality issues so that LPBF design freedoms can be fully exploited. A novel 3D reconstruction technique has been demonstrated to characterise transient plastic behaviour of interfacial pores post-fracture. This technique enables post-mortem evaluation of additively manufactured parts and tracking of pore deformation during subsequent mechanical testing. X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) identified interfacial pores up to 170 µm Feret diameter, with a voxel resolution of 6 µm. Micro tensile testing with in-situ microscopy exhibited a real-time mechanical response, observing evidence that these interfacial defects lead to fracture at interface locations. The 3D reconstruction technique found that pores constricted 10.0 – 14.1% in the x direction and 10.3 – 14.6% in the y direction after fracture – normal to the loading direction. These findings contribute towards improving Additively Manufactured biomedical implants and airframe components with reduced time and cost.",

    "abstract": "Temperature monitoring during the cooldown in powder bed fusion of polymers is essential to qualify parts, and is an absolute novelty in the field. This is because the direct reading of the parts' temperature is hindered by the powder. In this work, an innovative temperature monitoring technology based on microwave tomography is used to assess the part cooldown history in an industry-grade EOS P110 machine. So, relative and absolute readings of the temperature field can be carried out even for parts surrounded by powder. For the first time, several cooldown rates could be experimentally measured depending on the different polymer state: 0.56 °C min−1 in the liquid phase, 1.2 °C min−1 during supercooling, 0.83 °C min−1 in the solid phase. This technology will allow the development of a new generation of smart PBF machines that can better sense and hence control the entire PBF process, including the cooldown phase, which is often neglected but has the highest impact on the final mechanical performances of parts.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports the use of multi-spot melt strategy coupled with smaller layer thickness to additively manufacture Y2O3/γ-TiAl nanocomposite. In contrast to the hatch melt, the multi-spot melt strategy results in a lower fraction of γ and B2-phase, a smaller lamellar spacing of 208 ± 72 nm with straight interface between α2/γ, and a uniformly distributed nanoparticles with a finer size of 90 ± 38 nm. Twins can form in the equiaxed γ grains and within γ lamellae; this applies to both the multi-spot and hatch melt samples. Twins within the γ lamellae can propagate across the twin interface but terminate at the γ/α2 interface. A good combination of 556 ± 11 MPa (tensile strength) and 17.0 ± 3.1 % (ductility) at 800 ℃ with 16.5 ± 0.3 MPa√m (room-temperature fracture toughness) is achieved in the as-built condition. Quantitative microscopy confirms a homogeneous microstructure within the x-y plane for the multi-spot sample, whilst the use of smaller layer thickness helps to reduce the microstructure degradation due to thermal cycling. In terms of the Y2O3 nanoparticles, both the rod-like Y2O3 with monoclinic and the near spherical Y2O3 with cubic crystal system are identified using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High-resolution TEM reveals that the Y2O3/TiAl interface is clean, free of interfacial reactions, and with a semi-coherent or coherent type, suggesting a strong bonding.",

    "abstract": "Complex geometries and topology optimisations for weight and materials savings are leading drivers for the additive manufacturing of Ni-based superalloys through electron beam powder bed fusion (PBF-EB). However, there is a marked departure in these geometrically complex components with respect to the thermal signatures understood in commonly studied prismatic PBF-EB test coupons. This often results in unaccounted site-specific microstructure-property variations in complex PBF-EB builds. Here, the effects of topological changes, such as intentionally engineered internal voids, on the mechanical performance of an as-fabricated Haynes 282 monolith is revealed. The internal voids serve as representative physical models for changing thermal boundary conditions with build height. Complementary local nanoindentations, multi-scale microscopy, and residual stress measurements were used to understand the mechanisms behind geometry-structure-property relationships. The results highlight the effectiveness and influence of changing thermal conditions on the local mechanical property response of PBF-EB Haynes 282.",

    "abstract": "Additively manufactured (AM) alloys present unique and heterogeneous microstructures due to the complex, highly dynamic laser-material interactions. These AM-inherent heterogeneities impede the widespread adoption of AM components, necessitating a profound comprehension of their impact on mechanical properties. Despite extensive research on AM of Ni-based alloys, limited attention has been paid to their creep behavior due to the time-intensive nature of creep tests and the long research cycles. Moreover, experiments and conventional alloy-centric approaches to creep modelling are deemed insufficient in quantifying the effects of AM-specific heterogeneities on creep cavity acceleration and in incorporating the microstructural evolution during creep. To address this critical knowledge gap, a novel computational framework was developed within the structure-property paradigm to unravel the intricate mechanisms governing creep properties. A mechanistic creep model was formulated based on fundamental dislocation creep mechanisms, encompassing dislocation climb-glide motion controlled by γ' precipitates, grain-boundary-sliding (GBS) resistance resulting from M23C6 carbides, and the kinetics of cavity formation. The framework integrates the in situ nucleation, precipitation, and coarsening of γ' precipitates during creep by a precipitation model. The results revealed an excellent agreement in terms of γ' precipitate evolution, creep strain, and strain-rate evolution, the predicted creep life, and times to 1 % strain. By elucidating the intricate interplay between microstructural heterogeneities and creep behavior on the cavity nucleation and GBS mechanisms, the developed computational framework provided valuable insights for enhancing the performance of Ni-based alloys manufactured through AM.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic properties of additively-manufactured materials are generally under-characterized compared to static properties. Material extrusion (MEX) is the most readily available and economical method of 3D printing available. In order to reduce weight and material costs, most commercial MEX slicing software utilizes a concept called infill, often in the form of lattices, which fills the 3D space with a computer-generated design. In this study, finite element modeling of representative volume elements is utilized to predict the speed of sound for a polylactic acid–based structure with varying infill percentages. Experimental validation of the sound speeds for a subset of infill percentages are measured using an underwater acoustic through-transmission technique at frequency ranges which correspond to the assumptions used in the modeling approach. Significant anisotropy in elasto-dynamic response was observed numerically and experimentally. Insertion loss of the printed panels was also measured as part of general discussion of the effectiveness of the underwater acoustic method for air-filled samples. This work provides a framework for both characterization and design of MEX-printed parts for acoustic applications.",

    "abstract": "Hot cracking prevents the additive manufacturing of a range of high-strength and temperature alloys. This work presents a physics-driven method for avoiding crack formation in the crack-susceptible nickel-based superalloy René 80 built using laser blown-powder directed energy deposition (DED-LB/M). A hierarchal model that links process parameters, thermal features, and crack formation is proposed. The model uses a multi-source Rosenthal model calibrated against process monitoring to provide thermal features as an input to a simplified crack formation criterion based on the Rappaz-Drezet-Gremaud model. The results of the hierarchal model are developed and tested on single-pass walls built with a range of process parameters. The model matches the observed crack formation trend. The concepts are then applied for contour and hatch walls, and results suggest that this approach may be geometrically generalizable.",

    "abstract": "3D printing of continuous fibre reinforced thermosetting matrix composites is set to revolutionise composite manufacturing practice.The potential of curing additively is anticipated to bring significant improvement in terms of increasing process speed, producing geometries that are inaccessible with current processing routes and eliminating detrimental exothermic effects during the process.This study presents a comparison between the curing stage of the 3D printing and standard batch processing for carbon fibre/epoxy components of varying thickness and size.An optimisation methodology links simulation of the cure using Finite Element solver Abaqus with a Genetic Algorithm capable of dealing with multi-objective problems.Optimal cure cycles to minimise both process time and temperature overshoot in 3D printing and batch processing are identified and the optimal tradeoffs compared.The results highlight that temperature overshoot reduction up to 85% is possible and that the intrinsic additive nature of the 3D printing allows eliminating the dependence of temperature overshoot on thickness and producing component with thicknesses that are very difficult to manufacture conventionally.A simplified procedure for the estimation of 3D printing process duration is proposed based on the results of finite element simulation.This is used for exploration of the limits of the process with respect to part size and a generic comparison of process applicability against batch processing.The analysis shows that 3D printing is highly advantageous for small components, is efficient for mid-size components and canon the basis of its scalabilityoffer a feasible route for producing large and very large components.",
