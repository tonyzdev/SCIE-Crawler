    "abstract": "Dense crossbar arrays of non-volatile memory (NVM) devices represent one possible path for implementing massively-parallel and highly energy-efficient neuromorphic computing systems. We first review recent advances in the application of NVM devices to three computing paradigms: spiking neural networks (SNNs), deep neural networks (DNNs), and 'Memcomputing'. In SNNs, NVM synaptic connections are updated by a local learning rule such as spike-timing-dependent-plasticity, a computational approach directly inspired by biology. For DNNs, NVM arrays can represent matrices of synaptic weights, implementing the matrix–vector multiplication needed for algorithms such as backpropagation in an analog yet massively-parallel fashion. This approach could provide significant improvements in power and speed compared to GPU-based DNN training, for applications of commercial significance. We then survey recent research in which different types of NVM devices – including phase change memory, conductive-bridging RAM, filamentary and non-filamentary RRAM, and other NVMs – have been proposed, either as a synapse or as a neuron, for use within a neuromorphic computing application. The relevant virtues and limitations of these devices are assessed, in terms of properties such as conductance dynamic range, (non)linearity and (a)symmetry of conductance response, retention, endurance, required switching power, and device variability.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles are defined as solid colloidal particles ranging in size from 10 to 1000 nm. Nanoparticles offer many benefits to larger particles such as increased surface-to-volume ratio and increased magnetic properties. Over the last few years, there has been a steadily growing interest in using nanoparticles in different biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery, hyperthermia, photoablation therapy, bioimaging and biosensors. Iron oxide nanoparticles have dominated applications, such as drug delivery, hyperthermia, bioimaging, cell labelling and gene delivery, because of their excellent properties such as chemical stability, non-toxicity, biocompatibility, high saturation magnetisation and high magnetic susceptibility. In this review, nanoparticles will be classified into four different nanosystems metallic nanoparticles, bimetallic or alloy nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles and magnetic nanoparticles. This review investigates the use of nanosystems other than iron oxide nanoparticles such as metallic nanoparticles like gold (Au) and silver (Ag), bimetallic nanoparticles like iron cobalt (Fe-Co) and iron platinum (Fe-Pt) and metal oxides including titanium dioxide (TiO2) cerium dioxide (CeO2), silica (SiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) with a focus on the lesser studied nanoparticles such as silver (Ag), iron-platinum (Fe-Pt) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) and how their unique properties allow for their potential use in various biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) conversion of solar energy starts to give an appreciable contribution to power generation in many countries, with more than 90% of the global PV market relying on solar cells based on crystalline silicon (c-Si). The current efficiency record of c-Si solar cells is 26.7%, against an intrinsic limit of ~29%. Current research and production trends aim at increasing the efficiency, and reducing the cost, of industrial modules. In this paper, we review the main concepts and theoretical approaches that allow calculating the efficiency limits of c-Si solar cells as a function of silicon thickness. For a given material quality, the optimal thickness is determined by a trade-off between the competing needs of high optical absorption (requiring a thicker absorbing layer) and of efficient carrier collection (best achieved by a thin silicon layer). The efficiency limits can be calculated by solving the transport equations in the assumption of optimal (Lambertian) light trapping, which can be achieved by inserting proper photonic structures in the solar cell architecture. The effects of extrinsic (bulk and surface) recombinations on the conversion efficiency are discussed. We also show how the main conclusions and trends can be described using relatively simple analytic models. Prospects for overcoming the 29% limit by means of silicon/perovskite tandems are briefly discussed.",

Among them, growing efforts have been invested to an intriguing phenomenon, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Here, we review the recent progress in this emerging field. By starting from the one-dimensional (1D) case, the fundamental concepts of NHSE, its minimal model, the physical meanings and consequences are elaborated in details. In particular, we discuss the NHSE enriched by lattice symmetries, which gives rise to unique non-Hermitian topological properties with revised bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) and new definitions of topological invariants. Then we extend the discussions to two and higher dimensions, where dimensional surprises enable even more versatile NH.SE phenomena. Extensions of NHSE assisted with extra degrees of freedom such as long-range coupling, pseudospins, magnetism, non-linearity and crystal defects are also reviewed. This is followed by the contemporary experimental progress for NHSE. Finally, we provide the outlooks to possible future directions and developments.",

In this context, we explore the capability of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to improve model generalization and increase accuracy while reducing computational resources. We also illustrate how machine learning can be used both to mitigate the effects of errors on presently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, and to understand quantum advantage via an automatic study of quantum walk processes on graphs. In addition, we review how quantum hardware can be enhanced by applying machine learning to fundamental and applied physics problems as well as quantum tomography and photonics.

Thanks to hBN's high stability and two-dimensional (2D) layered structure, color centers in hBN can be readily integrated into nanophotonic and plasmonic structures on a chip. More importantly, the recently discovered optically addressable spin defects in hBN provide a quantum interface between photons and electron spins for quantum sensing applications. The most well-studied hBN spin defects, the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB−) spin defects, have been used for quantum sensing of static magnetic fields, magnetic noise, temperature, strain, nuclear spins, paramagnetic spins in liquids, RF signals, and beyond. In particular, hBN nanosheets with spin defects can form van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with other 2D materials for in situ quantum sensing and imaging. This review summarizes the rapidly evolving field of quantum sensing with spin defects in hBN. We introduce basic properties of hBN spin defects, quantum sensing protocols, and recent experimental demonstrations of quantum sensing and imaging with hBN spin defects. We also discuss methods to enhance their sensitivity. Finally, we envision some potential developments and applications of hBN spin defects.",

The angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments help confirm the existence of linear Dirac (Weyl) cone and Fermi arc. Meantime, the transport experiments are very important for its intimate relationship with possible applications. In this concise review, recent developments of quantum transport in two typical topological semimetals, namely Dirac and Weyl semimetals, are described. The 3D Dirac semimetal phase is revealed by the Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations. The Weyl Fermions-related chiral anomaly effect is evident by negative magnetoresistance, thermal power suppression, and nonlocal measurements. The Fermi arc mechanism is discussed and several corresponding transport evidences have been described. The point contact-induced superconductivity in Dirac and Weyl semimetal is also introduced. Perspectives about the development of topological semimetals and topological superconductors are provided.",

Certain metal nanoparticles support localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) which convert incident light to strong electromagnetic fields, hot carriers, or heat for directing and improving chemical reactions. By combining plasmonically active metals with traditionally catalytic metals, bimetallic nanostructures promote simultaneous light conversion and strong molecular adsorption, expanding the library of light-controlled reactions. In this review, we cover three bimetallic geometries: antenna–reactor, core-shell, and alloyed nanoparticle systems. Each geometry hosts its own set of intermetallic interactions which can affect the photocatalytic response. While antenna–reactor systems rely exclusively on optical coupling between the plasmonic and catalytic metal to enhance reactivity, core-shell and alloy architectures introduce electronic interactions in addition to optical effects. These electronic interactions usually dampen the plasmonic response but also offer the potential for enhanced reactivity and product specificity. We review both state-of-the-art bimetallic photocatalysts as well as emerging research opportunities, including leveraging quantum effects, new computational methods to understand and predict photocatalysts, and atomic-scale architecting of materials.",

In addition to electron and photon, phonon, is another important energy and information carrier in nature. Without any doubt, exploration of the phonon coherence and its impact on thermal conduction will markedly change many aspects in broad applications for heat control and management in the real world. So far, the application of coherent effect on manipulation of phonon transport is a challenge work. In this article, we review recent advances in the study of the phonon coherent transport in nanomaterials and nanostructures. We first briefly look back the classical and quantum theory of coherence. Next, we review the progresses made in the understanding of phonon coherence in superlattice, nanowires and nanomeshes, respectively, focus on the effect of phonon coherence on thermal conductivity. Finally, we introduce the recent advances in the direct detection of phonon coherence using optical coherence theory.",

Three different mechanisms: a combination of inversion and time-reversal symmetry, mirror reflection symmetry, and non-symmorphic symmetry, and their robustness under the effect of spin orbit coupling are discussed.

In this review, we summarize recent progress in understanding calving processes and representing them in the models needed to predict future ice sheet evolution and sea-level rise. We focus on two main types of calving models: (1) discrete element models that represent ice as assemblages of particles linked by breakable bonds, which can explicitly simulate fracture and calving processes; and (2) continuum models, in which calving processes are parameterized using simple calving laws. With a series of examples using both synthetic and real-world ice geometries, we show how explicit models are yielding a detailed, process-based understanding of system physics that can be translated into predictive capability via improved calving laws.",

Then we explain how these nodes can be composed into a network with arbitrary connectivity, including coherent feedback channels, using algebraic rules, and how to derive the dynamics of network components and output fields. The second part of the review discusses several extensions to the basic SLH framework that expand its modeling capabilities, and the prospects for modeling integrated implementations of quantum input-output networks. In addition to summarizing major results and recent literature, we discuss the potential applications and limitations of the SLH framework and quantum input-output networks, with the intention of providing context to a reader unfamiliar with the field.",

However, the conventional methods, which are based on fully coherent optics approaches, introduce several adverse effects such as speckles noise in the generated beams and susceptible to be disturbed in complex environment (e.g. turbulent atmospheres), because of the sensitive coherent light-matter interaction. To overcome those side effects, a new protocol relied on the partially coherent beam shaping has been developed. By elaborately tailoring the complex spatial coherence structure of a partially coherent beam, the desired beam profile and trajectory with high beam quality and robust propagation feature in complex environment can be generated. In this review, we present an overview of such unconventional partially coherent beam shaping with a focus on the important role of the complex spatial coherence structure engineering. Partially coherent beam shaping not only provides an efficient means for resisting the disadvantages in coherent optics methods but also enables new applications in novel optical imaging and tweezers.",

We first explain that the flat bands can be classified into two classes: singular and non-singular flat bands, based on the presence or absence of the singularity in the flat band's Bloch wave functions. The singularity is generated by the band crossing of the flat band with another dispersive band. In the singular flat band, one can find a special kind of eigenmodes, called the non-contractible loop states and the robust boundary modes, which exhibit nontrivial real-space topology. Then, we review the experimental realization of these topological eigenmodes of the flat band in the photonic lattices. While the singularity of the flat band is topologically trivial, we show that the maximum quantum distance around the singularity is a bulk invariant representing the strength of the singularity which protects the robust boundary modes. Finally, we discuss how the maximum quantum distance or the strength of the singularity manifests itself in the anomalous Landau level spreading of the singular flat band when it has a quadratic band-crossing with another band.",

Particular emphasis is laid on the question what constraints ensue from the functional form of a potential, e.g., in what way Cauchy relations for elastic tensor elements can be violated and what this entails for the ratio of defect and cohesive energies, or why the ratio of boiling to melting temperature tends to be large for potentials describing metals but small for short-ranged pair potentials. The review is meant to be pedagogical rather than encyclopedic. This is why we highlight potentials with functional forms sufficiently simple to remain amenable to analytical treatments. Our main objective is to provide a stimulus for how existing approaches can be advanced or meaningfully combined to extent the scope of simulations based on empirical potentials.",

Following photo-absorption of a pump pulse and the initial electronic thermalization, the dynamics of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom is dominated by electron-phonon and phonon-phonon scattering processes.The two-temperature model (TTM) and its generalizations -- as, e.g., the non-thermal lattice model (NLM) -- provide valuable tools to describe these phenomena and the ensuing coupled electron-phonon dynamics over timescales ranging between few hundreds of femtoseconds and tens of picoseconds. While more sophisticated theoretical approaches are nowadays available, the conceptual and computational simplicity of the TTM makes it the method of choice to model thermalization processes in pump-probe spectroscopy, and it keeps being widely applied in both experimental and theoretical studies. In the domain of ab-initio methods, the time-dependent Boltzmann equation (TDBE) ameliorates many of the shortcomings of the TTM and it enables a realistic and parameter-free description of ultrafast phenomena with full momentum resolution. After a pedagogical introduction to the TTM and TDBE, in this manuscript we review their application to the description of ultrafast process in solid-state physics and materials science as well as their theoretical foundation.",

    "abstract": "This concise review aims to provide a summary of the most relevant recent experimental and theoretical results for solitons, i.e. self-trapped bound states of nonlinear waves, in two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) media. In comparison with commonly known one-dimensional solitons, which are, normally, stable modes, a challenging problem is the propensity of 2D and 3D solitons to instability, caused by the occurrence of the critical or supercritical wave collapse (catastrophic self-compression) in the same spatial dimensions. A remarkable feature of multidimensional solitons is their ability to carry vorticity; however, 2D vortex rings and 3D vortex tori are subject to a strong splitting instability. Therefore, it is natural to categorize the basic results according to physically relevant settings which make it possible to stabilize fundamental (non-topological) and vortex solitons against the collapse and splitting, respectively. The present review is focused on schemes that were recently elaborated in terms of Bose-Einstein condensates and similar photonic setups. These are two-component systems with spin-orbit coupling, and ones stabilized by the beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang effect. The latter setting has been implemented experimentally, giving rise to stable self-trapped quasi-2D and 3D quantum droplets. Characteristic examples of stable three-dimensional solitons: a semi-vortex (top) and mixed-mode (bottom) modes in the binary Bose-Einstein condensate, stabilized by the spin-orbit coupling.",

In this review, we summarize recent results obtained by IR-spectroscopy applied in a reflection-geometry to macroscopic oxide monocrystals. These results provide new insights in the adsorption and subsequent reactions and photoreactions of molecules on these highly interesting, very complex class of materials.

According to the recent reports, perovskites are promising to greatly improve responsivity, detectivity, noise equivalent power, linear dynamic range, and response speed of photodetectors. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite-based photodetectors in terms of the progress in various low-dimension perovskites, and the recent effective approaches to enhance the performance of perovskite photodetector based on the interfacial engineering in perovskite heterostructures.

These problems are probably main goals in any search for new configurations and new emerging properties, independently of the degree of complexity of suggested methods. Fortunately, fabrication techniques in photonics have consolidated during the last decades, allowing the experimental implementation of different theoretical ideas which were neither tested nor validated. Specifically, we will focus on recent advances in the implementation of Flat Band (FB) photonic systems. FB periodical structures have at least two bands in their linear spectrum, with one of them completely flat. This implies the emergence of linear photonic states which are completely localized in space and that can be located in different regions across the lattice. This localization occurs as a result of destructive interference, what naturally depends on the particular lattice geometry. In addition, flat band systems also posses dispersive states which make possible the observation of ballistic transport as well. Therefore, FB photonic lattices constitute an unique platform for studying localization and transport, without requiring the inclusion of any sophisticated interaction/effect, rather a smart and simple geometry.",

Soon afterwards, the progress was very rapid; in the space of 2–3 years, operating temperatures were raised, single-mode DFB devices were produced, applications as local oscillators in heterodyne transceivers were implemented, frequency coverage was extended to the whole 1–5 THz region. In the last few years, technological advancement has continued to improve performances: the maximum operating temperature has now reached about 250 K and about 1 W peak output power has been demonstrated. Several beam engineering techniques have been implemented, with the scope of enhancing spectral purity, improving beam quality and achieving vertical emission. In parallel, various approaches have been devised that allow frequency tunability of the emitted light, with the most efficient schemes achieving a tuning range of about 10% of the central emission frequency. Even the generation of frequency combs directly from THz QCLs has been obtained, by employing dispersion compensated waveguides and an intrinsic material non-linearity. This manuscript reviews the physics underlying the operation of THz QCLs, the technology developed to advance laser performances, and highlights the latest most promising progresses in this fascinating area of opto-electronics.",

In nanoalloys, strain can arise because of finite size, morphology, domain structure and lattice mismatch between their atomic compounds. Strain can strongly affect the functional properties of nanoalloys, as it alters their electronic energy levels. Moreover, atomic-level strain generates atomic-level stress, which in turn results in distortions induced by strain. When the stress accumulated in a nanoalloy exceeds a certain level, the particle can relax that stress by undergoing structural transitions such as shape and/or chemical ordering transitions. Atomic-level strain is then a powerful tool to control and manipulate the structural and functional properties of nanoalloys. This requires a combined theoretical and experimental approach both to deeply understand the physical origin of strain, and to characterize it with a sub-angstrom resolution. Here, we present a theoretical analysis of the main sources of strain in nanoalloys, we analyse how atomic-level strain can be experimentally measured with transmission electron microscopy, we discuss its effect on the functional properties of nanoalloys, finally we describe how atomic-level stress arises from atomic-level strain, and how stress can induce structural transformations at the nanoscale.",

The method enables formation of novel glasses, amorphous phases, and metastable crystalline forms that are not easily accessed when nucleation and growth can readily occur at a container interface. Removing the container enables the use of a wide variety of process atmospheres to modify a materials structure and properties. In the past decade levitation methods, including acoustic, aerodynamic, electromagnetic, and electrostatic, have become well established sample environments at X-ray synchrotron and neutron sources. This article briefly reviews the methods and then focuses on the application of aerodynamic levitation to synthesize and study new materials. This is presented in conjunction with non-contact probes used to investigate the atomic structure and to measure the properties of materials at extreme temperatures. The use of aerodynamic levitation in research using small and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, XANES, and neutron scattering are discussed in the context of technique development. The use of the containerless methods to investigate thermophysical properties is also considered. We argue that structural motifs and in the liquid state can potentially lead to the fabrication of materials, whose properties would differ substantially from their well known crystalline forms.",

    "abstract": "Nature uses self-assembly for building supramolecular materials possessing fascinating properties (self-healing, adaptive, reconfigurable and responsive) that are fundamental for many complex biological functions. Artificial supramolecular polymers, composed of monomers that self-assemble via non-covalent interactions, are attracting increasing interest as platforms for building innovative materials, as these possess similar bioinspired dynamic properties. However, their design still relies on an inefficient/expensive trial-and-error approach. A key question is how to design the monomers to control the properties of the supramolecular polymer. Most often, obtaining from the experiments molecular-level information on how to control these assemblies is prohibitively difficult. Molecular modelling is a fundamental support in this field, allowing investigation of the supramolecular polymer from a privileged point of view and at high-resolution. Such a 'virtual microscope' can provide information on the factors that control supramolecular polymer structure and dynamics, on the monomer–monomer interactions and their cooperativity that are precluded to the experiments, paving the way to structure–property relationships useful to advance the rational design of such materials. This review discusses the state of the art of molecular modelling and simulation of supramolecular polymers. The field is advancing quickly. But the detailed insight that can be reached and the continuous technical developments promise that this is only the beginning.",

    "abstract": "Weyl semimetals are a new member of the topological materials family, featuring a pair of singly degenerate Weyl cones with linear dispersion around the nodes in the bulk, and Fermi arcs on the surface. Depending on whether the system conserves or violates Lorentz symmetry, Weyl semimetals can be categorized into two classes. Photoemission spectroscopy measurements have confirmed the TaAs class and WTe2 class of Weyl semimetals as type-I and type-II, respectively. This review article aims to elucidate and elaborate on the basic concepts of Weyl semimetals and quasiparticle interference experiments on both type-I and type-II Weyl semimetals. The versatile results which reveal (1) the topological sink effect of the surface carriers, the unique feature of the Fermi arc state; (2) the weakly bound nature of the Fermi arc surface state; (3) the orbital-dependent scattering channels on the surface; (4) a mirror symmetry-protected surface Dirac cone, are summarily discussed. Finally, a perspective toward the future applications of quasiparticle interference techniques on topological materials is presented.",

Instead, they involve electron density delocalization. In this work, we outline the studies of electronic structures of the H-bond systems in water systems and biological organic molecules systems. Theoretical researches based on the first-principles method have found important evidences for electron density delocalization in H-bond region. Topological analysis based on natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis proves that during the formation of the H-bonds, electrons transfer from B orbitals to A–H anti-bond orbitals. Energy decomposition analyses revealed that the delocalized electronic structures show strong relations with orbital interactions. Moreover, penetrating molecular orbitals (MOs) are proved to contribute to the electron density delocalization of the H-bonds, and the quantitative contributions for such MOs could be obtained with the electronic density projected integral (EDPI) method. The electronic delocalization and the corresponding penetrating MOs could be visualized in water clusters, based on the first-principles method. These researches open a new sight for understanding the electronic structures of H-bonds from atomic level, and even contribute to further controlling proton tunneling as well as charge and energy transfer processes.",

At low intensities, optical response of a material scales linearly with the amplitude of the electric field. However, at high intensities, light–matter interactions become more complicated leading to such fascinating nonlinear effects as self-focusing, soliton propagation, and high-harmonic generation. Although the field of nonlinear optics was developing for many decades since the invention of lasers, nonlinear optical materials available to date are still limited by either slow materials' response time in such phenomena as saturable absorption, photorefractive effect, and thermal nonlinear phenomena, or by relatively low and generally band-limited nonlinear susceptibilities responsible for ultra-fast nonlinear processes. The emergence of metamaterials is likely to revolutionize nonlinear optics, enabling to low-power, compact, and ultra-fast applications of nonlinear optical phenomena. We review a subset of recent progress in theoretical and experimental studies of nonlinear optical properties and phenomena enabled by the unique properties of engineered optical media. We discuss new regimes of nonlinear optical interactions enabled by judiciously designed metamaterials; review fundamental limit of nonlinear optical phenomena and several metamaterial-based approaches to enhancing nonlinearities at optical frequencies; and consider engineered nonlinear properties of soft matter-based nonlinear media.",

Phonons do not only act destructively in quantum dots by introducing dephasing, they also offer new opportunities, e.g. in state preparation protocols. Apart from being an interesting model systems for studying fundamental physical aspects, quantum dot and quantum dot-microcavity systems are a hotspot for many innovative applications.

    "abstract": "Controlling the motion of liquid drops in contact with a solid surface has broad technological implications in many different areas ranging from textiles to microfluidics and heat exchangers. The wettability of a surface is determined by specifying the apparent contact angle and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) that depend on the surface chemistry and morphology. The presence of chemical inhomogeneity and morphological disorder usually increases CAH. A liquid substrate, whose surface is atomically flat and homogenous, is then expected to exhibit a very low CAH. Low CAH determines high drop mobility, while high CAH favours drop pinning. Very slippery surfaces with exceptional omniphobicity are obtained by impregnating a textured solid with a lubricant. To guide and control the motion of drops, the solid surface can be decorated with suitable chemical patterns. In this review, we briefly outline the main results obtained in the past few years to passively control drop motion and produce robust omniphobic surfaces, highlighting some of the most promising applications of these novel functional surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Topological nodal-line semimetals offer an attractive research platform for exploring a variety of novel phenomena, which have attracted great research interest in the past decade. There are three unique features of the nodal-line semimetals: (i) band crossing along the closed loop that carries π Berry phase, (ii) torus-shaped Fermi surface as the Fermi energy deviates from the nodal loop, and (iii) drumhead-like surface states induced by the band topology, which comprise the main scenarios for most of its electronic properties. Here, we review recent progress on the quantum transport theory of nodal-line semimetals. We show that the properties (i) and (ii) result in a fascinating interplay between the effective dimensionality of electron diffusion and the band topology, which may give rise to 3D weak localization or 2D weak anti-localization effect that can be probed by the magnetoconductivity induced by a weak magnetic field. Moreover, (i) and (ii) can also be revealed by the pattern of the Shubnikov–de Hass oscillation in a strong magnetic field. For the massive nodal-line semimetals with spin-orbit coupling, we show that the magnetic field can induce a topological Lifshitz transition of the Fermi torus from genus 1 to 0. Interestingly, the Lifshitz transition is in good coincidence with the sign reversal of the magnetoresistivity. Compared to the conventional Fermi sphere, the Fermi torus possesses multiple reflection channels, which may give rise to novel scattering processes such as anomalous Andreev reflection at the interface between the semimetal and a superconductor. Besides the bulk states, the drumhead surface states also possess interesting properties. It is shown that the spin polarization of the surface states can induce resonant spin-flipped reflection, which can be detected through both spin and charge transport measurements. We also briefly review the recent experimental progress on the transport properties of nodal-line semimetals and compare the results with the theoretical predictions.",

Recently, DL, a subset of machine learning methods using neural network (NN) algorithms, has been introduced in the field of nanophotonics as an effective way to capture a complex nonlinear relationship between design parameters and their corresponding optical properties. In particular, among various fields of nanophotonics, DL applications to topological photonics empowered by NN models have shown astonishing results in capturing the global material properties of topological systems. This review presents fundamental concepts of topological photonics and the basics of DL applied to nanophotonics in parallel. Recent studies of DL applications to topological systems using NN models are discussed thereafter. The summary and outlook showing the potential of taking data-driven approaches in topological photonics research and general physics are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The input power-induced transformation of the transverse intensity profile at the output of graded-index multimode optical fibers from speckles into a bell-shaped beam sitting on a low intensity background is known as spatial beam self-cleaning. Its remarkable properties are the output beam brightness improvement and robustness to fiber bending and squeezing. These properties permit to overcome the limitations of multimode fibers in terms of low output beam quality, which is very promising for a host of technological applications. In this review, we outline recent progress in the understanding of spatial beam self-cleaning, which can be seen as a state of thermal equilibrium in the complex process of modal four-wave mixing. In other words, the associated nonlinear redistribution of the mode powers which ultimately favors the fundamental mode of the fiber can be described in the framework of statistical mechanics applied to the gas of photons populating the fiber modes. This description has been corroborated by a series of experiments by different groups. However, some open issues still remain, and we offer a perspective for future studies in this emerging and controversial field of research.",

    "abstract": "Future wireless systems integrating communication and sensing will require handling an enormous amount of data with extremely low latency. Intense video streaming data traffic, pervasive-augmented and virtual reality services, advanced haptic–tactile interaction and holography-type communications, in fact, reveal a trend towards experience-based networks and multi-sense media, which require seamless connectivity and ultra-high capacity. Using current 5G technologies to take mentioned challenges, might not represent the desired solution and a completely new paradigm is needed. Recently, to support this change, scientists have been focusing on the concept of Smart Electromagnetic Environments (SEE), based on deploying a number of smart nodes, whose electromagnetic response needs to be finely adapted to the changing operative conditions. In this framework, a pivotal role is played by reconfigurable intelligent metasurfaces, allowing the implementation of smart skins, reflecting intelligent surfaces, smart repeaters, and intelligent antennas. This paper aims at offering an insightful review of the role of intelligent metasurfaces in advancing the concept of SEE. Different application domains will be illustrated: advanced signal processing at the physical layer, a new generation of smart antennas whose intelligence is enabled by the physical layer, and practical implementation of reflecting intelligent surfaces. With an in-depth analysis of these areas, this review sheds light on how intelligent metasurfaces drive innovation in wireless communication shaping the future of SEEs.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of various chips towards high performance and integration, the 'thermal barrier' difficulty facing electronic devices has become ever increasingly challenging, while at the same time the space size left for thermal management system already becomes much narrower. In view of the intermittent operation or short-time large power consumption of some electronic devices, the thermal management technology based on phase change materials (PCMs) has received more and more attention. Among those cutting edge PCMs, the liquid metal phase change materials (LMPCMs) especially have aroused much interest due to their outstanding merits in thermal conductivity, energy storage density and stability. In this article, the representative works on LMPCMs are comprehensively reviewed. First, the thermophysical parameters of LMPCMs characterized by high thermal conductivity and large density are summarized. Then, some basic research cases on the thermophysical properties of metallic PCMs that are worthy of further investigation are briefly introduced. In view of the serious supercooling problem of the LMPCMs, the factors affecting the supercooling degree of liquid metal (LM), particularly the thermal history effect, based on the nucleation theory, are presented. Strategies for suppressing supercooling using nucleating agents and crystal species as well as external fields are also introduced. In addition, the mathematical models and related numerical algorithms for interpreting the phase change heat transfer mechanisms of LM are illustrated. Finally, the performance advantages of LMPCMs over other PCMs, as well as the technical approaches to further improve various properties of LMPCM heat sinks, are demonstrated by showing typical application cases. Based on the above, the current research status of LMPCMs and promising future research hotspots are prospected.This review is expected to help researchers interested in LMPCMs to quickly grasp the performance, heat transfer evaluation methods, and research status of LMPCMs, and also to provide a guidance for engineers in related fields to conduct further design and practices.",

    "abstract": "Conversion of energy at the gas–solid interface lies at the heart of many industrial applications such as heterogeneous catalysis. Dissipation of parts of this energy into the substrate bulk drives the thermalization of surface species, but also constitutes a potentially unwanted loss channel. At present, little is known about the underlying microscopic dissipation mechanisms and their (relative) efficiency. At metal surfaces, prominent such mechanisms are the generation of substrate phonons and the electronically non-adiabatic excitation of electron–hole pairs. In recent years, dedicated surface science experiments at defined single-crystal surfaces and predictive-quality first-principles simulations have increasingly been used to analyze these dissipation mechanisms in prototypical surface dynamical processes such as gas-phase scattering and adsorption, diffusion, vibration, and surface reactions. In this topical review we provide an overview of modeling approaches to incorporate dissipation into corresponding dynamical simulations starting from coarse-grained effective theories to increasingly sophisticated methods. We illustrate these at the level of individual elementary processes through applications found in the literature, while specifically highlighting the persisting difficulty of gauging their performance based on experimentally accessible observables.",

Furthermore, rotational structure in the spectra of small molecules provides a unique probe for interactions with the superfluid on an atomic scale. This review presents a summary of results and a discussion of recent experimental developments in helium droplet spectroscopy with the emphasis laid on infrared studies.

Electronic shell structure is a natural consequence of quantization of fermionic states in a quantum confinement, where the symmetry of the confining potential creates energetically close-lying sets of states that reflect the symmetry of the potential. It was introduced in cluster physics in early 1980s and initially influenced greatly by the related model of nuclear shell structure from 1950's. Three application areas are discussed consisting of free gas phase clusters, clusters supported by insulating oxides or oxide thin films, and clusters that are synthesized by wet chemistry and stabilized by an organic ligand layer. In all these systems, the concept of electronic shell structure has turned out to be useful to organize a vast amount of observations on abundance, stability, chemical reactivity and optical properties. Although this review focuses on theoretical concepts and computational results, relevant experiments are discussed as well.",

Their common features are the wave orbital angular momentum associated with the circular wave propagation around the axis of wave propagation. In plasmas these waves are called helicons. When particles or waves change the field momentum they experience a pressure and a torque which can lead to useful applications. In plasmas electrons can damp or excite rotating whistlers, depending on the electron distribution function in velocity space. A magnetized plasma is an anisotropic medium in which electromagnetic waves propagate differently than in space. Phase and group velocities are different such that wave focusing and wave reflections are different from those in free space. Electrons experience Doppler shifts and cyclotron resonance which creates wave damping and growth. All media exhibit nonlinear effects which do not occur in free space. Common and different features of vortex waves in different fields will be reviewed.

However, there is a large imbalance between scientific research on plasma physics and applications, which is partly due to the considerable differences in the characteristics of these plasmas compared with those of low-pressure plasmas. This discrepancy is particularly related to the difficulty in performing plasma diagnostics for highly collisional plasmas. Information on electrons (such as the electron density and temperature) is essential since electrons play a dominant role in the generation of active species related to the physical and chemical processes inside the plasma. So far, limited diagnostics have been available for electrons such as Thomson scattering and optical emission diagnostics based on equilibrium models. Here, we review the available diagnostic methods along with their merits and limitations for characterizing electrons in weakly ionized collisional plasmas. Particular attention is paid to continuum radiation-based spectroscopy, which facilitates multidimensional imaging of electron density and temperature. The future impact of these plasmas on relevant fields (i.e. laboratory and industrial plasmas and their applications) is also addressed.",

In addition to counting individual atoms, AMS is also capable to determine both mass number (A) and atomic number (Z). Since an atom (also called a nuclide) is unambiguously characterized by the proton number (Z) and the neutron number (N = A − Z), a rare nuclide can be well separated from possible background events, and extremely low abundances of specific nuclides can be measured. In general, the use of an accelerator system as a mass spectrometer improves the isotope abundance sensitivity by many orders of magnitude as compared to standard mass spectrometry (without an accelerator). In particular, AMS provides the means to measure minute traces of long-lived radioisotopes of cosmogenic and/or anthropogenic origin in essentially every domain of our environment at large. This allows one to use AMS for performing research in many different areas, ranging from archaeology to astrophysics. In this review, an update of the current status of AMS and an outlook to future developments in both technical and applied aspects will be presented.",

However, the predictive power of a computer simulation directly depends on the level of 'realism' that is used to represent the underlying molecular interactions. Here, we report a systematic analysis of many-body effects in halide-water clusters and demonstrate that the recently developed MB-nrg full-dimensional many-body potential energy functions achieve high accuracy by quantitatively reproducing the individual terms of the many-body expansion of the interaction energy, thus opening the door to realistic computer simulations of ionic solutions.",

    "abstract": "Several neurodegenerative disorders arise from the abnormal protein aggregation in the nervous tissue leading tointracellular inclusions or extracellular aggregates in specific brain areas. In case of Alzheimer Disease, the accumulation of the Amyloid Beta peptide in the brain is proposed to be an early important event in the pathogenesis. Despite significant research efforts in this field, the molecular mechanisms of protein misfolding and aggregation remain somewhat unrevealed.Within this framework, computer simulations represent a powerful tool able to connect macroscopic experimental findings to nanoscale molecular events.However, from the computational point of view, insufficient sampling often limits the ability of computer simulations to fully address this point. One of the main challenges of MD simulations is the ability to sample experimentally relevant millisecond to second timescales.The present review describes the applications of molecular dynamics techniques to elucidate the conformational states and the aggregation pathway of the Amyloid Beta peptide responsible for AD. Moreover, the computational studies focused on the impact of Amyloid Beta assemblies on cell membranes will be also described. Finally, the interaction mechanisms between promising small molecules and Amyloid Beta assemblies will be discussed within the field of designing new efficient drugs against neurodegenerative disorders.Abbreviations AD: Alzheimer disease; AB: amyloid beta; ABOs: amyloid beta oligomers; MD: molecular dynamics",

    "abstract": "Dusty plasmas are plasmas containing solid particles in the size range of about 10 nm—10 μm. The particles acquire an electrical charge by collecting electrons and ions from the plasma, or by photo-electron emission if they are exposed to UV radiation. The charged dust particles interact with the electrons and ions, forming a multi-component plasma. Dusty plasmas occur in a number of natural environments, including planetary rings, comet tails, and solar nebulae; as well as in technological devices used to manufacture semiconductor chips, and in magnetic fusion devices. This article focuses on the physics underlying dusty plasmas, which are studied by plasma physicists, aeronomists, space physicists, and astrophysicists. The article begins with an introduction explaining what we mean by a dusty plasma, where they are found, and a summary of their basic properties. The article then presents the fundamental physics of dust charging, forces on dust particles, a description of devices used to produce dusty plasmas, strongly coupled dusty plasmas, collective phenomenon (waves) in dusty plasmas, magnetized dusty plasmas, and the emerging technologies based on dusty plasmas. It concludes with a few perspective comments on how the field has developed historically and the prospects for future advances.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has rapidly become a key method for the analysis and organization of large-scale data in all scientific disciplines. In life sciences, the use of machine learning techniques is a particularly appealing idea since the enormous capacity of computational infrastructures generates terabytes of data through millisecond simulations of atomistic and molecular-scale biomolecular systems. Due to this explosion of data, the automation, reproducibility, and objectivity provided by machine learning methods are highly desirable features in the analysis of complex systems. In this review, we focus on the use of machine learning in biomolecular simulations. We discuss the main categories of machine learning tasks, such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, regression, and classification used in the analysis of simulation data. We then introduce the most popular classes of techniques involved in these tasks for the purpose of enhanced sampling, coordinate discovery, and structure prediction. Whenever possible, we explain the scope and limitations of machine learning approaches, and we discuss examples of applications of these techniques.",

    "abstract": "Wetting and drying of pores or cavities, made by walls that attract or repel the liquid, is a ubiquitous process in nature and has many technological applications including, for example, liquid separation, chromatography, energy damping, conversion, and storage. Understanding under which conditions intrusion/extrusion takes place and how to control/tune them by chemical or physical means are currently among the main questions in the field. Historically, the theory to model intrusion/extrusion was based on the mechanics of fluids. However, the discovery of the existence of metastable states, where systems are kinetically trapped in the intruded or extruded configuration, fostered the research based on modern statistical mechanics concepts and more accurate models of the liquid, vapor, and gas phases beyond the simplest sharp interface representation. In parallel, inspired by the growing number of technological applications of intrusion/extrusion, experimental research blossomed considering systems with complex chemistry and pore topology, possessing flexible frameworks, and presenting unusual properties, such as negative volumetric compressibility. In this article, we review recent theoretical and experimental progresses, presenting it in the context of unifying framework. We illustrate also emerging technological applications of intrusion/extrusion and discuss challenges ahead.",

The significant literature on interactions with single crystal metal surfaces should not obscure unknowns in the unique behaviour of ice and the complex relationships between adsorption, diffusion and long-range inter-molecular interactions. Even less is known about the atomic-scale behaviour of water on novel, non-metallic interfaces, in particular on graphene and other 2D materials. In this manuscript, we review recent progress in the characterisation of water adsorption on 2D materials, with a focus on the nano-material graphene and graphitic nanostructures; materials which are of paramount importance for separation technologies, electrochemistry and catalysis, to name a few. The adsorption of water on graphene has also become one of the benchmark systems for modern computational methods, in particular dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT). We then review recent experimental and theoretical advances in studying the single-molecular motion of water at surfaces, with a special emphasis on scattering approaches as they allow an unparalleled window of observation to water surface motion, including diffusion, vibration and self-assembly.",

Herein, we review the recent literature on the synthesis, characterization, simulations, and applications of metal@oxide nanocomposites.

We will show how extreme ultraviolet photon pulses have been successfully deployed in the last seven years to carry out transient grating experiments, mainly performed at the FERMI free electron laser, addressing a variety of scientific questions, ranging from the study of thermal transport in semiconductors approaching the ballistic regime to the modelling of ultrafast demagnetization at the nanoscale.

The paradigm for enabling function extends far beyond carrier accumulation or depletion in band semiconductors or simply moving ions through an insulating electrolyte. Rather, by carefully selecting electronically or structurally fragile materials, one can collapse or open band gaps via extreme ionic dopant concentration, or reconfigure their entire crystal structure to create new phases. Electron–electron and electron–lattice interactions can be coupled or controlled independently in such systems via electric fields without thermal constraints by use of ionic dopants. The unifying theme across these studies is to introduce ions and electrons via electric fields through interfaces, with electrochemistry playing a dominant role. In this review, we briefly summarize this nascent field of iontronics and discuss principal results to date with examples from binary and complex oxides as well as selected 2D materials systems. We conclude the review by highlighting gaps in fundamental scientific understanding and prospects for the use of such novel devices in future electronic, photonic and energy technologies.",

In this realm, the magnetic anisotropy is the critical factor because it prevents the random spin reorientation induced by thermal fluctuation. Extensive theoretical and experimental efforts have been made to enhance the magnetic anisotropy of the magnetic nanostructures to promote the stability of the magnetization, for the potential applications at high temperature. In this review, we will take a series of examples to address how the magnetic properties including the magnetic anisotropy can be manipulated, as well as the underlying mechanism associated with the manipulation. Thorough understanding of the magnetism of magnetic nanostructures not only provides guidance for engineering the magnetic properties in experiment, but also predicts promising candidates for applications in spintronics devices.",

On these scales, the processed material acquires optical, transport or contact properties that do not only rely on local effects on singular topographic features but involve increasingly collective behaviors. Rapid access to sub-100 nm features with intense coherent light represents nevertheless a challenge in laser structuring in view of the optical diffraction limit. Ultrafast non-diffractive beams with controllable time envelopes can overcome this limit and achieve super-resolved processing, a prerequisite for the next generation of flexible and precise material processing tools. They show a remarkable capacity of structuring transparent materials with high degree of accuracy and exceptional aspect ratio. This capacity relies on triggering fast hydrodynamic and material fracture effects with characteristic spatial scales in the nm range. Reviewing the present achievements and technical potential, we discuss from a dynamic viewpoint the physical mechanisms enabling structural features beyond diffraction limit achieved using ultrafast Bessel beams and indicate applications of high technical relevance.",

Picoliter volumes of fluids are remotely controlled and their viscosity precisely measured using microrheometers based on miniscule rotating particles. Theoretical predictions for extraordinarily weak forces related to the presence of dark matter, dark energy and vacuum-induced friction might be revealed, and the surprising properties of light have already been experimentally evidenced. All of these exciting landmarks have only been possible thanks to the torque exerted by light, which enables rotation of an optically trapped particle. Here, we review how light can impart torque on optically trapped particles, paying close attention to the design of the properties of both the particle and the light field. We detail how the maximum achievable rotation speed is limited by the environment, but can simultaneously be used to infer properties of the surrounding medium and of the light field itself. We also review the state-of-the-art applications of light-driven rotors, as well as proposals for the next generation of measurements, particularly at the classical-quantum interface, which can be performed using rotating optically trapped objects.",

    "abstract": "High-order harmonic generation in solids, the nonlinear up-conversion of coherent radiation resulting from the interaction of a strong and short laser pulse with a solid sample, has come to age. Since the first experiments and theoretical developments, there has been a constant and steady interest in this topic. In this paper, we summarize the progress made so far and propose new possibilities for the generation of high-order harmonics with the aid of plasmonic fields. The driven fields could be adequately engineered both spatially and temporally with nanometric and attosecond resolution, offering to the conventional solid-HHG novel and exciting coherent sources. Just to cite an example, the generation of attosecond pulses using bulk matter is strongly linked to the appropriate manipulation of the driven field to avoid, for instance, reaching the damage threshold of the material. Plasmonics fields as an alternative to conventional laser beams could open new avenues in the development of table-top sources of ultrashort and strong coherent radiation.",

The study of excitons has been brought on a new level of detail by the application of photoemission momentum microscopy – a technique that has dramatically extended the capabilities of time- and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Here, we review how the photoelectron detection scheme enables direct access to the energy landscape of bright and dark excitons, and, more generally, to the momentum-coordinate of the exciton wavefunction. Focusing on two-dimensional materials and organic semiconductors, we first discuss the typical photoemission fingerprint of excitons in momentum microscopy and highlight that it is possible to obtain information not only on the electron- but also hole-component. Second, we focus on the recent application of photoemission orbital tomography to such excitons, and discuss how this provides a unique access to the real-space properties of the exciton wavefunction. We detail how studies performed on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides and organic semiconductors lead to very similar conclusions, and, in this manner, highlight the strength of momentum microscopy for the study of optical excitations in semiconductors.",

    "abstract": "Soft tissues carry out their vital biological functions within a dynamic mechanical framework that can be extended or compressed. Externally or internally applied uni-axial or biaxial changes induce longitudinal strains that can be of either sign. The complex interrelationship between applied strain and induced strain is quantified by a time-space change of the Poisson's ratio, which is itself determined by cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions. While the viscoelasticity of multicellular systems under various experimental conditions has already been discussed extensively, the role of the viscoelastic Poisson's ratio, as a vital indicator of tissue compressibility, is only now beginning to be appreciated and explored more thoroughly. Tissues have frequently been treated as incompressible. However, the porous structure of the cell membranes, tissues, and extracellular matrices ensures an outflow of liquid even under relatively modest physiological strain conditions. This study explores a range of tissues and biological composites consisting of multiple cell types and extracellular matrices in the context of compressibility, accompanied by their Poisson's ratio. They are subjected to strains induced by both external and internal factors that mimic physiological conditions.",

However, developing tunable NIR-III ultrashort pulsed lasers is still challenging due to the lack of efficient rare-earth-doped fibers, reviewed in this paper. Overcoming these challenges and achieving wide tunability are possible by implementing methods based on nonlinear optical effects. This review presents recent advances in developing NIR-III fiber lasers, including the explanation of nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation, four-wave mixing, stimulated Raman scattering, soliton self-frequency shift, and supercontinuum generation. In addition, the paper discusses the advantages and drawbacks of each method and makes recommendations for future development trends and improvements.",

It is present at several scales going from elementary particles, to molecules, to macroscopic materials, and even to astronomical objects. During the last 30 years, chirality has also been investigated at the nanoscale, being a hot research topic in nanoscience. The importance of chirality at the nanoscale is due, in part, to the potential applications that chiral nanomaterials could have in nanotechnology. Great interest exists nowadays in the study of chirality in bare and ligand-protected metal nanoclusters. These are aggregates of n metal atoms (n ~ 10–300) that can be in gas phase or stabilized by organic ligands, covering the cluster surface. Chirality in bare and thiolate-protected gold clusters (TPGC) has received special attention because of the important progress achieved in their synthesis, size separation, and precise structural characterization. Here, we review the recent experimental and theoretical developments on the origin and physicochemical manifestations of chirality in bare and TPGC . Since chirality is a geometrical property, we also discuss the proposal for its quantification, and the correlation of this geometric measure with the chiroptical response, like the circular dichroism spectrum, calculated from quantum mechanical methods.",

After a broad introduction placing this effect in the context of new physical chiral-sensitive methods, we review the main characteristics of PECD in terms of molecular photoionization dynamics. We stress also the analytical capabilities of PECD to retrieve enantiomeric excesses (e.es.) and to probe subtle details of the whole molecular potential, some of them exemplified by the showcase camphor and fenchone molecules. We then present the case of the amino acid alanine for which an interplay between PECD and conformer population is rationalized. Based on this study, we propose a photophysical astrophysical scenario for the origin of life's homochirality, relying upon the asymmetry of the associated recoiling alanine parent ion that could lead at the relevant Lyman-α energy to an e.e. of up to 4% in a given line of sight, which appears independent of the temperature. In an attempt to generalize this scenario to other amino acids, new data on proline showing an e.e. of 12%, of the same sign as alanine, are also presented.Abbreviations ARPES: Angle-resolved photoemission; CMS-Xa: Continuum multiple scattering with Xa local-exchange potential; CPL: Circularly polarized light; CD: Circular dichroism; CSM: Circumstellar medium; DPI: Dissociative ionization; HHG: High harmonics generation; HOMO: Highest occupied molecular orbital; ISM: Interstellar medium; KE: Kinetic energy; MS: Mass spectrometry; MW: Microwave; PAD: Photoelectron angular distribution; PECD: Photoelectron circular dichroism; PECD-PICO: Photoelectron circular dichroism / photoion coincidence; PEPICO: Photoelectron / photoion coincidence; PES: Photoelectron spectrum; PV: Parity Violation; REMPI: Resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization; RH: Resistive heating; TD: Thermodesorption; UV: Ultra-violet; VMI: Velocity map imaging; VUV: Vacuum ultra-violet.",

Advancements in deep learning (DL) frameworks based on deep neural networks (DNN) improved accuracy in image recognition, natural language processing, and other applications yet severe data limitations and/or absence of transfer-learning-relevant problems drastically reduce advantages of DNN-based DL.

While the framework of rigidity, elastic phase transitions and topological constraint counting has been extensively used in glass science, its potentially wide applicability has remained difficult because of some inherent limitations of the theory. Here, we review promising methods that have been recently introduced, and which allow to overcome such limitations, and to extend these methods to the case of densified liquids or partially ordered solids, and also to the non-mean-field case. We introduce and describe a several methods based on an explicit account of temperature effects. In addition, the calculation of bond length and bond angle standard deviations is presented, accessed from molecular simulations, which allows to estimate atomic stretching and bending topological constraints as a function of pressure or temperature. These new methods are illustrated through a set of applications ranging from several archetypal glass-forming liquids (SiO2, GexSe1−x, …) to semiconductors (Si-C:H), phase change materials (Ge-Te) and cement, while also emphasizing the role of isostatic composition for the design of stable glasses with reduced ageing. Results furthermore reveal that in certain situations, adaptive isostatic phases appear, and these lead to remarkable physical properties over a finite interval in composition defining an intermediate phase. These features do not seem to be restricted to glasses, and, instead, connect to universal features found in disordered networks.",

Examples include three-dimensional island formation, injection of dislocations, mixing between film and substrate atoms. Their relative importance depends on the specific growth conditions, giving rise to a very complex scenario. The need for an optimal control over heteroepitaxial films and/or nanostructures is widespread: semiconductor epitaxy by molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapour deposition is nowadays exploited also in industrial environments. Simulation models can be precious in limiting the parameter space to be sampled while aiming at films/nanostructures with the desired properties. In order to be appealing (and useful) to an applied audience, such models must yield predictions directly comparable with experimental data. This implies matching typical time scales and sizes, while offering a satisfactory description of the main physical driving forces. It is the aim of the present review to show that continuum models of semiconductor heteroepitaxy evolved significantly, providing a promising tool (even a working tool, in some cases) to comply with the above requirements. Several examples, spanning from the nanometre to the micron scale, are illustrated. Current limitations and future research directions are also discussed.",

Indeed, they have been investigated in colloidal matter, chemical physics and biophotonics, for sensing and control of extreme phenomena. Here we review the last developed theoretical models and recent optical experiments on spatial dispersive shock waves in nonlocal media. Moreover, we discuss observations in novel versatile materials relevant for soft matter and biology.",

    "abstract": "A multitude of ultrafast photoinduced reactions in organic semiconductors are governed by the close interplay between nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. From biological light-harvesting and photoprotection to organic solar cells, the critical electronic dynamics are often precisely synchronized with and driven by nuclear motions, in a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Ultrafast time-domain Raman methods exploit impulsive excitation to generate nuclear wavepackets and track their coherent evolution through these reaction pathways in real time. This tool of vibrational coherence has recently been applied to study singlet fission, a carrier multiplication process with the potential to boost solar cell efficiencies which has been under intense mechanistic investigation for the past decade. In this review, we present the essential features of the spectroscopic techniques and discuss how they have been used to elaborate a new perspective on the singlet fission mechanism. It is now established that ultrafast triplet-pair formation is driven by vibronic coupling, whether fission is exothermic or endothermic, and thus that full understanding of singlet fission requires explicit consideration of nuclear dynamics. Despite broad qualitative agreement between different vibrational coherence methods, differences in the detailed observations and interpretation raise important questions and pose new challenges for future research.",

Although films assembled with metallic clusters or nanoparticles have been predicted to have unusual functional properties, it has been tacitly assumed that cluster-assembled metallic films have the same conduction behavior observed for polycrystalline metallic thin films grown from atoms. Unexpectedly, in the last decade, several studies showed that nanogranular metallic films show a non-linear electric behavior, substantially different from their polycrystalline counterparts. Here we review and discuss the electrical transport properties of cluster-assembled films. Our aim is to provide a background and a common language for the systematic investigation and exploitation of nanogranular metallic thin films where the extremely high density of defects and grain boundaries causes the departure from ohmic behavior.

Here, we review the main progress in this field, with a particular focus on inelastic thermoelectric effects induced by the electron-phonon and electron–photon interactions. We introduce the motivations, the basic pictures, and prototype models, as well as the unconventional effects induced by inelastic thermoelectric transport. These unconventional effects include the separation of heat and charge transport, the cooling by heating effect, the linear thermal transistor effect, nonlinear enhancement of performance, Maxwell demons, and cooperative effects. We find that elastic and inelastic thermoelectric effects are described by significantly different microscopic mechanisms and belong to distinct linear thermodynamic classes. We also pay special attention to the unique aspect of fluctuations in small mesoscopic thermoelectric systems.

    "abstract": "Improving the resolution and sensitivity in all-optical microscopy and spectroscopy is inevitably one of the most important challenges in contemporary optical and nanoscience. Here, we discuss a novel approach, plasmonic nanofocusing, towards broadband, coherent all-optical microscopy with ultrahigh temporal and spatial resolution. The conceptual idea is to launch radially symmetric surface plasmon polariton modes onto the shaft of a sharp, conical metal taper. While propagating towards the apex of the pointed taper, the spatial extent of the plasmonic mode gradually shrinks, from several microns in diameter to a spot size of less than 10 nm at the pointed apex of the conical taper. Concomitantly, the local field amplitude of the plasmon mode gradually increases, resulting in a pronounced field enhancement at the apex and – thus – a bright and spatially isolated coherent light source with dimensions far below the diffraction limit. In this review, we characterize the optical properties of such three-dimensional conical metal tapers and demonstrate nanofocusing of radially symmetric plasmon modes. We use this nanolight source for coherent light scattering spectroscopy and demonstrate the sensitivity enhancement resulting from the pronounced spatial field confinement. It is shown that such off-resonant plasmonic nanoantennas facilitate the creation of nanofocused light spots with few-cycle time resolution. As a first application of this ability to nanolocalize ultrashort plasmon wavepackets, we demonstrate remotely-triggered multiphoton-induced photoemission from the very apex of the taper and implement this novel ultrafast electron gun in a point-projection electron microscope. Our results not only indicate the favourable optical properties of this plasmonic nanolens but also suggest that it may find interesting applications in ultrafast scanning optical spectroscopy and might enable new types of ultrafast electron holography and scanning tunnelling microscopy.",

The applicability of these two dimensional materials in future electronic architectures requires a thorough understanding of the electrical transport mechanisms as well as of the factors limiting the device performance. The study of slow time-varying fluctuations in resistance, often called the 1 / f noise, offers deep insight into the electronic transport and scattering mechanisms, and also acts as a performance benchmark. Here we review the current status on the magnitude and microscopic understanding of low-frequency 1 / f noise in two-dimensional electronic materials, with specific focus on graphene, bismuth chalcogenides, and transition metal dichalcogenides. The noise characteristics differ significantly among these systems, and are directly influenced by the band structure, energy dispersion, and screening properties. The noise in field effect devices from van der Waals materials closely compares with or is even lower than that of conduction channels in conventional electronics. The excellent noise performance, when combined with high carrier mobility, energy efficiency and structural flexibility, renders an excellent platform for future electronic, optoelectronic, and sensor applications.",

These mechanical parameters directly influence cell sorting and possibly cell invasion into the extracellular matrix. Spheroid models therefore provide fundamental insights in the relation between cellular mechanics and important physiological processes, such as tissue formation, embryonic tissue remodeling, and cancer metastasis. In this review, we first summarize and compare current biophysical tools that probe mechanics of spheroids either from the outside or from within, then relate spheroid mechanics to cell mechanics and cell-cell adhesion, and subsequently discuss the role of spheroid mechanics alongside surrounding microenvironment parameters in (cancer) cell migration.

    "abstract": "In classical electrodynamics, by motion, it always means a relative movement of two observers in inertia reference frames, so that the covariance of the Maxwell's equations is preserved respectively in two spaces under Lorentz transformation. The energy is thus conservative for the electromagnetic system. The theory for describing the electromagnetic behavior of the charged particles in vacuum space can be well described using the special relativity because of the invariance of the speed of light in vacuum. However, for engineering applications, the media have shapes and sizes and may move with acceleration, and a system may have multiple moving objects that may be correlated or independently under external mechanical triggering. This paper presents the theory for describing the electromagnetic phenomena in this electro-magnetic-mechano system. We mainly introduce the Maxwell's equations for a mechano-driven media system (MEs-f-MDMS) under low-speed approximation (v << c). We concluded that the MEs-f-MDMS are required for describing the electrodynamics inside a moving object that moves not only with accelerated translation motion but also has rotation motion. The classical Maxwell's equations are to describe the electrodynamics in the region where there is no local medium movement. The full solutions of the two regions satisfy the boundary conditions, so that the rotation of the object affects the electromagnetic field at vicinity. The theoretical approaches for solving the MEs-f-MDMS are also presented.",

Both theories have transformed our view of physical phenomena, with QM accurately predicting the results of experiments taking place at small length scales, and GR correctly describing observations at larger length scales. However, despite the impressive predictive power of each theory in their respective regimes, their unification still remains unresolved. Theories and proposals for their unification exist but we are lacking experimental guidance towards the true unifying theory. Probing GR at small length scales where quantum effects become relevant is particularly problematic but recently there has been a growing interest in probing the opposite regime, QM at large scales where relativistic effects are important. This is principally because experimental techniques in quantum physics have developed rapidly in recent years with the promise of quantum technologies. Here we review recent advances in experimental and theoretical work on quantum experiments that will be able to probe relativistic effects of gravity on quantum properties. In particular, we emphasise the importance of using the framework of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime (QFTCS) in describing these experiments. For example, recent theoretical work using QFTCS has illustrated that these quantum experiments could also be used to enhance measurements of gravitational effects, such as Gravitational Waves (GWs). Verification of such enhancements, as well as other QFTCS predictions in quantum experiments, would provide the first direct validation of this limiting case of quantum gravity.",

Here, we review the progress made in the growth of crystalline phase change materials by physical methods, such as molecular beam epitaxy, sputtering, and pulsed laser deposition. First, we discuss the difference and similarities between these physical deposition methods and the crystal structures of Ge2Sb2Te5, the prototype phase change material. Next, we focus on the growth of epitiaxial GST films on (0 0 1)- and (1 1 1)-oriented substrates, leading to the conclusion that (1 1 1)-oriented substrates are preferred for the growth of phase change materials. Finally, the growth of GeTe/Sb2Te3 superlattices on amorphous and single crystalline substrates is discussed.",

Molecular units provide well defined environment to electronic spins and they represent elementary bricks for complex nano-architectures and nano-devices. Here we review our recent efforts and results on their efficient integration in circuit Quantum ElectroDynamics and, more specifically, in reaching their coherent coupling with microwave photons in planar resonators. To monitor molecular spin performances over a wide temperature and magnetic field range we have first developed microwave planar resonators made of high T c superconductors, obtaining excellent performances up to liquid Nitrogen temperature and in magnetic fields up to 7 Tesla. Ensembles of different molecular spins systems are then systematically tested. The regime of high spin-photon cooperativity is achieved with molecular spins diluted in non-magnetic matrix at 0.5 K, while the strong coupling regime is observed with concentrated samples of organic radicals up to 50 K. The possibility to create coherent states among distinct spin ensembles is further explored in similar spectroscopic experiments. These results show that molecular spins can be efficiently integrated in quantum devices.",

The main focus in investigating these light–matter interactions and nanostructures is to control the light via light on the nanometric length scale and ultrafast timescale, not achievable by present photonic or electronic technologies. Here, we provide a concise description of the relevant background physics and an overview of the manifestations, challenges and applications of weak and strong exciton-SPP interactions. It is now well established that semiconductor-metal hybrid nanostructures offer exciting opportunities to investigate intriguing quantum phenomena and many-body interactions in condensed matter systems even at room temperature. We also review how exciton-SPP interactions have been influencing various research directions. It is amply evident that a comprehensive understanding of these interactions may play an important role in several research areas. The recent progress made in this field is expected to give rise to novel applications of active plasmonic structures.Synopsis The ability of surface plasmon polaritons to localize light on the nanoscale dimensions results in a strong field enhancement, enabling efficient intensification of light–matter interaction with excitons in semiconductors. Two interaction regimes, weak and strong coupling are identified. Both these regimes exhibit intriguing quantum mechanical physical effects and are promising for diverse applications. Interestingly, unlike in pure atomic systems, in semiconductor-metal hybrid structures, these quantum-optical effects are observable even at room temperature.",

One particularly interesting system is synthetic soft matter, which plays a central role in numerous fields ranging from life sciences, chemistry to condensed matter and biophysics. In this paper, we review briefly the optical force-induced nonlinearities in colloidal suspensions, which can give rise to nonlinear self-trapping of light for enhanced propagation through otherwise highly scattering media such as dielectric and plasmonic nanosuspensions. We then focus on discussing our recent work with respect to nonlinear biological suspensions, including self-trapping of light in colloidal suspensions of marine bacteria and red blood cells, where the nonlinear response is largely attributed to the optical forces acting on the cells. Although it is commonly believed that biological media cannot exhibit high optical nonlinearity, self-focusing of light and formation of soliton-like waveguides in bio-soft matter have been observed. Furthermore, we present preliminary results on biological waveguiding and sensing, and discuss some perspectives towards biomedical applications. The concept may be developed for subsequent studies and techniques in situations when low scattering and deep penetration of light is desired.",

Such technologies would enable us to manipulate nanomaterials, such as molecules, quantum dots, and nanocarbons, in a direct and selective way according to their individual quantum properties. Laser cooling and laser tweezers have been established as methods of remote manipulation of small objects for the atomic and micro-sized regimes, respectively. Despite the great successes of these technologies, the optical manipulation of nanoscale materials is still challenging because the thermal disturbance from the environment must be overcome by the very weak force on nanoscale objects. Technologies for selectively manipulating individual nanomaterial would enable the creation of structural order through optical sorting and isolation of targets according to their quantum individualities, and enable manipulation of chemical processes by selective control of molecular diffusion and condensation. In this article, we review recent studies on optical force on nanomaterials, mainly focusing on that arising from the linear and nonlinear optical responses due to electronic resonance of nanoparticles, and discuss the possibility of establishing nanoscale optical manipulation that could potentially contribute to the science and technology supporting our daily lives.",

    "abstract": "Manipulating light on the nanometer scale is a challenging topic not only from a fundamental point of view, but also for applications aiming toward the design of miniature optical devices. Nanoplasmonics is a rapidly emerging branch of photonics, which offers variable means to manipulate light using surface plasmon excitations on metal nanostructures. As a spectroscopic phenomenon discovered nearly 40 years ago, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been an active topic of fundamental and applied researches. The dominating electromagnetic enhancement in SERS is caused by surface plasmon resonances. This is a typical example of manipulating light intensity with plasmons. Here, we will review the recent SERS studies related to nanoantenna effects on different metal nanostructures based on electromagnetic enhancement. Three aspects will be the focus in this paper: (1) the coupled nanostructures which act as receiving and emitting antenna that can generate enormous SERS enhancement ~E4 even enough for single molecule SERS. (2) The polarization of SERS at the single molecule limit, including the linear and circular polarizations can be manipulated using designed asymmetric antennas. Such an effect can make the traditional 1/2 and 1/4 wave plates miniaturized to the nanometer scale. (3) Combining nanoantenna and waveguiding effects, remote excitation of SERS can be realized, which may open a new area of single molecule SERS on nanophotonic circuits.",

Particle accelerators produce HIBs with precise particle energies, pulse lengths and pulse shapes with high energy efficiencies of ~30-40%. Higher energy driver efficiency means that a lower fusion energy output is required to construct a HIF power station to supply ~1 GW of electricity. A HIF power station could use about 4 to 5 MJ of HIB energy per shot at a shot rate of ~10 Hz. This review is focused on the direct-drive scheme in HIF. In direct-drive fuel target HIBs deposit their energy into a shell surrounded by a denser tamping outer layer. The DT (Deuterium-Tritium) fusion fuel, with a total mass of several mg, must be compressed to about one thousand times solid density to reduce the input driver energy and to achieve an adequate burn fraction. High-density compression is a major challenge in ICF, requiring that non-uniformity in driver energy deposition be kept lower than a few percent. The axis of an HIB can be made to oscillate sufficiently rapidly to improve the uniformity of energy deposition.",

It remains widely used for different materials processing today, with almost identical configuration to the original version. Through some revision and improved functionalization, ICTPs of several kinds such as DC–RF hybrid ICTP have also been developed. They are also widely adopted for processing of various materials because of their various benefits. Inductively coupled plasma at low pressures are not treated herein: only thermal plasma with high enthalpy. One is modulated induction thermal plasma (MITP), which has a function of controlling the temperature and chemical active fields in the time domain. Another development in ICTP includes changes in the ICTP configuration such as a planar-ICTP and loop-ICTP. These were developed for large-area materials processing.",

Yet, their membrane-bound form and their interfacial-binding site with membrane lipids remain difficult to observe directly. Their binding and unbinding mechanism, the conformational changes of the PMPs and their influence on the membrane structure are notoriously challenging to study experimentally. Molecular dynamics simulations are particularly useful to fill some knowledge-gaps and provide hypothesis that can be experimentally challenged to further our understanding of PMP-membrane recognition. Because of the time-scales of PMP-membrane binding events and the computational costs associated with molecular dynamics simulations, membrane models at different levels of resolution are used and often combined in multiscale simulation strategies. We here review membrane models belonging to three classes: atomistic, coarse-grained and implicit. Differences between models are rooted in the underlying theories and the reference data they are parameterized against. The choice of membrane model should therefore not only be guided by its computational efficiency. The range of applications of each model is discussed and illustrated using examples from the literature.",

In recent years, it was recognized that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with parity-time () symmetry can exhibit entirely real spectra, raising the possibility for extending the quantum theory to complex domain and hence stimulated growing interest in recent years. Many proposals have been presented for realizing -symmetric Hamiltonians in various physical systems. Among them -symmetric coherent atomic gases are special and possess many unique advantages, including the possibility to obtain authentic -symmetric refractive indexes (which have balanced gain and loss in the whole space), the capability to actively control and precisely manipulate system parameters in situ, and the feasibility to acquire large Kerr nonlinearity based on the resonance character between light and atoms. In this article, we review various schemes for the realization of symmetry with coherent atomic gases, elucidate their interesting properties and promising applications. In particular, the non-linear optical effect in the -symmetric atomic gases are described, which may be served as useful building blocks for developing novel photonic devices with active light control at very low power level.",

However, the fragility of quantum states to the effects of measurement and decoherence still poses one of the greatest challenges in quantum technology. An imperative capability in this path is quantum feedback, as it enhances the control possibilities and allows for prolonging coherence times through quantum error correction. While changing parameters from shot to shot of an experiment or procedure can be considered feedback, quantum mechanics also allows for the intriguing possibility of performing feedback operations during the measurement process itself. This broader approach to measurements leads to the concepts of weak measurement, quantum trajectories, and numerous types of feedback with no classical analogs. These types of processes are the primary focus of this review. We introduce the concept of quantum feedback in the context of circuit-QED, an experimental platform with significant potential in quantum feedback and technology. We then discuss several experiments and see how they elucidate the concepts of continuous measurements and feedback. We conclude with an overview of coherent feedback, with application to fault-tolerant error correction.",

However, a small number of Bi(110) islands containing an odd number of layers also coexist during the nucleation stage. In these islands, the top and bottom layers have the BP structure, whereas the inner layers have a bulk-like rhombohedral structure. Upon increasing the deposited amount of Bi atoms beyond a certain critical thickness, the Bi(110) islands transform into Bi(111) islands.

The systems are controlled such that their states follow the desired manners to realize different quantum protocols. However, the decoherence caused by the system-environment interactions causes the states deviating from the desired manners. How to protect quantum resources under the coexistence of active control and passive decoherence is of significance. Recent studies have revealed that the decoherence is determined by the feature of the system-environment energy spectrum: Accompanying the formation of bound states in the energy spectrum, the decoherence can be suppressed. It supplies a guideline to control decoherence. Such idea can be generalized to systems under periodic driving. By virtue of manipulating Floquet bound states in the quasienergy spectrum, coherent control via periodic driving dubbed as Floquet engineering has become a versatile tool not only in controlling decoherence, but also in artificially synthesizing exotic topological phases. We will review the progress on quantum control in open and periodically driven systems. Special attention will be paid to the distinguished role played by the bound states and their controllability via periodic driving in suppressing decoherence and generating novel topological phases.",

The recent progress in these large-area films for electronics, optoelectronics, terahertz, and spintronics applications is briefly reviewed. It is anticipated that with the rapid development of scalable, reliable, and low-cost production techniques and improved functional realization, large-area 2D layered topological semimetals would find the wide commercial applications in electronics, energy and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Since the initial isolation of few-layer graphene, a plethora of two-dimensional atomic crystals has become available, covering almost all known materials types including metals, semiconductors, superconductors, ferro- and antiferromagnets. These advances have augmented the already existing variety of two-dimensional materials that are routinely realized by quantum confinement in bulk-semiconductor heterostructures. This review focuses on the type of material for which two-dimensional realizations are still being actively sought: magnetoelectrics. We present an overview of current theoretical expectation and experimental progress towards fabricating low-dimensional versions of such materials that can be magnetized by electric charges and polarized electrically by an applied magnetic field - unusual electromagnetic properties that could be the basis for various useful applications. The interplay between spatial confinement and magnetoelectricity is illustrated using the paradigmatic example of magnetic-monopole fields generated by electric charges in or near magnetoelectric media. For the purpose of this discussion, the image-charge method familiar from electrostatics is extended to solve the boundary-value problem for a magnetoelectric medium in the finite-width slab geometry using image dyons, i.e., point objects having both electric and magnetic charges. We discuss salient features of the magnetoelectrically induced fields arising in the thin-width limit.",

A stable atomic nucleus could be simply termed as 'strong matter' since its nature is dominated by the fundamental strong interaction. Is there any other form of strong matter? Although nuclei are composed of 2-flavoured (i.e. up and down flavours of valence quarks) nucleons, it is conjectured that bulk strong matter could be 3-flavoured (with additional strange quarks) if the baryon number exceeds the critical value, Ac in which case quarks could be either free (so-called strange quark matter) or localized (in strangeons, coined by combining 'strange nucleon'). Bulk strong matter could be manifested in the form of compact stars, cosmic rays, and even dark matter. This trinity will be explained in this brief review that may impact dramatically on today's physics, particularly in the era of multi-messenger astronomy after the discovery of gravitational wave.",

Mass and radius estimates, which are only available for a fraction (∼ 10%) of the exoplanets, provide an indication of the bulk composition and interior structure and show that the diversity in exoplanets is far greater than in the Solar System. Geophysical studies of the interior of exoplanets are key to understanding their formation and evolution, and are also crucial for assessing their potential habitability since interior processes play an essential role in creating and maintaining conditions for water to exist at the surface or in subsurface layers. For lack of detailed observations, investigations of the interior of exoplanets are guided by the more refined knowledge already acquired about the Solar System planets and moons, and are heavily based on theoretical modelling and on studies of the behaviour of materials under the high pressure and temperature conditions in planets. Here we review the physical principles and methods used in modelling the interior and evolution of exoplanets with a rock or water/ice surface layer and identify possible habitats in or on exoplanets.",

    "abstract": "Topological semimetals are a fascinating class of quantum materials that possess extraordinary electronic and transport properties. These materials have attracted great interests in recent years for their fundamental significance and potential device applications. There have been intensive studies suggested that three-dimensional graphene networks support topological semimetals with two types of continuous nodal lines: one is to form closed nodal rings in Brillouin zone and the other ones traversing the whole Brillouin zone to be periodically connected. Carbon has negligible spin-orbit coupling, non-magnetism and great diversity of allotropes, which makes it very promising in realizing topological nodal line semimetals. Here we review recent efforts in proposing various carbon allotropes to realize these two types of nodal line semimetals. The nodal rings or lines are protected by the coexistence of time reversal and spatial inversion symmetries. When projecting these nodal lines or rings onto the certain surface, drumhead like surface flat bands will appear. Based on these flat bands, Chern insulator and high-temperature superconductor will be induced by electron-electron correlation effects. The recent discoveries of Mott insulator and superconductor in twisted bilayer graphene-related with flat bands have made these reviewed efforts very important and meaningful.",

    "abstract": "Topological constraints are the key to an understanding of how a macrosystem can be different from the simple sum of microelements. The emergence of a macrostructure is a reflection of reduced degrees of freedom, because the realization of all degrees of freedom, on an equal footing, maximizes the entropy and eliminates any inhomogeneity. Here, we formulate topological constraints as foliation of the phase space. A macrohierarchy is, then, a leaf (submanifold) embedded in the total phase space. A plasma confined in a magnetic field is invoked for explaining the organizing principle. In a magnetosphere, the plasma self-organizes to a state with a steep density gradient. The resulting nontrivial structure has maximum entropy in an effective phase space that is reduced by adiabatic invariants and the corresponding coarse-grained angle variables. Formally, the adiabatic invariants may be viewed as Casimir invariants, and the effective phase space is the Casimir leaf. Conversely, we may deem any Casimir invariant as an adiabatic invariant derived by separating a 'micro' conjugate variable; the topological constraint of the Casimir invariant can be unfrozen when the conjugate variable is recovered. We put this interpretation into the test in the context of ideal magnetohydrodynamics which is an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system obeying an infinite number of topological constraints. Diverse structures realized in plasmas are described as creations on different hierarchy of foliation.",

During the field-effect modulation of the semiconducting channel, the gate dielectric always has a significant influence on the charge transport behaviours. Hence, understanding of the nature of charge carriers at the semiconductor/dielectric interface and realizing functional OFETs with superior performance have been the cornerstones for the sustainable advancement in organic electronics. With the joint efforts of predecessors, various basic theories and models have been advanced to describe the charge transport processes in organic crystals. To make a further breakthrough, more accurate correlation between the electrostatic properties of dielectrics and charge carrier behaviours is urgently needed. The high-quality interface-like films, without nonideal factors, two-dimensional molecular crystals (2DMCs), have been spotted as a powerful platform for direct and accurate characterization of the intrinsic charge transport behaviours at the semiconductor/dielectric interface. In this article, the recent breakthroughs in the physics of charge transport, interfacial effects, and perspectives with 2DMCs in OFETs are reviewed, providing great benefits to penetrate the fundamental studies and keep up with the revolutionary advancement in organic-electronics road map.",

In this review article, historical achievements of three different types of collisionless shocks, i.e. magnetohydrodynamic, electromagnetic, and electrostatic (ES) shocks, in theory/simulation, observation in space and astrophysical plasmas, and laboratory experiments are shown. An overview is given on recent progress of collisionless ES shock experiments using high-energy laser systems for two schemes. One is an interaction between laser-produced high-density ablating plasma and a low-density ambient plasma, and the other is an interaction between laser-ablated counter-streaming plasmas using double-plane target. For the former scheme, detailed measurements of structures of collisionless ES shock and ion-acoustic soliton, and the transition from double-layer to collisionless ES shock are conducted by proton radiography. For the latter scheme, optical diagnostics are used to observe global structures of plasmas and shocks; collective laser Thomson scattering method is applied to clarify local plasma parameters, such as electron and ion temperatures, flow velocity, and electron density; and proton radiography is employed to measure a shock electric field. The measured large density-jump, steepening of self-emission profile, plasma parameters in the up- and down-stream regions of a shock, and the narrow width of the shock electric field compared with the ion-ion Coulomb mean-free-path reveal the evidence for the formation of collisionless ES shock.",

Such a clean, renewable energy cycle based on hydrogen is commonly referred to as the hydrogen economy. This review deals with cluster model systems of the three main components of the hydrogen economy, i.e. hydrogen generation, hydrogen storage and hydrogen re-electrification, and their basic physical principles. We then present examples of contemporary research on few atom clusters, both in the gas phase and deposited, to show that by studying these clusters as simplified models a mechanistic understanding of the underlying physical and chemical processes can be obtained.

The bead is ratcheted upward without any apparent external work, by taking advantage of favorable thermal fluctuations. Much of the previous work on such engines aimed to show that accounting for information-processing costs can reconcile the observed motion with the second law of thermodynamics. By contrast, we focus on the factors that limit the performance of such engines by optimizing variously the upward velocity, rate of gravitational free-energy extraction, or ability to track a trajectory. We then consider measurement noise, which degrades engine performance. A naive use of noisy measurements in the feedback algorithm leads to a phase transition at finite signal-to-noise ratio: below the transition, the engine no longer functions. A more sophisticated, 'Bayesian' algorithm eliminates the phase transition and improves performance. Finally, operating the information engine in a nonequilibrium environment with extra force fluctuations can enhance the performance by orders of magnitude, even to the point where the energy extracted exceeds that needed to run the information processing. Autonomous implementations of an information engine in such environments could be powered entirely by the additional energy of the bath.",

The focus is on modelling of protein and peptide, nucleic acid and saccharide-based biopolymer systems, excluding lignocellulose materials. The survey focuses on physics-based models. We cover particle-based simulations methods, including all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD), dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and Langevin and Brownian dynamics (BD) approaches. While these methods capture molecular and particle-level dynamics, a brief overview of also stochastic sampling approaches (Monte Carlo methods) to physics-based models, as well as free energy functional-based methods, i.e. field theory approaches, such as self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and classical density functional theory (cDFT), are provided.",

    "abstract": "Comets display with decreasing solar distance an increased emission of gas and dust particles, leading to the formation of the coma and tail. Spacecraft missions provide insight in the temporal and spatial variations of the dust and gas sources located on the cometary nucleus. For the case of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G), the long-term observations from the Rosetta mission point to a homogeneous dust emission across the entire illuminated surface. Despite the homogeneous initial distribution, a collimation in jet-like structures becomes visible. We propose that this observation is linked directly to the complex shape of the nucleus and projects concave topographical features into the dust coma. To test this hypothesis, we put forward a gas-dust description of 67P/C-G, where gravitational and gas forces are accurately determined from the surface mesh and the rotation of the nucleus is fully incorporated. The emerging jet-like structures persist for a wide range of gas-dust interactions and show a dust velocity dependent bending.",

DNA exhibits many properties, such as high stability, adjustable conductance, vast information storage, self-organising capability and programmability, making it an ideal material in the applications of nanodevices, nanoelectronics and molecular computing. Even though native DNA has low conductance, it can easily be converted into a potential conductor by doping metal ions into the base pairs. Nickel ions have been employed to tune DNA into conducting polymers. Doping of nickel ions within DNA (Ni-DNA) increases the conductivity of DNA by at least 20 folds compared with that of native DNA. Further studies showed that Ni-DNA nanowires exhibit characteristics of memristors, making them a potential mass information storage system. In summary, DNA molecules have promising applications in a variety of fields, including nanodevices, nanomachines, nanoelectronics, organic solar cells, organic light emitting diodes and biosensors.",

These properties are entirely different from those in bulk alkali metals of free-electrons. Alkali-metal clusters are stabilized in cages of zeolites, and new quantum states of s-electrons, such as 1s, 1p, and 1d states in the spherical quantum-well model, are formed. An electron correlation, a polaron effect, and an orbital degeneracy in the quantum states of s-electrons play critical roles in taking on the novel electronic properties. Electronic properties can be overviewed systematically by a coarse-grained model of localized s-electron states in cages based on the tight-binding approximation, followed by the t-U-S-n diagram of the correlated polaron system given by the so-called Holstein–Hubbard Hamiltonian: an electron transfer energy through windows of cages (t), a Coulomb repulsion energy between two s-electrons in the same cage (U), a short-range electron-phonon interaction energy due to the cation displacements (S), and an average number of s-electrons per cage (n). Beyond the jellium background model of alkali-metal clusters, a huge spin-orbit interaction has been observed in the 1p degenerate orbitals of clusters, similarly to the Rashba mechanism.",

Sometimes they form continuous lines and even enclosed loops with knotted or linked topologies in three spatial dimensions. Since the mathematical topology was introduced into physics, from hydrodynamics, condensed matter physics to photonics, and other modern physical fields, scientists have been exploring the related topological essences of vortex knots; hence, the topology is a forefront topic in different physical systems. Owing to the reliability and observability of light in free space, optical vortex knots and links are the most studied physical topologies. Here, we review some of these developments with a focus on optical vortex knots and links. We first introduce the brief historical perspective and structural properties of optical vortices. Then, we trace the progress on the theoretically constructing, experimentally generating, and characterizing methods of topological light fields. Wherein, we review recent developments of holographic metasurfaces and their applications in generating ultrasmall optical vortex knots. At last, we envision the possible challenges and prospects of topological light fields.",

In three-dimensional topological insulators, Dirac semimetals, Weyl semimetals, and other topological nontrivial materials, the topologically nontrivial band structure will add a phase correction to the quantum oscillation patterns, which is known as the nontrivial Berry phase. Berry phase analysis via quantum oscillation is a powerful method to investigate the nontrivial band topology of topological materials. In this review, we introduce the concepts of the Berry phase and quantum oscillations, and provide some classification of topological materials. We then employ some important studies on each type of topological material to discuss the nontrivial Berry phase. We conclude by pointing out the importance of quantum transport studies on topological materials, as well as drawing attention to the exploration of the nontrivial Berry phase in a new material system that could shed more light on the topology-based electronics.",

    "abstract": "Cancer tissues are a heterogeneously multifaceted assembly. Understanding the relationship of tumors with their microenvironment is also required to understand the tumor progression and metastasis better. Like tumors, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is heterogeneous, offering numerous mechanobiological, mechanochemical, and mechanophysical cues. Biomaterials impersonating extracellular matrix (ECM) properties must provide the mechanical cues cells get from their 3D extracellular environment. Pore size is one imperative yet less studied ECM factor implicated in the invasion and migration of the tumor. Several techniques are used to control the pore size of biomaterials constructed for a distinct tissue. Electrospinning is one of the most steadfast techniques for producing scaffolds with the preferred pore size. A comprehensive interpretation of ECM pore size would contribute toward a better understanding of the reciprocal interaction between pore size and tumor progression and can be used as a promising target for cancer treatments. In this review, we abridged the knowledge pertaining to (1) ECM and pore size, (2) the importance of pore size and its interplay with cancer, and (3) current advancement in the field of biomaterials to study pore size. Overall, this review will cover the effect of pore size on tumor cell behavior concerning electrospinning.",

A significant amount of research is focused on improving accident-tolerant fuel (ATF) technologies to enhance the safety features of reactors. Choosing the right material for the fuel-rod cladding is the most crucial part of the nuclear fuel system and is necessary to develop ATF ideas. Concerning their thermomechanical integrity, high-temperature oxidation resistance, irradiation tolerance, and manufacturability for light-water reactors (LWRs), this review offers a thorough benchmarking of three top ATF cladding candidates – silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide composites (SiCf/SiC), iron-chromium-aluminum alloys (FeCrAl), and chromium-coated zirconium alloy (Cr-coated Zr-alloy). Moreover, it addresses the performance metrics gap by elucidating the qualification pathways, including lead test rod campaigns, hermetic joining techniques for SiCf/SiC, weld optimization for FeCrAl, and comprehensive uniformity controls for Cr-coated Zr-alloy. This review further defines an executable R&D plan for the mid-2030s deployment of ATF claddings in current LWR fleets by directly comparing critical criteria and identifying feasible certification and licensing policies.",

    "abstract": "Photoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM) is a powerful and versatile full-field imaging technique based on the cathode lens, achieving lateral resolution down to ten nanometre range at the state of the art. In modern times, it has flourished at synchrotrons, where it has become one of the most sought-after microscopy tools, often referred to as XPEEM. By employing high-intensity, tunable sources of polarised soft X-ray radiation, PEEM enables absorption and photoemission spectroscopy at high lateral and elemental resolution, while also offering sensitivity to the local chemical, electronic, and magnetic structure. To date, surface and thin film magnetism has been one of the most prominent applications of synchrotron PEEM, with current research focusing on domain morphology in nanowires and nanostructures, exotic spin configurations, as well as spin manipulation and transport. On the other hand, the area where this technique has made the most remarkable progress is that of two-dimensional materials, beginning with graphene and rapidly expanding to the broader class of transition metal dichalcogenides. A rich variety of XPEEM applications is reviewed here, emphasising the usefulness of a multimodal experimental approach involving its parent technique, low-energy electron microscopy. XPEEM's ability to perform angle- and spin-resolved photoemission is highlighted as key to providing direct access to the electronic structure, with significant potential for studying a wide range of materials exhibiting quantum or topological properties. Finally, photoemission orbital tomography is introduced, with a focus on its capability to access the electronic structure of complex molecular interfaces at surfaces.",

Often, the ultimate goal is to retrieve the three-dimensional structure, which is very challenging since small species are typically sensitive to electron irradiation. Nevertheless, measuring individual atomic positions is crucial to understand the relation between the structure and physicochemical properties of these (nano)materials. In this review, we highlight the latest approaches that are available to reveal the 3D atomic structure of small species. Finally, we will provide an outlook and will describe future challenges where the limits of electron microscopy will be pushed even further.",

    "abstract": "Current in vitro practices must overcome important challenges to compare favorably with human studies. The limited applicability of conventional in vitro assays and strategies can be explained by the fact that standard approaches do not enable recapitulation of the complexity of human tissues and physiological functions. To address this challenge, novel bioengineering tools, techniques and technologies are rapidly emerging to advance current fundamental knowledge and innovate in vitro practices. For example, organs-on-a-chip have recently appeared as a small-scale solution to overcome the transability, financial and ethical concerns associated with animal studies in drug discovery and development. In parallel, biomimetic interfaces are increasingly recapitulating 3D structures with tissue-like dynamic properties to allow in-depth investigation of disease mechanisms. This review aims at highlighting current bioengineering approaches poised to address the shortcomings of conventional in vitro research practices towards the generation of more effective solutions for improving human health.",

For such studies, atoms, molecules, and atomic clusters in the gas phase may provide us with ideal platforms as various levels of experimental methods and theory are within reach. Developing experimental setups of electron and ion spectroscopies for gas-phase experiments at SACLA, a low-repetition rate X-ray free electron laser facility in Japan, we have studied the interaction of intense, short X-ray pulses with atoms, molecules, and atomic clusters. Via these experimental investigations and modelling efforts, we gain insight into the interaction of these intense pulses with the single-particle targets and extracted the information about how they are modified during the X-ray pulse duration. We summarize these studies in the present review. The information reported here will be important for any XFEL applications as the scattering signal used to image any targets may be strongly influenced by the XFEL-induced dynamics that occur in the target within the pulse duration.",

A brief summary of fractals and their dimensionality is presented and applied to the well-known diffusion limited aggregate (DLA) dendritic construct. Dendrites formed by electrochemical 'self-assembly' are explored and examples given of their formation under different conditions. Stochastic variations in the self-similar Y-shaped symbol that underlies these fractals can carry information, leading to significant entropy, even though the structural entropy of the overall pattern is relatively small.",

    "abstract": "It is now possible to establish the chemical identity of a substance at the ultimate detection limit of a single molecule, i.e. the sensitivity required to probe 1.66 yoctomoles (1/NA), using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). It is also possible to image within an individual molecule, all while retaining chemical selectivity, using tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS). The potential applications of ultrasensitive SERS and TERS in chemical and biological detection and imaging are evident, and have attracted significant attention over the past decade. Rather than focusing on conventional single/few-molecule SERS and TERS experiments, where the objective is ultrasensitive spectroscopy and nanoscale chemical imaging, herein we consider greatly informative, yet significantly underrated, signatures of single molecules. Namely, we review recent efforts ultimately aimed at probing different aspects of a molecule's local environment through a detailed analysis of its SERS and TERS spectra and images. Particular attention is devoted to local electric field imaging using TERS; we describe how the vector components and absolute magnitude of the local electric field may be inferred from molecular Raman signatures. We also propose experiments that can potentially be used to cross-check the insights gained from the described SERS and TERS measurements. The ultimate goal of this review is to demonstrate that there is much more to single-molecule Raman scattering than mere ultrasensitive chemical analysis.",

The ability to cool water very rapidly down to 227 K and to probe it with ultrashort (50 fs) X-ray pulses before freezing has allowed for investigating water structure below the previous limit of homogeneous ice nucleation. It was found that at the temperature where the thermodynamic response functions, such as heat capacity and isothermal compressibility, seem to diverge there is no discontinuous change in structure, but instead an accelerated transformation from a disordered state to a strongly tetrahedral. The ice nucleation rate in bulk-like micron-sized water droplets could be determined for temperatures down to 227 K and was shown to be ~8 orders of magnitude lower than previous data for nanodroplets. The application to X-ray spectroscopy is discussed based on measurements at high X-ray fluence where multiple valence-hole states can be generated. Finally, a perspective to the future is presented regarding X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy with which true equilibrium dynamical properties can be studied.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear frequency generation at the nanoscale is a hot research topic which is gaining increasing attention in nanophotonics. The generation of harmonics in subwavelength volumes is historically associated with the enhancement of electric fields in the interface of plasmonic structures. Recently, new platforms based on high-index dielectric nanoparticles have emerged as promising alternatives to plasmonic structures for many applications. By exploiting optically induced electric and magnetic response via multipolar Mie resonances, dielectric nanoelements may lead to innovative opportunities in nanoscale nonlinear optics. Dielectric optical nanoantennas enlarge the volume of light–matter interaction with respect to their plasmonic counterpart, since the electromagnetic field can penetrate such materials, and therefore producing a high throughput of the generated harmonics. In this review, we first recap recent developments obtained in high refractive index structures, which mainly concern nonlinear second order effects. Moreover, we discuss configurations of dielectric nano-devices where reconfigurable nonlinear behavior is achieved. The main focus of this work concerns efficient Sum Frequency Generation in dielectric nano-platforms. The reported results may serve as a reference for the development of new nonlinear devices for nanophotonic applications.",

The active stabilization keeps the interferometer ultra-stable for several hours with an RMS stability of 13 as and a total pump-probe delay scanning range of ∼400 fs. A tunable femtosecond laser source to drive high-order harmonic generation allows for precisely addressing atomic and molecular resonances. Furthermore, the interferometer includes a spectral shaper in 4f-geometry in the probe arm as well as a tunable bandpass filter in the pump arm, which offer additional high flexibility in terms of tunability as well as narrowband or polychromatic probe pulses. We demonstrate the capabilities of the beamline via experiments using several variants of the RABBIT (reconstruction of attosecond beating by two photon transitions) technique.

Oriented circular dichroism (OCD) has been used to detect orientation changes of peptides in membranes. The inner water columns of peptide-induced pores in membranes were detected by neutron scattering (NS), and pore structures were reconstructed using anomalous X-ray diffraction. Finally, the time evolution of pore formation induced by peptides binding to single GUVs was monitored by the aspiration method.",

In the 10-4-8-type Ca10(Pt4As8)(Fe2−xPtxAs2)5, the divalent As2– produces As2 molecules, and creates an interlayer substance with PtAs4 planar squares. The maximum superconducting transition temperature is 38 K. In the 122-type CaFe2As2, Rh doping induces a lattice collapse transition accompanying the formation of As2 molecules between the adjacent FeAs layers. This transition can be viewed as a valence transition between As3– and As2–. These properties of arsenic that produces various chemical bonds can be used to create new superconducting materials.",

Recently, primary focus has been on improving the efficiency of emitters, i.e. increasing the number of field-emitted electrons and their respective kinetic energies. An example of this is the modification of the conventional metal nanotip through adiabatic nanofocusing and various plasmonic metal structures, such as nanorods and bowtie antenna. The coherent emission control with two color irradiation enabled modulation in the emission yield. In addition, THz waves near the metallic nanostructure induced a highly accelerated, monochromatic energy. Alternative to metallic nanotips, carbon nanotubes are emerging as efficient photoelectron emitters, due to the large enhancement factor associated with their high aspect ratio and damage threshold. They particularly allowed the use of femtosecond light sources with a relatively short wavelength, resulting in the generation of photoelectrons with a narrow bandwidth. Additionally, electronic control over the single-walled nanotubes band structure added a degree of freedom for controlling the electron emission yield. Finally, we review the strong-field tunneling emission in graphene edge, with the emission yield showing an anomalous increase of nonlinear order, corresponding to the deep strong tunneling regime.",

    "abstract": "The extrinsic and intrinsic curvature of a two-dimensional waveguide influences wave propagation therein. While this can already be apprehended from a geometric point of view in terms of geodesics generalizing straight lines as the shortest distance between any two points, in wave optics interference phenomena strongly govern the field evolution, too. Radii of curvature in the order of the wavelength of light modify the local effective refractive index by altering the mode profile. Macroscopic radii only influence light propagation for non-vanishing intrinsic (or Gaussian) curvature. A positive Gaussian curvature leads to refocusing and thus an imaging behavior, whereas negative Gaussian curvature forces the field profile to diverge exponentially. These effects can be explained by an effective transverse potential acting on the electromagnetic field distribution’s envelope. This can also be extended to nonlinear beam propagation. In this review paper we give a thorough introduction to differential geometry in two-dimensional manifolds and its incorporation with Maxwell’s equations. We report on first fundamental experiments in this newly emerging field, which may lead to applications in integrated optical circuits. The close conceptual analogy to phenomena in four-dimensional spacetime with constant curvature as well as toy-models of the Schwarzschild metric and a wormhole topology are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Conducting polymers (CPs) are organic semiconductors that have gained popularity in more recent years as components of bioelectronic devices designed to electrically communicate with biological environments. Synergy between the material and biological tissue, both on a structural and functional level, is paramount for the proper performance of an implantable biomedical device. As such, significant progress has been made on understanding the fundamental impact of the molecular and macro structure of CPs on their functional properties such as conductivity and charge mobility. At the same time, the development of a variety of synthetic approaches has yielded a library of CPs with improved mechanical and electronic properties. Specifically, chemical biofunctionalization of CP films has significantly decreased the foreign body response, the main contributor to device failure. Therefore, this review covers the advances and challenges made in the chemical biofunctionalization of CP films for potential implantable devices. This is achieved by covalently attaching the biocompatible or biofunctional group to the CP backbone via a reactive functional group to create a material with physical and electronic properties that better matches biological tissue. A perspective is presented that this synthetic chemistry approach to biofunctionalization is valuable for the integration of CPs into commercial implantable bioelectronic devices.",

One of the key problems and challenges in condensed matter physics is to understand the phases, properties, and structure of hydrogen as a function of pressure and temperature. Over 80 years ago Wigner and Huntington predicted that if solid molecular hydrogen was sufficiently compressed, it would transform to an atomic metal. Later, a second pathway emerged; it was predicted that if heated to high temperatures under pressure it would transform to liquid atomic hydrogen; this form of metallic hydrogen makes up ~90% of the planet Jupiter. The prediction of high temperature superconductivity of solid atomic metallic hydrogen stimulated the experimental community to produce this material . For decades hydrogen defied the experimental efforts to transform it. Using diamond anvil cells, metallic hydrogen has recently been produced at a pressure of ~5 million atmospheres, significantly greater than the pressure at the center of the earth. Liquid atomic metallic hydrogen has been produced at temperatures of a few thousand degrees Kelvin in diamond anvil cells, as well as in dynamic experiments. We review the seemingly simple, but actually complex properties of this quantum solid and metal and the decades of development and progress to achieve this important fundamental result.",

Undoubtedly, the introduction of metallic structures has opened a path toward light confinement and manipulation at the subwavelength scalea regime that was previously thought to be out of reach in optics. Of central importance is to devise efficient light sources to power up the future nanoscale optical circuits. Coaxial resonators can provide a platform to implement such subwavelength sources. They support ultra-small cavity modes and offer large mode-emitter overlap as well as multifold scalability. Given their large modulation bandwidth, they hold promise for high-speed optical interconnects- where they can be used for light generation and modulation simultaneously. In addition, the possibility of thresholdless operation in such devices may have implications in developing the next generation of efficient lighting systems.

    "abstract": "We present an introductory review of concepts behind micromagnetic simulations, in which magnetic moments representing collections of atomic spins within a material evolve according to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, a generalized torque equation. This evolution is determined by a variety of interactions, including those arising from external fields, magnetostatic and exchange effects, and magnetic anisotropy. Anisotropy is a key ingredient in the Stoner-Wohlfarth model, which provides a quantitative basis for understanding magnetic hysteresis. In turn, hysteresis loops provide a basis for comparing simulations and experiments, and are important, for example, in quantifying the heating response of a sample to an oscillating external magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations bear conceptual similarity to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, but whereas in MD classical potentials are used to naturally model interactions between atoms and/or molecules, the choice of modelling length scale in micromagnetics is less obvious. If effective interactions are determined for, say, two crystallographic unit cells of a material, how interaction parameters should scale with micromagnetic simulation cell size, particularly at finite temperature, is still an area of research. Finally, we discuss the coupling of magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom in simulating atomic and nanoparticle systems. This review is based, in part, on our own experience in modelling hysteretic heating of magnetite nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "Amorphous solids manifest puzzling effects of mysterious degrees of freedom that give rise to a heat capacity and phonon scattering in great excess over what would be expected for a solid that has a unique vibrational ground state. Of particular conceptual importance is the apparent near universality of phonon scattering in amorphous solids made by quenching a liquid. To rationalise this universality, scale-free scenarios have been proposed that either hinge on there being long-range interactions between bare structural degrees of freedom or that invoke long-range criticality stemming from the emergence of marginally stable vibrational modes. In a contrasting, local scenario, the puzzling low-temperature degrees of freedom are, instead, weakly-interacting, strongly anharmonic degrees of freedom each of which involves the motion of a few hundred particles. In this scenario, the universality of phonon scattering comes about because the characteristic energy scale of the local anharmonic resonances and the strength of their interaction with phonons are both set by the glass transition temperature , while their concentration is set by the cooperativity size for dynamics at . The nanoscopic length is manifested in vibrational excitations of the spatial boundary of the resonances, which underlie the so-called Boson peak, and very deep, topological midgap electronic states in glassy semiconductors, which are implicated in a number of strange optoelectronic phenomena in amorphous chalcogenides. I discuss the merits of the above scenarios when confronted with experimental data.",

Two types of bifurcation phenomena in turbulent transport are discussed. One is significant change in the magnitude of the diffusion term and the other is a sign flip of non-diffusive term of transport. The bifurcation of diffusion term magnitude causes the transition to a so-called improved mode such as ion-electron root transition, L-mode to H-mode transition, and ITB formation. In contrast, the bifurcation of non-diffusion term sign causes the intrinsic flow reversal, convection reversal of bulk ion, and impurity ions. Two types of bifurcation phenomena in MHD are discussed. One is the bifurcation of static magnetic topology and the other is the bifurcation of MHD instability. The bifurcation of static magnetic topology is observed in between three magnetic topology (nested magnetic flux surface, magnetic island and stochastic magnetic field) in toroidal plasma. The bifurcation of MHD instability is observed as a parity change of MHD oscillation.

Interfacial charge transfer is primarily responsible for their peculiar electronic structure and optical response. Hence, it is essential to gain insight into this fundamental process also beyond the static picture. Ab initio methods based on real-time time-dependent density-functional theory coupled to the Ehrenfest molecular dynamics scheme are ideally suited for this problem. We investigate a laser-excited hybrid inorganic/organic interface formed by the electron acceptor molecule 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyano-quinodimethane (F4TCNQ) physisorbed on a hydrogenated silicon cluster, and we discuss the fundamental mechanisms of charge transfer in the ultrashort time window following the impulsive excitation. The considered interface is $p$-doped and exhibits charge transfer in the ground state. When it is excited by a resonant laser pulse, the charge transfer across the interface is additionally increased, but contrary to previous observations in all-organic donor/acceptor complexes, it is not further promoted by vibronic coupling. In the considered time window of 100~fs, the molecular vibrations are coupled to the electron dynamics and enhance intramolecular charge transfer. Our results highlight the complexity of the physics involved and demonstrate the ability of the adopted formalism to achieve a comprehensive understanding of ultrafast charge transfer in hybrid materials.",

At times, the turbulent noise can be mistaken to represent a signal, motivating erratic attack or escape responses. The present review addresses the latter problem. The analysis is kept on a level sufficiently simple to let the results have practical applicability, while on the other hand, the basic elements of the problem are retained.

    "abstract": "The continuous demand for small portable electronics is pushing the semiconductor industry to develop novel lithographic methods to fabricate the elementary structures for microelectronics devices with dimensions below 10 nm. Top-down strategies include multiple patterning photolithography, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), electron beam lithography (EBL), and nanoimprint lithography. Bottom-up approaches mainly rely on block copolymers (BCPs) self-assembly (SA). SA of BCPs is extremely appealing due to its excellent compatibility with conventional photolithographic processes, high-resolution patterns, and low process costs. Among the various BCPs, the polystyrene-b-polydimethylsiloxane (PS-b-PDMS) represents the most investigated material for the fabrication of sub-10 nm structures. However, PS-b-PDMS cannot be easily processed by conventional thermal treatments due to its slow SA kinetic coupled with a relatively low thermal stability. This review focuses on the available annealing methods to promote the SA PS-b-PDMS in parallel-oriented cylindrical sub-10 nm structures. Moreover, literature data regarding the annealing time, defects density, line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness ( LWR) are discussed with reference to the stringent requirements of semiconductor technology.",

This review illustrates recent developments in structural magnetism using polarized synchrotron X-ray scattering techniques, which have appropriate ability to explore hidden features in magnetic structures. The exploitation of X-ray polarization allows chiral discrimination of helimagnetic structure, evaluation of fraction of spin and orbital magnetic moments, visualization of antiferromagnetic domain distribution. The development of polarized X-ray diffractometry into microscopic observation techniques provides a scarce opportunity to investigate antiferromagnetic domain structures in detail. We present the basis of polarized X-ray diffractometry and X-ray magnetic scattering, and discuss potential directions for future developments.",

With the improvements in spatial and temporal resolutions of various measurement techniques, the changes of membrane topography in response to various external stimulations in the culture environments can be accurately recorded. Membrane roughness is a useful parameter to evaluate the changes in membrane topography. At present, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is the most common technique to measure the membrane topography and roughness of living cells. On the other hand, with the non-contact profiling capability, many optical techniques are also employed in this field of research. This review briefly introduces the evolution and applications of AFM on measuring membrane roughness. Meanwhile, quantifying the cell membrane topography and roughness with a non-scanning, non-contact, and label-free optical technique, non-interferometric wide-field optical profilometry (NIWOP), is also presented.",

First, evidenced in 1952, the dissociative photoionization of molecular nitrogen, N2, plays an important role in the species abundance, out of equilibrium evolution, and chemical reactivity of diverse media including upper atmospheres (the so-called ionospheres) and plasma. Many scenarios were proposed for rationalizing the dissociative ionization mechanisms and exit channels, which are reviewed here, mainly involving the N2+(C2∑u+, v+) vibrational levels state-to-state dynamics on which we focus. We show, however, that previous studies are not comprehensive enough for fully shedding light on the complex undergoing processes. As a complementary global work, we used state-of-the-art quantum chemistry, time dependent and independent theoretical approaches associated to advanced experimental techniques to study the unimolecular decomposition of the N2+ ions forming the N+ + N products. In addition to the already suggested spin-orbit-induced predissociation of the cationic C2∑u+ state, we documented a new mechanism based on vibronic coupling and tunneling dissociation. Besides, the quantum processes highlighted here should be also in action in the dynamics of electronically excited larger molecular systems involved in physical and chemical phenomena in plasma and in various natural environments on Earth and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Despite more than ten years of extensive research, the superconducting mechanism of iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) is still an open question. Generally, the high-temperature superconductivity is often observed with suppression of magnetic ordering, spin-density-wave, or even the structure transition by carrier doping. Furthermore, an electronic state ordering is also observed at temperatures close to or even above these transitions. Due to its proximity to the superconducting state and disappearance near the optimal superconductivity, it has been also suggested to interplay with superconductivity on a phenomenological level. Nevertheless, there is still no direct evidence to bridge the superconductivity to these transitions. Recently, another nematic order was observed in the superconducting state of heavily hole-doped compound AFe 2As 2 (A = K, Rb, Cs), providing a possibility to explore the superconductivity gap symmetry nature. Here, by reviewing the recent experimental progresses on the nematic superconductivity in the FeSCs, we will introduce the progresses by various methods including the quasi-particle interference from scanning tunneling microscope, anisotropic gap magnitudes from angular resolved photoemission, the upper critical field and the superconducting transition temperatures from transport measurements. In addition, some recent reports and theoretical explanations for experimental results are followed.",

We begin by describing strategies for the growth of binary Pt–Ni and ternary Pt–Ni–TM (TM = transition metal) nanoparticles, with a focus on understanding how their structure and compositional anisotropy is related to their catalytic activity and stability. We then describe the morphological changes and compositional degradation effects that can occur in electrochemical environments. Changes in nanoparticle shape, including the loss of highly active {1 1 1} facets due to dealloying from Ni-rich facets and Pt surface diffusion, are discussed as important reasons for catalyst degradation. Finally, strategies to prevent degradation, e.g. by surface doping, are addressed. The growth, segregation, and degradation mechanisms that we describe highlight the complexity with which octahedral alloy nanoparticles form and evolve under reaction conditions.",

The single layer of Bi4Br4 was demonstrated to be a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) with a 0.18 eV gap. Such a band gap is large enough for the observation of QSHI at room temperature. Bulk α-Bi4Br4 was categorized as a higher-order topological insulator and was soon examined in experiments. In addition, the α-Bi4Br4 exhibit simultaneously the topological phase and superconductive phase under 3.8–4.3 GPa pressure. While the single layer of Bi4I4 was shown to be close to the critical point of the QSHI/trivial-insulator phase transition, the α-Bi4I4 was considered to be a strong or weak topological insulator. In this work, we reviewed the recent progress in the topological properties of bismuth halogenides, including the theoretical calculations, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanned tunneling microscopy analyses, quantum transport measurement and the superconducting phase transfer under pressure. We expect further research of this family material about the non-trivial superconductor and possible Majorana, room-temperature quantum transport effect and potential application in the quantum device for the electronics and information technology.",

The switch (e.g. 'atomic switch') actually works by using an ion-conducting solid electrolyte or an ion-/electron-conducting mixed-conductor as the device material, and by applying an external voltage to control local ion transport and electrochemical reaction. With the application of an external voltage, a bridge is formed as a conductive filament in the solid electrolyte or the mixed conductor between electrodes. The atomic structure of the point contact in said filament can be reversibly changed by precise control of the applied voltage. By controlling the atomic structure of the point contact, interesting functions are obtained, such as fast on/off resistive switching, switching between each state of quantized conductance and neuromorphic properties. This atomic scale switch has the potential to overcome the functional and performance limitations of conventional integrated circuits because it can be used in conjunction with extant semiconductor devices.",

With the rapid development of advanced fabrication techniques and optical cavity designs, light confinement and manipulation at the nanoscale, far below the diffraction limit of light, have been achieved. However, downscaling can lead to problems such as large threshold current and excessive self-heating for nanolasers. In addition, the modulation bandwidth of a laser is ultimately limited by the large damping at high injection current levels due to gain compression. Recently, nanoLEDs that utilize the Purcell effect were proposed as fast and efficient nanoscale light sources to address the limitations of nanolasers. In this review, we summarize recent advances and several important figures of merit of nanoLEDs. To illustrate their practicalities, we use a specific nano-emitter design example to calculate and predict the dynamic response as well as energy consumption of the device with a rate-equation analysis. This short review is intended to offer new perspectives to the design and application of nanoscale light sources in high-speed on-chip optical communication systems.",

    "abstract": "Development of fabrication technologies for three-dimensional structuring and integration of nanomaterials in devices is important for a broad range of applications, including next-generation high energy density batteries, super(de)wetting and biomedical coatings, and miniaturized biomedical diagnostics. Amongst various nanofabrication approaches, the flame synthesis route accounts for some of the first man-made nanomaterials and industrial production of various nanoparticle commodities such as carbon black, fumed silica, and pigmentary titania. In the past two decades, flexibility in nanomaterials and facile fabrication of nanostructured films by aerosol self-assembly has motivated the exploration of this technology for device applications. In this review, we present a perspective of recent progress in flame-assisted nanofabrication and its application to emerging technologies. The fundamentals of flame synthesis will be briefly reviewed to evaluate trends in flame reactor designs and directions for improvements. A selection of exemplary flame-made nanostructures will be presented across the major categories of catalysis, energy conversion devices, membranes and sensors, highlighting weakness and strengths of this synthesis route. We will conclude with an outlook towards possible implementation of flame-assisted self-assembly as a scalable tool for nanofabrication in emerging devices and a critical assessment of the persisting challenges for its broader industrial uptake.",

    "abstract": "Ultrafast optical spectroscopy delivers unparalleled insights into the dynamic response of photoactive materials, including semiconducting, photonic and phase-change materials. The most applied experimental tool – transient absorption spectroscopy – derives signals from induced changes in the intensity of transmitted light, assumed to relate to the imaginary part of the refractive index. However, the entire complex refractive index of materials changes in the excited state; changes in the real part of the refractive index can have significant effects on transient absorption spectra and the function of optical devices. In this review, we introduce an emerging ultrafast spectroscopy method – frequency domain interferometry. This simple adaptation of transient absorption spectroscopy provides a model-independent means of spectrally resolving photoinduced changes in a materials refractive index. After introducing the theory and implementation of the method, we describe several case studies, including the optical response of metal-halide perovskites and phase modulators, and surface displacement of phase-change materials. Finally, we describe recent and future improvements that can enhance the time-resolution and signal sensitivity of this technique. The advances and applications highlighted in this review demonstrate the potential of the method to become a standard part of the ultrafast spectroscopy toolbox for characterising optoelectronic and photonic materials and devices.",

Recently several atomic-resolution holography methods have been developed, which can directly display the 3D atomic structure around this kind of specific atoms with no translational symmetry. These are the 'photoelectron holography', 'x-ray fluorescence holography', and 'CTR holography'. Their accuracy improved dramatically by the development of new analysis codes and sensitive analyzers and detectors. A new technique of direct 3D atomic structure analysis method 'stereography of atomic arrangement' has also been developed. These techniques received renewed attention recently, and a project '3D Active-Site Science' of JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas has been pursued for 5 years.

First studied experimentally in an apparatus called a Hele-Shaw cell in 1898, it has been widely used, for example, as a model for porous media in laboratory testing. This paper provides a brief insight into the mathematical model of the Saffman–Taylor instability (pore scale viscous fingering) and the situations in which viscous fingering can be encountered. Since it is a morphogenetic instability, it is usually considered a nuisance and in recent decades many scientists and researchers have focused on the ways to avoid its occurrence. For instance, the petroleum industry has been continuously trying to discover the best solution for its control since viscous fingering limits oil recovery in porous media. The review provides a historical overview of the phenomena and various methods that have been used to control this instability. The final part of the paper gives a summary and the conclusions that have been drawn as the results of diverse studies.",

This multitude of materials and exciton types poses tremendous challenges for ab initio modeling. Following a brief overview of typical ab initio techniques, we summarize our recent work based on Many-Body Green’s Functions Theory in the GW approximation and Bethe–Salpeter Equation (BSE) as a method applicable to a wide range of material classes from perfect crystals to disordered materials. In particular, we emphasize the current challenges of embedding this GW-BSE method into multi-method, mixed quantum-classical (QM/MM) models for organic materials and illustrate them with examples from organic photovoltaics and fluorescence spectroscopy.

We review different models developed to describe this entropy-driven process and the occurrence of cooperative conversions resulting from elastic interactions. There is a growing number of SCO materials exhibiting unusual thermal conversions when symmetry breaking occurs. To illustrate the importance of considering both phenomena, we review studies of the prototype [Fe(ptz)6](BF4)2 system, exhibiting at atmospheric pressure a single step thermal transition with hysteresis, where a ferroelastic distortion occurs from the high-spin high-symmetry (HShs) phase, towards the low-spin low-symmetry (LSls) phase. Under pressure, sequential conversions occur on cooling from the HShs phase towards a high-spin low-symmetry (HSls) phase, followed by a spin crossover towards the LSls phase. In addition, a metastable low-spin high-symmetry (LShs) state forms upon fast cooling. We revisit this coupling and decoupling of spin crossover and ferroelastic phase transition through the Landau theory model adapted by Collet, which provides qualitative agreement with the experimental data, such as the phase diagram and the evolution of spin transition curves or lattice deformations under pressure. This Ferroelastic Instability coupled to Spin Crossover (FISCO) approach should be generalized to many materials undergoing coupled spin transition and symmetry breaking.",

We present a physical model for quantum ballistic transport of electrons through a short conduction channel, and investigate the role played by the Coulomb interaction in modifying the energy levels of two-electron states at low temperatures as the width of the channel is increased. In this regime, the effect of the Coulomb interaction on the two-electron states has been shown to lead to four split energy levels, including two anti-crossings and two crossing-level states. Due to the interplay between the anti-crossing and crossing of the energy levels, the ground state for the two-electron model switches from one anti-crossing state for strong confinement to a crossing state for intermediate confinement as the channel width is first increased, and then returned to its original anti-crossing state. This switching behavior is related to the triplet spin degeneracy as well as the Coulomb repulsion and reflected in the ballistic conductance. Here, many-body effects can still affect electron occupations in the calculation of quantum ballistic conductance although it cannot vary the center-of-mass velocity.",

The thermoelectric effects are studied as a function of the location of the Fermi level inside the nanowire conduction band, notably around its edges where they become very large. We underline the interest of using electron-phonon coupling around the band edges of large arrays of parallel nanowires for energy harvesting and hot spot cooling at small scales.

These have generally focused on the fast dynamics of neurons; however, there is now an increasing emphasis on the slow dynamics of synapses, whose weight changes are held to be responsible for memory storage. An important first step in this direction was taken in the context of Fusi’s cascade model, where complex synaptic architectures were invoked, in particular, to store long-term memories. No explicit synaptic dynamics were, however, invoked in that work. These were recently incorporated theoretically using the techniques used in agent-based modelling, and subsequently, models of competing and cooperating synapses were formulated. It was found that the key to the storage of long-term memories lay in the competitive dynamics of synapses. In this review, we focus on models of synaptic competition and cooperation, and look at the outstanding challenges that remain.",

In this short review we outline the major steps of our theoretical modelling activity connected to the experimental gas-phase synthesis of silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) in plasmas reactors, limiting the discussion to the long-scale simulations based on the classical reactive description (ReaxFF methodology) for reproducing the whole process, perturbations included. The huge computational workload at the quantum chemistry level, required to prepare the training data, calibrate the parameters and validate the procedure, is not reported for the sake of conciseness. The excellent agreement of the simulations results with the experimental data and the sound explanations of the observed phenomena suggest that the ReaxFF-based paradigm is a reliable approach capable of studying these types of materials on time and size scales corresponding to realistic scenarios.Major steps of the theoretical modelling activity connected to the experimental gas-phase synthesis of silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) in plasmas reactors.",

    "abstract": "Gas phase experiments combined with ultrafast technologies can provide information on the intrinsic properties of molecular systems at picosecond, femtosecond, or even attosecond timescales. However, these experiments are often limited to relatively simple model systems. In this context, electrospray ionization sources (ESI) have offered new perspectives as they allow to produce large or fragile molecular ions in the gas phase, mimicking molecules in their natural environment. While time-resolved UV-visible ultrafast experiments on molecular ions have been successfully developed over the past decades, efforts are still required to perform experiments using ultrashort extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses with the goal of reaching attosecond resolution. In this article, we present recent results obtained using the combination of ultrafast technologies and ESI sources. We show that ultrafast dynamics experiments can be performed on molecular ions without ion trapping devices and can reveal UV-induced charge transfer in small peptides with controlled micro-environment. Non-adiabatic relaxation dynamics in large (bio)molecular ions is also presented. Such experiments are compatible with high harmonic generation XUV sources as shown here in the case of a metal complex. These ultrafast dynamics studies on large molecular ions offer new perspectives in attosecond science.",

    "abstract": "As a special class of stable atomic clusters, the superatom has become an exciting research topic in recent decades. They can mimic the chemistry and physics of individual atoms in the periodic table and find potential applications in a variety of fields. Traditional strategies for superatom design, however, have their own limitations. Herein, we review recent progress in the discovery of novel methodologies for superatom design, namely external-field regulated strategies (EFRS). We begin with a description of the basic concept of the superatom and the conventional electron-counting rules for superatom design, followed by a discussion of recent exploration about external-field regulated superatoms, where the oriented external electric field (OEEF), the ligand field, and the solvent field are presented. In the concluding section, we discuss the benefits and challenges of the EFRS together with some future research topics.",

    "abstract": "Cluster structures in nuclei have been studied for half a century and one central problem is how to understand and describe the relative motion of clusters. In 2001, the THSR (Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-Röpke) wave function was proposed for exploring the possible condensation in nuclei. This novel microscopic cluster wave function provides us with a new perspective for understanding general cluster correlations in nuclei. In this article, we will review a new understanding for cluster structures, that is the concept of nonlocalized clustering, which is inspired by the THSR wave function. The concept of nonlocalized clustering is characterized as the dimensional size parameter rather than the traditional inter-cluster distance parameter. Based on this concept, a container picture is introduced for describing and understanding the complicated motion of clusters in nuclei.",

    "abstract": "In this review, recent advances toward bridging the mismatching length scales of optical spectroscopy and imaging are described. Spectroscopic measurements that span ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths provide rich details about the structural properties of molecules and materials. However, the diffraction limit precludes the spatial resolution needed to image these systems commensurate with structure. Many groups have innovated statistical approaches that allow an optical point source to be determined, or ‘localized,’ with a precision that approaches the molecular length scale. As we review here, interferometric nonlinear optical imaging (INLO) allows researchers to simultaneously acquire spectroscopic data and localize the point source in three dimensions with nanometer precision using a single wide-field microscope. Employing plasmonic nanoparticles as prototypical systems, we show that INLO yields sample excitation spectrum, coherence lifetimes (i.e. homogeneous linewidth), and polarization-dependent responses. The INLO method can also be used for polarization-resolved (e.g. circular dichroism) imaging. Hence, multiple dimensions of spectroscopic information content can be added to the optical image. A discussion of prospects for extending the INLO-localization platform to other so-called super-resolution spectroscopy measurements is also provided.",

    "abstract": "The functionality of the materials used for energy applications is critically determined by the physical properties of small active regions such as dopants, dislocations, interfaces, grain boundaries, etc. The capability to manipulate and utilize the inevitable disorder in materials, whether due to the finite-dimensional defects (such as vacancies, dopants, grain boundaries) or due to the complete atomic randomness (as in amorphous materials), can bring innovation in designing energy materials. With the increase in computational material science capabilities, it is now possible to understand the complexity present in materials due to various degrees of disorder resulting in pathways required for optimizing their efficiencies. This article provides a critical overview of such computational advancements specifically for designing realistic materials with various types of disorders for sustainable energy applications such as catalysts and electrochemical devices. The ultimate goal is to gain a thorough knowledge of the traditional approaches (implemented via tools such as density functional theory, and molecular dynamics) as well as modern approaches such as machine learning that exist for modeling the disorder present in materials, thereby identify the future opportunities for energy materials design and discovery.",

    "abstract": "A QM/MM method is an atomistic simulation algorithm that allows researchers to describe different regions of a system with different physical laws. Here, we review this hybrid method’s applications to the study of copper, silver, and gold atoms and clusters interacting with biological and organic molecules. In particular, we highlight efforts to characterize the relaxation process in a copper(I) phenanthroline complex; details of Cu’s secretory path; the atomic structure of Ag-homopolymers of cytosine and guanine; DNA-stabilized silver clusters; effects related to temperature and solvent on thiolate-protected gold clusters’ optical properties; and the effect of a medium-like noble gas on a cluster’s optical spectrum. The results of these efforts demonstrate how QM/MM methods are applied successfully to a wide range of processes that include the study of excited state evolution, charge transport, light absorption, and emission, and determining an atomic structure in the absence of crystal-determined structure. We expect QM/MM methods will continue supporting the exploration of novel hybrid organo-metallic materials and their safe use in the environment, while also providing guidance on mechanisms to deal with diseases associated with a failure in cells’ proper behavior.",

Here, we review OAM dynamics in depth, focusing on key concepts and non-equilibrium systems, and laying the groundwork for the thriving field of orbitronics. We review briefly the conventional understanding of the equilibrium OAM based on the modern theory of orbital magnetisation. Following this, we explore recent theoretical and experimental developments in out-of-equilibrium systems. We focus on the generation of an OAM density via the orbital magneto-electric, or Edelstein effect, the generation of an OAM current via the orbital Hall effect, the orbital torque resulting from them, along with their reciprocal non-equilibrium counterparts – the inverse orbital Edelstein and inverse orbital Hall effects, as well as OAM conservation. We discuss the most salient achievements and the most pressing challenges in this rapidly evolving field, and in closing we highlight the future prospects of orbitronics.",
