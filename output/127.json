    "abstract": "This research was focused on the use of the modified Chapelle test as a direct laboratory methodology to access the pozzolanic activity of both experimental and commercial metakaolins.At the same time, this test was used in the evaluation of experimental metakaolins.This chemical test, performed during 16 hours at 90 °C, allows the quantification of portlandite fixed by the metakaolin sample.The calcium hydroxide that was not consumed is quantified by acid titration (HCl), and the test result is expressed in mg of fixed calcium hydroxide by g of metakaolin.According to this test, the pozzolanic activity of a metakaolin should not be less than 700 mg Ca(OH) 2 / g metakaolin.The modified Chapelle pozzolanic activity of six commercial metakaolins was evaluated between 920 and 1560 mg Ca(OH) 2 / g metakaolin.From the seven experimental metakaolins produced between 750 ºC and 940 ºC, a material with modified Chapelle pozzolanic activity value of 1240 mg Ca(OH) 2 / g metakaolin was obtained, which is similar to some tested commercial metakaolins produced at industrial scale.The metakaolin produced at 800 ºC was ground, resulting in a particle size reduction of ≈ 4x less and a consequent increase of 21 % in the pozzolanic activity.",

    "abstract": "The results presented in this paper concern investigation of environmental influences to GNNS coordinates on the example of ASG-EUPOS network. The problem of the impact of environmental effects is crucial for observing gravity. Satellite systems are not as susceptible to changes in local hydrology or atmospheric effects, although significant influences are clearly visible in the change of coordinates. The authors analyzed daily and sub-daily solutions (geocentric coordinates) in the context of different disturbances to eliminate sites suffering from poor quality for further researches (e.g. data from the most reliable ASG-EUPOS stations will be used for investigating the correlation of their movements with the lithosphere deformations on territory of Poland). There are many doubts regarding proper antennas’ placement – as they are mostly placed on the roofs, there were questions if data from these sites can be used for scientific purposes like velocity estimations or geodynamical researches. Analysis of daily solutions was supposed to prove that the majority of Polish sites give fully valuable data. Some factors that may cause a precision decreasing can be avoided or eliminated in the future. Taking into consideration that GLONASS will be soon fully operational and it will be an alternative for commonly used GPS, the authors made separate elaboration of GPS and GLONASS data. Usage of two different satellite systems holds the potential to increase of solutions’ reliability and eliminate errors that could be possibly related to the specific satellite system. Base on time series of coordinates residual values, systematic errors that could prove geophysical and geodynamical influence on GNSS measurements were investigated. In this elaboration only post-processing observations were taken into account, but the monitoring of the network in the near real-time by means of coordinates’ stability is under development.",

    "abstract": "Assuring the stability of underground headings in order to fulfill their technical functions without any disturbance and provide a safe workplace for mining staff seems to be a fundamental issue in mining activity.In recent years, rockbolts: bar or cable have been most frequently applied as a means of reinforcement.Such a construction is often referred to as a stand-and-roofbolting support.The paper presents sample results of monitoring stand-and-roof-bolting support systems selected from numerous research projects carried out by the authors.The results discussed below are based on the measurements of the strength parameters of rocks in the laboratory and in-situ research, convergence of underground excavations, forces in rockbolts, separation of roof rock strata tested with extensometric probes, telltales and endoscopes, as well as steel yielding support frames load tested with dynamometers.The complex measurements of stand-and-roof-bolting supports along with specifications of geological, mining and geomechanical conditions allowed to formulate a proper evaluation of support behavior and its effectiveness for particular conditions.KEYWORDS: stability of underground roadways, support monitoring, stand-and-roof bolting support, support design systems, which definitely fails to provide a sound basis for estimating the behavior of support and surrounding rock mass over a longer period of time or in changeable mining conditions.Therefore, the only way to optimize the support system for particular conditions is the proper monitoring of stand-and-roofbolting support carried out in natural conditions (Layer, 1996), (Bawden and Tod, 2002), (Majcherczyk et al., 2006), (Bigby et al., 2010).Such a method allows one to obtain a work specification of particular elements of support, which can verify the appropriateness of the applied.In most cases, support monitoring makes it possible to determine optimal conditions, in which number of rockbolts, their length and frame size can be minimized, whereas frame spacing can be increased.As a result, such monitoring procedures offer numerous benefits, such as: an increase in the safety potential offered by the applied solutions, facilitating an on-going search for more innovative support systems, entailing cost minimization of exploitation and providing optimal protection of headings with an ideal adjustment of support system to dynamic requirements.What seems to be the crucial element of coalmine measurements is the possibility to utilize their results in numerical modeling (Procházka and Trčková, 2008), (Małkowski et al., 2008).The application of so-called reverse analysis allows the researchers to formulate a proper selection of rock mass models, their properties and rate of strata influence on the support.A model calibrated in this way can serve as a basis for designing underground roadways with the use of numerical methods.The support parameters can be optimized then.",

    "abstract": "GPS (Global Positioning System) technique has become a major tool in contemporary surveying and geodesy.This concerns mostly measurements of horizontal point coordinates, where centimeter-level accuracies are usually required and easily achievable.For the height component, however, these requirements are higher and millimeter-level accuracy is necessary.On the other hand, the intrinsic precision of GPS-derived heights is clearly lower comparing to the horizontal components.This is due to unfavorable satellite geometry, adverse effects of the troposphere or GPS antenna phase center offset and variations.In order to overcome these effects one has to carefully model all the error sources and rigorously process the GPS data.This paper presents studies on the optimal GPS data processing strategy suitable for precise leveling.This was done through the extensive testing and selection of the most appropriate observational session duration, ambiguity resolution strategy, network geometry, troposphere and ionospheric delay reduction methods, signal linear combination, elevation angle cut-off, etc.The analyzed processing strategies were evaluated through the processing of a test network.The test network consisted of 19 monitored points and 5 control points, and covered the area of 20 km x 60 km.The obtained results show that the precise GPS leveling with the selected optimal processing strategy allows for about 3 mm repeatability of height measurements when processing 4-hour long sessions.In our opinion GPS leveling may serve as fast and cost-effective replacement of classic geometric leveling, especially in applications where the heights in orthometric or normal height systems are not necessary.This is the case in, e.g., ground deformation studies.",

    "abstract": "The Zan lateritic deposit is located in ~25 km southeast of Damavand, Tehran province, Iran.This deposit was developed as stratiform at the base of Shemshak (sandstone and shale) Formation of Jurassic age.Mineralogical data shows that rock-forming minerals in this deposit include kaolinite, diaspore, hematite, goethite, anatase, boehmite, siderite, rutile, quartz, titanomagnetite, zircon and pyrite.The values of absolute weathering index calculated on the assumption of Th as an immobile element indicate that lateritization processes at the Zan were accompanied by enrichment of elements like Al, Fe, Zr, Nb, Ni, Cr, Co, Y, V, and REEs and by leaching-fixation of elements such as U, Mn, Sr, Ba, and Ca.Combination of the data obtained from mineralogical and geochemical investigations reveals that pH variation of weathering solutions, oxidation potential, adsorption, presence of organic matters, preferential sorption by metallic oxides, presence in resistant minerals and fixation in neomorph phases played prominent role in distribution of elements in the Zan lateritic deposit.With considering of correlation coefficients among elements, the minerals such as zircon and rutile can be regarded as potential hosts for REE in the ores.Palaeogeography evidence as well as geochemical indices like TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 and Eu/Eu* anomaly suggests that this deposit is a weathering product of basalt.",

The sub-Cainozoic and sub-Quaternary surface maps presented in this study display buried palaeotopography whose interpretation proves helpful in identification of tectonic dislocations. Such a kind of analysis has been conducted for the area of Lower Silesia, including the Sudetes, Fore-Sudetic Block, and Fore-Sudetic Monocline. The maps have been constructed on the basis of well-bore data, vertical geoelectrical soundings, and detailed mapping of exposures of pre-Quaternary rocks. Well-bore data have been reinterpreted with a view to reconstruct the original depth to the top of the crystalline basement. Many archival borehole descriptions place the boundary between Tertiary strata and the Proterozoic-Palaeozoic substratum at the top of poorly weathered rocks, including regoliths of the crystalline substratum into the Tertiary cover. The presented maps portray for the first time the actual morphology of the sub-Cainozoic surface. A comparison between the sub-Cainozoic and sub-Quaternary surface maps enables us to document changes in tectonic mobility throughout Cainozoic times. An additional source of information is provided by the attached thickness maps of individual time-slices of the Cainozoic.",

K-Ar datings were made on whole rock samples, using the methodology applied by the Institute of Nuclear Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Debrecen, Hungary. Most of the samples gave dates ranging between 21-38 Ma, whereas that derived from a borehole in the Mokrzeszow graben was dated to 44 Ma. Another borehole sample (Jezow Sudecki B-5) is of 59 Ma age. On the other hand, the supposedly “Quaternary” basalts from the Debowiec area fall into the interval of 29-30 Ma.The southeasternmost occurrences of the Lower Silesian basalts at Nowa Cerekiew display two generations of effusive activity: the older lava flows (26 Ma) are cut by plugs dated to 22 Ma. The Oligocene-Lower Miocene (26-33 Ma, 20-24 Ma) rocks represent alkali basalts and basanites. Most of the samples studied show properties typical of the two phases of volcanic activity, hitherto recorded in the Opole area by other authors.",

    "abstract": "Many papers on axial compression tests of coal-rock combined bodies have observed the failure of rock components.However, the failure mechanism of the rock component has been the focus of debate among many scholars.One view is that the failure of the rock is due to the energy released during coal failure; the other view is that the failure of the rock is due to the inconsistent coal-rock lateral deformation resulting in tensile stress on the rock side of the coal-rock interface.In response to these two controversial failure mechanisms, coal-rock combined bodies with three coal-rock interface bonding methods (AB glue, direct contact, and graphite fluoride) were designed, and the axial compression tests were carried out.The results show that: (1) the damage cracks of the combined body are mainly distributed on the coal component, the stronger the interface adhesion, the easier it is to crack.(2) All three combined bodies showed rock component damage, and the number of cracks in the rock component was different at different interfaces of the combined bodies.The stronger the interfacial adhesion is, the easier it is to produce cracks, and the more the number of cracks in the rock component is.(3) The destruction of rock components is the result of energy transfer mechanism.Under the action of the test machine, the coal component is destroyed first, and a large amount of elastic energy is released instantaneously to the rock component, which reaches the energy storage limit of the rock and stimulates the destruction of the rock component.The tensile stress at the coal-rock interface plays a certain role in the propagation and penetration of cracks in the rock, but does not determine the damage of rock components.(4) The stronger the interfacial bonding, the greater the strength of the combined body.Based on the D-P criterion, the strength of coal rock at the interface of coal-rock combined body was analyzed.The strength of the coal body at the interface increases to a certain extent, and the strength of the rock mass at the interface decreases to a certain extent.( 5) The stress distribution model of coal-rock combined body was constructed, and the internal mechanism of coal-rock component failure was further clarified.The coal and rock mass at the interface are the weak areas of the combined body, and the stress concentration in this area is the largest and the possibility of damage is the largest.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic properties of soil deposits subjected to dynamic loading, such as the shear modulus G and material damping ratio D, are important parameters in ground response seismic analysis. In seasonally frozen regions, these properties can be significantly affected by microstructural changes that occur during freeze-thaw cycles. The current study evaluated the dynamic properties of clayey soil exposed to freeze-thaw cycles. Dynamic triaxial testing was conducted to determine the influence of mean effective consolidation stress, cyclic stress ratio, loading frequency, and freeze-thaw cycles on G-γ and D-γ curves. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out to investigate microstructural changes in the clay soil fabric. The results indicate the freeze-thaw process has an important effect on dynamic properties of the soil. The dynamic shear modulus increases with increasing effective confining pressure, loading frequency, and confining pressure, and decreases with increasing number of freeze-thaw cycles. Development of more voids between clay particles after ice lens formation during these cycles results in an increase in the damping ratio, but this trend decreases with increasing confining pressure. Increasing the loading frequency increases or decreases the damping ratio depending upon the mean effective confining pressure and number of freeze-thaw cycles.",

As a result, the whole Thessalian Basin was supposed to be under an extensional tectonic regime of N-S direction. However, the recent earthquake sequence of March 2021 which occurred close to the northwestern margin of the basin revealed NE-SW direction of extension. Based on 7-year GPS measurements recorded by stations installed within and around the basin we assessed four deformational parameters for Thessaly aiming at the understanding of the deformation processes that control the region. These parameters are i) the Maximum Horizontal Extension (MAHE), ii) the Total Velocity (TV), iii) the Maximum Shear Strain (MSS), and iv) the Area Strain (AS). The results show that during the monitoring period, Thessaly moved toward the S-SW with a simultaneous clockwise rotation and underwent dispersed deformation mostly associated with dilatation. Focusing on the epicentral area of the 2021 sequence, strain during the 7-year period was rather low in all three strain parameters, implying a mature stage of elastic strain accumulation before the fault rupture.",

    "abstract": "The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can provide the daily position time series for the geodesy and geophysical studies. However, due to various unpredictable factors, such as receiver failure or bad observation conditions, missing data inevitably exist in GNSS position time series. Most traditional time series analysis methods require the time series should be completed. Therefore, filling the missing data is a valuable step before analyzing the GNSS time series. In this study, a new method named Iteration Empirical Mode Decomposition (Iteration EMD) is proposed to fill the missing data in GNSS position time series. The simulation experiments are performed by randomly removing different missing percentages of the synthetic time series, with the added different types noise. The results show that Iteration EMD approach performs well regardless of high or low missing percentage. When the missing percentage increases from 5 % to 30 % with a step of 5 %, all the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of Iteration EMD are smaller than Interpolation EMD. The relative improvements at different percentages of Iteration EMD relative to Interpolation EMD are significant, especially for the high missing percentage. The real GNSS position time series of eight stations were selected to further evaluate the performance of Iteration EMD with an average missing percentage 8.15 %. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the filled time series, which is used to assess the interpolation performance of Iteration EMD and Interpolation EMD. The results show that Iteration EMD can preserve variance 75.9 % with the first three Principal Components (PC), more than 66.5% of interpolation EMD. Therefore, we can conclude that Iteration EMD is an efficient interpolation method for GNSS position time series, which can make full use of available information in existing time series to fill the missing data.",

Test results indicate that the developed testing methodology may be used for corrected evaluation of the fracturing fluid as well as proppant in hydraulic fracturing treatment of unconventional reservoirs, especially shale rocks.",

The risk of damage-destruction of buildings and structures caused by earthquakes, sea storms, floods, mudflows, has increased in the world. Risks can be prevented by increasing of building and structure stability by reducing the anisotropy of cement concrete strength. To do this: Aqueous aluminosilicate minerals of clays, while dehydrating preserving habitus, are modified into a void containing (...mAl2O3∙nSiO2..) base minerals in which, after mixing in cement concrete while rehydro-liming, Ca(OH)2 is sorbed. The tobermorite, stratlingite, generated in filler, together with cement ettringite form fiber-needle-flaky habit clusters by modifying the structure of cement concrete with 3D self-nano-reinforcement, by reducing the anisotropy of strength – by increasing of stability to loads with variable direction-magnitude. It has been proven that in order to prevent risks of catastrophe, it is possible to use modification of Georgian clays by thermal dehydration in cement concrete technologies, which will create the preconditions for cement concrete pozzolanization by rehydro-liming, so the study of the basics of this process is actual.",

    "abstract": "Deep extraction of minerals is accompanied by deformations of the strata overlying extracted coal seams.Deformations of overlying layers run up to the surface where a subsidence trough gradually forms.The movement of individual surface points is curvilinear, spatial and, in relation to the time pattern, not uniform.In some cases, during the formation of a subsidence trough, temporary uplifts of the surface occur.This paper gives a particular area in which uplifts of the surface occurred when the rigid overlying strata was disturbed.The character of deformations of the overlying rocks is evaluated on the basis of a comparison of the results of the measurement of subsidence of the surface using geodetic methods with the development of mined-out areas and with their extracted thickness.For specifying the time of failure of the overlying strata, also information obtained from a system of continuous monitoring of seismic events is used.The spatial extent of the subsidence trough is identified by satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques applied to TerraSAR-X images.The subsidence wave was possible to detect using a short temporal difference of 11 days between satellite radar images.This shows the potential of short-temporal high resolution InSAR for monitoring of progress of subsidence troughs.A good knowledge of extents and shape of subsidence trough formation in time allows to verify values of parameters used for prediction purposes.Application of the short temporal InSAR appears very effective for spatio-temporal studies of the current subsidence trough development and helps understanding the physical process as well as identifying deviations from the behaviour expected by models.",

The shear distortion of the lining section under normal faults located in hanging wall side (i.e.moving bottom boundary of faulting) is higher than the one in footwall side (i.e.fixed bottom boundary of faulting).This is opposite for reverse faults.Finally, in normal mechanism, the recommended safe distance from fault tip is smaller than that of reverse mechanism.",

Using satellite images followed by field investigations, spatial distribution of landslide database was generated. Next, an integrated study was undertaken in the study area to perform the landslide susceptibility mapping. Dubaur-Dudishal section of KKH (about 150 km) which is a part of Kohistan Island Arc, is investigated in this study with a buffer zone of about 8 km along both sides of the KKH. Several thematic maps, e.g., lithology, distance to faults, distance to streams, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope, aspect, elevation, relative relief, plan-curvature and profile-curvature were prepared. Subsequently, these thematic data layers were analyzed by frequency ratio (FR) model and weights-of-evidence (WoE) model to generate the landslide susceptibility maps. In order to check the accuracy of the models, the area under the curve (AUC) was to quantitatively compare the two models used in this study. The predictive ability of AUC values indicate that the success rates of FR model and WoE model are 0.807 and 0.866, whereas the prediction rates are 0.785 and 0.846, respectively. Both methods show that nearly 50 % landslides in the study area fall in either high or very high susceptibility zones. The landslide susceptibility maps presented in this study are of great importance to the policy makers and the engineers for highway construction as well as the mega dams construction projects (Dasu dam and Bhasha dam which lie within the vicinity of the study area); so that proper prevention as well as mitigation could be done in advance to avoid the possible economic as well as the human loss in future.",

    "abstract": "The motion of GPS permanent stations during three earthquakes has been investigated with the use of Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique and the data obtained by seismic sensors.The study examines the ability of high-rate GPS observations to reflect the ground motion retrieved by the strong motion instruments (SM), considered to be more reliable and precise.The goal of this article is to show the sensitivity of GPS PPP kinematic high-rate positioning with position domain filtering using the band-pass Butterworth filter on small samples of position time series.The kinematic PPP approach in RTKLib software was used, supported by the CODE precise orbit and clock products to estimate positions from 5-hour long GPS phase datasets.Obtained position time series were reduced to 5-minute samples covering the time of co-seismic motion.The application of Butterworth band-pass filtering of GPS and SM time series increased the agreement between them up to 72% in terms of correlation, resulting in correlations within the range 0.34 to 0.99.The comparison of peak ground displacements (PGD) revealed that for Italian events, GPS-SM absolute value of the average difference is 6 mm with GPS-SM distances within the range of 0.05 to 2.14 km.In all analysed earthquakes, the agreement between GPSgrams and seismograms in terms of the first P-arrival polarity was checked and it was found that it is consistent in all cases.This confirms the GNSS technique capability for determining fault plane solution for earthquakes with magnitudes over 6.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of coal and rock damage caused by unloading during deep mining differs from that caused by continuous loading, and failure often results from a combination of loading and unloading.Triaxial unloading tests are useful for studying the damage characteristics of coal and rock under different conditions from a unloading point of view to better understand dynamic disasters of deep coal and rock.In this study, we performed triaxial tests involving loading axial stress and unloading confining pressure (4, 7, 10 MPa) using different unloading rates (0.02, 0.05, 0.08, 0.11, 0.14 MPa/s), and acoustic emission (AE) events were recorded simultaneously.The results show that the maximum AE ring and energy counting rates do not appear at peak stress but rather at the stress drop stage following peak stress.Similarly, the maximum AE impact counting rate occurs after the peak stress, which indicates that the internal cracking of the coal samples reaches a maximum at the fracture stage following peak stress.The AE information indicates a relatively quiet period prior to the occurrence of large-scale AE events.Higher initial unloading confining pressure is associated with earlier and more severe failure after peak stress.Faster unloading rates are also associated with earlier sample destruction after peak stress because the coal rapidly changes from a triaxial stress state to a uniaxial stress state with higher unloading rate, crack propagation is insufficient, and more elastic energy is released.Compared with conventional triaxial tests, the coal damage variable increases faster under triaxial unloading tests, which indicates that unloading failure is more severe.",

Slate was evaluated for its effectiveness as partial replacement of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in the production of Portland Pozzolana cement (PPC). The grain size analysis of crushed slate sample using ball mill revealed that maximum fraction retained on 44 μm was about 72.8 %. Sum of the major oxides (SiO2 + Al2O3 + Fe2O3) is about 90.09 % that meet the requirement as per ASTM C 618 (minimum 70.0 %). Other oxides including SO3 (&lt;0.05), CaO (4.04), MgO (1.66), K2O (0.10), Na2O (0.16), TiO2 (0.35), MnO (&lt;0.02) and Cl (0.12) also meet the international standard of ASTM C 618 for PPC. OPC without and with using slate sample in a ratio of 5 % and 10 % with clinker was tested to measure compressive strength, physical tests and setting time. The results showed that after 5 % and 10 % replacement, insignificant effect was observed on the physical properties, setting time and compressive strength in 2-, 7- and 28-days curing. Hence, slate can be used as natural pozzolan for manufacturing PPC. It is cost effective for the production of cement as well as to sustain the resources of limestone for long time and reducing emission of CO2 in the environment. It can also be used in the sulfate rich environment, coastal areas especially for the construction of dams and bridges.",

    "abstract": "According to the newest Polish regulations multifunctional system of precise positioning ASGEUPOS serves as the fundamental network and constitutes reference frame as well. The permanent GNSS observations gathered within the network are processed and analysed by the Centre of Applied Geomatics of Military University of Technology, which is one of the EPN Local Analysis Centres. IGS and EUREF recommendations are included. Weekly solutions are being stacked and, as the result, cumulative solution (coordinates expressed at the specified epoch and velocities of all stations) by using the CATREF software and minimal constraints approach is determined. Its reliability increases with the number of reference (sometimes described as fiducial) stations. According to the EUREF guidelines, reference stations have to belong to the EPN A class, but their geographical layout leaves much to be desired. The authors made several numerous tests using different configuration of reference stations to transfer ETRF2000 frame into Poland area, and to choose the best strategy of ASG-EUPOS alignment to the EPN. Eight different variants of ASG-EUPOS processing were investigated and each time the different set of coordinates was obtained. The differences reached several centimetres. The spatial distribution of the results on the area of Poland was shown and the optimum solution was pointed out. Furthermore, the analysis on the Helmert transformation parameters from individual TRF to the reference network were performed. These parameters do not have any geophysical interpretation, but provide very useful information about solution’s consistency and compliance. ARTICLE INFO",

    "abstract": "Geodetic geodynamic studies were conducted in the Wroclaw Plain, situated in the SE part of the Central European Subsidence Zone (CESZ). The boundaries of this plain coincide with the outline of the rhomboidal Cainozoic Wroclaw Basin. This area has been chosen for detailed examination taking into account the results of previous geodynamic research, pointing to constant subsidence of the Wroclaw region. Analysis of drainage network and changeable thicknesses of the Neogene and Quaternary strata also indicates weak, although stable subsidence of the central part of the Silesian Lowland and relative, small-scale uplift of the Fore-Sudetic region situated in the south and an area placed north of the Odra River valley. The studies consisted in measuring elevation changes of benchmarks along lines of precise levelling during 1956-1999 period, establishing a GPS network points, as well as measuring and processing of GPS data acquired during 2008-2010 time span. Displacements of benchmarks of precise levelling lines point to block-type mobility of structures located in the SE part of the CESZ, while GPS measurements indicate deformations related to bending of the Cainozoic sedimentary cover underlain by metamorphic bedrock and Permo-Mesozoic strata. Three years of observations enable us to distinguish two zones typified by compressive deformations being coincident with subsiding areas. One of these zones strikes NW-SE and marks the CESZ axis, the second one, oriented NNW-SSE, follows the orientation of a deeply buried Carboniferous-Permian tectonic graben (the Eastern Fore-Sudetic Basin) and a much shallower trough filled with Cretaceous strata in the Opole region. Uplift typifies the Fore-Sudetic Block as well as areas situated close to Opole town and north of the Odra River valley.",

    "abstract": "We present the crustal deformation field in the Penola Strait – Lemaire Channel fault area (West Antarctica), based on the analysis of the 5 seasonal cycles of static GNSS survey. This 5 GNSS campaigns were conducted with approximately a 16-year interval from 2003 to 2019. The analyses indicate that average linear velocities of horizontal movements are multidirectional but no larger than 1 – 2 mm/yr. Average linear velocities of vertical movements are no larger than ±3 mm/yr. In the present work scheme of vertical and horizontal movements has been drawn out. The obtained results correlate well with the movements of the surrounding GNSS stations. Based on the analysis of spatial distribution of the Earth’s surface dilatation velocity the zones of extreme compression and expansion values were revealed. The analyses of spatial distribution of the Earth’s surface total shear velocity indicate that the studied region is horizontally heterogeneous. Based on the analysis of obtained results, a new kinematic model of fault area was developed. The possibility of using static GNSS survey to study recent local geodynamic processes in Antarctica has been demonstrated.",

The second principal problem, which was considered in the present work is the ability to detect diurnal and sub-diurnal oscillations in changes of permanent stations’ coordinates. Results show unambiguously, that such oscillations appear in all analysed stations. In the paper there are examples of stations with dominant oscillations in different frequencies.

It has also been adapted to work with the Javad Alpha GNSS receiver and with an IFEN SX-NSR software receiver. This paper shows results of studies regarding effects of additional pseudolite-like distances on the accuracy of kinematic satellite positioning. At this stage of the research, only simulated observations with various accuracie shave been used in the analyses.These simulated observations are in the form of distances between PL transmitters and two GNSS receivers forming a baseline.These distances are expressed in cycles and treated as phase measurements. They are double differenced with the reference satellite phase measurements and used along with real observations in a uniform functional model to determine the baseline. The pseudolites are going to be used in engineering geodetic applications such as deformation monitoring, where often independent positions between the main observational epochs are required.Thus the developed software works in the kinematic mode. The studies show that the additional observations may help to provide high accuracy of determined positions, but any inaccuracies of these observations affect the results more than similar errors of satellite observations.

A 14-year time-series of Release 06 (RL06) monthly gravity field models from the Center for Space Research (CSR) truncated to degree and order 60 from the period April 2002 to August 2016 are analyzed using the EMD approach compared with traditional Gaussian smoothing filtering. Almost all fitting errors of GRACE spherical harmonic coefficients by the EMD approach are smaller than those by Gaussian smoothing, indicating that EMD can retain more information of the original spherical harmonic coefficients. The ratios of latitude-weighted RMS over the land and ocean signals are adopted to evaluate the efficiency of eliminating noise. The results show that almost all ratios of RMS for the EMD approach are higher than those of Gaussian smoothing, with the mean ratio of RMS of 3.61 for EMD and 3.41 for Gaussian smoothing, respectively. Therefore, we can conclude that the EMD method can filter noise more effectively than Gaussian smoothing, especially for the high-degree coefficients, and retain more geophysical signals with less leakage effects.",

    "abstract": "The growing urban development in mountain areas together with climate change increased the need for rockfall research and modeling.Determining rockfall processes and related hazard is still a difficult task because of the complexity and intrinsic stochastic nature of the physics involved.In recent years, numerical simulations of rockfall trajectories became common procedure for evaluating rockfall hazard.Increasing of model accuracy leads to the need for more specific complex calibration, appropriate combination of rockfall modeling tools, as well as careful assessment of rockfall sources, block and slope characteristics.Rockfall modeling issues have been tested in local study areas in Hřensko (Czechia) through HY-STONE 3D software.The Hřensko area is characterised by sandstone landscape with rock plateaus, deep canyons with several levels of steep cliffs, which forms favourable conditions for rockfalls.Different modeling approaches, calibration problems, dependency of model results to parameters, and proposed appropriate countermeasures are discussed.The aim of this paper is to provide a knowledge base for researchers and practitioners involved in projects dealing with rockfall protection.",

    "abstract": "Underground mining activity in the region of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) results in ground displacements scattered on a large area. Both the locations and the velocities of the displacements depend on many factors, such as the current location of the mining front, the mining depth and system, as well as geological conditions. Although SAR interferometry techniques allow the monitoring of such ground displacements, in a regional scale (as is the case of the USCB) SAR images must be appropriately processed (from a number of frames and swaths), and this is the problem addressed in this article. The implementation of algorithms for analyzing time series allows observations of displacements in both time and space. The authors also analyze the influence of mining operations on the road infrastructure and mining waste heaps located in the area and investigate the potential for the monitoring of secondary influence (due to induced seismic tremors). As a result of these investigations, the article presents the quality of the InSAR-SBAS data and the potential for their employment in the measurements.",

    "abstract": "In Czech and Polish underground hard coal mines of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin high-energy seismic phenomena are periodically recorded, the sources of which are located ahead of the longwall.Generally, these types of tremors are rooted in very strong, thick layers of sandstone, which are subject to the deformation border.The consequences are discontinuities and cracks with a range depending on the mechanical properties of destroyed rocks: the mechanical parameters of layers.Forecasting methods, developed in the Central Mining Institute, for stress concentration, seismic energy, fault zone and range, together with methods of rock fracturing using liquid or explosives, ,allow precise identification of suitable locations for controlled fracturing of rock mass with a pre-established direction.The size and range of discontinuities have an impact on mining parameters, dependent on basic exploitation intensity and expressed by the average daily progress of the longwall face.The rockmass is locally weakened because of exploitation or technical measures of discontinuities in the roof-rock on the longwall face.To prevent rockburst, measures are needed to reduce the amount of energy accumulating in the rockmass in the area of the longwall face.Knowledge of where stress is concentrated is extremely important for the development and implementation of effective preventative methods.For many years several research centres have been working on defining the range of these areas.In this paper, basic information is presented on methods developed by Central Mining Institute and used in Polish hard coal mines for forecasting energy concentration and assessing how it can be reduced.excavation process helps to characterize this environment and the impact of mining on its destruction.Faults are areas of non-uniform stress distribution, regardless of the size of the throw, in which the accumulated energy can be released in stress concentration zones in the form of a seismic tremor, which creates a real danger of rock burst.Adequate recognition of geological deposits enables implementation of the most effective exploitation technology for the given conditions.Measurements of displacements of the roof rock layers revealed them to be horizontal, relative displacements continuing at large distances from the longwall face (Drzewiecki, 2000).This indicates a high capacity to preserve transverse continuity of the rock mass layers, despite their strong deformation in the area of the dynamic edge, which is the longwall face.In real conditions, the longwall face is moved at variable speeds, because of current technical and geological conditions, and natural hazards.In the rock mass, where the rock layers are able to accumulate energy, the longwall advancement determines which rock layer and which part is involved in the process of energy accumulation.Proper identification of rock layers allows prediction of the amount of the changes in accumulated energy, depending on the intensity of exploitation.",

The stability of the composite structure of coal pillars and their overlying strata determines the safety of the whole stope and the surface. This paper conducts uniaxial compression tests on coal-rock composite structures with the same lithology and the same coal-rock height ratio and finds the coal-rock composite structure’s mechanical properties and failure characteristics have greater discreteness. Combining the CT images of rock and coal, it is concluded that the main reason for the discreteness of the composite structure test results is the different crack characteristics in the rock specimen and the coal specimen. Therefore, this paper uses the PFC numerical simulation software to analyzes the influence of the crack characteristics on the mechanical properties, failure characteristics, and impact energy index of the coal-rock composite structure. The sensitivity factors are used to analyze the influence of crack angle, crack length, crack number and crack position on the peak stress, total crack number, and impact energy index of the coal-rock composite structure. The research results can provide a theoretical basis and guidance for preventing the instability and failure of the coal pillar-roof composite structure.",

    "abstract": "The global surface mass variations obtained by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite Level-2 products show significant north-south strip noise, which seriously affects the estimation of regional surface mass variations.Most existing filtering methods are based on the processing of spherical harmonic basis functions to remove stripes.However, because spherical harmonic basis functions are only orthogonal globally, they may not be orthogonal in regions, which hinders the effective constraint of quality changes in specific regions.Therefore, this paper converts the spherical harmonic base of GRACE Level-2 to the Slepian base of the interested region and truncates it based on the Shannon number of the region.Even though the signals are concentrated in the region, there are still many stripes present.In order to remove the stripes, it is necessary to introduce the regularization and consider the statistical information of the spherical harmonic coefficient.The Tikhonov regularization matrix of the Slepian coefficient is obtained, combined with a power-law model to construct the prior covariance matrix of the signal and the optimal regularization coefficient is selected by using the generalized cross-validation (GCV) method, which is represented as the statistically optimal Slepian method (SO-Slepian) in this study.The results show that the ability of SO-Slepian and decorrelation and denoising Kernel (DDK) filtering with the same regularization parameters as SO-Slepian to remove stripes and retain signals in the selected region is comparable.The line chart comparing the differences between SO-Slepian and DDK not only demonstrates the close similarity in results between SO-Slepian and traditional DDK filtering in the regional domain but also emphasizes the logical application of regularization during the Slepian modeling stage.It further supports the rationality of developing a regularization scheme for GRACE data processing based on Slepian.",

The current research examined the effect of the geometrical layout of soil nails using analytical and physical modelling. The results of limit equilibrium analysis for different nail layouts are presented. The target gravity level was 50g for centrifuge models and all models had a safety factor of 1.35 at this level. The parameters studied were base nail length, angle of nail tail extension, horizontal spacing of nails, and nail density. The limit equilibrium results showed that, when longer nails were used, the nail density could be decreased. The results of centrifuge modelling confirmed that different layouts at a similar safety factor did not show similar levels of displacement. Also, nail density was the most influential parameter affecting soil-nailed wall performance. An empirical relationship was observed between displacements of the wall crest and nail density. An interesting similarity was observed between the predicted slip surface and the slip surface that formed during physical modelling.",

The formal errors are provided along with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) position time series, however, not being considered by the traditional EMD. In this contribution, we proposed a modified approach that called weighted Empirical Mode Decomposition (weighted EMD) to extract signals from GNSS position time series, by constructing the weight factors based on the formal errors. The position time series over the period from 2011 to 2018 of six permanent stations (SCBZ, SCJU, SCMN, HLFY, FJPT, SNXY) were analyzed by weighted EMD, as well as the traditional EMD. The results show that weighted EMD can extract more signals than traditional EMD from original GNSS position time series. Additionally, the fitting errors were reduced 14.52 %, 12.25 % and 8.06 % for North, East and Up components for weighted EMD relative to traditional EMD, respectively. Moreover, 100 simulations of four stations are further carried out to validate the performances of weighted EMD and traditional EMD. The mean Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) are reduced from traditional EMD to weighted EMD with the reductions of 9.08 %, 9.63 % and 6.84 % for East, North and Up components, respectively, which highlights the necessity of considering the formal errors. Therefore, it reasonable to conclude that weighted EMD can extract the signals more than traditional EMD, which can be suggested to analyze GNSS position time series with formal errors.",

A variety of these granitoid rocks have been investigated in terms of their petrographic features and physico-mechanical properties. The studied rocks are classified into four different textural varieties including Dubair mylonitized (DM), Dubair coarse grained (DCG), Shang coarse grained (SCG) and Shang foliated (SF) granitoids based on field observations and petrographic features. Petrographically quartz, potash feldspar, plagioclase and biotite are the essential minerals present in all varieties in varying amount. Beside these hornblende, chlorite, epidote, ore mineral(s) and sphene are also present in the accessory amount. As a part of the present investigation some of the mechanical and physical properties including uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), uniaxial tensile strength (UTS), specific gravity, water absorption, total porosity, and Los Angeles abrasion were also determined. The combined approach of petrographic features with the physico-mechanical investigation revealed that the textural characteristics and mineralogy have a significant influence on the physico-mechanical properties of the studied rocks. It is determined that modal percentage of minerals, degree of alteration, recrystallization, grain size and shape, types of grain boundary contacts have significant effect on characteristics of these granitoids. Based on strength tests studied rocks fall in category of moderately strong to strong. The values of specific gravity, porosity, water absorption and Los Angeles are within the range permissible for their use as constructional materials except SF. Based on physico-mechanical properties and petrographic examination Dubair-Shang granitoids could be used as aggregate for the construction of road, railway tracks, embankment, and canals. Theses rocks could also be used as sills, lentils, and roofing but should not be used for load bearing masonry like bridges, tunnels, buildings, dams etc.",

Obtained coordinates were firstly compared with those provided by IGS final weekly combined solution. In Europe, the best agreement with this reference product was reached by solutions including Galileo signals, namely by a combination of GPS+GLONASS+Galileo systems with a mean RMS of 11 mm. This situation was different in China where inclusion of Galileo always led to worse results and the best agreement was achieved by a combination of GPS+GLONASS systems. Although product provided by German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) could be selected as the best performing over Europe and product by Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE) over China, differences between individual precise products were mostly at a minimal level. Secondly, coordinates repeatability over the processed period was computed in order to assess the positioning stability. In this regard, the lowest values in both horizontal and vertical direction were reached by GPS+GLONASS solutions. From the perspective of precise products, the repeatability results were dependent on the selected constellation where mainly a specific behavior of product from Wuhan University (WUM) for Galileo system was observed.",

The relative reduction in the velocities of compression and shear waves with depth under the influence of increasing pressure and temperature in the range of 5-25 km is about 2 %. The observed increase in seismic velocity with depth may be due to changes in the degree of metamorphic transformation of rocks. ARTICLE INFO",

Appearances to dispute about tectonical character of this zone was made a trench near Habartice, 3 km north from Hanusovice. Detailed mapping and trench prove, that on contact of marbles of Branna Group and migmatites of Stare Město Group is up to 50 m of cataclasites. This tectonic zone on the contact between Lugicum and Silesicum is very probably steeply dipping to west and it has character of left-handed horizontal movement. Quartz, graphite, limonite and locally ankerite or dolomite, rarely chalcopyrite occur often on the crushed zones.

The main reasons behind the occurrence of landslides in this area are heavy rainfall, weak geological strata, seismic zones and active faults. Several episodes of roads blockage due to landslide is one of the major problem in this area, therefore, this study is carried out for landslide susceptibility analysis along the roads of Kotli to Trar Khel, Azad Kashmir, NW Sub-Himalayas. Geographic information system (GIS) is used to interpret remote sensing, geological strata and topographical data. Total ten anthropogenic and physical factors (aspects, fault, lithology, drainage density, curvature, distance to roads, landuse landcover, slope, seismic and elevation) were examined by Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) technique. The thematic layers of all factors were prepared for the preparation of the final susceptibility map by using a weighted overlay method (WOM). The susceptibility map classified the study area into four susceptible classes of low, moderate, high and very high. The spatial analysis and result outcomes depicted that active faults, slope gradient and landuse landcover may facilitate landslide phenomena. The results were verified by landslide density analyses (LDA), receiver operator characteristics (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) with predictive accuracy of 77 % that is rated as satisfactory by many researchers.",

Gravity and magnetic data were analyzed using different techniques, such as wavenumber filtering, least-squares separation techniques, and tilt derivatives. Euler deconvolution with different structural indexes (SI), power spectrum analyses, 3-D crustal modeling. The deep-seated structures affecting the study area, and the basement depth, which range between 1170 and 4590 m., have been utilized. The main structural trends affecting the study area were delineated to control the groundwater aquifer's regional geometry. Moreover, it was found that the NorthWest-SouthEast trend direction – Suez Gulf trend – was caused by primary shear, and the NorthEast-SouthWest trend direction – Aqaba Gulf trend – was caused by the secondary shear. The direction of each trend's lateral movement was to the right and the left, respectively. Meanwhile, the geoelectrical resistivity measurements were also utilized to determine the ground water-bearing formations using eighteen deep vertical electrical soundings (VES) stations. The results revealed the depth to the uppermost part of the Nubian sandstone aquifer ranging between 598 and 1106 m; the combination of the depth to the uppermost part of the Nubian aquifer, the depth of the basement relief map revealed that the aquifer thickness varies from 430 to 3750 m, and the resistivity values ranging between 22 and 214 Ω.m.",

For the triple-frequency phase observations, two EWL code-phase combinations and one GF-phase combination are jointly employed to detect and repair cycle slips. Based on the different performances in the success of cycle slip detection and repair, this paper uses GF-phase combinations to detect and repair cycle slip individually. Specifically, the GF-phase combination with a large MTIV value is applied to detect cycle slip possessing the stronger ability to resist ionospheric delay. Besides, the GF-phase combination with a higher success rate of cycle slip repair is selected to repair cycle slip, and the classic LAMBDA method and Ratio test are implemented to fix the cycle slip solution and evaluate reliability separately. For the quad-frequency phase observations, we employ a supernumerary EWL combination based on the triple-frequency, which can directly determine the cycle slip value of the 4th frequency. The results show that the cycle slip estimation value still can detect and repair all real and artificially added cycle slips even under harsh conditions. Moreover, the overall cycle slip repair success rate is greater than 99.99 %.",

    "abstract": "Numidian quartz-rich sandstones collected from four different reconstructed sections along the Apennine chain of Southern Italy, have been studied for their textural, petrographic and geochemical characteristics to verify their potential industrial use. Sampling was carried out along a NW-SE transect: Monteverde and Aquilonia sections at NW (Campania Region) and Valsinni and Rotondella ones at SE (Lucania Region). The sandstones from NW successions are subarkoses with subordinate sublitharenites. High compositional maturity is shown by these sandstones containing high SiO2 values (93wt% in average) and lowest amounts of CaO (0.08 wt%), MgO (0.1wt%), Fe2O3 (0.9 wt%) due to the absence of carbonate components (cement and lithics) and scarce presence of clay-ferruginous cement. The sandstones from SE successions show lower contents of SiO2 (87 wt% in average) and relatively higher contents of CaO (up to 7.4 wt%), MgO (up to 1.9 wt%) and Fe2O3 (up to 4.6 wt%) as compared to the previous ones, connected to the presence of calcite and clay-ferruginous cements; these can be classified as Fe-sands with subordinate sublitharenites. The sandstones from NW area show a better potential vocation to be used in the glass industry. However, the coloring elements contents are too high for clear or optical glass production. They are it is suitable as raw material for colored glass, insulating fibres, foundry molds or air Crete. With the aim of assessing the possible improvement of chemical characters, four granulometric fractions (A&lt; 63 μm, B 63-125 μm, C 125-250 μm and D &gt;250μm) were analyzed considering four samples from NW successions. Based on chemical composition, C and D fractions from Aquilonia area, are the most suitable for a coloured glass, while fractions A (&lt;63 μm) and B (63-125 μm) mixed in proportions of 40 % (A) and 60 % (B), appropriately cleaned of clays, heavy minerals and iron hydroxides, could be used as raw material for the paint industry. The obtained results suggest a complete exploitation of this type of sandstones in the manufacturing industry, reducing waste materials and enhancing the economic value of these resources from southern regions of Italy.",

Libyan Petroleum Institute provided the data of aeromagnetic that was used in this study. The data was used to study the structure beneath the Jahamah Platform by using Oasis montaj software. Various filters from the software have been applied to enhance determining the fault system within the study area. An RTP filter was applied to the magnetic data to construct a reduction to the pole anomaly map. The subsurface structural elements underneath the study area were identified using Total horizontal derivative (THD), CET analysis, and Euler deconvolution. 2-D forward modelling of the area was constructed based on gravity data, and then the basement depth was estimated to range from 2.2 km to 3.1 km based on the model. Based on the interpretation of the constructed maps, the area has a number of faults that trend in NE-SW, NNW-SSE, N-S and NW-SE and faults depth ranging between 790 m to 3102 m.",

In this respect, the coupled dynamic equations which are known as u-p equations were used, and instead of crisp values for input parameters, including permeability coefficient, specific mass of the soil, compressibility and shear modulus, their fuzzy numbers were used. At the end, displacements and pore water pressure created during earthquake were reported as fuzzy numbers. After verifying procedures of fuzzy analysis by experimental results from the centrifuge model test No. 1 from the VELACS project, several membership grades were considered. Firstly, the effect of fuzzification of each input soil parameter investigated individually, and then effect of considering all four input soil parameters as fuzzy numbers was analyzed by developed method. It was indicated that results of the analysis during the effective time of the earthquake were strongly influenced by the shear modulus and partially by compressibility modulus, and after this time, it was mainly affected by the permeability coefficient. Also considering uncertainty nature of specific mass of the soil had no significant effect on the results.",

    "abstract": "The main target of the present study is to investigate the foundation layers and the subsurface structures in an Egyptian solar plant site using geophysical techniques including the seismic refraction and Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW). The studied solar park is situated at about 40 km to the north of Aswan city on the Aswan-Cairo highway road and is classified as the largest solar plant in Africa and worldwide. Due to its location in the vicinity of the most prone earthquake area in Egypt (Aswan seismic zone); it is imperative to mitigate the earthquake hazard in this region. The geophysical results show that the subsurface foundation in this site is primarily composed of two layers. The upper one is loose and incompetent soil sediments that extend down to about 10 m depth with P-wave velocity ranging from 400 to 1000 m/s and shear-wave velocity ranging from 260 to 550 m/s. The deeper section is considered the main foundation layer with velocities ranging between 650 and 1900 m/s and from 350 to 950 m/s for P-wave and shear-wave, respectively. The average shear-wave velocities calculated for the topmost 30 m (Vs30) vary almost between 319 and 834 m/s; thereby the studied site is primarily ranked into classes C&amp;D (180-360 m/s &amp; 360-760 m/s, respectively) according to the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) soil classification. Additionally, the southwestern and southeastern zones of the site area are characterized by maximum velocity values, relative high values of rock densities, rigidity or shear modulus “μ”, Standard Penetration Test (N-Value), ultimate bearing capacity and allowable bearing capacity, while the low values are observed through the northern and middle sectors across the area. This study an integral part of many works being carried out delineating the subsurface foundation structures around the solar plant and allows the most appropriate sites for constructing the renewable energy plants to be sited away from the highly hazards prone areas.",

So far the GPS network has been measured in three campaigns within the last three years with very good accuracies (1-4 mm in the horizontal plane). Although it is early to draw conclusions on the velocity field and on strain patterns it can be noted that, the data from the extensometers demonstrate both fault-normal opening and shear motion. Given that the total offset on the Kaparelli fault is small, and the geological data suggesting a segmented character of this fault, we expect in the near future to differentiate fault slip and strain accumulation among segments.",

    "abstract": "The rock units of the NW Himalayan region are fragile, heavily fractured and highly deformed due to active tectonics and complex geological setup.Fast urbanization, road constructions along hill slopes and other infrastructural development activities also increased the slopes instability problems.The present study emphasizes the application of rock mass classification to estimate the rock mass properties along the Yadgar section Muzaffarabad, NW Himalayas, Pakistan.For this purpose, Rock Mass Rating (RMR) and Geological Strength Index (GSI) were used to characterize and classify the rock masses.In the present study, twenty-five sites have been investigated to evaluate rock properties along the Muzaffarabad-Neelum road, Sub-Himalayas, Pakistan.Result of the study shows that the Abbottabad Formation of Cambrian age is vulnerable in the Yadgar section with extremely poor RQD (Rock Quality Designation), lowest UCS (Unconfined Compression Strength) values and closely spaced discontinuities.RMR values of the Abbottabad Formation ranges from 40-54 and classified as Poor to Fair having low GSI (20±3-35±3), blocky, disintegrated structure.The Paleocene Hangu Formation has lowest GSI (28±3-29±3; Blocky, Disturbed/ Seamy in nature) having RMR (40-45) and Eocene Kuldana Formation has GSI (30±3-45±3; Blocky) having RMR (34-67), are categorized as heavily broken, disintegrated and poorly interlocked rock masses.RMR values of rock units of the Paleocene Lockhart Formation (52-60), the Miocene Murree Formation (38-63), and the Eocene Margala Hill Limestone (38-61) are relatively higher values of GSI ranges from (35±3-45±3; 35±3-50±3; 30±3-40±3) respectively.RMR and GSI values in Yadgar section, ranges between 34-67 and 20±3-50±3 respectively.Analysis shows positive correlation between GSI and RMR values.This approach to evaluate the rock mass classification through RMR and GSI will give the better estimation of rock mass properties along Muzaffarabad-Neelum road to identify the vulnerable slopes and design effective geotechnical measures.",

The geoid undulation can be predicted using emerging mathematics tools and algorithms. The objective of this study was to develop a model for predicting the geoid undulation using Gaussian process regression (GPR), one of the soft machine learning algorithms having different covariance functions. This method was then compared with the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and the interpolation method of inverse distance to a power (IDP) with the power of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. First, 70 % of GNSS/leveling data (422 points) were used in the training phase. The remaining 185 points were used as testing data to check the effectiveness of the constructed model. In the GPR modeling, ten covariance functions (Materniso d= 1, 3, 5; Maternard d= 1, 3, 5; SEiso; SEard; RQiso; and RQard) were tested for prediction on this dataset. The GPR based on the Materniso (d = 1) covariance function model was introduced as an effective method for predicting geoid undulation and provided the best results (RMSE = 8.32 cm, MAE = 5.51 cm, R2 = 0.98968) when compared with the other developed GPR models. In addition, the statistical findings showed that the accuracy of all the GPR models was also better in predicting geoid undulation than the RBFNN, GRNN, and IDP with the power of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.",

The elastic response of the rock is typically determined by sonic logging calibrated with laboratory tests. This paper presents the laboratory ultrasonic measurements of the core samples, performed to determine the elastic moduli and brittleness index (BI) of the coal. Tests were performed on 20 core plugs from four coal mines located in the central and southern part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB), Poland, characterized by varied maceral composition and mineral additives. The samples were cored out in three directions: perpendicular, parallel, and at a 45° angle to the bedding planes, and tested with the given effective pressure. The majority of the samples were saturated by water with a potassium chloride additive (swelling inhibitor). A P- and S-wave velocity upward trend was observed when the mineral content in the samples increased. Elevated velocities in samples of high mineral content resulted in exceeding the Ed to vd limits for coal as proposed in literature. With increased BI, upward trends in the liptinite and inertinite content as well as a downward trend in the vitrinite content were observed. The dynamic elastic moduli of the measured samples were compared to the available literature data.",

Werner deconvolution profile shows a high-density intrusion (about 1.8 km from the surface) within the sedimentary sequence. The intrusion may be the result of the Eocene volcanic activities near the Gharyan region. The 2-D model shows that the basement depth of Jifara plain ranges from 2.8 to 3.0 km.

    "abstract": "Owing to the disastrous consequences of ground subsidence in the urban area, great attention had always been accorded to areas with suspected signs of subsidence occurrence in order to mitigate its effect. Microgravity and electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) survey techniques were conducted at a parking lot of which possible occurrence of subsidence is anticipated due to the increased exposure of surface cracks and very slight depression. This study aimed to map and delineate the subsurface condition of the area with the view of revealing probable subsidence prone zones within the study area. To this end, the microgravity survey data was acquired at a station interval of 2 m. Pole-dipole configuration with 2 m electrode separation was adopted for the electrical resistivity imaging survey. The two methods showed good correlation with each other and proved their effectiveness in imaging the subsurface. A large proportion of the subsurface area was found to be residual soil (mainly silt and or clayey sand) with saturated zones identified by low gravity (&lt; -40.94 mGal) and resistivity (&lt;150 Ω.m) values, which have the tendency to undergo expansion and contraction processes due to rise and fall in moisture content. The subsurface condition was found to be relatively stable, devoid of any subsidence triggering features such as voids or cavities. However, it is inferred to be unsuitable for engineering structures due to the expansive and contractive properties of the subsurface geomaterials (residual soil). Therefore, it is concluded that the area is not prone to subsidence and the surface cracks presents are mere effects of the expansion and contraction process, which could be avoided by the excavation of the expansive soil or good engineering design before the establishment of any structure.",

Results from joint evaluation of geophysical data and InSAR not only confirmed detected deformations but also notified on other locations with tendencies to subsidence in the neighborhood of main faults. The combination of the methods to identify displacement tendencies in urbanized areas is very effective.",

    "abstract": "Mechanically strong sandstones consider as a potential construction material which can withstand modest load and not associated with any geologic fractures. This work is about understanding the macro-mechanical properties of sandstones by studying several petrographic parameters, which could provide evidence of their influence on mechanical strength. Here the authors were considered the Bhuban sandstones of western Indo-Burmese Ranges (IBR) of north-eastern India to investigate the above criteria. The result shows that sandstones have a mean grain size between 108 to 208 μm. Moderate to poorly sorted (phi scale ranges 0.56–1.5) grains show greater content of rounded constituents (43–68 %) with sphericity between 0.65–0.85; along with moderate packing properties (packing density 54–77 %; packing proximity 32–70 %). The grains join by mostly straight (20–54 %) and concavo-convex (13–45 %) contacts; with lesser point (5–13 %) and sutured contacts (8-44 %). Schmidt Hammer rebound values (R-values) were used to calculate and analyse the uniaxial confined stress (UCS); which again validated with UCS testing of core samples. The comparison between macro-mechanical parameters and the UCS shows interrelationship among rock constituents which hold the key to the mechanical strength of the rock. The presence of angular grains and semi-angular spherical grains diminish the macro-mechanical strength to some extent. Moreover, FETEM-EDX analysis confirms the micro-weathering of the angular grains, which have a deformed lattice setting. These findings show that macro-mechanical and micro-nano scale properties of sandstones influence the rock strength.",

The aim of this study is to suggest a new chemical index parameter for the prediction of basaltic rocks’ brittleness. In the order of that abovementioned purpose, a total of 23 basaltic rock samples were collected from different region of Turkey. Samples were initially tested to determine their chemical properties. Then, mechanical tests were carried out to define the brittleness indices (B1, B2, and B3) for each corresponding sample. Finally, relations between parameters obtained from test results and brittleness indices were examined with regression analysis. According to the results obtained, a new chemical parameter (CP) was proposed for predicting brittleness via major oxide element components of basaltic rocks. It was found out that, B1 and B2 are not reliable parameters for predicting the different properties, however; B3 and CP can be employed as good criteria for predicting the different properties of basaltic rocks (especially in terms of chemical and mechanical properties).",

The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of data driven quantitative models of landslide susceptibility assessment using geospatial tools in Jhelum valley of the Himalayas. This area suffers from extreme rainfall events due to the local climate and has experienced significant and widespread landslide events in recent years. Four probabilistic data-driven models are employed for this purpose, which includes the weight of evidence (WOE), information value method (IVM), frequency ratio (FR), and certainty factor (CF). These assessed models are based on integrating landslide contributing factors and a ground truthing-based landslide inventory of 437 landslides. The landslide susceptibility maps were presented by categorizing the study area into very low to very high susceptibility zone by Jenks natural breaks method. The performance of models was evaluated by a sensitivity analysis using Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) method. The ROC-validated results of success rate curves for WOE, IVM, FR and CF were 80 %, 78 %, 77 %, and 76 % respectively. The prediction rate curve of WOE, IVM, FR, and CF was 78 %, 77 %, 75 %, and 78 % respectively. The results showed the reasonable efficiency of applied models for landslide susceptibility assessment in the study area and applicable to regions with similar geomorphological conditions. Conclusively, the comparison of applied models revealed the promising results of used approaches.",

    "abstract": "In this study the compressive strength and durability of soft clay soil stabilized with halloysite nanotubes are investigated. Halloysite nanotubes are novel 1D natural nanomaterials which are widely used in reinforcing polymer, pollution remediation, and as nanoreactors for biocatalyst. The wide use of halloysite nanotubes is due to their high aspect ratio, appropriate mechanical strength, high thermal stability, nature-friendly and cost-effectiveness. However, the use of halloysite nanotubes as a stabilizing agent for improving the durability of soil is not clear. In this research, halloysite nanotubes was used in the amounts of 2%, 5% and 10% by the weight of dried soil. Unconfined compressive strength, wet/dry cycles and freeze/thaw cycles tests were performed to evaluate the strength and durability of stabilized soft clay soil. Experimental results showed that halloysite nanotubes considerably improves the compressive strength and durability of soft clay soil. The optimum amount of halloysite nanotubes for soil stabilizing in terms of compressive strength and durability was 5%. The compressive strength of soft clay increased as much as 129% by applying 5% halloysite nanotubes. Also, the specimen containing 5% halloysite nanotubes showed the least strength loss after wet/dry and freeze/thaw cycles. The soil sample containing 5% halloysite nanotubes lost 20% of its initial compressive strength after 8 cycles of freezing and thawing, while the soil sample without any halloysite content lost 100% of its compressive strength after the same number of freezing and thawing. Based on the obtained results, the use of halloysite nanotubes in order to enhance the strength and durability of soft clay is strongly recommended.",

As a result of this study, the presence of gold mineralisation in sheared zones is noticed. BIFs are the economically prominent litho-units in the GSB hosting high-grade iron ore deposits along with sulphide mineralised shear zones.

    "abstract": "The boundary conditions and loading ways of geostress field of oil and gas trap are the difficulties in the numerical simulation and geomechanical analysis. Owing to the limited data of geostress, unclear tectonic movement and complex geological structure, the stress field cannot be solved directly. Boundary load inversion is a very important method to analyze the stress field of rock mass. Based on the measured in-situ stress of S4 member in C41 fault block of Liangjialou oilfield, the boundary loads of the geological body stress field are inversely calculated. Meanwhile, the optimal boundary stress obtained by the inverse modeling is used to study the stress field near the fault. This method can overcome the shortcomings of common back analysis, such as boundary load adjustment method and regression method, and improve the calculation accuracy of stress field. The results show that the inversion method is simple, reliable, accurate and fast. The distribution of stress field can well reflect the in homogeneity of the magnitude and direction of the stress field near the fault. Therefore, this method has a certain application value in boundary load inversion, and the initial stress field distribution of faults provides a precondition for local stability.",

A study in the Bujang Valley found monuments related to trading activities and others that functioned as a temple related to the Hindu-Buddhist period. The main purpose of this study was to resolve issues and problems arising from previous studies related to the Bujang Valley civilisation, particularly in terms of iron studies. Geophysics plays a vital role in assisting archaeologists to obtain excellent preliminary results before they proceed with excavation and digging works. Therefore, the 2-D resistivity and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) methods were conducted to locate and map the potential iron smelting site at Site B2 (SB2). Three main characteristics that can be observed on the surface are a mound area, exposed clay bricks and surface finds. Two-D resistivity showed the resistivity values of a possible buried structure, with values &gt; 800 Ωm. Radargram profiles showed the highest amplitude, indicating the reflections uncovered in the location in certain survey lines. This paper presents the first summary of research on the metallurgical sites in the Bujang Valley, the most important site in Malaysia. Geophysical methods, which rely on a physical contrast between buried archaeological features and the properties of the surrounding subsoil, can assist archaeological investigations.",

In recent years, finalization of modern GNSS systems Galileo and BeiDou has brought a possibility of multi-GNSS positioning. The paper focuses on evaluation of possible benefits of multi-GNSS constellations in landslide monitoring. While simulating observational conditions of selected Recica landslide in the Czech Republic, one-month data from well-established permanent GNSS reference stations were processed. Besides various constellation combinations, differential and Precise Point Positioning techniques, observation data lengths and observation sampling intervals were evaluated. Based on the results, using a combination of GPS and GLONASS, or GPS, GLONASS and Galileo systems can be recommended, together with a static differential technique and observation periods for data collection exceeding eight hours. In the last step, data from GNSS repetitive campaigns realized at the Recica landslide during two years were processed with optimal setup and obtained displacement results were compared to standard geotechnical measurements.",

    "abstract": "On the Śniezka mountaintop in the Giant Mts. there are situated three GPS points. The first one situated on the Polish side (SNIE), a former fundamental trigonometric station, is an epoch site maintained by the Department of Geodesy and Photogrammetry AU Wroclaw that has been used for geodynamic research connected with the EXTENDED SAGET, CERGOP and CEGRN international programmes for the past 10 years. Since 2001 two other GPS sites are located on the Czech side of the Śniezka Mt. One of them (SNE1), placed on the Czech fundamental trigonometric point, serves for an occasional GPS epoch measurement point and the other one (SNEC) belongs to a permanent GPS observatory point maintained by the Institute of Rock Structure and Mechanics AS CR, Prague. Since GPS observations have been performed in 2001 and 2002 simultaneously within a few international research programmes, this fact enabled to transfer geodynamic observations from one site to another one, e.g. from the epoch site SNIE point to the permanent GPS observatory SNEC. From this viewpoint, several day observations were carried out at the same time on all three GPS points SNIE, SNEC and SNE1 in 2002. Afterwards range and angle measurements with precise Leica TCA 2003 Total Station were performed to verify and mutually link relative positions of all three GPS points.",

    "abstract": "A morphologically distinct intrusive massif emerges from sedimentary Mesozoic/Tertiary cover in Eastern Socotra forming the high Haggier Mts. It is mostly composed of peralkaline and hypersolvus granite partly accompanied by gabbroic rocks. Amphibole, the sole mafic mineral of the granite, shows predominately the arfvedsonite composition, while riebeckite, for which Socotra is reported in most manuals of mineralogy as the “locus typicus”, occurs subordinately only. Either Paleozoic or Tertiary age has been assumed for this massif for a long time. In the last decade, however, K/Ar datings have been published clearly showing Precambrian (Neoproterozoic) age. The present authors confirm with somewhat modified results this statement by five new radiometric measurements of monomineral amphibole fractions yielding values of 687 to 741 Ma for granites and 762 Ma for gabbroic rocks. The massif represents an isolated segment of numerous late postorogenic PanAfrican A-granite bodies piercing the Nubian-Arabian Shield and is explained as the result of partial melting of Pan-African calc-alkaline shield rocks in the closing stage of the orogeny.",

To study the stress evolution characteristics of surrounding rock and asymmetric support control technology of gob side entry retaining with high water material, the evolution law of stress and deformation of surrounding rock in gob side entry retaining during working face mining is studied by theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and field measurement. According to the stress variation of overlying strata during the mining process of the working face, the mechanical models before and after the basic roof fracture were established respectively. The stress and deformation of the filling body and the roof on the side of the filling body are larger, and the stress and deformation of the solid coal and the roof on the side of solid coal are smaller. The maximum stress is at 3 m away from the roadway. The first weighting step distance is 40 m and the periodic weighting step distance is 30 m. Based on the stress and deformation characteristics of the roadway surrounding, the roadway surrounding support is divided into filling bodyside, solid coal side, and middle part of roadway roof. The asymmetric support technology of \"filling body+ double row hydraulic prop+ I-beam+ high-strength pretension anchor cable+ high-strength bolt\" is proposed. The field engineering practice shows that the surrounding rock control effect of asymmetric support technology with high water material is good.",

The development of hillslopes for rapid urbanisation and heavy rainfall has detrimental impacts on Penang Island soil layers. Modelling, simulation, and the development of susceptibility maps were past methods used to predict potential ground deformations of Penang Island. There is no published work on the Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique, where ground deformation of the region has been holistically studied. This work integrates the Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique with Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to monitor the deformation on the island and identify possible subsurface causes for the disturbance. Twenty-four descending Sentinel-1A datasets acquired between 14th July 2017 and 13th October 2018 were processed to monitor and map ground deformation areas with a focus on three selected regions- Batu Feringghi (BF), Paya Terubong (PT), and Tanjung Bungah (TB), where multiple landslides occurred between 2017 and 2018. InSAR results were later analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) tool and validated by the available Global Positioning System (GPS) analysis. InSAR analyses reveal the mean deformation values of -3.13 mm/yr, -2.76 mm/yr and -4.77 mm/yr for the BF, PT, and TB areas. GPR surveys were conducted with a 300/800 MHz dual-frequency antenna at the three selected study areas. Anomalies (wall cracks, road fissures, cavities, drains, and pipes) detected using GPR profiles correlated well with the permanent scatterer points calculated using the InSAR technique.",

    "abstract": "The physical properties of tidal gravimetric instruments allow recording, not only tidal effects, but also waves generated by earthquakes. Three gravimetric stations with determined transfer functions and co-located seismic stations from the observatories in Western and Central Europe were selected for analysis. The observatories are equipped with almost all types of sensors available on the market, which allow for thorough analysis of earthquake recordings in the period range of 10–1000 s. In total, over 10,000 traces of worldwide earthquakes were investigated. The saturation levels of gravimeters as well as a correlation between the gravimetric and seismometric signals of an earthquake were carefully analysed. A simple processing scheme of gravimetric signal of earthquakes was adopted thanks to the probabilistic power spectral density analysis of continuous recordings. The detail analysis of transfer function of gravimeters allowed to define a period range when a sensitivity coefficient (calibration factor) and a time lag value only can be used to properly describe the properties of instruments. What’s more, it has been shown based on the calculated group-velocity dispersion curves of fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves, that the Earth’s mantle structure can be determined for greater depths from the recording of tidal gravimeters than from typical broad-band seismometers.",

    "abstract": "The Miocene Ishim Formation is characterized by a considerable distribution area within the southwestern Siberia.These deposits are highly dispersed and are composed mainly of angular quartz grains of aleuritic and pelitic fractions.The study of the Ishim Formation is of interest both for investigating the origin of the sediments, and for justifying these rocks as a new type of mineral raw material for the local construction materials industry.This paper presents the results of first complex studies of the Ishim Formation deposits from two outcrops Masali and Bigila.The studies included determination of the particle size distribution on the laser particle analyzer, semiquantitative determination of the mineral composition (X-ray diffraction analysis), as well as, determination of contents of sesquioxides (X-ray fluorescence analysis), rare and trace elements (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) and measurement of specific surface area.The most representative samples were chosen for petrographic studies.In certain extent these deposits are characterized by quite high degree of homogeneity of the mineral, chemical, and granulometric compositions.The main component is SiO 2 (about 70 %); other most important components are Al 2 O 3 (about 14 %) and Fe 2 O 3 (2-5 %).At the same time, deposits of the upper part of the Ishim Formation are depleted in CaO, MnO, MgO, TiO 2 , and P 2 O 5 .This is probably due to the fact that the proportion of clayey minerals in the upper part of the formation is lower than that in the lower one.The contents of trace elements in the Ishim Formation are lower or close to their clarke values in the Earth's crust.This is with the exception of such elements as Eu, Tb, Cr, and Sb, which form a strong anomaly and, to a lesser extent, a number of other elements that is probably related to the tectonic setting during the period of sedimentation.The CIA values vary from 68-70 in the lower unit of the Ishim Formation at the transition to the sandy facies to 75-80 in the upper one, which indicates a moderate weathering of rocks.The results obtained testify to the fact that these deposits were formed under the conditions of degrading shallow water bodies.A distinct geomorphological confinement to boundaries of the Neogene river paleovalleys, continuity, high dispersion and, predominantly, quartz composition allow us to consider these deposits as a promising type of filler for construction materials industry.",

    "abstract": "In geoscience research, elevation anomaly modeling plays vital roles in engineering design and construction.In this paper, an improved Hardy function based on Tikhonov regularization is proposed to model elevation anomalies in which the improved model is not constrained by the ill-posed problem induced by that the number of nodes is less than the number of data points, and it has a wider range of use scenarios.In the experimental part, numerical simulation is used to generate simulated data of elevation anomaly, which is divided into training group and checking group, and the hardy functions before and after improvement are used to establish elevation anomaly models, and the performances of the two models are compared.is the results show that the improved Hardy function has better prediction performance with accuracy improvement of 79.75 % due to selecting more nodes and obtaining a more optimal model.",

Analyses of the subsidence magnitude and the length and direction of horizontal displacements showed that the subsidence trough was formed unevenly not only due to the position of the exploited local longwall panels and their different size but also showed a notable effect of the dominant tectonic fault. The significantly uneven development of the subsidence trough negatively affects line constructions. Terrain deformations of the road and stream pipeline were computed and classified into the building site categories according to the Czech standard ČSN 73 0039. The course of individual deformations in the monitored locality is influenced by a complex geo-mechanical situation. While the course of the subsidence curves is continuous at the observed pipeline and the classification of individual sections into building site categories corresponds with that, the road profile points out a more complex development of surface deformations. At the end of the observed period, 5 % of the profiles’ sections fell into category III (medium intensity), 49 % into category IV (moderate intensity) and 32 % stayed in category V (very moderate intensity of mining effects).",

    "abstract": "The Salt Range (SR) is an ENE-WSW trending fault bend fold that form the range front of the Himalayan fold and thrust belt in Pakistan. The research is carried out in the Eastern Salt Range (ESR) with the objective to determine the paleostress inversion from reduced stress tensors by using fracture data. The surface morphology of the fold is predominantly shaped by Eocene limestone that provide best exposure of joint surfaces that can be used for kinematic and dynamic analysis. We adopted a classical circle inventory method in the field and collected orientation data (dip amount, direction, and strike) from 7 localities (outcrop stations) of the Eocene Sakesar Limestone. Three prominent fracture trends are present in the study area namely, FS-1; (E-W), FS-2; (ENE-WSW) and FS-3; (NNE-SSW). For stress analysis and data processing we used the Tensor Program of Delvaux and Sperner (2003) and calculated seven stress fields by the Right Dihedron Method. The orientations of the principal stress axes (ϭ1, ϭ2, ϭ3) and Stress Ratio (R) depicts ϭ1(Shmax) and ϭ2 are sub-horizontal while ϭ3 is vertical in all stress tensors. The paleostress results show that ϭ1(Shmax) oriented NNE-SSW belonging to a compressive regime. It is suggested that ϭ1 developed more or less perpendicular to the trend of SRT and other relevant structures in the Potwar Plateau.",

Within the framework of the geodynamical model constructed the horizontal extent of the 2D heat flux anomaly observed in the rear of the Caucasus mountain belt corresponds to subduction velocity of ~ 40 mm per year which is close to that observed with the help of geodetic means. The upwelling convective mantle flows can transport the mantle calc-alkali magmas (containing metals) to the subsurface Earth’s crust layers, thus making the ore deposits to be attached to the upper lithospheric locations above the ascending flows of the Karig-Richter vortices.",

    "abstract": "The soil engineer needs to be able to readily identify difficult or problematic soils and to determine the amount of settlement that may occur. This paper deals with the assessment and identification of three types of difficult soils: collapsible soils, swelling soils, and liquefiable soils. In the first instance, the study investigates the effect of some soil properties on wetting-induced collapse strain and the swelling potential of soils. Also, two new methods for predicting soil collapse and swelling potential are developed. The proposed relationships correlate between collapse strain and swelling potential and some soil parameters which are believed to govern soil collapse and swelling. Validation of these two relationships with some data reported in literature is also examined. Furthermore, the paper describes the different steps suggested in a new procedure for soil liquefaction assessment. The procedure was presented in the form of an evaluation guide. In addition, a relationship was suggested for computing the potential for liquefaction. An application of the proposed procedure to a practical case is included in order to validate and illustrate the different steps to be followed in the suggested evaluation procedure.",

In accordance with past (analogue) seismogram interpretations, we did not treat digital seismograms as a time series, as per the general method, but, rather, converted them into time snaps of continuous data flow. Multichannel seismograms were represented with a time frequency domain in the form of multilayer images, with each signal channel forming one image layer. Images were then exposed to CNN (composed of three convolutional blocks whose architecture design was justified using Bayesian optimization). To improve reliability, we evaluated the posterior type function (PTP) as a combination of the probabilities of all of the considered classes of signal types (five in our case) which increased robustness of the identification. For data, we used records of acoustic emission (AE) events. The events were generated during laboratory loading experiments originally performed to study material/rock properties. As known, AE events may be studied in the same manner as natural earthquakes and treated in other ways as laboratory earthquake models. AE events are less complex compared to natural earthquakes where many of the physical parameters are known or may be controlled. Based on our results, we concluded that the successful identification of AE events is a necessary step prior to applying the proposed methodology for identifying natural earthquakes in seismograms.",

In the present study, the above-mentioned techniques are applied to the reservoir interval of Basal Sand of Cretaceous age widely distributed in the Lower Indus Basin of Pakistan. The data used for this purpose consists of complete suits of wireline logs from four well A, B, C and D. The primary goal of this work is to understand the trends of seismic parameters such as P-wave velocity (VP), S-wave velocity (VS), bulk modulus, bulk density as a function of ﬂuid saturation and porosity in this sand interval. Petrophysical analysis based on well logs is used to obtain petrophysical properties such as porosity, the volume of shale, fluid saturation, P-wave velocity (VP), S-wave velocity (VS) and density at reservoir conditions. The results show that seismic parameters are very sensitive to fluid saturation, fluid types and rock-forming sediments. Reservoir porosity and fluid saturation control the elastic response of Basal Sand due to which seismic velocities decrease with an increase in porosity and fluid saturation.",

    "abstract": "Oil and gas are the main reserves in the fractures of rocks. Under different pressure conditions, fracture permeability of reservoir rock directly affects the flow of oil and gas, which is an important object of oil and gas exploration and development. The permeability of single fractured rock and double fractured rock under different pressure conditions was studied by using high-precision hydro-mechanics coupled triaxial experimental equipment. The experimental scheme is as follows: (i) permeability test under increasing confining pressure, (ii) permeability test under increasing liquid pressure, (iii) permeability test under cyclic loading and unloading deviatoric stress and (iv) permeability test under synchronously increasing confining pressure and deviatoric stress. Results show that the entire change of permeability is irreversibly reduced. This is due to the presence of residual factors in permeability after the dilation cycle and the recompaction cycle ends. On the basis of the dual medium model of fracture, the permeability model of fractured rock is proposed considering the interaction among fracture system, matrix system and expansion deformation of fracture under external stress. The simulation results of the model are in good agreement with the experimental results. These results can provide an important basis for the prediction of permeability of fractured rock and efficient oil and gas exploitation.",

Its tectonic activity, especially in the NW part and in the neighbouring Cheb basin, is well known and has been proven by present-day earthquake swarms, mantle-derived CO2 emanations, geophysical and paleoseismological research. It seems that other parts of the MLF (especially segments of NNW-SSE and N-S orientation) might also have been active during the Pleistocene, possible even in the Holocene. This study provides a robust set of morphometric analyses – mountain-front sinuosity, basin asymmetry, longitudinal stream profiles, SL-index, which assesses the possibility of recent tectonic activity. The results suggest that the activity of the central and southern part of the MLF could have been very young. A reconstruction of the evolution of the stream network of the Mže River, as a result of different timing of the activity of particular segments of the MLF, is also put forward. The first ideas about the evolution of terrain morphology and the stream network are proposed by this study, however subsequent field research (geophysics, paleoseismology) could prove and date the tectonic activity. The delineation of segments with young activity may also have a great implication for seismic hazard assessment.",

In 1996–2019, the stabilization and the following drop of the sea level of 1.39 m led to an average annual rate of accumulation processes up to 14 times higher than the average annual rate of erosion processes. This pattern is observed along the entire coastline of those periods. Erosion processes in the initial stage (1976–1996) increased the indentation and length of the coastline by almost 2 times, and in the next stage (1996–2019) the intensification of accumulation processes resulted in the smoothing and reduction of the coastline by 35 %. Statistical analysis of coastlines was carried out by processing Landsat satellite images for 1976–2019; each coastline was divided into 14 segments according to geomorphological zones and their morphostructures in the study area.

    "abstract": "Landslides are often regarded as secondary hazards, typically triggered by major catastrophic events like storms, floods, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes.In tropical regions such as Malaysia, the prevalent geohazard phenomenon involves landslides induced by moisture or rainfall.These incidents predominantly occur due to the unique composition of residual soils in the area, resulting from the weathering of bedrock in situ.Major landslides and local slope failures occur when water saturation exceeds a critical limit in certain parts of the slope.The foundation of a dependable stability analysis lies in the geological model of the landslide, which should accurately reflect the actual conditions.To achieve this, a thorough understanding of the landslide phenomenon and access to high-quality datasets are essential.In this study, 2D electrical resistivity imaging and seismic refraction tomography were utilized to identify subsurface characteristics, along with geotechnical data for data corroboration.The study shows a highly weathered zone (ρ< 1200 Ωm; V p < 1200 m/s) was identified at a depth of less than 5 m.The number of blows (N-values) for standard penetration test (SPT) indicate a low range of 1-15, representing the low stiffness of the soil condition.The N-values show variation in the number of blows with depth, suggesting that the layer may not be competent due to the present heterogeneous material caused by the highly weathered process.The results emphasize the benefits of incorporating both geophysical and geotechnical parameters to define subsurface properties.The study offers insights into how spatial distributions of these parameters can be utilized to minimize uncertainty in ground models.",

    "abstract": "The territory of the Polar Urals is characterized by significant forecast resources of natural zeolites.In case of their successful development, the resources of the zeolite deposits can provide a positive impact on the development of a number of industries in the adjacent regions of the Urals and Western Siberia.At the same time, the available data about the zeolite-bearing rocks of the Polar Urals present in published research paper and materials of geological funds is rather contradictory.The results of research performed by different scientific groups often contain opposed conclusions on the mineralogical composition, the content of the commercial component in the ore, as well as on the ore reserves calculation and the potential of commercial exploitation for the same mineral occurrences.In many respects, this situation can be explained by the complexity of the geological and geomorphological conditions of the territory under consideration, the remoteness of the promising mineral occurrences from large scientific and industrial centers, and the variety of ore occurrences.This work presents the study results of lithological-petrographic features and the material composition of the eluvial debris of the Middle-Late (Givetian-Frasnian) Devonian zeolite-bearing rocks of the volcanogenicsedimentary origin within the Naunpe area of the Polar Urals.The main objective of the proposed research was to evaluate the economic feasibility of their development and possible directions for commercial exploitation of this type of ores.Research methods included petrographic study of samples of zeolite-bearing rocks in thin sections, SEM-EDS, determination of the total mineral composition by XRD and the chemical composition by XRF.Within the Naunpe area, the outcrops of zeolite-bearing rocks on the surface are represented by blankets and debris of small lumpy-gravel eluvial deposits with indistinct outlines.Macroscopically, zeolitebearing eluvial deposits are represented by reddish or pinkish in color, massive and relatively homogenous rocks.The ore occurrences are well interpreted based on the remote sensing data.According to the results of petrographic, lithological, and mineralogical studies, three main rock types were distinguished among the eluvial debris deposits: zeolite-bearing crystallo-lithoclastic tuffs of the mafic, intermediate, and felsic composition, and also tuffoargillites, and siliceous rocks.Crystallo-lithoclastic tuffs and tuffoargillites contain Ca-zeolites, represented mainly by laumontite (13.8-18.9%), which fill small open spaces between crystallites and lithoclasts.Volcanic glass fragments and feldspars from tuffoargillites are replaced partially or completely by zeolites.The content of zeolites in these rocks is even lower (less than 10 %).The characteristic features of the studied zeolite-bearing rocks from the ores of the known deposits of the Polar and Subpolar Urals have higher contents of Fe 2 O 3 , CaO и Na 2 O and lower content of K 2 O.The obtained results show that the studied rocks are quite complex, diverse, and polygenetic, as well as their formation is a result of several stages of post-volcanic authigenic mineral formation.The rather low content of zeolite minerals in these rocks and high variability of the material composition decrease the industrial potential of that eluvial debris deposits as an object of mineral raw material base.At this, they can be considered as prospecting indicator for prospecting the areas with a similar geological structure.",

Both natural samples of granodiorite with natural joints and fault surfaces and gypsum models have been tested on the Matest A129 Rock shear box apparatus. The shear strength of preexisting ruptures was measured under a fixed normal stress component. The anisotropy of the shear strength of the joints and fault surfaces reached more than 60 % of maximum strength, which is a very important value for solving structural loads. The shear strength was analyzed with polar plots. The pattern of the real joints typically showed a teardrop shape with one peak of strength in a certain direction and a minimum in the opposite direction. On the contrary, striated fault surfaces are characterized by two axial directions of minimal shear strength, i.e., longitudinal and transverse, and by two axial oblique directions with maximal shear strength, so the strength distribution in the polar graph has a four-cornered shape. The study showed that the anisotropy of the shear strength of various types of ruptures is their important feature.",

Meanwhile, the Monte Carlo significance test is utilized to distinguish the signal from the colored noise. By comparing with Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), it can be confirmed that MSSA has better signal extraction and modeling performance by taking into account the correlation of different channels. Then, taking the LHAZ station as an example, MC-MSSA is utilized to simultaneously model the three components of GNSS position time series, and the trend and periodic signals are respectively identified by Kendall nonparametric test and W-correlation correlation analysis. The result denotes that MC-MSSA can effectively model the tectonic and non-tectonic signals of GNSS position time series, and the modeled signals can more intuitively reflect the dynamic movement of the station. Finally, based on the MC-MSSA-modeled tectonic signal, we characterize the crustal deformations around the eastern Tibetan Plateau, mainly including the crustal movement and strain rate change. The results suggest that the pushing movement of the Tibetan Plateau from the Indian plate is blocked by the South China block, and the crustal movement rate is obviously decreased and appears a right-handed movement trend. Meanwhile, the junction of the Tibetan Plateau and South China block has accumulated a certain amount of stress, and the tectonic activity at the junction is relatively strong and still belongs to the dangerous zone of seismic activity.",

In order to investigate the effect of CME on the time series in GNSS networks in Shanxi, this paper proposes an improved superposition filtering method by introducing single-day solution accuracy, correlation coefficient, and spherical distance between stations as weights. The filtering effect is evaluated using the GNSS data in Shanxi. By using the improved stacking filtering method, the root mean square (RMS) values for N, E, U are reduced by approximately 27.8%, 29.0%, and 46.0%, respectively. And compared to the traditional stacking filter, our improved method can achieve better results with CME extraction. We investigate the CME spatial-temporal characteristics and its relationship with environmental loading. The results show that the CME between stations decreases as the distance between stations increases. In addition, we analyze the effect of CME on the noise component and velocity estimates. Results show that removing the CME refines the velocity and leads to a significant reduction in the magnitude of noise, indicating that the CME is dominated by the flicker noise in Shanxi Province.",

    "abstract": "Stone columns consist of granular material compacted in long cylindrical holes. They are used for improving the strength and consolidation characteristics of compressible soils. However, they are still less effective at supporting heavy loads, since they still cannot transfer applied stresses to deeper layers of soil. The main objective of this numerical study was to investigate the geotechnical performance of a combined foundation system composed of stone columns and piles grouped together under a rigid raft foundation in compressible soil. The failure mechanism of this hybrid foundation system was examined, and configurations optimizing the performance of the combined foundation system were explored. An analytical model was developed for predicting the ultimate carrying capacity of the combined system in compressible soils. It was deduced that combining stone columns and piles in one foundation system improved considerably the system’s carrying capacity. Moreover, the uppermost improvement was observed when the piles were installed on the periphery or edge of the raft foundation, while stones columns were placed at the center area of the raft. The failure of the combined foundation system started from the center of the raft and noticeably extended to its edges. Due to the presence of stone columns in the combined foundation system, the piles did not interact. The areas affected or influenced by the soil–pile interaction also did not overlap.",

    "abstract": "This study integrates remote sensing and geophysical data to identify the hydrological conditions of the Naqab reservoir watershed. The main objectives of this study are identification and the interpretation of subsurface structures and their impact on groundwater flow, the relationships between structures and groundwater and the optimum way for watershed management in this sub-basin. Geophysical data including, ground magnetic survey and 1D electrical resistivity sounding helped in identifying the lithology and delineating zones of groundwater occurrence. The magnetic data delineated the basement rock, aided in characterizing the geometry of the subsurface structures that control the land surface features and constrain groundwater flow system. The interpreted subsurface structure elements include six sets of faults trending NE-SW, NW-SE, NWW-SEE, NEE-SWW, N-S and E-W. The basement depth was estimated at zero at the southern part and about 5187 m at the northern part. Two aquifer systems were characterized, the shallow aquifer of the Wata Formation (Upper Cretaceous) and the deep aquifer of the Malha Formation (Lower Cretaceous). The probability of groundwater occurrence increases towards the central part of the study area to north direction, where the thickness of the sedimentary basin reaches its maximum at the center of the study area. Different trends of faults were interpreted from are the geo-electrical cross-sections along two transects. Three patterns of faults were characterized including step faults, graben faults and horst faults. These faults could be indicated on the geo-electrical section by a marked difference in the layers` thicknesses. The magnetic data confirmed the locations of the faults delineated by the electrical resistivity profiles. The outlined faults are trending mainly in NE-SW, NW-SE, NWW-SEE, NEE-SWW and E-W directions. Lineament structures delineation and drainage pattern analysis were evaluated and interpreted from the analysis of remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) technique. The SRTM-DEM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission-Digital Elevation Model) was also utilized to automatically identify and extract drainage network. Interpretation and analysis of the inferred lineament structures indicate the presence of a number of main lineament populations that trends: NE-SW, NW-SE, NNW-SSE, NWW-SEE, E-W and N-S. Meanwhile, the interpretation and analysis of drainage pattern network indicate the presence of three main lineament structures that trends: NW-SE, NE-SW and NWW-SEE. Azimuth distribution analysis of both the measured structures and drainage channels shows similar trends, except for very few differences in the prevailing trends. Similarity in orientation of lineament structures, drainage system, and subsurface structural trends were recognized in the area under study. In conclusion, the integration between remote sensing and geophysical data revealed a close matching between the surface structural lineaments and subsurface structural trends could be verified. The preferred conduits of surface run-off and groundwater flow, as well as, the proper locations for groundwater exploitation could be determined.",

    "abstract": "Stress controlled cyclic triaxial tests have been done on coastal sand of Digha, West Bengal, India, at different frequencies, confining pressures, and relative densities and cyclic stress ratios. Number of cycles for initial liquefaction (NL) has been determined for that number of cycle when excess pore pressure ratio has become equal to 1. Significant influences of density of sand, confining pressure and number of cycles for initial liquefaction on coastal Digha sand have been found. The test results have shown that increasing density of sand increases liquefaction potential, whereas cyclic strength of sand decreases with increase of confining pressure. An empirical correlation has been developed on cyclic strength of sand based on these parameters and this correlation fits quite well with the observed experimental results. Bender Element tests have been performed to determine maximum shear modulus (Gmax) of Digha sand at different densities and confining pressures. A high correlation coefficient between cyclic strength and Gmax of Digha sand at any NL has been found. A new pore water pressure generation model has been introduced for this sand along with upper bound and lower bound curves to predict excess pore water pressure build up due to seismic loads.",

    "abstract": "Numerical modelling has been widely used in the underground excavation design, where the in situ stress state plays a crucial role in the stability analysis. However, determination of an exact stress state for a specific geological region remains uncertain due to the complicated tectonic nature and measurement limitations. The stability is thus better analysed by considering the in situ stress as a finite spectrum and pinpointing the possible worst-case scenario. The most probable scenarios of in situ stress states in the Rožná mine area were analysed based on the varying trends in principal stress ratio and mean stress values obtained from four different measurement/analysis campaigns. The influence of different in situ stress judgement on the deformation and failure characteristics of the Bukov Underground Research Facility (URF) (Phase II, Czech) were investigated by the finite volume program FLAC3D. Results show that the increased horizontal stress anisotropy and the mean stress level jointly increase the overall deformation and lower the URF stability. Such influences on the roadway horizontal convergence are more considerable than the vertical ones. A mathematical model considering mean stress and horizontal stress ratio was proposed to quantitatively describe the overall stability, especially useful for excavations possessing complicated configuration.",

    "abstract": "An identification of the responsible faults for the destructive earthquakes of 1894 in the Atalanti region was carried out by employing a novel application of 3D finite-difference wavefield modeling. Several faults proposed in the literature were tested in detailed 3D simulations, by also utilizing a detailed local 3D velocity model, as well as the local topography. The assessment of the most probable sources for these events was based on the correlation of reported damages with the distribution of the simulated peak ground acceleration. Furthermore, the distribution of the spectral amplitudes at higher frequencies that are related to the resonant frequencies of the local buildings on that time period was also used as an indicator. The general effect of the local 3D subsurface structure on the propagation of the wavefield and the spatial distribution of the ground motion was also investigated. The Malessina fault was identified as a probable source for the main event of 20/4/1894 based on the results of the 3D modeling, whereas the 3D effect was found to be a highly contributing factor to the distribution of the simulated ground motion.",

    "abstract": "Field observations in the northwest of Naein (Central Iran zone) indicate various types of alteration products have extended into pyroclastic and volcanic units with Oligo- miocene age. It seems the Zefreh (with NW- SE trend) and Kachumesqal (with E-W trend) faults are effective factors in the formation of Neysian and Barzavand copper deposits respectively. Alteration in Barzavand copper deposit (with stratabound form) includes pyritization, propylitization, zeolitization, saussuritization, uralitization and silicification, while in Neysian (with oval form) include phyllic, advanced argillic, argillic and propylitic. Geochemical studies in Barzavand show the positive correlation between (La/Lu)N, (La/Yb)N and (La/Sm)N and CaO (r= 0.70 to 0.96) related to propylitization of host rock basalt and increase in pH of fluids responsible for mineralization that play important role in differentiation of lanthanides in study area. The Barzavand copper deposit has submarine volcanism, diagenesis, burial metamorphism and weathering stages during its evolution. Remarkable geochemical features in Neysian include high (La/Lu)N, Ba and Sr values than La, Ce and Y. It seems that extensive alteration occurred along with hypogene and supergene processes in Neysian. According to alteration properties, mineralogy and the whole-rock geochemistry, the Barzavand and Neysian copper deposits are most similar to Manto- type and porphyry copper deposits respectively.",

    "abstract": "A historical and instrumental earthquake catalogue is prepared for the Northwest Himalayan Fold and Thrust Belt and Makran Subduction Zone Pakistan from 1960 to 2019 with homogenized moment magnitude. The local and some international published sources were utilized for the preparation of catalogue. This earthquake catalogue contained numbers of duplicate, repeated, dependent and independent events. Declustering process was opted to remove the dependent events such as foreshock and aftershock from catalogue to separate the mainshock only in term of distance and time space window. The declustering found 2714 clusters of earthquakes with total of 19512 (57.19 %) events out of 34112. Only cluster events which contained the mainshock or independent events were drawn on seismicity map with color identification. Maximum likelihood method was used to compute the value of magnitude of completeness i.e., Mc = 3.8 with estimation of a and b-values. Years vise magnitude of completeness was also computed to check the time period variation. The completeness of magnitude for different intervals of time indicates the impartial approximation of previous recorded seismicity. Temporal and spatial maps were also drawn to investigate the slope “b” and rate of productivity “a” in the study region. It is noted that b-values varied from 0.2 to 2.0 due to stress and intensive tectonic setting whereas a value increases due to increase the seismicity rate with respect to region. Seismotectonic map was drawn to delineate the major faults, seismicity pattern and tectonic activities. This work further can be used for single value hazard assessment for any region and their response spectra to update buildings and bridges codes.",

    "abstract": "The character of modern pedogenesis in the territory of the Brdská and Křivoklátská vrchovina Highlands was studied on silicate rocks such as Paleozoic granite and Proterozoic mudstone and greywacke. The parent materials were evaluated on the basis of petrography, X-ray diffractometry of powder samples of rock forming and heavy minerals. The soils were described as for their macromorphological characterics and the results of a variety of analyses of organic and anorganic components. Pedogenesis proceeded in acid conditions. The values of base saturation are mostly below 50 % for the Ah horizons. The intensity of soil development on individual parent material decreases in the order: mudstone (Ah-AhBw-Bw-C)granite (Oi-Oe-Oa-Ah-Bw-C)greywacke 1 (Oi-Oe-Oa-Ah-AhC-C)greywacke 2 (Oi-Oe-Oa-Ah-C). The process of humification was documented at all study sites. Evidence of pedogenetic alteration is present in soils developed on granite and mudstone. High amounts of chlorite and elevated contents of illite are characteristic for Cambic Leptosols (Dystric, Skeletic) on mudstone. Weddellite and whewellite were found in relatively large amounts in O horizons of soils except for the Červený kríž site. The predominant from of calcium oxalate minerals at these sites is whewellite. Weddellite occurs in small amount, which is probably due to its lower stability.",
